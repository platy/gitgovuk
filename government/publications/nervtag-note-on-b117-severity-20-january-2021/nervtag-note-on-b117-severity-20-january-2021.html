<p><strong>Presented to <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> on 21 January 2021</strong></p>

<p><strong>Authors</strong> - Peter Horby, Catherine Huntley, Nick Davies, John Edmunds, Neil Ferguson, Graham Medley, Calum Semple.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>1. The variant of concern (<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>) B.1.1.7 appears to have substantially increased transmissibility compared to other variants and has grown quickly to become the dominant variant in much of the UK.</p>

<p>2. Initial assessment by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> of disease severity through a matched case-control study reported no significant difference in the risk of hospitalisation or death in people infected with confirmed B.1.1.7 infection versus infection with other variants. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>3. Several new analyses are however consistent in reporting increased disease severity in people infected with <abbr title="WHO designated variant Alpha">VOC B.1.1.7</abbr> compared to people infected with non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> virus variants.</p>

<p>4. There have been several independent analyses of <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> and non-<abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases identified through Pillar 2 testing linked to the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> deaths line list.</p>

<p>a. <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>: reported that the relative hazard of death within 28 days of test for <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>-infected individuals compared to non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> was 1.35 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.08 to 1.68). <br>b. Imperial College London: mean ratio of <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> for <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>-infected individuals compared to non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> was 1.36 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.18 to 1.56) by a case-control weighting method, 1.29 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.07 to 1.54) by a standardised <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> method. <br>c. University of Exeter: mortality hazard ratio for <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>-infected individuals compared to non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> was 1.91 (1.35 to 2.71). <br>d. These analyses were all adjusted in various ways for age, location, time and other variables.</p>

<p>5. An updated <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> matched cohort analysis has reported a death risk ratio for <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>- infected individuals compared to non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> of 1.65 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.21 to 2.25).</p>

<p>6. There are several limitations to these datasets including representativeness of death data (less than 10 per cent of all deaths are included in some datasets), power, potential biases in case ascertainment and transmission setting.</p>

<p>7. <strong>Based on these analyses, there is a realistic possibility that infection with <abbr title="WHO designated variant Alpha">VOC B.1.1.7</abbr> is associated with an increased risk of death compared to infection with non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> viruses.</strong></p>

<p>8. It should be noted that the absolute risk of death per infection remains low.</p>

<p>9. An analysis of <abbr title="COVID-19 Clinical Information Network">CO-CIN</abbr> data has not identified an increased risk of death in hospitalised <abbr title="WHO designated variant Alpha">VOC B.1.1.7</abbr> cases. However, increased severity may not necessarily be reflected by increased in-hospital death risk.</p>

<p>10. Since the time lag from infection to hospitalisation and death is relatively long, data will accrue in coming weeks, at which time the analyses will become more definitive.</p>

<h2>Full text</h2>

<p>11. Previously, preliminary results from a matched-cohort study conducted by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> reported no statistically significant increased risk of hospitalisation or death in <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>- infected individuals compared to non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>12. On Friday 15 January <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr> was presented with 2 papers that reported an increased case fatality rate in subjects with s-gene target failure (<abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>, a proxy for variant B.1.1.7).</p>

<p>13. Both papers used the same core dataset of <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases identified through Pillar 2 testing linked to the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> deaths line list: a paper from <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and a paper from Imperial College London <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>14. The <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> paper used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate change in risk of death within 28 days of test for individuals infected with the <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>a. The study was based on 2,583 deaths among 1.2 million tested individuals. 384 deaths were among <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> individuals. <br>b. Results were controlled for age, sex, index of multiple deprivation, and Upper Tier Local Authority (<abbr title="Upper Tier Local Authority">UTLA</abbr>). <br>c. The relative hazard of death within 28 days of test was 1.35 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.08 to 1.68) for <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>-infected individuals, compared to non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>, with adjustment made for misclassification of <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>. <br>d. Focusing only on individuals with <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> after 1 November 2020 (no adjustment for <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> misclassification), the relative hazard of death is 1.28 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.06 to 1.56). <br>e. Relative increases in <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> appeared to be consistent across age groups. <br>f. Sensitivity analyses including further hospital pressure covariates (proportion of beds capable of mechanical ventilation occupied; proportion of beds capable of non-invasive ventilation occupied; number of staff absences per bed among medical staff; and number of staff absences per bed among nursing staff) did not substantially change the measure of effect.</p>

<p>15. The Imperial Paper reported the results of a non-parametric analysis of fatal outcomes associated with B1.1.7 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>a. Two methods were used to evaluate the differences in mortality between <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> and non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> cases: case-control-weighting, and standardised <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr>. In each case, the ratio of s-gene positive to s-gene negative case fatality ratios (<abbr title="case fatality ratios">CFRs</abbr>) is calculated. <br>b. The study considers data from all of England and includes specimen dates in the epidemiological week range 46 to 54 (54 being week 1 of 2021) inclusive. Estimates are adjusted for <abbr title="NHS Scientist Training Programme">NHS STP</abbr> area, epidemiological week, ethnicity code, and age band. <br>c. Across all specimens, the mean ratio of <abbr title="case fatality ratios">CFRs</abbr> is 1.36 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.18 to 1.56) by the case-control weighting method, and 1.29 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.07 to 1.54) by the standardised <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> method. This estimate includes a correction for the probability over time that a specimen with <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> is the <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>. <br>d. Relative increases in <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> appeared to be consistent across age groups. <br>e. Subsequent correction for possible differences in <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> cycle threshold values (<abbr title="cycle threshold values">ct</abbr>) between <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> and non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> cases was included by restricting both groups only to those samples with <abbr title="cycle threshold values">ct</abbr> less than 30. This adjustment made no meaningful difference.</p>

<p>16. A <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> retrospective matched cohort study was also reported <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>a. 23 November 2020 to 4 January 2021 study period (period when more than 90 per cent of sequenced <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> samples confirmed to be <abbr title="VOC B. 1. 1.7, WHO designated variant Alpha">VOC202012/01</abbr>). Matching based on10-year age bands, sex, week of test and lower-tier local authority. <br>b.92,207 <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases and corresponding comparators were included in the matched cohort (n=184,414), although routine hospitalisation data is subject to reporting delays and this should be considered preliminary. <br>c. The odds of <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases being admitted was not significantly different to non-<abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases (<abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr> = 1.07, 95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 0.86 to 1.33). <br>d. Initial analysis identified 152 deaths following a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test, n = 86 (0.09 per cent) <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases and n = 66 (0.07 per cent) comparator cases. It was noted that 0.07 to 0.09 per cent represents a 28 per cent relative increase in the risk of death, which is compatible with the results from <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> and Imperial. <br>e. Initial analysis of 14,939 <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases and 15,555 comparators who had at least 28 days between specimen date and the study period end date. There were 25 deaths (0.17 per cent) in <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases and 26 deaths (0.17 per cent) in comparators (<abbr title="relative risk">RR</abbr> 1.00, 95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 0.58 to 1.73). <br>f. Updated linkage of deaths data to the same matched cohort on 19 January 2021identified there were 65 deaths among non-<abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases (0.1 per cent) and 104 deaths among <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> cases (0.2 per cent), within 28 days of specimen date. With this increased time for follow-up and ascertainment of deaths, the risk ratio increased to 1.65 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.21 to 2.25).</p>

<p>17. There are potential limitations in these datasets.</p>

<p>a. The dataset used in the <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>, Imperial, Exeter and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> analyses is based on a limited subset of the total deaths. This includes approximately 8 per cent of the total deaths occurring during the study period. Of all coronavirus deaths, approximately 26 per cent occur in individuals who have had a Pillar 2 test, and only 30 per cent of these have <abbr title="S-gene encodes the spike protein">S-gene</abbr> data. The results of all studies may therefore not be representative of the total population. <br>b. Restriction of analysis in the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> matched cohort to people with a full 28 days follow up at the first analysis reduced statistical power and removed the excess death signal. However, the <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> analysis show an increasing divergence in <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> between <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> and non-COV with time since diagnosis. A later update of the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> analysis with additional follow-up time identified an increased risk ratio for 28-day case fatality.  <br>c. Some laboratories only report <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> if the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> cycle threshold (<abbr title="cycle threshold values">ct</abbr>) value is less than 30, since target gene failure can occur with low viral loads. For the <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> paper, no such <abbr title="cycle threshold values">ct</abbr> threshold was applied to non-<abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> positive samples.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A sensitivity analysis of the Imperial study produced a <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> ratio estimate where the cycle threshold was limited to less than 30 for both <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> and non-<abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr> samples. The estimate was 1.37 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.19 to 1.56) by the case-control weighting method, and 1.30 (95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.08 to 1.57) by the standardised <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> method. These results were similar to those obtained without this restriction.</li>
</ul>

<p>d. The increased transmissibility of <abbr title="WHO designated variant Alpha">VOC B.1.1.7</abbr> compared to non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> variants might lead to differences in the context in which cases are occurring. For example, if institutional outbreaks are more likely with B1.1.7 compared to non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>, then an age matched analysis might be comparing frail elderly people in nursing home outbreaks of B.1.1.7 with healthier elderly people infected with the non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> virus in the community. However, both the Imperial and the <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> analyses showed increased <abbr title="case fatality ratios">CFRs</abbr> across all age groups. This potential bias could therefore not explain the increased <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> in younger age groups. <br>e. If there is an increase in the severity of infection with <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> B1.1.7, we would also expect to see an increase in the risk of hospitalisation. Currently, we do not have evidence of an increased risk of hospitalisation in individuals with <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> B1.1.7 but data are limited due to lags in the availability of hospitalisation data.</p>

<p>18. A rapid analysis of <abbr title="COVID-19 Clinical Information Network">CO-CIN</abbr> data during the period in which <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> B1.1.7 emerged was reported <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>:</p>

<p>a. Across the whole <abbr title="COVID-19 Clinical Information Network">CO-CIN</abbr> cohort, there is no observed increase in hospital case fatality in the period during which <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> emerged in England, after adjusting for period of admission, age, sex, deprivation, and ethnicity. <br>b. Compared to March 2020, hospital <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> continues to be lower and has been stable in September through December. <br>c. Data return from <abbr title="COVID-19 Clinical Information Network">CO-CIN</abbr> is currently reduced and unevenly distributed, which will impact on the representativeness of findings. Importantly there are a substantial number of outcomes missing from cases admitted in late December, when the impact of <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> emergence would start to be apparent in hospital data. <br>d. A sub-analysis included linked data from 21,882 cases (21,596 non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> and 286 <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>) from across the whole <abbr title="COVID-19 Clinical Information Network">CO-CIN</abbr> cohort. <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> in this sub-study was robustly determined by COG sequence lineage, rather than assumed by <abbr title="s-gene target failure">SGTF</abbr>. Outcome data was available for only 143 <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> cases. However; 32 <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> cases were identified at one trust with good data quality returns throughout the period of study. <br>e. Restricting the analysis to a trust with high proportion of proven <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> which has maintained good quality data returns, and after adjusting for age and sex, found no statistically significant change in hospital <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> comparing proven <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> (n=32) with non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> (n=184) (<abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr> 0.63, 95 per cent <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 0.20 to 1.69). <br>f. An increase in case fatality rates would not necessarily manifest as an increase in case fatality rates amongst those hospitalised. Rather, it may increase the proportion of cases who are ill enough to meet the severity threshold for hospitalisation, but not affect the likelihood of death amongst those who are sick enough to be admitted.</p>

<p>19. A subsequent independent case control analysis of Pillar 2 data linked to the death line list by Exeter University, matched on age, specimen time, location, ethnicity, gender and index of multiple deprivation, reported a mortality hazard ratio for <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr>- infected individuals compared to non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> was 1.91 (1.35 to 2.71).</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>20. There is evidence from analysis of Pillar 2 testing data linked to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> deaths that infection with <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> B1.1.7 is associated with an increased case fatality rate compared to infection with non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> viruses. The relative increase in <abbr title="case fatality ratio">CFR</abbr> appears to be apparent across age groups.</p>

<p>21. An initial retrospective matched cohort study from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> (also based on linked testing and mortality data) found no evidence of a significant difference in risk of hospitalisation or death between individuals with <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> and individuals with non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> when analysis was restricted to those with completed 28 days follow up, but had insufficient statistical power to assess this accurately. A later update of the analysis with additional follow-up time, has now also identified an increased risk ratio for 28-day case fatality.</p>

<p>22. <abbr title="COVID-19 Clinical Information Network">CO-CIN</abbr> has not found evidence of an increase in hospital case fatality rate associated with <abbr title="WHO designated variant Alpha">VOC B.1.1.7</abbr>, both across the whole cohort and in a single trust with a high rate of good quality data using sequence determined lineage. However, increased severity may not necessarily be reflected by increased in-hospital death risk.</p>

<p>23. There are limitations in all datasets that it may not be possible to resolve but as more data accrue the analyses will become more definitive.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>24. <strong>There is a realistic possibility that <abbr title="WHO designated variant Alpha">VOC B.1.1.7</abbr> is associated with an increased risk of death compared to non-<abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> viruses.</strong></p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>25. <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> to review if cases associated with care homes can be flagged in Pillar 2 data for an analysis adjusted for care home status.</p>

<p>26. <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> should assess if it is possible to link <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> survey participants to <abbr title="Secondary Uses Service">SUS</abbr> data on hospitalisations and to deaths. This dataset would suffer from less ascertainment bias since participants are a random selection and ascertainment of cases is not dependent on symptoms of on seeking a test from the Test and Trace. This analysis will be limited in power, so analyses comparing <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> estimates of the proportion of the population infected over time, with the number of hospitalisations and deaths over time, stratified by age and region, could also provide insight as to whether case fatality rates have changed during the period of emergence of the virus.</p>

<p>27. <abbr title="COVID-19 Clinical Information Network">CO-CIN</abbr> to stratify analyses by region to assess whether in hospital mortality time trends differ in those regions affected by the <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> earliest.</p>

<p>28. <abbr title="Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium">ISARIC</abbr> <abbr title="Clinical Characterisation Protocol">CCP</abbr>-UK, <abbr title="COVID-19 Clinical Information Network">CO-CIN</abbr> to be re-prioritised as Tier 1 <abbr title="Urgent Public Health">UPH</abbr> study.</p>
