  <li>The Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010</li>
  <li>Anglian Water Authority Act 1977 (S17)</li>
  <li>The Environment Act 1995 (S43)</li>
  <li>Recreational Waterways (General) Byelaws 1980 (amended)</li>
</ul>

<p>This charging scheme sets out the registration charges for all boats, kept, used or let for hire on the Anglian Waterways from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 and is made under the powers of the Environment Agency to fix charges in section 17 Anglian Water Authority Act 1977 and section 43 Environment Act 1995.</p>

<p>All vessels kept, used or let for hire on Anglian Waterways must be registered with the Environment Agency in accordance with The Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010, including vessels in marinas and on privately owned moorings.</p>

<p>Anglian Waterways include the Ancholme, Black Sluice, Glen, Welland, Nene, Great Ouse System and Stour.</p>

<p>The full registration charge is payable for a vessel kept, used or let for hire on our Anglian Waterways at any time during the registration year (1 April to 31 March) unless it qualifies for an ‘end of season’ discount. When registering the vessel, you are responsible to pay the full registration charge.</p>

<p>All annual registrations expire on 31 March regardless of when they start. There are no pro-rata annual registration charges.</p>

<p>A minimum registration charge of £10.50 applies to all registrations, to cover our administration costs.</p>

<p>Registration charges for Anglian Waterways are set annually and all the income contributes to the services, facilities and structures we maintain to make boating possible on our waterways. This includes maintenance of our locks and other navigation structures which retain water levels, as well as activities such as lock keeping, compliance and the provision of safety advice.</p>

<h2>Private vessels</h2>
<p>Vessels used for private use only.</p>

<p>Unpowered means any vessel which is not mechanically propelled (for example, canoes, kayaks and rowing boats), and not covered by our houseboat definition as shown on page 4.</p>

<p>If your vessel has an auxiliary engine then your vessel needs to be registered under the appropriate powered vessel registration charge.</p>

<p>If you are a member of British Canoeing/Canoe Wales or British Rowing you should register with your member organisation.</p>

<p>Unpowered vessel registrations are valid for use on all Environment Agency waterways.</p>

<h3>Private - powered vessels</h3>
<p>Powered vessels include any mechanically propelled vessel; for example narrowboats, cruisers and barges.</p>

<h3>Electric engine discount</h3>

<p>Vessels with an electric engine receive a 25% discount on the appropriate registration charge, provided the sole method of propulsion is an electric engine/s and no other propulsion or charging engine is carried.</p>

<h3>Tenders</h3>
<p>A 50% discount is available for a tender, when registered at the same time as the ‘parent’ vessel. We define a tender as a small powered boat or dinghy, towed or carried by another vessel.</p>

<p>Tenders are subject to the appropriate registration charge, but the registration number issued will be the same as the ‘parent’ vessel.</p>

<h3>End of season discount</h3>
<p>A 50% discount on the appropriate registration charge is available from 1 September. This applies to a vessel that has not been kept, used or let for hire on one of our Anglian Waterways before 1 September in the registration year (1 April to 31 March). It also applies if the applicant is the new owner of the vessel.</p>

<h3>Applying discounts</h3>
<p>If more than one discount applies, the value of each one is calculated on the declining net balance.</p>

<p>For example, if the full charge is £100 and the vessel is eligible for the electric and end of season discount, the net payable would be £100 - 25% = £75 - 50% = £37.50.</p>

<h2>Other registration options</h2>

<h3>British Canoeing</h3>
<p>Members of British Canoeing or Canoe Wales can use our waterways as part of their yearly membership fee. They are required to carry their membership card with them as it acts as a registration too. Affiliated clubs through British Canoeing and Canoe Wales may purchase registrations for club owned boats through British Canoeing and Canoe Wales or can purchase registrations directly from us. Members of the Scottish Canoe Association and the Canoe Association of Northern Ireland must apply for registration through us.</p>

<h3>British Rowing</h3>
<p>Members of a British Rowing affiliated club should register their boats with British Rowing at a reduced rate. This should be done through their club.</p>

<h3>Gold Licence</h3>
<p>You can buy a Gold Licence which lets you use all Environment Agency and Canal &amp; River Trust waterways. Gold LIcences are only available to buy through the Canal &amp; River Trust.</p>

<h2>Other Charges</h2>

<h3>Anglian Pass</h3>
<p>The Anglian Pass is a joint arrangement between the Environment Agency, the Conservators of the River Cam and the Middle Level Commissioners to allow powered boaters, annual unrestricted access across the three authorities navigations. The Pass replaces the previous arrangement to visit Cam Conservancy waters.</p>

<p>You will require a valid annual vessel registration when applying for the Pass. (For the Environment Agency, you will require an annual powered vessel registration that covers the Great Ouse system and River Nene).</p>

<p>The Pass is a fixed price, based on vessel length, for the year starting 1 April and ending the following 31 March. The Pass can be purchased at any point during the year, but there are no reductions in the cost if obtained part way through the year. However, boaters still have the option of purchasing short-term/visitor registrations/licences, from the respective navigation authorities, if they so choose.</p>

<p>Up to 5m inclusive = £25</p>

<p>Over 5m to 10m inclusive = £50</p>

<p>Over 10m to 15m inclusive = £75</p>

<p>Over £15m = £100</p>

<h3>Pump-out token charges</h3>
<p>A token will also be required to use our pump-outs on the River Nene at Northampton Marina and Wellingborough Embankment and on the Black Sluice navigation at Hubbert’s Bridge. Certain pump-outs at other locations, such as on the Great Ouse, may also see a charge introduced in the future. The charge for these is £10.</p>

<h3>Navigation key</h3>
<p>Vessels navigating on our waterways will require a navigation key to use our locks and other facilities, such as slipways. These can be purchased with your registration or from various agents along our waterways.</p>

<p>If you have or are applying for an annual registration navigation keys will be charged at £15 each.</p>

<p>If you have or are applying for a short-term/visitor registration then a fully refundable deposit, on return of the key, of £25 will be required for each key.</p>

<h3>Trade plates</h3>
<p>Annual charge - £62.11.</p>

<h3>Refunds</h3>
<p>Refunds are only made in certain limited cases – see <a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/register-a-boat">Register a boat</a> or call for our refund and transfer guidance.</p>

<h3>Anglian Waterways Vessel registration charges</h3>
<p>The Environment Agency hereby fixes the charges for the year commencing 1 April 2021, payable under Section 43 Environment Act 1995, as applied by Section 17 Anglian Water Authority Act 1977 (the Act), in respect of the services provided for and the facilities made available to vessels using the recreational waterways as defined by the Act; such charges to be paid on demand or as may be otherwise required.</p>

<p>The charges have been fixed on the principle that the cost of maintaining the navigable channels and navigation works under Section 8 and 12 of the Act and generally discharging the functions under the Act in relation to the use by vessels of recreational waterways shall be met by those who own or use the vessels, having regard to the changes currently made by other water and navigation authorities providing a similar service and similar facilities, taking into account the kind and length of vessel, and the Environment Agency’s power to raise revenue for navigation.</p>

<p>The charge shall be payable in respect of any vessel on a recreational waterway at any time in the year, and shall be paid by the person in whose name the vessel is registered under the Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010 (the Order). If a vessel is not so registered then the charge shall be paid by the owner of the vessel or by any person who uses the same at any time in the year.</p>

<p>Only one charge shall be made in respect of any one vessel in the year, except that, if a vessel subsequently uses a recreational waterway or waterways in respect of which a higher charge is payable, an additional amount equal to the difference between the charge paid and the higher charge shall then become payable.</p>

<p>The charge for a vessel shall be as prescribed as above, according to the recreational waterways or waterways named, which the vessel is using or is to use; subject to any other charge or discount listed.</p>

<p>Words or expressions used herein shall have the same meaning as defined in the Act and the Order.</p>
