<p>The Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010</p>

<p>Anglian Water Authority Act 1977 (Section 17)</p>

<p>The National navigation boat charging scheme 2022 to 2023 sets out the charges for all boats, kept, used or let for hire on the Anglian Waterways from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, It is made under the powers of the Environment Agency to fix charges in section 17 of the Anglian Water Authority Act 1977, under Article 23 of The Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010.</p>

<p>The scheme will increase charges by 4% in 2023 to 2024 and a further 2% in 2024 to 2025. Charges will then continue at the 2024 to 2025 values each year until the scheme is amended.</p>

<p>This requirement extends to Anglian Waterways including the Ancholme, Black Sluice, Glen, Welland, Nene, Great Ouse System and Stour, including backwaters, marinas and private moorings. Registration charges income contributes to the services, facilities and structures we maintain to make boating possible on our waterways. This includes maintenance of our locks and other navigation structures, which retain water levels, as well as activities such as lock keeping, compliance and the provision of safety advice.</p>

<p>All boats have to register and pay the appropriate charge unless they are exempt from charge (go to
section 11).</p>

<p>If a powered or unpowered enclosed boat is registered for the first time part way through a registration year, then a pro rata (reduced) charge may apply in certain circumstances (go to section 15).</p>

<p>Visitor charges (monthly, weekly and daily) are due when coming onto the waterway and they expire after the defined period of the registration.  They are valid from the date and time set when registering for the period. Boats kept on Environment Agency waterways are not eligible for visitor registrations.</p>

<p>Monthly visitor charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for consecutive 31 days.</p>

<p>Weekly visitor charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for 7 consecutive days.</p>

<p>Daily visitor charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for 24 hours. They are valid for 24 hours from the time of issue, or where issued in advance, valid for 24 hours from the date and time requested at application.  Where tidal conditions prevent moving off the waterway within the valid time, the valid time shall be extended by 12 hours to allow passage on the next tide. Any extension will be managed by staff at our tidal locks.</p>

<p>Explorer charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for up to 15 non consecutive days in the annual registration period.  The ‘explorer’ option is only available for privately owned unpowered open boats.</p>

<p>When registering a boat, the registered owner is responsible to pay the full charge.</p>

<p>Charges for powered boats and unpowered enclosed boats are subject to a minimum charge of £10.80.</p>

<p>Words or expressions used herein shall have the same meaning as defined in the Acts and the Order and the National navigation boat charging schemes from 2022.</p>

<h3>Annual charges for electrically powered boats</h3>

<p>“Electrically powered” means the power to propel the boat is solely from an electric motor.</p>

<p>Electrically powered boats shall pay 75% of the appropriate annual powered boat charge set out in tables 1A to 1C, 2A  to 2C and 3A to 3C.</p>

<h4>How to calculate the charge for electric powered boats:</h4>

<p>Step 1: find the appropriate annual powered charge from tables 1A to 1C, 2A to 2C or 3A to 3C.</p>

<p>Step 2: multiply the result by 0.75.</p>

<p>If a powered boat is registered for the first time part way through a registration year, then a pro rata (reduced) charge may apply in certain circumstances. Go to section 15 for more details.</p>

<h3>Visitor charges</h3>

<p>A registration for the ‘Ouse waterways and River Nene’ also covers use of the ‘Lincolnshire Waterways’ and ‘River Stour’.</p>

<h4>Navigation keys</h4>

<p>If you have, or are applying for an annual registration navigation keys will be charged at £15 each.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span> Footnotes applying to all Waterways</h2>

<h4>Footnote 1: Applying multiple reductions</h4>

<p>If more than one reduction applies, the value of each one is calculated on the declining net balance.</p>

<p>For example, if the full charge is £100 and the boat is eligible for the electric and not-for-profit or charity reductions, the net payable would be £100 – 25% = £75 – 75% = £18.75. Subject to the minimum charge for powered boats and unpowered enclosed boats.</p>

<h4>Footnote 2: Applying the increase</h4>

<p>Percentages have been applied and the charges rounded down to the nearest 1p, apart from charges for registrations sold at locks which have been rounded down to the nearest 10p for operations reasons.</p>
