<p>These tables incorporate thresholds for Student Loan Plan 1, Student Loan Plan 2 and Postgraduate Loan so manual calculations can be based on any of these loan types.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>When to use these tables</h2>

<p>These tables should only be used to manually calculate Student or Postgraduate Loan deductions when you cannot or do not use either of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commercial payroll software</li>
  <li>HMRC Basic PAYE tools</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/basic-paye-tools">download HMRC Basic PAYE tools</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re doing a manual calculation use the weekly or monthly tables below for existing employees for whom you’ve received either form SL1 ‘Student Loan Start Notice’ or form PGL1 ‘Postgraduate Loan Start Notice’ and for new employees who have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>told you they are repaying an Income Contingent student loan and either the relevant plan or loan type, or both</li>
  <li>given you a form P45 with a ‘Y’ entry in box 5 ‘Student Loan deductions to continue’</li>
  <li>completed a starter declaration and ticked the student loan box indicating either the relevant plan or loan type, or both</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you can use these tables, you must work out the correct figure of employee earnings on which Student or Postgraduate Loan deductions are due. The figure to use is the same gross pay amount that you would use to calculate your employer’s secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How to use these tables</h2>

<p>Go to the table which corresponds to your employee’s loan or plan type. Look up the amount of weekly or monthly earnings in the left hand column to find the corresponding deduction in the right hand column. If the exact amount of earnings is not shown, look for the nearest figure below and use the amount of deduction shown for that range of earnings.</p>

<p>If you need help using these tables phone the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/employer-enquiries">Employer Helpline</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Earnings for week or month exceed highest amount of earnings shown in the tables</h2>

<p>For borrowers repaying on Student Loan Plan 1 — if earnings in the week or month exceed the highest amount of earnings shown in the tables you’ll need to deduct the ‘pay period threshold’ from total earnings in the week or month. Do this by deducting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£388.36 from weekly earnings for weekly paid employees</li>
  <li>£1,682.91 from monthly earnings for monthly paid employees</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiply the result (the excess) by 9% (0.09), round down this figure to the nearest whole pound.</p>

<p>For borrowers repaying on Student Loan Plan 2 — if earnings in the week or month exceed the highest amount of earnings shown in the tables, you’ll need to deduct the ‘pay period threshold’ from total earnings in the week or month. Do this by deducting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£524.90 from weekly earnings for weekly paid employees</li>
  <li>£2,274.58 from monthly earnings for monthly paid employees</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiply the result (the excess) by 9% (0.09), round down this figure to the nearest whole pound.</p>

<p>For Scottish borrowers repaying on Student Loan Plan 4 — if earnings in the week or month exceed the highest amount of earnings shown in the tables, you’ll need to deduct the ‘pay period threshold’ from the total earnings in the week or month. Do this by deducting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£487.98 from weekly earnings for weekly paid employees</li>
  <li>£2,114.58 from monthly earnings for monthly paid employees</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiply the result (the excess) by 9% (0.09), round down this figure to the nearest whole pound.</p>

<p>For borrowers repaying a Postgraduate Loan — if earnings in the week or month exceed the highest amount of earnings shown in the tables you’ll need to deduct the ‘pay period threshold’ from total earnings in the week or month. Do this by deducting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£403.84 from weekly earnings for weekly paid employees</li>
  <li>£1,750.00 from monthly earnings for monthly paid employees</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiply the result (the excess) by 6% (0.06), round down this figure to the nearest whole pound.</p>

<p>Record the amount of Student or Postgraduate Loan deduction on the employee’s payroll record. Only employers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-which-employers-are-exempt-from-online-payroll-reporting">exempt from filing payroll information online</a> will not have to use payroll software to do this.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Pay periods other than weekly or monthly</h2>

<p>The pay period for Student and Postgraduate Loan deductions is always exactly the same as the earnings period for National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>For earnings periods of less than 7 days use a pay period of 1 week.</p>

<p>If the pay period is a multiple of a week or a month:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Divide the earnings into equal weekly or monthly amounts to get an average weekly or monthly amount.</li>
  <li>Find the amount of Student or Postgraduate Loan deduction due for the average weekly or monthly amount.</li>
  <li>Multiply the amount of Student or Postgraduate Loan deduction by the number of weeks or months in the pay period.</li>
  <li>Record the result of step 3 on the employee’s payroll records at the appropriate week or month.</li>
</ol>

<p>If, exceptionally, the earnings period for National Insurance contributions is longer than a week, but not a multiple of a week or month:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Work out the number of days in the pay period.</li>
  <li>Multiply the number of days by £20,195 for Student Loan Plan 1 or £27,295 for Student Loan Plan 2 or £25,375 for Student Loan Plan 4, or £21,000 for Postgraduate Loans and then divide the result by the number of days in the year to give you the pay period threshold. Round down the resulting figure to the nearest penny.</li>
  <li>Deduct the ‘pay period threshold’ from the total earnings in the pay period.</li>
  <li>Multiply the result of step 3 (the excess) by 9% (0.09) for Student Loan Plans 1, 2 and 4 or by 6% (0.06) for Postgraduate Loans.</li>
  <li>Round down the resulting figure to the nearest whole pound.</li>
  <li>Record the amount of Student or Postgraduate Loan deduction on the employee’s payroll records at the appropriate week or month.</li>
