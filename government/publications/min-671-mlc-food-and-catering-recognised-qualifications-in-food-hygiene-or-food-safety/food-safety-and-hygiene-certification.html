<p>Part 8 of the merchant shipping (maritime labour convention) (minimum requirements for seafarers etc.) regulations 2014 (the “minimum requirements regulations”) introduce a requirement for all ship’s cooks, catering staff and other persons processing food in the galley to be suitably qualified in food hygiene or food safety in catering.</p>

<p>The MCA does not approve food hygiene or food safety in catering courses but accepts those accredited by the relevant awarding bodies. The qualifications and awarding bodies which are listed in this notice are those that fulfil the learning outcomes and assessment criteria set out in Annex 1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1846-m-maritime-labour-convention-2006-food-and-catering-ships-cooks-and-catering-staff">MSN 1846 (M)</a>. Level 2 is the minimum acceptable level for ship’s cooks, catering staff and other persons processing food in the galley.</p>

<p>The courses which the MCA accepts for pre-qualification for issue of a ship’s cook certificate of competency are listed on the websites of the awarding bodies – see section 4 and tables 1, 2 &amp; 3.</p>

<p>Tables 1,2 &amp; 3 lists the current accepted Ofqual courses only (provided for ease of reference at the date of publication of this notice) and table 4 lists the discontinued courses but MCA will still accepted these food safety and food hygiene certificates within the certificates expiry date. For CIEH and REHIS, please visit the websites of the awarding bodies for the latest information.</p>

<p>The same learning outcomes (Annex 1 of MSN 1846(M)) apply for stewards, temporary support staff or other persons processing food in the galley, but these personnel are not required to hold the qualifications referred to, as it is expected that they would be working under qualified supervision.</p>

<p>Amendment 1 reflects updated guidance for section 3 concerning online delivery of courses.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the Minimum Requirements Regulations all ship’s cooks are to be suitably qualified in food hygiene or food safety in catering. All catering staff and other persons processing food in the galley must be properly trained or instructed in food hygiene or food safety.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Training requirements for catering staff and other persons processing food in the galley (Regulation 40)</h2>

<p>The shipowner must ensure that the ship’s cook and any other person who processes food in the galley of a sea-going United Kingdom vessel is properly trained or instructed in food and personal hygiene, as well as safe handling and storage of food onboard ship, in accordance with the learning outcomes and assessment criteria set out in Annex 1 of  MSN 1846 (M). A ship’s cook must hold a qualification attesting these learning outcomes and must also complete the additional learning outcomes and assessment criteria set out in Annex 2 and the standards of training certification and watchkeeping safety courses listed in section 3 of  MSN 1846 (M).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Online delivery of courses</h2>

<p>As national COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, the MCA continues to only accept certificates from courses which are listed in MIN 671.</p>

<p>Where, due to remaining restrictions to training because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the awarding body is temporarily continuing to provide an MIN 671 listed training course via an online classroom methodology, these course certificates will also be accepted.</p>

<p>These courses are required to be held with suitable control measures, to ensure that they remain an accepted qualification. The MCA will only accept these online courses for use on UK registered ships and towards the issue of a ship’s cook certificate of competency for this reason. Please note that the MCA will not accept course certificates which are not listed in MIN 671.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the student/applicant, to contact the accredited course provider for a course listed in MIN 671, and to establish how the course is to be delivered. If, due to any continued COVID-19 considerations, the course is to be delivered via an online methodology, only courses delivered via a “virtual” classroom” with interaction between the lecturer and students, and appropriate oversight of examinations, will be accepted. The MCA does not accept courses which have been delivered solely by computer based training (CBT).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Accepted food hygiene and food safety qualifications</h2>

<p>The qualifications and awarding bodies which the MCA accepts as meeting the learning outcomes and assessment criteria as set out in Annex 1 of Merchant Shipping Notice MSN 1846 (M) are listed on the following awarding body websites, with the Ofqual courses provided in tables 1 – 3 to this notice. Level 2 is the minimum acceptable level for ship’s cooks, catering staff and other persons processing food in the galley.</p>
