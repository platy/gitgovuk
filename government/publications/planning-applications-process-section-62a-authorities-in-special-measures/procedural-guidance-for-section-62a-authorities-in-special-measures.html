<h2><span class="number">1.Introduction </span></h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Background to Section 62A Applications</h3>

<p>1.1.1. From 1 October 2013 the Growth and Infrastructure Act inserted two new provisions into the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) (‘the Act’). In particular, Section 62A allowed major applications for planning permission, consents and orders to be made directly to the Planning Inspectorate (acting on behalf of the Secretary of State) where a local planning authority has been designated for this purpose. Subsequently amendments were made by the Housing and Planning Act 2016 to expand the type of application beyond major development.</p>

<p>1.1.2. The Secretary of State can designate a Local Planning Authority (LPA) where they consider it is not adequately performing its function in determining applications.</p>

<p>1.1.3. Where an LPA has been designated, an applicant may choose to submit an application to either the LPA or the Planning Inspectorate. Only applications for development which falls within the category(s) to which the designation relates can be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate. Certain types of applications, including householder applications, are excluded and cannot be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate (see Appendix 2).</p>

<p>1.1.4. The purpose of this Procedural Guide is to provide additional information to applicants, designated authorities, local communities and other stakeholders involved in this. This guide does not have statutory status.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Pre-application process</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Introduction</h3>

<p>2.1.1. Applicants can apply directly to the Planning Inspectorate for advice and assistance at the preplanning application stage. Pre-application advice is given without prejudice and it does not necessarily follow that the outcome of any formal application will be the same.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> What will it cost?</h3>

<p>2.2.1. Where the Planning Inspectorate gives advice about applying for planning permission, under Section 62A a fee will be payable. This will be calculated on an hourly rate. The hourly rate fees are set by the Secretary of State and can be provided. Where a site visit is carried out the cost of this, including traveling time, will form part of the hourly rate charged. All expenses incurred will also be added to the charge.</p>

<p>2.2.2. Prior to the start of the pre-application process a charging strategy will be agreed between the applicant and the Planning Inspectorate. Only once a charging schedule is in place will the pre-application process commence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> What is the role of the Planning Inspectorate?</h3>

<p>2.3.1. It is not the role of the Planning Inspectorate to remove a designated LPA’s ability to provide good quality and timely advice to applicants. Applicants can choose whether to seek pre-application advice from the relevant LPA and/or the Planning Inspectorate.</p>

<p>2.3.2. A Case Officer will be appointed; they will act as the main point of contact.</p>

<p>2.3.3. The Case Officer will share written advice to applicants on development proposals. The applicant should also engage with key stakeholders, such as statutory consultees, and provide copies of any responses to the Planning Inspectorate. It may still be necessary to liaise with the LPA in respect of certain matters, such as the content and structure of any section 106 agreements where applicable.</p>

<p>2.3.4. Further detailed information might be requested before an application is ready to be submitted. There is no minimum or maximum timescale for the pre-application process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> What is the role of the planning authority?</h3>

<p>2.4.1. An LPA that has been designated will still play an important role in the pre-application process.</p>

<p>2.4.2. A designated LPA will be expected to provide the following information to an applicant and the Planning Inspectorate as part of the initial pre-application process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>copies of relevant local land and policy designations or land allocations</li>
  <li>copies of relevant development plan policies, strategies, supplementary planning documents, guidance, and development briefs etc</li>
  <li>information relating to approaches to Community Infrastructure Levy rates and planning obligations</li>
  <li>full details of the planning history of the proposed development site</li>
  <li>a list of relevant local community groups, including Parish Councils and other organisations and stakeholders; and</li>
  <li>details of other development proposals that are likely to affect a particular scheme (eg on an adjacent site)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> What is the role of the applicant?</h3>

<p>2.5.1. It is not the purpose of this guidance to set out excessively prescriptive requirements for applicants seeking pre-application advice. The Planning Inspectorate, however, will expect applicants to provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a completed pre-application form (Please refer to Appendix 1 for a copy of the pre-application form)</li>
  <li>relevant plans drawn to scale showing the location of the site, and confirmation of the relevant LPA</li>
  <li>relevant plans or information</li>
  <li>a supporting statement identifying what the main issues are considered to be, what consultation has been carried out to date and a summary of stakeholder comments, and how it is intended that the pre-application process will shape the development of the proposal</li>
</ul>

<p>2.5.2. Consultation must take place early in the process so that stakeholders may positively influence proposals before submission.</p>

<p>2.5.3. For <strong>large scale proposals</strong>, applicants are strongly encouraged to carry out community consultation separately, alongside discussions with the Planning Inspectorate and the LPA.</p>

<p>2.5.4. Meaningful consultation should also take place with statutory consultees. For example, if the application site is known to be in an area identified to be at risk from flooding then it is strongly advised that initial investigations are prepared and pre-application consultation is undertaken with the Environment Agency and any other relevant consultees. Any advice provided by a consultee should be included in the pre-application documents submitted to the Planning Inspectorate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2.6. </span> How should the request for pre-application advice be submitted?</h2>

<p>2.6.1. Prior to submitting a request for pre-application advice it would be helpful if you notify the Planning Inspectorate (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:section62a@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">section62a@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a>) of your intention at least 10 working days prior to making your request.  Please include the following details:  type of application, applicant name, site address and description of the proposed development, the likely issues, and the likely date you will make your request.</p>

<p>2.6.2. When submitting a request for pre-application advice please complete <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-applications-process-section-62a-authorities-in-special-measures">Appendix 1 – Pre-Application Advice Form</a> and email it to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:section62a@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">section62a@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>2.6.3. If you are not able to submit electronically please telephone 0303 444 5000.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Submission of Applications</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> What can be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate?</h3>

<p>3.1.1. The Planning Inspectorate can only accept applications within the boundaries of a designated LPA. Designations are made separately for major and non-major development. There are some types of applications that have been excluded and cannot be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate. Definitions of major and non-major development and the excluded development types are provided in Appendix 2.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Pre-submission checklist</h3>

<p>3.2.1. Before submitting an application for a development proposal directly to the Planning Inspectorate under Section 62A, applicants are strongly encouraged to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify what the main issues are likely to be with reference to the development plan, the National Planning Policy Framework,, supplementary guidance documents and issues raised by pre-application community consultation or advice</li>
  <li>ensure that all the issues identified are adequately and appropriately addressed in the application submission. This should be included within a Planning Statement or in an accompanying letter submitted with the application</li>
  <li>carryout pre-application discussions with any key stakeholders including statutory consultees; and where appropriate, prepare a draft planning obligation or unilateral undertaking to address issues which will be raised by the development proposal</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Validation requirements</h3>

<p>3.3.1. A valid application is one that complies with the national validation requirements and meets the relevant requirements of the designated LPA’s published local list.</p>

<p>3.3.2. Most designated LPAs will have their own local list of validation requirements, which may add to or expand the national criteria. Applicants will be expected to meet the requirements of the Local List.</p>

<p>3.3.3. Where pre-application discussions have been carried out with the Planning Inspectorate, the necessary validation requirements can be discussed prior to submission.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> How should the application be submitted?</h3>

<p>3.4.1. Where possible all applications should be submitted electronically by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:section62a@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">section62a@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a>. For applications received in this way, all communications from the Planning Inspectorate will also be carried out electronically. It is therefore important to ensure that email filters do not prevent communications from the Planning Inspectorate.</p>

<p>3.4.2. Prior to submitting an application, it would be helpful if you notify the Planning Inspectorate (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:section62a@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">section62a@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a>) of your intention at least 10 working days in advance of submission.  Please include the following details: type of application, applicant name, site address and description of the proposed development, the likely issues, and the likely date of submission.</p>

<p>3.4.3. If you are not able to submit your application electronically please telephone 0303 444 5000.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Determination of applications</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> The role of the Planning Inspectorate</h3>

<p>4.1.1. Each application is managed by a Case Officer, who is responsible for ensuring that all the necessary processes are followed and the correct information is received.</p>

<p>4.1.2. The Case Officer will work with the LPA and liaise with the applicant and any relevant third parties. A copy of the application documents will be made available on GOV.UK. Responses will be published on GOV.UK after the close of the representation period. The application documents will also be provided to the LPA.</p>

<p>4.1.3. The Planning Inspectorate will appoint an Inspector to determine the application. The Inspector will be provided with the application documents, representations and any other relevant documents including the development plan policies. Consultation with statutory consultees and the designated LPA will be carried out by the Planning Inspectorate. Where required, the Planning Inspectorate will also publish a notice advertising the application in a local newspaper.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> The role of the designated Local Planning Authority</h3>

<p>4.2.1. The designated LPA has a statutory duty to complete a questionnaire and provide information about the site, planning policy, and constraints in the area. Where the LPA has provided pre-application advice to the applicant, this can also be submitted; however if it is submitted the LPA must be content that it is published on GOV.UK. The LPA also must carry out its normal notification duties, which may include erecting a site notice and/or writing to the owners/occupiers of adjoining land. The LPA is expected to undertake non-statutory consultation where necessary.</p>

<p>4.2.2. The LPA is also a statutory consultee and must provide a substantive response to the consultation within 21 days. This should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the policies and any guidance, that are considered relevant</li>
  <li>responses from any internal and non-statutory consultees</li>
  <li>set out any amendments to the scheme, or additional information the LPA, considers to be necessary</li>
  <li>a recommendation, with reasons, for whether planning permission should be granted or refused</li>
  <li>provide detailed comments on any submitted planning obligations, or set out any matters that the LPA considers should be secured through an obligation; and</li>
  <li>a list of conditions in the event that planning permission is granted</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Consultations and representations</h3>

<p>4.3.1. Statutory consultees are required to provide a substantive response within 21 days.</p>

<p>4.3.2. Where interested parties wish to make representations about a proposal, these should be submitted electronically via email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:section62a@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">section62a@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a> quoting the relevant reference number.</p>

<p>4.3.3. Consultation responses and representations must be <strong>received by the deadline given</strong> (usually 21 days from the start of consultation). Any representations submitted after this date may not be taken into account.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Extension of time agreements</h3>

<p>4.4.1. In exceptional circumstances there may be occasions where the complexity of the issues raised by a development proposal are such that it will be necessary to agree an extension of time for the determination of the application.</p>

<p>4.4.2. Where an agreement for an extension of time is necessary the Case Officer will set out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the reasons for the extension of time</li>
  <li>any additional information considered necessary</li>
  <li>the date required for the submission of any additional material; and</li>
  <li>the revised determination date for the application</li>
</ul>

<p>4.4.3. On receipt of the agreement, a revised timetable for determining the application will be published on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Can applications for listed building consent be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate?</h3>

<p>4.5.1. Applications for listed building consent can be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate, but only where the works to the listed building are connected with an application for planning permission which has also been submitted to the Planning Inspectorate under Section 62A. The application for listed building consent must be submitted on the same day as the planning application and must be deemed valid within 10 days of the accompanying planning application.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Procedure to be followed</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Criteria to determine the procedure to be followed</h3>

<p>5.1.1. The Planning Inspectorate will determine the procedure to be followed. In the event that a hearing is required it is likely that the Inspector will wish to focus on comments from interested parties and any outstanding queries they have in respect of the application.  It is not envisaged that the process will be inquisitorial.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Issuing of the decision</h3>

<p>5.2.1. The Planning Inspectorate will issue a formal decision notice incorporating a statement setting out the reasons for the decision. If the application is approved the decision will also list any conditions which are considered necessary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> After the decision</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Is there a right of appeal?</h3>

<p>6.1.1. There is no provision to appeal the decision, irrespective of the outcome. Similarly, there is no provision to appeal directly against the imposition of any conditions imposed on a permission or consent under Section 62A.</p>

<p>6.1.2. Judicial review is the only way in which a decision made by an appointed person on an application under Section 62A can be challenged. A claim for the judicial review of a decision must be made within 6 weeks of the date of issue.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Appendix 2 – Applications covered by S62A and excluded applications</h3>

<p>For the purposes of section 62A, ‘major development’ and ‘non-major development’ are defined within Regulation 3(5) of the Town and Country Planning (Section 62A Applications) (Written Representations and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations, as amended by The Town and Country Planning (Section 62A Applications (Amendment) Regulations 2016.
Major development is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the winning and working of minerals or the use of land for mineral working deposits:</p>
  </li>
  <li>waste development;</li>
  <li>the provision of dwellinghouses where
    <ul>
      <li>the number of dwellinghouses to be provided is 10 or more; or</li>
      <li>the development is carried out on a site having an area of 0.5 hectares or more and the number of dwellings is not known;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the provision of a building or buildings where the floor space to be created by the development is 1,000 square metres or more; or</li>
  <li>development carried out on a site having an area of 1 hectare or more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-major development is development that does not meet/exceed any of the thresholds above.
There are a number of types of applications that cannot be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate under section 62A:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applications where the development has already been carried out (As described in section 73A of the Town and Country Planning 1990 Act, as amended);</li>
  <li>householder applications (As described in article 2 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015);</li>
  <li>applications for development without complying with conditions (As described in section 73(1) of the Town and Country Planning 1990 Act, as amended);</li>
  <li>applications for permission in principle;</li>
  <li>applications for technical details consent (As described in section 70(2ZZB) of the Town and Country Planning 1990 Act, as amended);</li>
  <li>applications for approval of details reserved by condition;</li>
  <li>applications for advertisement consent; and
*applications for lawful development certificates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications for the approval of reserved matters can be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate provided the outline planning application to which it relates fell within the category of development for which the relevant planning authority has been designated.</p>

<p>An application for listed building consent can only be submitted to the Planning Inspectorate where it is connected to an application for planning permission submitted under section 62A. Both applications must be submitted on the same day and the application for listed building consent must be considered a ‘valid application’ within 10 working days of the related planning application being considered valid.</p>

<span class="number">8.3 </span> Appendix 3 – When a design and access statement is required</h3>

<p>A design and access statement includes information about the design principles and concepts that have been applied to the development concerned; and how issues relating to access to the development have been dealt with. It must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain the design principles and concepts that have been applied to the development</li>
  <li>demonstrate the steps taken to appraise the context of the development and how the design of the development takes that context into account</li>
  <li>explain the policy adopted regarding access, and how policies relating to access in relevant local development documents have been taken into account</li>
  <li>state what, if any, consultation has been undertaken on issues relating to access to the development and what account has been taken of the outcome of any such consultation; and</li>
  <li>explain how any specific issues which might affect access to the development have been addressed</li>
</ul>

<p>A design and access statement is required for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All applications for major development unless it is solely for</p>

    <ul>
      <li>engineering or mining operations</li>
      <li>a material change of use of land or buildings; or</li>
      <li>waste development</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-major development, in a designated area, where it consists of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the provision of one or more houses; or</li>
      <li>the provision of a buildings where the floor space created is 100 square metres or more</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A designated area for these purposes is a conservation area, or world heritage site.</p>

<p>Waste development is any operational development designed to be wholly or mainly for the purpose of, or material change of use to, treating, storing, processing, or disposing of refuse or waste material.</p>

<p>All connected applications for listed building consent will also require a design and access statement. That statement must explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the design principles and concepts that have been applied to the works</li>
  <li>how the design principles and concepts that have been applied to the works take account of—
    <ul>
      <li>the special architectural or historic importance of the building</li>
      <li>the particular physical features of the building that justify its designation as a listed building; and</li>
      <li>the building’s setting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Unless the application for listed building consent is only for works that affect the interior of the building, the design and access statement must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain the policy adopted as to access, including what alternative means of access have been considered, and how policies relating to access in relevant local development documents have been taken into account</li>
  <li>explain how the policy regarding access takes account of:</li>
  <li>the special architectural or historic importance of the building</li>
  <li>the particular physical features of the building that justify its designation as a listed building; and</li>
  <li>the building’s setting</li>
  <li>state what, if any, consultation has been undertaken and what account has been taken of the outcome of any such consultation; and</li>
  <li>explain how any specific issues which might affect access to the building have been addressed</li>
</ul>
