<h2>Data sources</h2>

<p>Vehicle licensing statistics are produced from extracts of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>) vehicle database. Other sources of information are also used to improve and expand the information available.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> database</h3>

<p>The main purpose of the database is to administer vehicle registration and licensing records (for Great Britain prior to July 2014, and for the whole of the United Kingdom since this date).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> database contains a new record every time a new (or used) vehicle is first registered in the United Kingdom. A wide range of variables are captured, including the make, model, body type, colour and size of the vehicle, plus some basic information about the keeper of the vehicle, including the postcode of the keeper. More information about what is captured and how this is done can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/v3555-application-for-first-vehicle-tax-and-registration-of-a-used-motor-vehicle-v555">V355 guidance notes</a> produced by <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The initial registration of new vehicles is usually carried out by vehicle manufacturers at the point of sale. In most cases, this is currently processed using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-registration-schemes-for-the-motor-trade/register-a-vehicle-service">Register a Vehicle (<abbr title="Register a Vehicle service">RaV</abbr>) service</a>. Historically, this was done using the Automatic First Registration and Licensing (AFRL) system.</p>

<p>In a small number of cases, the information is keyed in manually by <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> staff. Reasons for this include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles being imported into the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>vehicles that have been restored or built by an individual</li>
  <li>unusual or rare vehicle categories</li>
</ul>

<p>Vehicle details held by <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> are updated when a vehicle has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changed keeper</li>
  <li>been scrapped or exported</li>
  <li>been modified by the keeper</li>
</ul>

<p>In July 2014, vehicle and registration services for Northern Ireland were centralised at <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>, where these services for Great Britain were already administered. This created a single vehicle register for the United Kingdom, in place of separate registers for Great Britain and Northern Ireland. From this time, statistics can be provided for both Great Britain and the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions information</h3>

<p>With the introduction of the Worldwide harmonised Light vehicles Test Procedure (<abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr>), new data was required to accurately measure the emissions of new cars and light goods vehicles. Additional data was captured both via the <abbr title="Register a Vehicle service">RaV</abbr> system and from vehicle manufacturers.</p>

<h3>Plug-in vehicle information</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> record does not capture information about plug-in hybrid electric or range extended electric vehicles, so this information is gathered manually at individual model level. This process is ongoing and iterative.</p>

<h3>Generic models</h3>

<p>The methodology used to implement the generic model to all makes and models is iteratively improved in each release.</p>

<h2>Quality of the data</h2>

<p>Vehicle Licensing statistics are produced to the high professional standards set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>. They undergo regular quality assurance reviews to ensure that they meet customer needs. They are produced free from any political interference.</p>

<p>They were <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vehicles-statistics-guidance">designated as National Statistics in April 2012</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19)</strong></p>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has had an impact on every aspect of life in the United Kingdom, which has affected almost all statistical trends across the transport sector.</p>

<p>New vehicle registration and licensed vehicle statistics are likely to be affected in future months and quarters by the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus.</p>
</div>

<h3>Strengths and weaknesses</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> database can be regarded as being virtually complete in terms of the number of licensed vehicles and vehicles with a <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr>. However, there will be some errors in some of the specific details of individual vehicles.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> carry out regular Traceability Surveys which look at whether it is possible to trace the owner of any given vehicle and check what details on the database are inaccurate. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> estimate that every variable is correct for roughly 89% of the registered vehicles. The remaining 11% of vehicles will have an error in at least one of the fields. Of the overall total, about 4% have wrong details that make it impossible to trace the registered keeper of the vehicle (often caused by keepers not providing <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> with updated details when they move or dispose of the vehicle).</p>

<p>Most of the inaccuracies in the database are with the less critical variables, such as colour, though some will affect the statistics published here (for example by having the wrong <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> g/km emission value or the wrong wheelbase). <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> estimates that under 2% of vehicle records have an inaccuracy in one of the variables used for the published statistics.</p>

<h3>Revisions to series</h3>

<p>Various measures in these statistics are subject to minor revision for the entire series. This is usually due to being continually assessed and improved, or due to additional information being collected at a later date. Major changes to these figures will be communicated to users.</p>

<p>The measures subject to regular minor revisions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ultra low emission vehicles</li>
  <li>Plug-in vehicles</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants/eligibility">Plug-in vehicle grants</a></li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions</li>
  <li>Generic models</li>
</ul>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<h3>Body types</h3>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> record a vehicle body type for each registered vehicle. These body types relate to the physical construction of the vehicle but not the way in which it is currently being used. The key body type groups used are outlined in <strong>Table 1</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Road using vehicles</strong> is a new concept introduced in the 2021 annual release of these statistics.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A <strong>road using vehicle</strong> is one that would reasonably be expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make significant use of the public highway</li>
  <li>be used as a mode of transport</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>A number of vehicle types on the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> register are electric but rarely used the public highways, so the concept of a “road using vehicle” in these statistics allows users to better interpret data about vehicles on the road.</p>

<p>The vast majority of vehicles on the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> database would be considered road using, around 98%. However, there are a number of exceptions, which are outlined in <strong>Table 2</strong>.</p>

<h3>Keepership</h3>

<p>The keeper of the vehicle is responsible for registering and taxing the vehicle only. The keeper of the vehicle is not necessarily the owner or the driver.</p>

<p>A vehicle is either registered to an individual (private) to a or to a business (company). The data source for these <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> statistics does not have full details of the vehicle keepers, only the title of the keeper (for example Mr, Mrs or Company) and the relevant postcode. When a vehicle is in the process of changing hands, it is considered “between keepers” or “under disposal” and has no keeper at that point.</p>

<p>The keeper’s address does not have to be where the vehicle is physically kept, but the keeper must be contactable at that address. This is especially relevant for company vehicles, where a national fleet might be registered to a single administrative office.</p>

<p>A good example of the <strong>keeper</strong> not being the same as the <strong>owner</strong> would be for car leasing schemes, where an individual is responsible for taxing the vehicle, but it belongs to the leasing firm.</p>

<p>A good example of the <strong>keeper</strong> not being the same as the <strong>driver</strong> would be family use of a private vehicle or when renting a car from a car hire company.</p>

<h3>Tax classes</h3>

<p>All vehicles registered by <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> are allocated a tax class, reflecting the way in which the vehicle is used and, in some cases, by whom it is used. It does not always reflect the physical construction of the vehicle. <abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr> due from a specific tax class is outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-of-vehicle-tax-v149">V149</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, the precise tax class depends upon certain vehicle characteristics such as engine size, propulsion type, emission rates, gross weight, number of axles or, in the case of public transport vehicles, and the number of seats.</p>

<p><strong>Table 3</strong> shows the current key tax class groupings in these statistics, but there have been many changes to the tax classes over the years.</p>

<h3>Statutory Off Road Notification (<abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr>)</h3>

<p>From 31 January 1998 it has been necessary to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/make-a-sorn">make a Statutory Off Road Notification (<abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr>)</a> for any vehicle for which the keeper does not wish to renew the tax, or wished to claim a tax refund, because it is not being used on the road.</p>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr> declarations made prior to 16 December 2013 had to be renewed after 12 months. Declarations after this date no longer have to be renewed annually and will remain valid until the vehicle is re-taxed, sold, permanently exported or scrapped. When a vehicle with a <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr> declaration is sold, the new owner will need to tax or <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr> the vehicle themselves.</p>

<p>For statistical purposes, this change to “continuous <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr>” may make a difference in a very small proportion of cases to the estimation of whether a vehicle was licensed or <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr> at the statistical census date (i.e. the end of the previous quarter). The removal of the requirement to renew <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr> declarations annually has resulted in an increase in their number.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions</h3>

<p>When a car or van is registered for the first time, a <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions figure is reported to the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> for monitoring purposes (among other reasons, such as <abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr>).</p>

<p>These emissions were originally determined using the <strong>New European Driving Cycle (<abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr>)</strong>, which has been in place since 1992. <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> is a theoretical laboratory test using a limited number of driving conditions, which led to numerous criticisms from industry and stakeholders. As vehicle technology evolved, the disparity between <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> emissions and “real world” emissions grew wider, compounded by incidents of “defeat devices” being used to lower official emissions.</p>

<p>Introduced in 2015, the <strong>Worldwide harmonised Light vehicles Test Procedure (<abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr>)</strong> is a replacement laboratory test for emissions and fuel efficiency, initially developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). It aims to better align reported <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions measured in the laboratory with those achieved during real world driving conditions.</p>

<p>In order to smoothly transition the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> from using <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> to <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr> for cars and vans registered for the first time, an equivalent <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> figure was calculated, or <strong><abbr title="Estimated New European Driving Cycle">e-NEDC</abbr> figure</strong>, using the results of a <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr> test via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://co2mpas.io/intro.html" rel="external">COM2PAS tool</a> developed by the European Commission. This figure can also be referred to as a <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> correlated figure. This is not directly comparable with a <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> figure as their underlying methodologies are different. The <abbr title="Estimated New European Driving Cycle">e-NEDC</abbr> figure allows for the continuation of tax and emission monitoring systems that were set up to use <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>Table 4</strong> sets out how the two different test procedures (<abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> and <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr>) and the three different test figures (<abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr>, <abbr title="Estimated New European Driving Cycle">e-NEDC</abbr>, and <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr>) have been used during the transition for cars.</p>

<p>From September 2018 onwards, cars tested under <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> could only be registered with agreement from the European Commission, so called “end-of-series derogations”. This avoided manufacturers being left with new cars that were illegal to sell - although this was used sparingly.</p>

<p>Once <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr> testing was introduced in September 2018, cars registered for the first time quickly transitioned to being registered with an <abbr title="Estimated New European Driving Cycle">e-NEDC</abbr> figure. <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr> then became the reported figure used when cars are registered from April 2020. From 2021, this has been the only mandatory reported measure for new cars.</p>

<h3>Fuel types</h3>

<p>The most common fuel types used to propel vehicles are petrol and diesel, sometimes referred to as <strong>Internal Combustion Engine (<abbr title="Internal Combustion Engine">ICE</abbr>)</strong> vehicles. Since about 2014, several alternatives have been growing in popularity. The term “electric vehicle” is vague and can relate to different groupings of fuel types depending on the context, but most commonly refers to just battery electric vehicles.</p>

<p>There are a number of rarer fuel types that include liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), other types of gas, biofuels, steam, and experimental technologies.</p>

<h3>Low emission vehicles</h3>

<p><strong>Ultra low emission vehicles (ULEVs)</strong> are vehicles that are reported to emit less than 75g of carbon dioxide (<abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>) from the tailpipe for every kilometre travelled.</p>

<p>ULEVs will typically include an electrified powertrain but a number of different technologies can be used to achieve these low emissions.</p>

<p><strong>Zero emission vehicles (ZEVs)</strong> are a subset of ULEVs, which only report 0g of carbon dioxide (<abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>) from the tailpipe for every kilometre travelled, currently only including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>battery electric vehicles (BEVs)</li>
  <li>fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs, sometimes referred to as hydrogen powered)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plug-in vehicles</h3>

<p><strong>Plug-in vehicles (PiVs)</strong> is a new measure introduced in the 2021 annual release of these statistics.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Vehicles are a <strong>plug-in vehicle</strong> if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a plug-in technology to connect to a source of electricity</li>
  <li>are road using</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Current fuel types that count as plug-in vehicles are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>battery electric (<abbr title="Battery Electric Vehicle">BEV</abbr>)</li>
  <li>plug-in hybrid electric (petrol or diesel) (<abbr title="Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle">PHEV</abbr>)</li>
  <li>range extended electric (petrol or diesel) (<abbr title="Range Extended Electric Vehicle">REEV</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The introduction of these new <abbr title="Plug-in Vehicle">PiV</abbr> figures allows for a more direct comparison with electric chargepoint infrastructure and general electricity usage.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> shows the overlap between common terms used in this release to describe “electric vehicles”, along with some common models found in those categories. Note that the size of the area does not accurately reflect how many vehicles lie within that region.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1: Venn diagram to show the overlap of the terms plug-in vehicle (<abbr title="Plug-in Vehicle">PiV</abbr>), ultra low emission vehicle (<abbr title="Ultra Low Emission Vehicle">ULEV</abbr>), and zero emission vehicle (<abbr title="Zero Emission Vehicle">ZEV</abbr>) in relation to electric vehicles</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151291/01-image-1.SVG"></div></figure>

<p>It should be noted there is a slight difference in how the <abbr title="Ultra Low Emission Vehicle">ULEV</abbr> data is compiled. This difference is due to the removal of administrative errors from the <abbr title="Ultra Low Emission Vehicle">ULEV</abbr> classifications to maintain their robustness, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>incorrect <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>
</li>
  <li>incorrect propulsion type</li>
  <li>incorrect make or model</li>
</ul>

<p>As there is a small difference between the sets of figures on ULEVs and PiVs, we recommend using the <abbr title="Plug-in Vehicle">PiV</abbr> statistics for most use cases.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows how the main fuel types used in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> are related.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2: Diagram showing key properties of the main fuel types</strong></p>

<h3>Impact of <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr> on ultra low emission vehicles</h3>

<p>In April 2020, cars moved to report a new <abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emission figure at first registration. This “<abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr>” figure generally reports higher emission levels for the same car.</p>

<p>As ULEVs are based on reported emissions, the set of non-<abbr title="Battery Electric Vehicle">BEV</abbr> models that are considered ULEVs for these statistics (for example Mitsubishi Outlander <abbr title="Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle">PHEV</abbr>, BMW 330e <abbr title="Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle">PHEV</abbr>) has been affected when transitioning to a new source for the reported emissions figure. <abbr title="Battery Electric Vehicle">BEV</abbr> models are unaffected (for example Nissan Leaf) as they always report zero emissions under all tests.</p>

<p>When vehicles transitioned from reporting <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> to <abbr title="Estimated New European Driving Cycle">e-NEDC</abbr> (September to December 2018 for cars and September to December 2019 for light goods vehicles), there was potential for the set of models to vary. However, given the “equivalent” nature of <abbr title="Estimated New European Driving Cycle">e-NEDC</abbr>, the impact of this transition is considered negligible for these statistics. This means that published figures on ULEVs are still comparable across this transition.</p>

<p>When cars transitioned from reporting <abbr title="Estimated New European Driving Cycle">e-NEDC</abbr> to <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr> (April 2020), there was a notable impact on the set of models. The relationship between these two emissions figures is complex. For petrol, diesel, and hybrid electric cars, the <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr> figure is typically around 20% higher than the <abbr title="Estimated New European Driving Cycle">e-NEDC</abbr> figure. Whilst this impact can be reduced for plug-in vehicles, the <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr> figure is still typically higher. This means that models just under the 75 grams threshold under <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> can be pushed over by the transition to <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr>. Common affected models include Land Rover Range Rover P400E, Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid, and Porsche Panamera 4 E-Hybrid.</p>

<p>Whilst the set of models from April 2020 is slightly reduced, the number of ULEVs in these statistics remain broadly comparable across this transition, as the most common models are not affected. Alternative definitions of ULEVs are being considered in order to provide a consistent time series going forward.</p>

<h2>Factors affecting statistics on licensed vehicles</h2>

<p>When assessing the data on licensed vehicles presented within this publication, it is important to note that the numbers given represent the number of vehicles licensed at the end of each year. The following factors may affect the statistics given.</p>

<h3>Seasonality in stock figures</h3>

<p>The number of licensed vehicles at the end of each quarter is seasonal as the distribution of vehicles changes throughout the year.</p>

<p>Motorcycles are especially affected as a large number are kept off road during the winter months (given a <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr>). Many such vehicles have six month licences covering, for example April to September and are not used for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>Many tables are presented on a quarterly basis to illustrate this seasonality.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>When comparing licensed vehicles over time, statistics for the same quarter in different years should be used, rather than comparing consecutive quarters.</p>

<p>For example, 2021 Quarter 2 (end June) data should be compared to 2020 Quarter 2 (end June) rather than 2021 Quarter 1 (end March).</p>
</div>

<h3>Seasonality in new registration figures</h3>

<p>New registration data generally shows very marked peaks of new vehicle registrations in March and September and troughs in February and August. These correspond with the release of the new registration plates in March and September each year. Up to September 1999, new registration plates were issued only once a year in August.</p>

<p>New registration statistics are also much more responsive to the wider state of the United Kingdom economy than the total licensed vehicles statistics. In general, new registrations are higher during periods of strong economic growth and lower during times of low growth or recession.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>When comparing new vehicle registrations over time, statistics for the same time period in different years should be used, rather than comparing consecutive months or quarters.</p>

<p>For example, November 2021 data should be compared to November 2020 rather than October 2021.</p>
</div>

<h3>Effect of government actions</h3>

<p>Government policy can impact the trends in these statistics, such as changes to</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr> and other aspects of taxation</li>
  <li>regulations, such as emissions monitoring</li>
  <li>administrative, such as introducing “continuous <abbr title="Statutory Off Road Notification">SORN</abbr>”</li>
  <li>incentives, such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants">plug-in vehicle grant</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the data on makes and models</h2>

<p>The following tables and datafiles contain information about the make and model of vehicles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VEH0133</li>
  <li>VEH0141</li>
  <li>VEH0171</li>
  <li>VEH0181</li>
  <li>VEH0210</li>
  <li>VEH0260</li>
  <li>df_VEH0120 (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>)</li>
  <li>df_VEH0124</li>
  <li>df_VEH0160 (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>)</li>
  <li>df_VEH0220</li>
  <li>df_VEH0270</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some third party websites that process this <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> data and present it in a different format.</p>

<h3>Data processing</h3>

<p>The statistical database used for these statistics does not contain the text of the make and model. Instead, the information is encoded at point of first registration.</p>

<p>Prior to 1963, these codes were created by manufacturers and they tended to record less detail than for modern vehicles. Usually just a generic commercial name was used.</p>

<p>Since 1963, the manufacturers created the model codes in conjunction with the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>, initially, and subsequently the various trade associations. The main stipulation of the codes is that they should only be created for models which have been made available for sale in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Generic model</h3>

<p><strong>Generic model</strong> is a grouping of models to help compare models on the road. Manufacturers vary in their approach on how many model versions they give a particular range of vehicles. For example, there are currently 3 model versions for Tesla Model 3, but there are over 800 model versions for Ford Fiesta.</p>

<h3>Missing or incorrect details</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The limitations of these make and model statistics are <strong>not errors in the DVLA database</strong>, but issues with the statistical process used.</p>

<p>If a vehicle keeper believes that there is a specific error on the V5 document for their own vehicle, they should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/change-vehicle-details-registration-certificate">contact the DVLA</a> directly to have this corrected.</p>
</div>

<p>Vehicle manufacturers submit vehicle information at point of first registration and <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> do not change it unless prompted. This means that most mistakes in the final data are usually because of administrative errors made by the manufacturer. Other mistakes can occur when vehicles are registered manually using a paper form as there is opportunity for typographic errors.</p>

<p>Other issues include</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles registered before 1963 are less likely to have a specific model name or any model name at all. Model names would only have existed if the manufacturer created one at the time</li>
  <li>model names are not designed to fully describe the vehicle, so different “marks” or trims might be included as one model name, despite being different vehicles (for example Volkswagen Golf)</li>
  <li>imported vehicles (that have not been on general sale in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) would not have a code available. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> attempts to find a near match but usually end up setting them to “model missing”</li>
  <li>some smaller vehicle manufacturers are not part of the encoding scheme, so their vehicles are registered with the correct make code, but do not have any model codes</li>
  <li>multistage build vehicles (for example motorhomes) are likely to have a mix of makes and models from the base and final manufacturers</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Any vehicle of a given model name which cannot be found in the data will most likely be included in the <strong>missing</strong> categories.</p>

<h2>History of Vehicle Excise Duty (<abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr>)</h2>

<p>There have been several major changes to the <abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr> system in recent years. This section highlights some important changes when considering trends over time. This is not an exhaustive list.</p>

<h3><span class="number">1980s </span></h3>

<p>From 1 October 1982, all general goods vehicles up to 1,525 kilograms (<abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr>) unladen weight were assessed for vehicle excise duty at the same rate as private vehicles, and the old Private Car and Van tax class was replaced by the new Private and Light Goods (PLG) tax class. In addition, goods vehicles greater than 1,525 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> unladen weight were to be taxed with reference to their gross vehicle weight and axle configuration, as opposed to unladen weight as in previous years. Farmers’ light goods vehicles and showmen’s light goods vehicles, such as vehicles up to 1,525 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> unladen weight, were allocated to their own distinct tax classes and were not included in the PLG tax class.</p>

<h3><span class="number">1990s </span></h3>

<p>From 1 October 1990, goods vehicles less than or equal to 3,500 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (3.5 tonnes) gross vehicle weight were transferred from the Goods Vehicle tax class to the Private and Light Goods class. Farmers’ and showmen’s goods vehicles of less than or equal to 3,500 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> gross vehicle weight, but more than 1,525 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> unladen weight, were transferred to the Light Goods Farmers’ and Light Goods Showmen’s tax classes.</p>

<p>There were major reforms of the entire <abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr> system. The bulk of the 1995 changes came into operation on 1 July 1995, but some additional changes were introduced on 29 November 1995. The intention was to remove many of the complications in the existing tax structure, using a strategy to link <abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr> rates for many vehicles directly to the rate for the PLG group, or the basic minimum rate for HGVs.</p>

<p>In addition, the Goods Vehicle tax system was considerably simplified by the abolition of separate goods vehicle classes for farmers and showmen. All remaining light goods vehicle tax classes were also abolished and vehicles in those groups transferred to the PLG class. At the same time, the basis for calculation of excise duty for goods vehicles was amended to “revenue weight”. Revenue weight means either “confirmed maximum gross weight” as determined by plating and testing regulations, or “design weight” for vehicles not subject to plating and testing (formerly known as Restricted HGVs).</p>

<p>The process also included further simplifications and “tidying” arrangements. These included cases in which vehicles not over 3,500 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> gross weight were moved into the PLG tax class rather than remaining in specialised tax classes and groups, and the re-allocation of some tax classes into more appropriate groups. One key change of a similar type was to abolish the separate tax of public transport vehicles with eight seats or fewer and tax all such vehicles in the PLG class. From start of July 1995 bigger public transport vehicles were taxed in a new Bus tax class. The changes were completed by the introduction of a new Exempt class in the November 1995 budget for vehicles previously in the private and light goods or motorcycle groups over 25 years of age. From November 1997 this applies only to vehicles that were manufactured before 1973.</p>

<h3><span class="number">2000s </span></h3>

<p>From March 2001, the <abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr> due for cars was set according to the reported carbon (<abbr title="Carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>) emissions emitted by the vehicle. There were originally six bands, A to F, which was expanded in March 2006 to include a new emissions band G.</p>

<p>From April 2009, these seven emission <abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr> bands for cars were increased to 13 (A to M) and redefined.</p>

<h3><span class="number">2010s </span></h3>

<p>For cars registered for the first time from April 2017 onwards, a flat Standard Rate applies (except for zero emissions cars which remain zero rated) after the first year. Cars with a list price in excess of £40,000 incur an additional supplement for the years 2 to 6. All cars newly registered before 1 April 2017 are taxed according to a new set of emission bands.</p>

<h3><span class="number">2020s </span></h3>

<p>From April 2020, the emissions figure used to allocate a car to a <abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr> band shifted from a <abbr title="New European Driving Cycle">NEDC</abbr> or equivalent figure to a <abbr title="Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure">WLTP</abbr> figure, which is typically higher for most vehicles.</p>

<h2>Other sources of data on vehicles</h2>

<h3>Data from other <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> statistical series</h3>

<p>Statistics on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/vehicles-statistics#vehicle-excise-duty-evasion-statistics">Vehicle Excise Duty (<abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr>) evasion</a> are produced using a bespoke roadside survey. If a vehicle is being illegally used on the road without a licence (such as evading <abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr>), then it is not counted in the statistics presented within this publication. The same data source is used to produce estimated of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/road-traffic-statistics">foreign registered vehicles</a> on <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> roads.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-travel-survey-statistics">National Travel Survey</a> includes tables on driving licence holders, vehicle ownership and driving intentions.</p>

<p>Statistics are also available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/road-accidents-and-safety-statistics">reported road accidents and road safety</a>.</p>

<h3>Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>The Department for Infrastructure <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/articles/northern-ireland-transport-statistics" rel="external">publishes statistics on Northern Ireland</a> using an extract of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> database. We will continue to work with colleagues in Northern Ireland to produce consistent statistics for the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3>Trade associations</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/" rel="external">Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (<abbr title="Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders">SMMT</abbr>)</a> also produces some statistics for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. These are collated directly from the manufacturers and therefore only report new vehicles, rather than all new registrations. There are also some minor differences in body type classifications used. This means that although the broad trends between the <abbr title="Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders">SMMT</abbr> data and the statistics published in this series tend to be similar, there will be some minor differences.</p>

<p>In addition, the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.mcia.co.uk/" rel="external">Motorcycle Industry Association (MCIA)</a> produce motorcycle statistics for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>  and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://aea.uk.com/" rel="external">Agricultural Engineers Association (AEA)</a> produce tractor statistics for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>
