<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Intellectual Property and Copyright</h3>

<p>The Defence Intellectual Property Rights (DIPR) department is responsible for managing the licensing of the majority of MOD Crown copyright material (see Part 3 for other Public Sector Bodies).</p>

<p>DIPR, working in conjunction with the Directorate of Defence Communications (DDC), is also responsible for licensing of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) for the purposes of producing merchandise i.e. Officially Licensed products with MOD logos/insignia.</p>

<p>This document provides information about MOD Crown copyright and Merchandising licensing. It also provides some information about other Public Sector Bodies who have a separate delegation to license Crown copyright material.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>MOD Crown copyright licensing</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Re-use of MOD imagery - photographs and film footage</h3>

<h4>Re-use of MOD imagery taken in the last 5 years</h4>

<p>The Ministry of Defence (MOD) needs to ensure that there are no personal data or security issues with images or video it produces before it can be published or allow third parties to use that material.</p>

<p>The Directorate of Defence Communications (DDC) provide an online facility for the public and media to access official images and video produced by the MOD.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.defenceimagery.mod.uk" rel="external">MOD Defence Imagery</a></p>

<p>The material is made available under the terms of two separate licenses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224534/20130715_Crown_Copyright_-_MOD_News_Licence_V2.0_-_U.pdf" rel="external">MOD News Licence</a> - allows free use of MOD imagery for the purposes of news reporting only</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/" rel="external">Open Government Licence (OGL)</a> is a broad commercial, free re-use licence but does not allow the re-use of imagery containing personal data.</li>
</ul>

<p>For further information on the licensing terms, please see the Copyright section at the foot of online facilities homepage.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may contact the team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:admin@photos.mod.uk">admin@photos.mod.uk</a></p>

<h4>Re-use of MOD imagery over five years old</h4>

<p>Under MOD policy, after five years, imagery of significant importance is generally transferred to the Imperial War Museum (IWM) for archiving.</p>

<p>Information about their collections, including photographs and film can be accessed at <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections" rel="external">IWM Collections</a>.</p>

<p>The IWM has a special delegation from the Keeper of The National Archives so that they can license at a cost, most Crown Copyright items in its possession. This is to support the preservation of the official imagery in its care.</p>

<p>Any requests to use the imagery from their archive should be directed to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/commercial/licensing" rel="external">IWM Collections, Sales and Licensing</a>.</p>

<h4>Re-use of MOD imagery - Other requests</h4>

<p>Any other request not covered by the information provided above, should be directed to the MOD Crown copyright administrator: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DIPR-Copyright@mod.gov.uk">DIPR-Copyright@mod.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If it cannot be established 100 per cent that an image or video is MOD Crown copyright, no licence terms will be offered by MOD to re-use such an image.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Re-use of MOD text, diagrams and illustrations</h3>

<p>Text, diagrams and illustrations may be available under the OGL. Any requests should be directed to the MOD Crown copyright administrator via e-mail: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DIPR-Copyright@mod.gov.uk">DIPR-Copyright@mod.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>The MOD will require a minimum acknowledgment of the source as follows: â(title of material), Ministry of Defence Â© Crown Copyright 20XX (insert year of publication). If such material is available under the OGL, then a further acknowledgment will be required as follows: âReproduced under the terms of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/" rel="external">Open Government Licence</a>.â</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Software, training material and all other MOD Crown copyright material</h3>

<p>Licences for all other types of Crown copyright material, for example training courses, or software, are dealt with on a case by case basis and are likely to involve the payment of fees.  All enquiries should be directed to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DIPR-Copyright@mod.gov.uk">DIPR-Copyright@mod.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Music by a MOD Band</h3>

<p>MOD bands such as the Royal Marines Band are often requested to perform, either in public or for a sound recording. Under copyright law, anyone who wishes to record the performance, either by sound recording, video or broadcast requires a contract/licence.</p>

<p>If you wish to engage the use of a MOD band whether it be a regular serving or a reserve forces band, you will need to contact the following MOD commercial staff:</p>

<p>Navy/RM Band - <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:NAVYRMBAND-HQBSRMENGCOORD@mod.gov.uk">NAVYRMBAND-HQBSRMENGCOORD@mod.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Use of MOD Insignia, Logos, and Badges</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>General use</h3>

<p>Insignia is a general term used to describe an object or mark that shows that a person belongs to an organisation or group.  This term will include arms, crests, badges and banners, other such heraldic identifiers; or logos.  More information about insignia is provided in Annex B.</p>

<p>The majority of MOD insignia are not only protected by Crown copyright but are also protected by way of trademark and/or design registration. This includes all current and many former service and unit badges, and variants thereof.</p>

<p>MOD takes its intellectual property, and in particular, use of its insignia very seriously. Legal action can be taken against you if you use any of them without the correct permission. DIPR, and no other part of MOD is responsible for the licensing of its insignia.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148008/MOD.PNG"></div></figure>

<p>MOD will not allow third parties to use the MOD logo, as shown above, except where used as part of MOD business; see âSection 8 - Use of MOD Insignia by Contractorsâ below.  This is its corporate identity and is not licensed out. Neither can you reproduce a part of any MOD insignia; any reproduction approved will be for the whole badge, crest or logo.</p>

<p>MOD does not, as a matter of course, permit the use or incorporation of any part of any MOD insignia within another logo. Any such coexistence requests or enquiries as to whether a proposed logo will infringe the rights of the MOD should be directed to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DIPR-CTML@mod.gov.uk">DIPR-CTML@mod.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Information regarding common enquiries relating to the use of MOD insignia is provided below.</p>

<p>All other general enquiries about the use of MOD insignia should be directed to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:mod-brandportal@ddc-mod.org">mod-brandportal@ddc-mod.org</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Use of MOD Insignia on a private memorial or memorial project</h3>

<p>The Secretary of State for Defence is content to permit the families of former Service personnel to use appropriate specified MOD insignia on private, family instigated memorials and/ or their headstone. The Secretary of State for Defence may also permit the use of such insignia on public memorials at the request of veteranâs associations, such as the Royal British Legion, or local authorities, such as a county council, or other third parties.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Use of MOD Veterans Badge</h3>

<p>In order to ensure that the image of the HM Armed Forces Veterans Badge (HMAFVB) is not devalued through inappropriate use, the decision was made some time ago not to licence its use outside the MOD. This policy applies to any external organisation irrespective of how aligned with the MODâs goals they may be and no matter how much the MOD may implicitly wish to support them. As a result, DIPR is unable to give permission to use the badge.</p>

<p>Any concerns about this policy should be directed to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:People-DSSec-HonsMailbox@mod.gov.uk">People-DSSec-HonsMailbox@mod.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Use of MOD Veterans UK Logo</h3>

<p>The Veterans UK logo is different to the Veteranâs badge and is protected by a registered trademark. Veterans UK administer the armed forces pension schemes and compensation payments for those injured or bereaved through service. Veterans UK are part of MOD.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span>Use of MOD Insignia by the media or for the purposes of illustration</h3>

<p>MOD will not interfere with the use of MOD badges and logos by the media in relation to news reports relating to the MOD.</p>

<p>MOD will not interfere with the use of names, badges and logos in a drama about the MOD or military (for example, on costumes or props), unless the depiction of the MOD or military is intentionally and seriously defamatory.</p>

<p>People are free to use MOD insignia for illustration purposes.  For example, to include a regimental badge in a website such as Wikipedia for the purposes of describing in their own words what that regiment does.  Free access to low resolution graphics of MOD badges or logos for use in a website for the illustration purposes only, can be obtained from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.defencebrandportal.mod.uk" rel="external">defence brand portal</a>.</p>

<p>Annex C below is a free licence that provides the terms of use.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span>Use of MOD Insignia by charities</h3>

<p>âOfficialâ military charities operated within military units have separate guidance.</p>

<p>Other charities may not use MOD insignia to say they supply or are targeting MOD staff in any general or specific activity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span>Use of MOD Insignia by contractors</h3>

<h4>Fulfilment of procurement contracts</h4>

<p>As a general rule, no licence separate from the contract is required by a manufacturer to fulfil a MOD procurement contract. The name or insignia being licensed should be defined in the contract with the conditions of use required to fulfil the contract.</p>

<p>Any permission to use MOD insignia provided under a procurement contract is however provided for the purposes of that contract only. Insignia may not be used for any other purpose or following the completion of the contract without a separate licence from DIPR.</p>

<h4>Advertisement by Businesses</h4>

<p>MOD names or insignia should not be used in a way that might indicate endorsement of a contractorâs products or services and imply that the MOD particularly favours a contractorâs products or services or certifies the suitability of such products.</p>

<p>Therefore contractors, such as equipment manufacturers may not use MOD insignia in their promotional material, including their website, to indicate that they are a MOD supplier; nor for example, use them on or in annual reports or on websites or marketing material.</p>

<p>Contractors may make factual statements as to the nature of their contractual relationship with MOD, but they may not use our badges to do so. The incidental inclusion of insignia and logos in photographs is permitted where this cannot practically be avoided.</p>

<p>Likewise, businesses may not use MOD insignia to say they supply or are targeting MOD staff in any general or specific activity.</p>

<h4>Publishing, lectures, conferences and displays</h4>

<p>Where MOD is a contributor to a document, lecture, conference or display, a contractor may be permitted to use MOD insignia to indicate MODâs contribution.</p>

<p>Permission will only be given where MOD has control over the output and where the use of the insignia or logo makes it clear what MODâs contribution is.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.10 </span>Use of MOD Insignia for book projects</h3>

<h4>Author/Publisher request to have access to MOD resources</h4>

<p>On occasion, the MOD may assist authors and publishers with the production of a book.  This can mean providing access to persons for interview or information, or access to important research data.  Author/Publisher requests to have access to MOD resources to produce a book should be directed to the following contacts:</p>

<p>Royal Air Force publication reviews â <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:jay.myers420@mod.gov.uk">jay.myers420@mod.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Army publication reviews - <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ArmyEandC-ArmyComms-projects-a@mod.gov.uk">ArmyEandC-ArmyComms-projects-a@mod.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Navy publication reviews - <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Charles.Ball236@mod.gov.uk">Charles.Ball236@mod.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>On the completion of the manuscript, it will need to be submitted for clearance; including operational security and personal security issues, balance, factual accuracy, this includes front and back cover and all photographs and illustrations.</p>

<h4>Requests to use MOD Insignia</h4>

<p>There are often requests to use MOD insignia, i.e. badges or logos, on or inside books.  This can be from an author or publisher, a serving member of the military, or a project commissioned by a regiment or unit of the UK Armed Forces.  Such requests are managed because MOD wishes to avoid the use being mistaken for a publishersâ mark and to ensure that use is within MODâs Brand Guidelines.</p>

<p>Access to high resolution graphics of MOD badges or logos is provided through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.defencebrandportal.mod.uk" rel="external">Defence Brand Portal</a> as part of the MOD merchandising licensing scheme, see âSection 11 - Use of MOD Insignia for merchandiseâ below; but only after a book project is endorsed by one of the relevant media officers whose contacts are provided above.</p>

<p>Free access to low resolution graphics of MOD badges or logos for use inside a book for illustration purposes only, can be obtained from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.defencebrandportal.mod.uk" rel="external">Defence Brand Portal</a>.</p>

<p>Annex C below is a free licence that provides the terms of use.</p>

<p>Alternatively an author or publisher may photograph a metal or embroidered cap badge themselves for use on the cover of a book as part of a montage, or inside a book; provided it is clear that the badge is not being used to imply that the book originates from, or is endorsed by MOD.  Such use will also be free of charge.</p>

<span class="number">4.11 </span>Use of MOD Insignia for merchandise</h3>

<p>MOD allows the sale under licence of a wide range of commercial products bearing MOD badges and logos.  For example, this will include items such as clothing using a regimental badge; or watches with the Red Arrows Diamond Nine trademark.  No third party should trade products or services using MOD insignia until a licence has been fully agreed and signed by DIPR.</p>

The Official MOD Licensing Programme exists primarily as a vehicle for communicating MOD messages to the public, and to assist in building an affinity between the public and the Armed Forces.  Due to this need to protect MODâs IP and convey positive messages to the public and the Armed Forces, there is no guarantee that an application for use of MOD insignia will be accepted.</p>

<span class="number">5.1 </span>Annex A - MOD Crown copyright licensing delegation</h3>

<p>The Keeper of The National Archives issues policy to public sector bodies on the management and in particular the licensing of Public Sector Information; in other words, Crown copyright material.  The MOD has been granted a delegation from The Keeper of The National Archives to license MOD Crown copyright material.</p>

<p>Permission for the re-use of copyright materials can be either free or for a charge. In 2015, The Keeper of The National Archives issued policy guidance to public sector bodies on the implementation of the Re-Use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015; which was legislated by government through a Statutory Instrument (SI 2015 No 1415).  This was to effectively implement European Directive 2013/37/EU.</p>

<p>The result of the 2015 regulations was that more Public Sector Information would be available to the public for re-use at no charge.  In other words under a free copyright licence called the Open Government Licence.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/" rel="external">Find out more</a></p>

<p>To understand what information might be licensed for free, The Keeper of The National Archives have issued guidance that Public Sector Information will include any information such as print, digital or electronic, and sound recordings that falls within the public task of a Crown body, unless such information is subject to an exemption under the 2015 Regulations. DIPR follows the policy issued by The Keeper of The National Archives; as such MOD operates a publication scheme which sets out information available to the public about how we operate and spend our budget.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>The 2015 Regulations and the MODâs public task</h3>

<p>For the purposes of the 2015 Regulations, the MODâs public task is to:</p>

<p>Work for a secure and prosperous United Kingdom with global reach and influence.  Protect our people, territories, values and interests at home and overseas, through strong armed forces and in partnership with allies, to ensure our security, support our national interests and safeguard our prosperity.

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Information not subject to 2015 Regulations or falling outside the MOD Public Task</h3>

<p>Information falling outside the 2015 Regulations or Public Task may not be available for re-use at all; or may be available under licence subject to a charge. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Third party copyright works</li>
  <li>A document where access is excluded or restricted under information access legislation including on the grounds of protection of personal data, protection of national security, defence or public security, statistical confidentiality or commercial confidentiality (including business, professional or company secrets).

  <li>Imagery</li>
  <li>Band music</li>
  <li>MOD insignia, including parts of documents containing such logos or badges</li>
</ul>

<p>Some particularly sensitive documents, if falling within the scope of MODâs public task, will only be made available for re-use, if at all, with the most stringent conditions, these will include, but will not be limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identity documents</li>
  <li>Certification documents of any kind</li>
  <li>Photographs of the deceased</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether the material you request is within MODâs public task will be determined by the MODâs Crown Copyright Administrator.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Annex B â Information about insignia</h3>

<p>Coat of Arms are defined as a shield inclusive of a specific design, used as an identifier of an individual to which they are granted by the Her Majesty the Queen through the College of Arms.  Crests have heraldic design positioned on top of a helmet or crown; they are not free standing and will be used in conjunction with a coat of arms. An example of a coat of arms, including a crest, is the Cranwell coat of arms, see below.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148009/Cranwell.PNG"></div></figure>

<p>Badges are free standing heraldic devices, which can be derived from a crest or arms. The Armour Centre Badge and the Life Guards are two examples of badges, see below.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148010/Armour_Centre.png"></div></figure>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148011/The_Life_Guards.png"></div></figure>

<p>The term logo is used to describe more modern symbols used by an organization to identify its products, uniform, or services it provides. The Ministry of Defence, Navy, Army and RAF logos are shown below as examples.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148012/Royal_Navy.PNG"></div></figure>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148013/ARMY.PNG"></div></figure>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148014/RAF.PNG"></div></figure>

<p>Therefore, given the above descriptions, all MOD insignia can be defined either as a badge or logo.</p>
