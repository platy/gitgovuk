<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance contains information on the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Merchandise
Licensing Programme and should be read and understood before commencing the
application process for a licence.</p>

<p>MOD insignia including arms, crests, badges and names, other such heraldic
identifiers, or logos are owned by the MOD. They are protected by various
intellectual property rights, including Crown copyright, registered/unregistered
design rights, and registered/unregistered trademark rights.</p>

<p>To protect the MOD’s reputation and financial interests, any third party wishing to
use MOD insignia on merchandise will require a licence from the MOD.</p>

<p>There are two types of merchandise licence. Please see paragraph 4 for
information.</p>

<p>If you are a retailer and purchase MOD branded products from a MOD licensed
supplier, there is no need for you to have a licence. All licence holders are issued
a licence number from Defence Intellectual Property Rights (DIPR) which licensees
should provide on request.</p>

<p>The MOD is prepared to take legal action against anyone who uses its intellectual
property without a licence, in contravention of these legal rights.</p>

<h2>Authorisation</h2>

<p>Permission to use MOD insignia on merchandise can only be given from DIPR and
DDC. It cannot be granted by serving military personnel of any rank, veterans or
anyone else in the Defence community.</p>

<p>Defence Intellectual Property Rights (DIPR), who act on behalf of the Secretary of
State for Defence, are the only authority that can issue licences for the use of MOD
insignia.</p>

<p>The Directorate of Defence Communications (DDC) are the only authority who can
advise and approve how MOD insignia can be applied and used on merchandise.</p>

<h2>The Defence Brand Portal</h2>

<p>The Defence Brand Portal (DBP) is where the MOD Merchandise Licensing
Programme is administered. All licence applications, renewals, amendments and
product approvals are managed via the DBP.</p>

<p>You can register for the DBP by visiting the <a class="govuk-link" href="www.Defencebrandportal.mod.uk">website</a>. Please see Annex B for further information.</p>

<p>The workflows on the DBP are designed to be easy to use and self-explanatory,
however if any difficulties or questions arise, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:mod-brandportal@ddcmod.org">mod-brandportal@ddcmod.org</a>.</p>

<p>Only once a licence has been granted, access will be given to the specific highresolution images of MOD insignia which have been approved for use under the
licence. These will be made available for download on the DBP.</p>

<h2>Types of Licence</h2>

<p>The two types of merchandise licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the Standard Merchandise Licence – the licensed material under this
licence can include Army, Navy, Royal Air Force and Battle of Britain
Memorial Flight (BBMF) insignia. The licensed material is to be specially
selected on application for a licence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Red Arrows Licence - the licensed material under this licence can only
include Red Arrows insignia. The licensed material is to be specially selected
on application for a licence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>each type of licence will be subject to a separate application and approvals
process on the Defence Brand Portal and will be subject to separate licence fees.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Terms of Licence</h2>

<p>All licence applications are subject to an approvals process on a case by case
basis. There is no guarantee of a licence application being approved. The MOD’s
decision is final and there is no appeal process. This does not preclude you from
applying for a licence at a later date</p>

<p>The MOD does not grant exclusive licences. This means there may be several
licensees selling similar or identical products.</p>

<p>Successful applicants will be required to take out and maintain Product Liability
Insurance to a minimum of £5 million with an indemnity to principal clause and
provide evidence of such insurance for the duration of the licence. This will insure
and indemnify the MOD against product liability claims. All insurance documents
will need to be validated before a licence is granted.</p>

<p>Licences are granted on commercial terms. No concessions are available for
charities, associations, veterans or welfare organisations. All third parties are
licensed on the same terms.</p>

<p>Licences are subject to fees. Please see Annex A for further information.</p>

<p>Licences are generally approved for a term of five (5) years.</p>

<h2>Licence Renewal</h2>

<p>An application for a renewal of a licence will need to be submitted six (6) months
prior to the licence expiry date. Failure to submit the licence renewal application
before the licence expiry date will result in the application being treated as a new
licence application, which will incur new application fees (if the application for
renewal is approved).</p>

<p>The decision to renew a licence is at the absolute discretion of the MOD.</p>

<h2>Products and Approvals</h2>

<p>A complete and extensive list of all products intended to be produced under the
licence is required on application for a licence. Products should be chosen on the
application form by firstly selecting the product category and then secondly,
selecting the specific products. For example, “Clothing, Footwear and Headwear”
is the product category and “Bath robes, Boots and Baseball Caps” are the specific
products.</p>

<p>You will be required to submit artwork before production and may even be required
to submit physical samples of all products intended to be produced under the
licence. This is submitted to DDC for approval during the application stage and if a
licence is granted, throughout the term of the licence via the Defence Brand Portal
workflows.</p>

<p>In order to extend the candidate products listed within the licence you will be
required to apply for an amendment to the licence. Approval for an amendment is
not guaranteed. If the amendment is approved, an amendment fee will be payable.</p>

<p>Licensed products must be manufactured, distributed, advertised, promoted and
sold in accordance with all statutes, codes, laws, decrees, rules and regulations
applicable in the relevant territories</p>

<p>Licensees shall use OFFICIAL LICENSED PRODUCT holographic stickers on
licensed products when they are made available. Each sticker has a unique
reference number and only one sticker should be used per licensed product.</p>

<h2>Statement of Sales for Royalty Periods</h2>

<p>A royalty rate on total net sales of licensed products or a minimum royalty cost
(whichever is greater) is payable at the end of each royalty period, except for the selloff period where the minimum royalty cost is not applicable.</p>

<p>The licence agreement will set out the start and end dates for each royalty period and
when the statement of sales for each period is due. There will be a royalty period for
each year of the licence. There will also be a sell-off period at the end of the licence to
allow for the licensee to sell off or destroy any remaining MOD branded products.</p>

<p>A statement of sales for each royalty period including the sell-off period is required to
be submitted to DIPR in the format provided in the licence. The statement of sales will
set out the licensed products sold during each royalty period.</p>

<p>No reminder will be sent when a statement of sales is due or has not been received. It
is the licensee’s responsibility to ensure that all statements of sales are submitted on
time.</p>

<p>A late fee will be incurred on late submission of statement of sales.</p>

<h2>Annex A - Licence Fees</h2>

<p>The table below sets out the fees associated with a MOD merchandise licence. These feesare payable to DIPR and are non-negotiable. DIPR reserve the right to change these standard fees from time to time.</p>
