<p>Universal Credit is a monthly payment to help with your living costs. You may be able to get it if you’re on a low income, out of work or unable to work.</p>

<p>Your monthly payment is based on your circumstances, for example, your earnings or household income, housing costs and any health condition or disability you may have.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>If you have a health condition or disability when making a claim for Universal Credit</h2>

<p>When you make a claim for Universal Credit you will be asked if you have either a health condition or a disability which prevents, or limits, your ability to work. If you answer ‘yes’ you may be asked to attend a Work Capability Assessment (<abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr>).</p>

<p>In most circumstances, if you remain unable to work due to your health conditions for 4 weeks, you will be referred for a <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr> on the 29th day of your claim.</p>

<p>You may be referred for a <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr> on the first day of your claim when one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you are <a class="govuk-link" href="#TerminallyIll">terminally ill</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you are pregnant and there is a serious risk of damage to your health, or to the health of your unborn child if you do not refrain from work or work-related activity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you are receiving or are about to receive treatment for cancer by way of chemotherapy or radiotherapy – or you are recovering from such treatment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you are in hospital or similar institution for 24 hours or longer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you are prevented from working by law</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you are receiving treatment such as dialysis, plasmapheresis or total parenteral nutrition for gross impairment of enteric function or are recovering after receiving one of these types of treatment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Declaring a health condition or disability on an existing Universal Credit claim</h2>

<p>If you have already made a claim for Universal Credit, a new health condition or disability will need to be reported as a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances">change of circumstances</a>.</p>

<p>You can report periods of sickness of up to 14 days as a <a class="govuk-link" href="#temporaryperiodofsickness">temporary period of sickness</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Medical evidence</h2>

<p>You can self-certify for up to the first 7 days of your claim by notifying Universal Credit that you have a health condition which prevents you from working.</p>

<p>From the 8th day, if your condition persists and if you have not already done so, you will need to submit medical evidence.</p>

<p>This will normally be a Statement of Fitness for Work (<abbr title="Statement of Fitness for Work">SoFFW</abbr>). This is often referred to as a fit note, sick note, med cert or doctor’s note. This can be provided by a doctor or General Practitioner.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Your Claimant Commitment</h2>

<p>To get Universal Credit you will need to agree with your work coach what activities you can do to prepare or look for work. Your work coach will take into account your health condition or disability when considering what to include in your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/your-responsibilities">Claimant Commitment</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If a medical professional has said you have less than 12 months to live, you will not need a Claimant Commitment.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Work Capability Assessment</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr> is used to find out how much your health condition or disability affects your ability to work. It assesses what you can do, as well as what you can’t do.</p>

<p>You’ll be asked questions about how your condition affects you in your day to day life. It gives you the opportunity to explain if, and how, your health condition or disability may vary over time.</p>

<p>Once a referral to a <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr> has been made you will be sent a capability for work questionnaire. This is called a UC50. The information you provide on the questionnaire will be used to decide if you need to attend a face to face assessment.</p>

<p>A paper copy of the questionnaire will be posted to you. If you prefer you can fill out the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uc50-form-universal-credit-capability-for-work-questionnaire">Universal Credit capability for work questionnaire online</a> and print it out.</p>

<p>You will need to send the completed UC50 questionnaire to the Centre for Health and Disability Assessments by the date requested.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Completing the UC50 questionnaire</h2>

<p>If you need help completing the UC50 questionnaire, you could ask a friend, relative, carer or a support worker.</p>

<p>If you still need help or you have no one to support you then speak to someone at the Centre for Health and Disability Assessments who will be able to help you answer the questions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>After the <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The Centre for Health and Disability Assessments sends a report of the assessment to Universal Credit. A Decision Maker will use that report, along with any other relevant evidence, to decide if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are fit for work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have limited capability for work (<abbr title="Limited capability for work">LCW</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have limited capability for work and work related activity (<abbr title="Limited capability for work and work related activity">LCWRA</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Fit for work</h2>

<p>If you are assessed as being fit for work, you will need to agree to look for work that is suitable for your health condition, and be prepared to work to keep getting Universal Credit.</p>

<p>Your work coach will take into account your health condition or disability when considering what work related activities and availability for work is included in your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/your-responsibilities">Claimant Commitment</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Limited capability for work</h2>

<p>If it is decided you have limited capability for work (<abbr title="Limited capability for work">LCW</abbr>), you are not expected to look for work right away.</p>

<p>You will need to discuss with your work coach the activities you agree to do to prepare for work with the aim of working at some time in the future.</p>

<p>Your work coach will take into account your health condition or disability when considering what work preparation activities to include in your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/your-responsibilities">Claimant Commitment</a>.</p>

<p>Activities could include, for example, writing a CV and undertaking some training.</p>

<p>You will get paid an extra amount of Universal Credit called the <abbr title="Limited capability for work">LCW</abbr> component if all the following apply:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Limited capability for work and work related activity</h2>

<p>If it is decided you have limited capability for work and work related activity (<abbr title="Limited capability for work and work related activity">LCWRA</abbr>) you are not expected to look for work or to prepare for work, though you can volunteer.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/what-youll-get">additional amount</a> for having <abbr title="Limited capability for work and work related activity">LCWRA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Terminally ill</h2>

<p>When claiming Universal Credit you will be treated as being terminally ill if you have a progressive disease or a health condition and due to that condition you are not expected to live for more than 12 months.</p>

<p>If you have a terminal illness, you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not need to have a <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>do not have a claimant commitment</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/what-youll-get">get the additional amount</a> for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/health-conditions-disability-universal-credit">limited capability for work and work-related activity</a> (LWCRA)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you tell us you have a terminal illness when you claim Universal Credit you will be asked if you would like Universal Credit to call you. In the call, we will explain more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to make your claim</li>
  <li>what documents you need</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not have to have a call – you can choose to complete your claim online yourself.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span>Medical evidence to support your claim: forms SR1 and DS1500</h3>

<p>You might be asked to provide evidence from your doctor, specialist nurse or other medical professional. This can be either a DS1500 form or an SR1 form. These forms provide information about your condition and treatment.</p>

<p>The SR1 is for people who might not live for more than 12 months, and can only be used for Universal Credit and Employment Support Allowance.</p>

<p>The DS1500 is for people who might not live for more than 6 months, and can be used for other benefits as well as Universal Credit.</p>

<p>You only need to provide one of these forms. It’s likely that your doctor will send the form to DWP, but you or another representative can send it. The address is on the form.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Temporary period of sickness</h2>

<p>If you already have a claim to Universal Credit and you become unwell for a short period of time, you can be treated as having a temporary period of sickness.</p>

<p>Whilst you are treated as having a temporary period of sickness you do not have to complete the activities agreed in your Claimant Commitment.</p>

<p>A temporary period of sickness can last for up to 14 days. You must provide medical evidence from the 8th day of your sickness. In a rolling 12 month period you are permitted to have two temporary periods of sickness.</p>

<p>If you have more than 2 temporary periods of sickness, you will need to complete the activities agreed in your Claimant Commitment.</p>

<p>You may be referred for a Work Capability Assessment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Moving from Employment and Support Allowance to Universal Credit</h2>

<p>If you have been receiving Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>), have already completed a <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr> and been assessed whilst claiming <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, you may not have to undertake the assessment again when you move to Universal Credit.</p>

<p>If your Work Capability Assessment is due for a review, you will need to have another assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>Work Related Activity Component</h3>

<p>If you have already been assessed as having limited capability for work, you may not have to undertake the assessment again.</p>

<p>You will get paid an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/what-youll-get">extra amount of Universal Credit called the <abbr title="Limited capability for work">LCW</abbr> component</a> if you:</p>

<ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span>Support Component</h3>

<p>If you have already been assessed as having limited capability for work and work related activity you may not have to undertake the assessment again.</p>

<p>You will get paid an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/what-youll-get">extra amount of Universal Credit</a> called the <abbr title="Limited capability for work and work related activity">LCWRA</abbr> component, if you were in receipt of the Support Component in <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> immediately before your claim to Universal Credit and have no changes to your health condition.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Change of circumstances</h2>

<p>You must let Universal Credit know if:</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your condition has got worse</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have any other changes, such as finding a job or moving in with a partner</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t tell Universal Credit about these changes straight away you could be paid more or less money than you should. You may have to pay back any money you are overpaid.</p>

<p>You can report a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances">change of circumstances</a> by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sign-in-universal-credit">signing in to your Universal Credit account</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Working and Universal Credit</h2>

<p>If you start work or are already in employment your Universal Credit payment will reduce gradually as your earn more. For every £1 you earn your payment will reduce by 55p.</p>

<p>If you have a health condition or disability that affects your ability to work, you can earn a certain amount before your Universal Credit is reduced. This is called a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/how-your-earnings-affect-your-payments">work allowance</a>.</p>

<p>You may undertake <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/volunteering/when-you-can-volunteer">voluntary work</a> to develop skills and gain experience, particularly if you have been unemployed for some time and are looking to build confidence and your CV at the same time.</p>

<p>You must tell your work coach if you are volunteering or are planning to volunteer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span>Changes in your work place</h3>

<p>You may be able to get help from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work">Access to Work</a> if the help you need at work is not covered by your employer making reasonable adjustments.</p>

<p>An Access to Work grant can pay for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>special equipment, adaptations or support worker services to help you do things like answer the phone or go to meetings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>help getting to and from work</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Help with prescriptions and health care costs</h2>

<p>If you receive Universal Credit you may be entitled to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcosts/Pages/universal-credit.aspx" rel="external">free prescriptions and other health care costs</a>, such as dental care and sight tests.</p>

<p>You’re only entitled if your earnings during your last assessment period were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>£435 or less</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>£935 or less if your Universal Credit includes a payment for a child or limited capability for work</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The last assessment period means the assessment period that ended immediately before the date you claim free prescriptions or health care costs.</p>

<p>If you claim Universal Credit as a couple, the earnings limit applies to the joint income of you and your partner. Your earnings are shown on your statement as ‘Your total take-home pay for this period’.</p>

<p>If neither you nor your partner work then your earnings will be £0.00.</p>

<p>If you’re entitled to free prescriptions through Universal Credit, you must tick the income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance box on the back of your prescription.</p>

<p>A tick box for Universal Credit will be added to the form soon.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Other financial support</h2>

<p>If you receive Universal Credit you may also be able to get:</p>

<ul>
