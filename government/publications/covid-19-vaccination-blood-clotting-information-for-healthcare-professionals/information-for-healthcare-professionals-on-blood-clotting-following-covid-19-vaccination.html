<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>The condition that has been reported following COVID-19 vaccination</h2>

<p>Since March 2021, there have been reports from the UK and internationally of an extremely rare condition characterised by thromboembolic events (blood clots) accompanied by thrombocytopenia (low platelets) following the first dose of the AstraZeneca (<abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>) COVID-19 vaccination. This includes cerebral venous sinus thromboses (<abbr title="cerebral venous sinus thromboses">CVST</abbr>) where blood clots develop in the cerebral veins occurring together with low platelet counts. These cases are particularly unusual because despite low platelets, there is progressive thrombosis (formation of blood clots which block blood vessels).</p>

<p>The cases of venous thromboses that have been reported include <abbr title="cerebral venous sinus thromboses">CVST</abbr> and portal vein thrombosis, as well as the more usual presentations of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.</p>

<p>Whilst the cases reported to date have primarily been venous clots, arterial clots have also been reported.</p>

<p>Typical laboratory features include a low platelet count, very raised D Dimer levels – above the level expected for venous thromboembolism (<abbr title="venous thromboembolism">VTE</abbr>) and inappropriately low fibrinogen. Antibodies to platelet factor 4 (<abbr title="platelet factor 4">PF4</abbr>) have been identified and so this has similarities to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (<abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopenia">HIT</abbr>), but it is occurring without the patient receiving any heparin treatment.</p>

<p>Up to the 11 August, 412 suspected cases have been reported across the UK through the Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) Yellow Card scheme following <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccination and 43 suspected cases were after the second dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. Whilst investigation remains ongoing for some cases, it is important to note that the overwhelming majority of cases reported after the second dose have not been confirmed and remain dramatically lower than after the first dose and there is therefore no evidence of an association of this syndrome with the second dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. The <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advises that those who have received their first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should continue to be offered the second dose, unless they have developed this specific syndrome of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following the first dose or if the vaccine is otherwise contraindicated.</p>

<p>For the latest information please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions">weekly summary from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Further information on the investigation and treatment of suspected cases has been published by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://b-s-h.org.uk/about-us/news/guidance-produced-by-the-expert-haematology-panel-ehp-focussed-on-vaccine-induced-thrombosis-and-thrombocytopenia-vitt/" rel="external">Expert Haematology Panel of the British Society of Haematology</a>.</p>

<p>A recent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109908" rel="external">study</a> provides further information on the clinical features and prognostic criteria of this syndrome.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Risk factors for developing this condition</h2>

<p>This condition is known to occur naturally although the underlying risk factors have not yet been fully established. A detailed review of suspected cases of this condition following COVID-19 vaccination is ongoing by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, supported by the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) and other professional groups. This will help us to understand the risk factors for developing this condition. The data reported in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> weekly report</a> up to 4 August 2021 estimates an overall incidence of around 14.9 per million after first or unknown doses of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine administered in the UK, there is no indication of an increased risk of these events after the second dose.</p>

<p>This data is regularly updated based on the reports received through the Yellow Card reporting scheme. For the latest information please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting">weekly summary from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></a>.  Although cases have been reported in all ages and genders, there appears to be a trend for increasing incidence with decreasing age amongst adults, with the highest incidence reported in the younger adult age groups.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Is this condition only associated with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine?</h2>

<p>All suspected cases following vaccination with any of the COVID-19 vaccines being used in the UK are undergoing a detailed review by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. Up to 4 August 2021, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> received 412 reports of thrombosis events with low platelets of which 147 were <abbr title="cerebral venous sinus thromboses">CVST</abbr> following vaccination with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. This is out of a total of 24.8 million first doses and 23.9 million second doses of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine given by that date in the UK. For the latest information please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting">weekly summary from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>There has also been a small number of reports of a similar syndrome following receipt of the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (also an adenovirus vector vaccine, although using a different vector) in the US. Following a detailed investigation and temporary pause in the use of the vaccine in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<abbr title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">CDC</abbr>) and Food and Drug Administration (<abbr title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr>) announced the resumption of the use of the vaccine for all age groups on 23 April 2021. There is currently no evidence to suggest these rare events occur following administration of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines which are available in the UK.</p>

<p>Up to 11 August, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> received 15 reports of thrombosis events with low platelets following vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. This is out of a total of 20.46 million first doses and 13.8 million second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Reassuringly, as these numbers are so small, there is no signal of this syndrome with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. There were 2 reports of this syndrome following vaccination with the Moderna vaccine.</p>

<p>Although these extremely rare events have been associated with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine and Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccines, further investigations are underway to understand the biological mechanisms and whether the association is related to the vaccine platform (the way in which the vaccine delivers antigen) or some other immunological mechanism.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Number of people who have developed the condition</h2>

<p>This condition is known to occur naturally and is thought to be extremely rare. The background rate of <abbr title="cerebral venous sinus thromboses">CVSTs</abbr> is estimated to be around 5 to 16 per million annually, although there is currently limited data on the background rate of <abbr title="cerebral venous sinus thromboses">CVSTs</abbr> occurring with thrombocytopenia.</p>

<p>Based on reports to 11 August 2021, the overall incidence following the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine is around 14.9 per million first or unknown doses and 1.8 per million second doses administered. For the latest information please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting">weekly summary from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that thromboses (blood clots) have been reported with natural COVID-19 infection and more than a fifth of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 have evidence of blood clots. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00341-2/fulltext" rel="external">study based on analysis of US data</a> showed that <abbr title="cerebral venous sinus thromboses">CVST</abbr> was a complication of COVID-19 infection, with a higher incidence (42.8 per million) compared to a matched cohort of patients with influenza (RR=2.67, 95% CI 1.04–6.81, P=0.031) and people who had received an <abbr title="messenger ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> vaccine (RR=6.33, 95% CI 1.87–21.40, P=0.00014).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Number of those affected who die</h2>

<p>A detailed review of all suspected cases is ongoing and based on the reports received by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> as of 11 August, there were 73 fatal cases from the 411 events reviewed with an estimated overall case fatality rate of 18%. This compares with the clear demonstrable benefits from the COVID-19 vaccination programme. For the latest information please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting">weekly summary from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>From 4 January to 4 August, 24.8 million first doses and 23.9 million second doses of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine were administered across the UK. It has been estimated that the vaccine programme has prevented between 81,300 and 87,800 deaths up to 6 August with vaccine effectiveness of a single dose against hospitalisation estimated at 80% for both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccines.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>UK’s current advice on the use of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine</h2>

<p>Based on a review of cases reported to the Yellow Card scheme and the evidence of effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines used in the UK to prevent serious complications and deaths from COVID-19 infection, the current <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> advice remains that the overall benefits of the use of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine in the UK programme outweighs the extremely rare adverse events reported to date.</p>

<p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) has carefully assessed the overall risk benefit of the use of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine in the UK population and continues to keep this under active review. After considering the relative balance of benefits (in terms of deaths, <abbr title="intensive care unit">ICU</abbr> and hospital admissions averted estimated by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) and risks (based on data presented by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> on reported adverse events through the Yellow Card Scheme), on 7 April 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-the-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-jcvi-statement"><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advised</a> that, for adults aged under 30 without underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease, there should be a preference for an alternative to the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, if available.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has continued to review cases of these extremely rare adverse events, including those reported retrospectively, and data on the frequency of these events by age is now more precise. The available data continues to suggest a trend of increasing incidence of this condition with decreasing age amongst adults, with the highest incidence reported in the younger adult age groups. In contrast, the risks of serious disease associated with COVID-19 increases steeply with age, with the younger adults at the lowest risk of serious disease.</p>

<p>Amongst those healthy adults targeted in Phase 2 (those under 50 years), there continues to be an age-related risk of severe complications from COVID-19. For example, the risk of dying in an individual aged 40 to 49 years is 3 times higher than someone aged 30 to 39 years and 12 times higher than someone aged 20 to 29 years.</p>

<p><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has continued to review the available data on the current epidemiology, benefit-risk profile by age, modelling predictions on future disease trends and the current forecast on vaccine supply. Given the risk (albeit extremely rare) of these adverse events associated with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, the current control of COVID-19 in the UK, model predictions of the potential scale and timing of a future wave, and promising forecasts for the availability of vaccines in the UK, <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has issued <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-the-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-jcvi-statement-7-may-2021">updated advice on 7 May 2021</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in addition to those aged under 30, unvaccinated adults aged 30 to 39 years who are not in a clinical priority group at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease, should be preferentially offered an alternative to the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, where possible and only where no substantial delay or barrier in access to vaccination would arise</li>
  <li>for those within this age group who are of older age, male, obese (BMI above 30), from certain ethnic minority backgrounds or experiencing socio-economic deprivation, the risks of acquiring or suffering complications of COVID-19 are higher. Every effort should be made to remove barriers to accessing vaccination in those individuals. These individuals can choose to have the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine if they have been provided with information on the risks and benefits of the vaccine</li>
  <li>for those aged 18 to 29 years the precautionary advice for a vaccine preference is stronger, reflecting a gradient in the benefit-risk balance with age</li>
</ul>

<p>This new advice is specific to the current UK context and is based on all of the following remaining favourable: the current low incidence of disease, the availability of alternatives to the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, and the strength of the whole vaccine programme in terms of maintaining speed and uptake. Should there be a deterioration in any of the above factors, <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advises that vaccination of adults aged 30 to 39 years with any of the UK authorised vaccines is always better than no vaccination, except where there are specific contraindications.</p>

<p>Healthy adults aged 40 to 50 years who are offered a vaccine as part of Phase 2 of the programme are recommended to receive any of the available COVID-19 vaccines. Those who have received their first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine without suffering this rare side effect, should continue to be offered the second dose to complete the course (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">COVID-19 green book chapter</a> for further information).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should also continue to be offered to those in Phase 1 (which includes older adults, those with underlying conditions, health and social care workers over 40 years old) who have not yet been offered the vaccine. Those who have received their first dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine without suffering this rare side effect, should continue to be offered the second dose to complete the course. This includes individuals aged 18 to 39 years who have received their first dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine as part of the Phase 1 programme such as health and social care workers, unpaid carers and family members of those who are immunosuppressed.</p>

<p>Due to its storage and transport requirements, the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine is much more easily delivered in some settings, and in these settings may be the only vaccine that is practical to offer. In such circumstances <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advises that the benefits of receiving the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine outweigh the risks, and individuals in this event should be offered the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> considers that there continue to be no safety concerns for this extremely rare adverse event following receipt of a second dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. All those who have received a first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should continue to be offered a second dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, irrespective of age. The second dose will be important for longer lasting protection against COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Can COVID-19 infection cause the same problem?</h2>

<p>Thrombotic events are known to occur in individuals with natural COVID-19 infection and more than a fifth of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 have evidence of blood clots.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00341-2/fulltext" rel="external">study based on analysis of US data</a> showed that <abbr title="cerebral venous sinus thromboses">CVST</abbr> was a complication of COVID-19 infection, with a higher incidence (42.8 per million) compared to a matched cohort of patients with influenza (RR=RR=2.67, 95% CI 1.04–6.81, P=0.031) and people who had received an <abbr title="messenger ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> vaccine (RR=6.33, 95% CI 1.87–21.40, P=0.00014). However, this particular combination of thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia is extremely rare and not known to be a common feature of COVID-19 infection. Based on cases reported to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> as of 4 August 2021, the overall incidence following the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine is estimated at 14.9 per million first or unknown doses and 1.8 per million second doses administered. For the latest information please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting">weekly summary from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Has this condition been reported after both the first and second dose of COVID-19 vaccine?</h2>

<p>As of 11 August 2021, of the 412 suspected cases reported to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> following the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, 43 suspected cases have been reported after the second dose. The <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> concluded that there continues to be no safety concerns following the second dose of vaccine. As the number of second doses administered has increased, the much lower rate of reported cases after the second dose is reassuring, particularly for younger recipients where the incidence is significantly lower after the second dose compared to the first. Overall, there is no evidence of an increased risk after the second dose in any group.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advises that those who have received their first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should continue to be offered the second dose unless they have developed this specific syndrome of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following the first dose or have had an anaphylactic reaction. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">COVID-19 green book chapter</a> has further information on contraindications to COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Is it affecting both men and women?</h2>

<p>Suspected cases have been reported in patients of all ages in men and women. Whilst reports from some countries have suggested a substantially higher number of cases amongst females, based on the events reported to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> in the UK, such a distinctive gender difference has not been observed. Although the reported incidence rate is higher in females compared to men, this is not seen across all age groups and the difference remains small. It is worth noting that more females were vaccinated early on in the programme, which may partly explain the slight excess of cases reported amongst females.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Is it affecting any particular community?</h2>

<p>Suspected cases have been reported in patients of all ages and genders and currently, no specific predisposing factors have been identified.  There appears to be a trend of increasing incidence of this condition with decreasing age amongst adults, with the highest incidence reported in the younger adult age groups.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Signs and symptoms</h2>

<p>While the detailed case review is ongoing, it is important to ensure all health professionals are alert to relevant symptoms which require further clinical review and investigation. Advise patients to seek urgent medical advice if they experience any of the following symptoms more than 4 days and within 28 days of coronavirus vaccination:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new onset of severe headache, which is getting worse and does not respond to simple painkillers</li>
  <li>an unusual headache which seems worse when lying down or bending over, or may be accompanied by blurred vision, nausea and vomiting, difficulty with speech, weakness, drowsiness or seizures</li>
  <li>new unexplained pinprick bruising or bleeding</li>
  <li>shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal pain</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have clinical concerns, patients should be urgently referred to hospital and to appropriate specialist services for further assessment, particularly if the symptoms are unexplained and present in combination with thrombocytopaenia. Further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://b-s-h.org.uk/about-us/news/guidance-produced-by-the-expert-haematology-panel-ehp-focussed-on-vaccine-induced-thrombosis-and-thrombocytopenia-vitt/" rel="external">guidance for secondary care</a> is available with specific guidance produced for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcem.ac.uk/docs/Policy/Vaccine%20pathway%20concerns%20-%20RCEM.SAM.RCP%20guidance.pdf" rel="external">Emergency Departments and Acute Medical Units</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://elearning.rcgp.org.uk/pluginfile.php/166267/mod_resource/content/7/Suspected%20thromboembolism%20after%20AZ_August%202021.pdf" rel="external">primary care</a>.</p>

<p>Mild flu-like symptoms, including headache, chills and fever remain one of the most common side effects of any COVID-19 vaccine. These generally appear within a few hours and resolve within a day or two.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>What you should do if you suspect a case</h2>

<p>If you have clinical concerns, patients should be urgently referred to hospital and to appropriate specialist services for further assessment, particularly if the symptoms are unexplained and present in combination with thrombocytopaenia.

<p>It is very important that all suspected cases are reported to both the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> on the COVID-19 Yellow Card scheme</a> and to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cutt.ly/haem_AE" rel="external"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s clinical reporting scheme</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> clinical reporting scheme collects patient identifiable information with details of the clinical presentation, dates of vaccination, vaccine product received and any underlying conditions.  In order to minimise burden on reporters, for cases reported on the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> clinical reporting scheme first, the last page of the survey allows all the inputted answers to be copied, and relevant information can then be directly pasted into the COVID-19 Yellow Card form.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Contraindications or cautions to receiving the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine</h2>

<p>The contraindications to vaccination with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine include individuals who have a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis (<abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis">HITT</abbr> or <abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopenia">HIT</abbr> type 2).  These individuals may be offered vaccination with an alternative COVID-19 vaccine. A history of thromboses on its own is not a contraindication to the vaccine.</p>

<p>Individuals who experience thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should be properly assessed and if they are considered to have the reported condition, vaccination should be delayed until their clotting has completely stabilised and they should be considered for a second dose of an alternative COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that those with a prior history of thrombosis or known risk factors for thrombosis, including antiphospholipid syndrome, are more at risk of developing this immune-mediated condition of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopaenia after the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">COVID-19 green book chapter</a> has further information on contraindications and cautions to receiving the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>Individuals aged 40 years or older with past clotting episodes and those diagnosed with thrombophilia, whether or not they are on long term anti-coagulation, remain at risk of COVID-19 disease and should be vaccinated with any of the available vaccines (provided they are not otherwise contraindicated). The same consideration applies to those who experience common clotting episodes, without concomitant thrombocytopaenia, after the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://b-s-h.org.uk/media/19537/letter-to-mhra-from-expert-haematology-group-endorsed-by-thrombosis-uk-1300-8th-april-2021.pdf" rel="external">Expert Haematology Panel</a> advises that there is no evidence that individuals with a prior history of thrombosis or known risk factors for thrombosis are more at risk of developing the immune complication reported after the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. Furthermore, for the majority of individuals, the risk of recurrent thrombosis due to COVID-19 infection is far greater than the risk of this syndrome.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Should people have their second dose?</h2>

<p>Yes, because of the high risk of complications and death from COVID-19, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency have concluded that the balance is very much in favour of vaccination.  Overall, there is no evidence of an increased risk after the second dose in any age group. There are no known risk factors for this extremely rare condition, which appears to be an idiosyncratic reaction on first exposure to the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-the-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-jcvi-statement"><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advises</a> that those who have received their first dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine without suffering this rare side effect should continue to be offered the second dose to complete the course.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Can patients receive the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine if they have previously had a blood clot?</h2>

<p>Importantly, a history of thromboses on its own is not a contraindication to the vaccine and individuals should be reassured that they can still receive the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine when offered.</p>

<p>The contraindications to vaccination with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine include individuals who have a history of heparin- induced thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis (<abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis">HITT</abbr> or <abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopenia">HIT</abbr> type 2).  These individuals may be offered vaccination with an alternative COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>Individuals who experience thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should be properly assessed and if they are considered to have the reported condition, vaccination should be delayed until their clotting has completely stabilised and they should be considered for a second dose of an alternative COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>Individuals over 40 years or older with past clotting episodes and those diagnosed with thrombophilia, whether or not they are on long term anti-coagulation, remain at risk of COVID-19 disease and should be vaccinated with any of the available vaccines (provided they are not otherwise contraindicated). The same consideration applies to those who experience common clotting episodes, without concomitant thrombocytopaenia, after the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.</p>

Furthermore, for the majority of individuals, the risk of recurrent thrombosis due to COVID-19 infection is far greater than the risk of this syndrome.</p>

<p>If a patient has a history of, for example, a deep venous thrombosis (<abbr title="deep venous thrombosis">DVT</abbr>) or pulmonary embolus (<abbr title="pulmonary embolus">PE</abbr>) without concurrent thrombocytopenia, then they can receive the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. Likewise, if they have had an arterial thrombosis, for example myocardial infarction without thrombocytopenia, then they can receive the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>Many patients who have had a history of blood clots may be concerned as to whether they also had low platelets at the same time. This is likely to have been communicated at the time of diagnosis of the blood clot and be recorded in the patient’s medical records. In the absence of this being recorded in the patient’s medical records, such individuals can be offered the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>A revision to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">COVID-19 green book chapter</a> is available with updated information on cautions and contraindications for the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Can patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have the vaccine?</h2>

<p>Antiphospholipid syndrome increases the risk of thrombosis but there is no evidence that individuals with a prior history of thrombosis or known risk factors for thrombosis are more at risk of developing the immune complication reported after the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. If an individual with antiphospholipid syndrome is aged 40 years or older and has no contraindications to the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, then they can receive the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>This information is consistent with the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>’s advice. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s current advice is that the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should be considered in individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome when the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risk for that individual. The <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has reviewed the evidence on risks and benefits and has provided advice to the UK population on who should continue to be offered the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine and this is the advice, as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">COVID-19 green book chapter</a>, that should be followed for vaccination decisions.</p>

<p>For the majority of individuals, the risk of recurrent thrombosis due to COVID-19 infection is far greater than the risk of this syndrome following vaccination with <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>. Individuals who experience a clotting episode with concomitant thrombocytopenia following the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should be properly assessed. If they are considered to have the reported condition, further vaccination should be deferred until their clotting has completely stabilised and should then be boosted with an alternative product. The contraindications to vaccination with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine include individuals who have a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis (<abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis">HITT</abbr> or <abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopenia">HIT</abbr> type 2). These individuals may be offered vaccination with an alternative COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Can patients receive the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine if they have been or are currently thrombocytopenic?</h2>

<p>Thrombocytopaenia on its own is not a contraindication to receiving the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>The contraindications to vaccination with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine include individuals who have a history of heparin- induced thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis (<abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis">HITT</abbr> or <abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopenia">HIT</abbr> type 2).  These individuals may be offered vaccination with an alternative COVID-19 vaccine. Individuals who experience thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should be properly assessed and if they are considered to have the reported condition, vaccination should be delayed until their clotting has completely stabilised and they should be considered for a second dose of an alternative COVID-19 vaccine.

<p>Individuals with bleeding disorders can still be vaccinated and further information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">COVID-19 green book chapter</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>If someone has had a cerebral or major blood clot with low levels of platelets following the first dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine</h2>

<p>Individuals who experience thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should be properly assessed and if they are considered to have the reported condition, vaccination should be delayed until their clotting has completely stabilised and they should be considered for a second dose of an alternative COVID-19 vaccine (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">COVID-19 green book chapter</a>).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span>Can patients still have a second dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine if they had a blood clot after the first dose?</h2>

<p>Importantly, a history of thromboses on its own (without thrombocytopaenia) following the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine is not a contraindication to receiving their second dose and individuals should be reassured that they can still receive the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine when offered.</p>

<p>The contraindications to vaccination with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine include individuals who have a history of heparin- induced thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis (<abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis">HITT</abbr> or <abbr title="heparin-induced thrombocytopenia">HIT</abbr> type 2).  These individuals may be offered vaccination with an alternative COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>A history of thromboses on its own is not a contraindication to the vaccine. Individuals who experience thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should be properly assessed and if they are considered to have the reported condition, vaccination should be delayed until their clotting has completely stabilised and they should be considered for a second dose of an alternative COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that those with a prior history of thrombosis or known risk factors for thrombosis, including antiphospholipid syndrome, are more at risk of developing this immune-mediated condition of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopaenia after the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.

If they are considered to have the reported condition, further vaccination should be deferred until their clotting has completely stabilised and should then be boosted with an alternative product.</p>

<p>In the UK about 1 in 1,000 people are affected by venous thrombosis each year. This compares with reports up to 19 May to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of 332 thrombosis events with low platelets out of a total of 24.2 million first doses of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine given by that date. Therefore, by chance, a lot of people will have blood clots after vaccination which are not due to this syndrome.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21. </span>If somebody under 40 years has had <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> for their first dose – should they have the second?</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should continue to be offered to those in Phase 1 who have not yet been offered the vaccine. This includes older adults, those with underlying conditions, health and social care workers 40 years or older. There are currently no known risk factors for this extremely rare condition, which appears to be an idiosyncratic reaction on first exposure to the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>Those who have received their first dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine and have not suffered this rare side effect should continue to be offered the second dose to complete the course.</p>

<p>Individuals aged 18 to 39 years who have received their first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, without suffering this rare side effect, should complete their course with the same vaccine. This will include those who are eligible as part of the Phase 1 programme, for example health and social care workers, and this includes unpaid carers and family members of those who are immunosuppressed.</p>

<p>Whilst there is some evidence on the interchangeability of the COVID-19 vaccines and further studies are underway, it is recommended that individuals complete their initial COVID-19 vaccine course (doses 1 and 2) with the same vaccine, unless they have suffered this very rare side-effect. Data from 2 studies, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01115-6/fulltext#section-7c530872-6235-4433-899c-b3f276970189" rel="external">one of 463 participants randomly assigned to different vaccine schedules</a> and another of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.28.2100634#html_fulltext" rel="external">real word data of 1,313 participants</a>, suggests that individuals receiving mixed schedules (a dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> followed by a dose of Pfizer/BioNTech or vice versa) have higher rates of reactions. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine which vaccine the individual received and to complete with the same vaccine.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">22. </span>Should patients have a second dose of a different vaccine other than the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine?</h2>

<p>Individuals who experience thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine should be properly assessed and if they are considered to have the reported condition, vaccination should be delayed until their clotting has completely stabilised and they should be considered for a second dose of an alternative COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>There are currently no safety concerns following receipt of the second dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. This extremely rare condition appears to be an idiosyncratic reaction on first exposure to the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine and there are no known risk factors for it. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-the-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-jcvi-statement"><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advises</a> that those who have received their first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine without suffering this rare side effect should continue to be offered the second dose to complete the course.

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01115-6/fulltext" rel="external">Preliminary data from a study</a> of 463 people aged 50 to 69 years in evaluating the interchangeability of COVID-19 vaccines suggests that a mixed schedule appears to lead to more systemic side effects after the second dose, such as fever and muscle aches. More individuals who received the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine for the first dose and Pfizer/BioNTech for the second dose reported fever compared to those who received the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine for both doses (difference 24%, 95% CI 13 to 35%). A similar pattern was seen for those individuals who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for the first dose and <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> for the second dose compared to those who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for both doses (difference 21%, 95% CI 8 to 33%).</p>

<p>Real world data from a study of 1,313 individuals, demonstrated that those who received mixed schedules had higher rates of reactions and sought medical attention more than those who had the same vaccine for both doses. In those individuals previously uninfected, the reaction rates for those receiving <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> then Pfizer/BioNTech were 54.4% (95% CI: 49.4 to 59.5%) and Pfizer/BioNTech then <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> were 55.2% (95% CI: 46.1 to 64.1%). Whilst those receiving <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> and <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> had reaction rates of 33.5% (95% CI: 28.0 to 39.2%) and for those receiving 2 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech, the reaction rates were 33.3% (95% CI: 23.4 to 44.5%). Similar results were seen in those who had previously been infected with COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">23. </span>Will taking aspirin before vaccination with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine reduce the clotting risk?</h2>

<p>It is not recommended to take aspirin before vaccination with <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>, unless this is already part of your patient’s regular medications.</p>

<p>Investigations are underway to understand the biological mechanisms behind this extremely rare condition of thromboembolic events with thrombocytopenia and whether the association is related to the vaccine platform (the way in which the vaccine delivers antigen) or some other immunological mechanism. Whilst aspirin may be used to reduce clotting risk in other conditions, it is not currently thought to have the same effect in this condition and may in fact worsen the outcome by increasing the risk of bleeding. Therefore no one should self-medicate with aspirin to cover the period around and after the vaccination.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">24. </span>How to communicate the potential benefits and risks of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine to patients</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/covid-19-vaccination-and-blood-clotting">Resources</a>, such as patient information leaflets, have been produced which explain the benefits and risks of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccination by different age bands. Older age groups, such as those aged 50 or older or with underlying medical problems, have a higher risk of hospitalisation, intensive care admission or death from COVID-19 infection than younger age groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for those aged 50 and older or with underlying medical problems, the risk of this extremely rare side effect is around 1 in every 100,000 first doses and the benefit of 1 dose of the vaccine is an 80% reduction in deaths, hospitalisation and intensive care admission</li>
  <li>for people aged 40 to 49, the risk of this extremely rare side effect is around 1 in every 100,000 first doses and the benefit of 1 dose of the vaccine is a 60 to 70% reduction in catching and passing on the infection</li>
  <li>for people aged 18 to 39, the risk of this extremely rare side effect is around 1 in every 50,000 first doses and the benefit of 1 dose of the vaccine is a 60 to 70% reduction in catching and passing on the infection</li>
</ul>

<p>Someone who is vaccinated will continue to accrue benefits from vaccination over their lifetime from being protected against COVID-19, whilst the risk from vaccination occurs only in the few weeks after vaccination.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">25. </span>If a patient refuses the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine</h2>

<p>To make an informed decision it is important that all individuals are provided with the relevant information, including the benefits and risks, and that they have the opportunity to discuss this with their healthcare provider if they wish. If the patient is under 40 years, an alternative vaccine is available, but they may need to go to a different vaccination site. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/covid-19-vaccination-and-blood-clotting">Resources</a>, including patient leaflets, are available to support decision making.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">26. </span>If a patient under 40 years old wants to have the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine</h2>

<p>Patients under 40 who decide to go ahead after they have considered all the risks and benefits can be vaccinated with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. You should document that you have had a full conversation with the patient and that you have provided them with sufficient information for them to give informed consent to vaccination. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/covid-19-vaccination-and-blood-clotting">Resources</a>, including patient leaflets, are available to support decision making.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">27. </span>Can patients taking the combined oral contraceptive pill have the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine?</h2>

<p>Yes, patients taking the combined oral contraceptive pill can have the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, if they do not have any of the contraindications or cautions to its use (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">COVID-19 green book chapter</a> for further information).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has concluded that for adults under 40 years of age who are not in a clinical risk group, it is preferable to offer an alternative to the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-the-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-jcvi-statement-7-may-2021">if available</a>. Healthy adults aged 40 to 50 years are recommended to receive any of the available COVID-19 vaccines. Those who have received their first dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine without suffering this rare side effect should continue to be offered the second dose to complete the course.</p>

<p>Patients who are taking the combined oral contraceptive pill may be concerned that they have an increased risk of thrombosis and should not have the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://b-s-h.org.uk/media/19537/letter-to-mhra-from-expert-haematology-group-endorsed-by-thrombosis-uk-1300-8th-april-2021.pdf" rel="external">Expert Haematology Panel advises</a> that there is no evidence that individuals with a prior history of thrombosis or known risk factors for thrombosis are more at risk of developing the immune complication reported after the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine.

<span class="number">30. </span>Risk of relapse of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia symptoms following subsequent doses of COVID-19 vaccinations</h2>

<p>Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (<abbr title="Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome">TTS</abbr>) is a rare condition and may have a range of different underlying causes including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M22-0118?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org" rel="external">following COVID-19 vaccination</a>. The specific subset of <abbr title="Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome">TTS</abbr>, known as Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (<abbr title="Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia">VITT</abbr>) refers to the extremely rare condition which occurs following the first dose of an adeno virus vectored COVID-19 vaccination (<abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> and Johnson &amp; Johnson) with detection of anti-<abbr title="platelet factor 4">PF4</abbr> antibodies.  The risk of relapse following subsequent doses of COVID-19 vaccination is very low.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2118507" rel="external">study</a> followed up to 40 patients with confirmed, probable or possible <abbr title="Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia">VITT</abbr> after their first dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccination and who received a second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Of these patients, 33 had Pfizer/BioNTech as their second vaccine dose, one had Moderna and 5 had <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>. None of the patients had a relapse of <abbr title="Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia">VITT</abbr> symptoms or a severe adverse reaction.  The numbers of patients followed up in this study is small, but the results are consistent with other evidence that shows that the anti-<abbr title="platelet factor 4">PF4</abbr> antibodies are independent of the spike antibody response and that rarely is <abbr title="Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome">TTS</abbr> associated with vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna.</p>

<p>Based on the current evidence, patients with <abbr title="Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia">VITT</abbr> are advised to complete their course of COVID-19 vaccinations. This should be done with an <abbr title="messenger ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech), after their clotting has stabilised and at least 12 weeks after the implicated dose (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">Green book</a> for further information).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">31. </span>Risk of new <abbr title="Immune thrombocytopenic purpura">ITP</abbr> or relapse of <abbr title="Immune thrombocytopenic purpura">ITP</abbr> following COVID-19 vaccination</h2>
<p>Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (<abbr title="Immune thrombocytopenic purpura">ITP</abbr>) is when the immune system destroys platelets. Individuals with low platelets without blood clots have been reported rarely following COVID-19 vaccination with <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>. Some of these cases have occurred in individuals with a history of <abbr title="Immune thrombocytopenic purpura">ITP</abbr>. A history of <abbr title="Immune thrombocytopenic purpura">ITP</abbr> is not a contraindication to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">Green book</a> for further information).</p>

<p>Guidance has been produced by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://b-s-h.org.uk/media/20724/vaccine-guidance-from-the-uk-itp-forum-working-party-on-itp-version-2-2.docx" rel="external"><abbr title="Immune thrombocytopenic purpura">ITP</abbr> working group at the British Society for Haematology</a>. In individuals who develop <abbr title="Immune thrombocytopenic purpura">ITP</abbr> or have a relapse following COVID-19 vaccination, the balance of risks and benefits is in favour of receiving further COVID-19 vaccine doses. There should be an individual risk assessment. Patient discussion with their haematologist and platelet count monitoring is recommended between days 2 to 5 following COVID-19 vaccination.
