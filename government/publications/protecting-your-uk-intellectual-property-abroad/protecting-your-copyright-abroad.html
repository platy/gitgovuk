<h2>International Law</h2>

<p>Usually, protection of your copyright work abroad will be automatic in the same way UK protection works.</p>

<p>The UK is a member of several international conventions in the field of copyright:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works</li>
  <li>Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations</li>
  <li>World Intellectual Property Organisation (<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organisation">WIPO</abbr>) Performances and Phonograms Treaty (<abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organisation">WIPO</abbr> Copyright Treaty (<abbr title="WIPO Copyright Treaty">WCT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (<abbr title="Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights">TRIPS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Copyright material created by UK nationals or residents and falling within the scope of one of these conventions is automatically protected in each member country of the convention by the national law of that country.</p>

<p>Most countries belong to at least the Berne Convention and/or <abbr title="Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights">TRIPS</abbr> which is a World Trade Organisation (<abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr>) agreement. The <abbr title="Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights">TRIPS</abbr> Agreement obliges <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr> members to comply with the Berne Convention (although some least developed countries have until 2021 to bring this into effect).</p>

<p>The Rome Convention and the <abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr> provide some protection for performers, producers of sound recordings and broadcasters, while the <abbr title="WIPO Copyright Treaty">WCT</abbr> enhances certain protection provided by the Berne Convention. The number of countries that are members of these conventions is more limited than Berne/<abbr title="Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights">TRIPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>A list of countries that belong to the different conventions is available from the World Intellectual Property Organisation (<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organisation">WIPO</abbr>) and the <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr> (for <abbr title="Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights">TRIPS</abbr>). Most countries (including all European states) belong to the Berne Convention and/or <abbr title="Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights">TRIPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Berne Convention provides that works will receive automatic protection without formality. However, you may choose to mark your work with the international © symbol, followed by the name of the copyright owner and year in which the work was created. In some countries (such as the USA), there is an official register of copyright which you might want to use, although registration is not an essential condition for copyright to subsist in any Berne/<abbr title="Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights">TRIPS</abbr> member country.</p>
