<h2>What is an <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary?</h2>

<p>In the 2022 to 2023 academic year, we are making available a package of support to help further education (<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>) providers attract high-quality individuals into the teaching profession in the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> sector in certain defined subject areas. This package includes <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> initial teacher education (<abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr>) bursaries to support pre-service training of teachers in priority areas. This funding manual sets out the scope, eligibility criteria and application process for the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursaries offer. These bursaries  are for teaching in the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> sector only, and are distinct from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-bursary-funding-manual/initial-teacher-training-bursaries-funding-manual-2022-to-2023-academic-year">school teacher training bursaries</a> also available.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this funding manual, pre-service training is defined as training that is undertaken prior to employment in the given specialty (in this context, as a teacher).</p>

<p>From the 2022 to 2023 academic year, in-service grants (supporting the recruitment and training of English, maths and special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>) teachers, previously offered alongside pre-service bursaries) have been made available as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/taking-teaching-further-programme#:~:text=Taking%20Teaching%20Further%20(%20TTF%20)%20is,work%20at%20the%20FE%20provider">Taking Teaching Further</a> programme.</p>

<p>The bursaries, available for the 2022 to 2023 academic year, are awarded to trainees based on their relevant qualifications or professional experience, and their intention to teach a designated priority subject in the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> sector. The bursary amount varies according to the subject in which they train to teach.</p>

<p>Bursary awards are fixed for the duration of the trainee’s <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programme and are for <a class="govuk-link" href="#qualifyingITEcourses">qualifying <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> courses</a> starting in or after September 2022, and finishing no later than August 2023 (for full-time courses) or August 2024 (for part-time courses). Awards will be made from a finite funding pot on a first-come-first-served basis, as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#allocations">bursary allocations</a>. English bursary awards will be capped at 100 places in the 2022 to 2023 academic year, allowing for more of a focus on <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (<abbr title="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">STEM</abbr>) subjects.</p>

<h2>COVID-19: teaching expectation</h2>
<p><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> trainees are considered to be in the critical worker pipeline along with other key higher education students. Department advice for <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> providers is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-further-education-provision">Actions for <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> colleges and providers during the coronavirus pandemic</a>. Our current advice confirms that a full curriculum should continue to be made available to trainees, including 100 hours of teaching practice and relevant observations, with the intention of completing their qualification on time. We continue to fully support the Education and Training Foundation’s ‘Additional guidance for qualifications in education and training’ which was updated on 29 January 2021: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.feadvice.org.uk/file/etf-ite-qualification-mitigations-guidance-2-oct-20-updated-29-jan-21pdf" rel="external">ETF <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> Qualification mitigations guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Funding will not be provided for any subjects that are not included in this list.</p>

<p>You must not make assumptions about the continuation, value or scope of <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary awards in future years based on the information provided in this guidance.</p>

<p>We will publish information regarding the availability of any future training bursaries (beyond the 2022 to 2023 academic year) at the appropriate time.</p>

<h2>Bursary eligibility</h2>
<p>For a trainee to be eligible to receive a bursary, you must make sure that the trainee meets the criteria set out here. These points should be read in conjunction with the corresponding sections of this manual, which give further guidance.</p>

<p>To be eligible, a trainee must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be eligible to receive student support</li>
  <li>have achieved a standard equivalent to GCSE grade 4 (C) or above in English and mathematics, and at least a level 3 qualification in their subject of training (or have appropriate professional experience)</li>
  <li>be taking a qualifying pre-service <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> course in England</li>
  <li>not already be in possession of a diploma in education and training (<abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>), <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>-compliant qualification or equivalent</li>
  <li>not have already received a full <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary award for a previous <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programme or a full <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> grant for a previous qualification</li>
  <li>not already hold, or be eligible to receive, early years teacher status (<abbr title="early years teacher status">EYTS</abbr>), qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>), qualified teacher learning and skills (<abbr title="qualified teacher learning and skills">QTLS</abbr>) status or advanced teacher status (<abbr title="advanced teacher status">ATS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>not receive a salary or other payment for any teaching work associated with the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programme for which they are receiving the bursary</li>
  <li>not be simultaneously undertaking any other <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> course, training scheme or programme, that leads to a <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr> or <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>-compliant qualification</li>
  <li>not be on an apprenticeship programme</li>
  <li>meet other related expectations, including intending to seek an <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> teaching post in England after qualification</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these eligibility criteria cannot be met because of circumstances arising due to COVID-19, email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FE.workforceincentives@education.gov.uk"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>.workforceincentives@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Eligibility for UK student support</h3>

<p>To receive an <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary the trainee must meet one or more of the definitions for being an ‘eligible’ student to receive grants and loans towards tuition fees or living costs as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1986/contents/made" rel="external">Education (Student Support) Regulations 2011</a>, part 2 (eligibility).</p>

<p>For a trainee to be eligible to receive a bursary, you must make sure that, from the first day of training:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the trainee meets the criteria of being an ‘eligible student’ and would therefore be able to receive support from the Student Loans Company (<abbr title="student loans company">SLC</abbr>) - the trainee does not need to have, or be intending to apply for, a loan, they just need to be eligible to receive student support as set out in the regulations</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programme is a ‘designated course’ for the purposes of student finance as set out in the regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>Detail of the criteria for ‘eligible students’ and for ‘designated courses’ is provided in regulations 4 and 5 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1986/part/2/made" rel="external">Education (Student Support) Regulations 2011</a>, part 2 (eligibility).</p>

<p><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursaries do not contain a disability aspect, and therefore being in receipt of Disabled Students’ Allowance (<abbr title="Disabled Students’ Allowance">DSA</abbr>) has no impact on eligibility for a bursary. Likewise, receipt of a bursary does not impact on eligibility to receive <abbr title="Disabled Students’ Allowance">DSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The EU Withdrawal Agreement provides that current EU principles of equal treatment will continue to apply for those covered by the citizens’ rights provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement. This means that EU nationals resident in the UK before the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, and who qualify for pre-settled status or settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, will continue to be eligible for home fee status and student financial support on broadly the same basis as previously, subject to meeting the usual residence requirements. Similar agreements have been signed with the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) - European Free Trade Association (<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr>) states and Switzerland. For further information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-finance-eligibility-2021-to-2022-academic-year">Student finance eligibility</a>.</p>

<p>Further guidance for <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and Swiss citizens is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-uk-guidance-for-eu-students">Studying in the UK: guidance for EU students</a>.</p>

<p>For further information on these requirements, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.practitioners.slc.co.uk/" rel="external">Student Finance England</a>.</p>

<p>Trainees from the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey may not meet one of the definitions for eligibility. However, they may still be eligible for support from their respective home education departments and, where this is the case, they will still be eligible for an <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary on the basis that they meet all other criteria.</p>

<p>International students can contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/" rel="external">UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA)</a> for advice on student support and other issues around studying in the UK.</p>

<h3>Qualifications</h3>

<p>To be eligible to receive a bursary a trainee must have achieved a standard equivalent to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>English GCSE grade 4 (C) or above</li>
  <li>Maths GCSE grade 4 (C) or above</li>
</ul>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) does not provide a list of qualifications that can be considered equivalent to the GCSE examinations in English and mathematics. When you look for evidence that a qualification is of a standard equivalent to GCSE grade 4, you should look at the content not only in terms of its level, but also in terms of its breadth.</p>

<p>It is the standard, not the certificate, that matters. Applicants who are otherwise suitable but have not successfully achieved a GCSE grade 4 may be given an opportunity to show that they can meet the required standard either by taking an equivalence test or by offering other evidence of attainment, which should demonstrate a similar level and breadth. You should consider making similar arrangements for candidates who cannot provide original certificates as evidence.</p>

<p>Qualifications in key and functional skills at level 2 are not equivalent to GCSEs in terms of content. You should look for additional evidence of breadth of knowledge and understanding in applicants who have key and functional skills certificates but do not have GCSEs at grade 4 or above in English and mathematics. You should look for further evidence of a breadth of achievement in English where applicants have achieved a GCSE grade 4 or above in English literature only.</p>

<p>You should be confident that a trainee’s subject qualification has the same level of breadth and depth that would be expected of a UK level 3 qualification. If the trainee does not hold a relevant level 3 qualification, you can use your discretion when considering the trainee’s skills, knowledge and experience - including relevant professional experience - to determine whether their subject knowledge is sufficiently robust to allow them to complete an <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programme successfully.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary award is dependent on the subject that a trainee trains to teach - not the subject of any other qualifications they hold.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p>If a trainee with a degree in English and relevant sector experience trains to teach physics, they will be eligible for a £26,000 physics bursary. If they train to teach English, they will be eligible for a £12,000 English bursary.</p>
</div>

<p>This should not change your selection or recruitment process, including making judgements about the suitability of qualifications or professional experience to the subject of training.</p>

<p>Further information on making and recording qualification decisions is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexB">Annex B: assessing UK academic qualifications</a>.</p>

<h3>Qualifying <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> courses</h3>

<p>To be eligible to receive a bursary, the trainee must be recruited to a qualifying pre-service <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> course in England, beginning in or after September 2022 and finishing no later than August 2023 (for full-time courses) or August 2024 (for part-time courses). We will accept applications on behalf of eligible trainees who were recruited onto in-scope courses before the bursaries were announced.</p>

<p>A qualifying course must lead, upon successful completion, to the award of a level 5 <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr> or a same or higher level <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>-compliant qualification, with a specialisation in one of the subjects identified in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexA">Annex A: list of subjects eligible for a bursary</a>.</p>

<p>A small number of providers may call a part-time <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> course an ‘in-service’ course. To clarify, if a trainee on such a titled course is not employed (they are studying pre-service before entering paid teaching employment), then this course title by itself would not make them ineligible for the bursary.</p>

<p>As set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#expectation">COVID-19: teaching expectation</a>, a full curriculum should continue to be made available to trainees, including 100 hours of teaching practice and relevant observations, with the intention of completing their qualification on time.</p>

<p>Courses that enable a trainee to be recommended for the award of <abbr title="early years teacher status">EYTS</abbr>, <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, or a non-<abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>-compliant qualification, are not eligible for <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary funding.</p>

<h4>Combination courses</h4>

<p>The course content must be at least 50% of the bursary subject awarded.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p>A course with content of 50% or more in English and the remainder in drama would receive the English bursary.</p>

<p>A course with content of more than 50% drama would not be eligible for a bursary as there is no bursary award for this subject.</p>
</div>

<p>Courses with equal content of 2 subjects will be awarded the bursary for the subject which attracts the highest bursary rate.</p>

<h3>Possession of a <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>, <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>-compliant qualification, or equivalent</h3>

<p>Individuals who hold a <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr> or <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>-compliant qualification on the first day of
their <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> course are not eligible for a training bursary. Separate continuing professional development may be appropriate for those who already hold these qualifications.</p>

<p>Information on qualifications which may be considered ‘<abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>-compliant’ is available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.practitioners.slc.co.uk/policy/" rel="external">Student Finance England eligibility guidance</a> (from the ‘Select a policy type’ drop-down menu select ‘2021/22 guidance chapters’ and then ‘Guidance Chapter - Assessing Eligibility Guidance 2122’).</p>

<h3>Award of an <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary or a grant for a previous qualification</h3>

<p>If an individual has already received a full <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary award for a previous <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programme or a full grant for a previous qualification, they are not eligible for another <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary.</p>

<h3>Possession of, or eligibility for, <abbr title="early years teacher status">EYTS</abbr>, <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, <abbr title="advanced teacher status">ATS</abbr> or <abbr title="qualified teacher learning and skills">QTLS</abbr> status</h3>

<p>Individuals who hold, or are eligible to receive, <abbr title="early years teacher status">EYTS</abbr>, <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, <abbr title="advanced teacher status">ATS</abbr> or <abbr title="qualified teacher learning and skills">QTLS</abbr> are not eligible for an <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary.</p>

<h3>Paid teaching work</h3>

<p>Trainees receiving bursary payments must not receive a salary or other payment for any teaching work associated with the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programme for which they are receiving the bursary.</p>

<p><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary funding is not intended to be provided to trainees with unpaid teaching responsibilities in lieu of a salary. Other funding is available to support in-service teacher training for the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> sector, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/taking-teaching-further-programme#:~:text=Taking%20Teaching%20Further%20(%20TTF%20)%20is,work%20at%20the%20FE%20provider">Taking Teaching Further</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/learning-and-skills-teacher-v1-1" rel="external">the learning and skills teacher apprenticeship</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Undertaking other <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> courses, training schemes or programmes that lead to a <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr> or <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>-compliant qualification</h3>

<p>To be eligible for an <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary, trainees must not simultaneously undertake any other:</p>

<ul>
  <li>teacher training course, including teaching apprenticeships</li>
  <li>programme leading to a <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr> or <abbr title="diploma in education and training">DET</abbr>-compliant qualification</li>
</ul>

<h3>Apprenticeship programme</h3>

<p>Individuals studying on apprenticeship training programmes are not eligible for an <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary.</p>

<h3>Trainee expectations</h3>

<p>We expect that trainees who accept a place with you and are eligible to receive a bursary will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inform you of any changes to their bank account details and address</li>
  <li>promptly inform you if they intend to withdraw from the course</li>
  <li>sign a declaration of understanding with you to the effect that they expect to seek an <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> teaching post in England on successful completion of their course</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also make it clear how you intend to pay the bursary to the trainee. <a class="govuk-link" href="#payments">Bursary payments</a> contains more details on payment patterns.</p>

<h2>Bursary allocations</h2>

<h3>General process</h3>

<p>Bursaries are funded from a predefined pot of money, and the number that can be awarded will therefore be limited. It is possible that not every candidate who meets the eligibility criteria will be able to receive a bursary. It will depend on the total number of eligible applications received.</p>

<p>We welcome applications from everyone irrespective of background but, as ethnic minority groups are currently under-represented in the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> teaching workforce, we would encourage applications from members of these groups. Bursaries will be awarded based on applicants meeting the eligibility criteria set out in this manual and the availability of funding.</p>

<p>For the 2022 to 2023 academic year, funding for pre-service bursaries, will be allocated  on a first-come-first-served basis, regardless of the trainee’s choice of eligible subject specialism, with the exception of English bursaries which will be capped at 100 awards.</p>

<p>Once the available funding has been exhausted, we will retain details of anyone remaining on a waiting list in case any trainee withdraws before their course starts, and their bursary can be reallocated.</p>

<p>If a trainee who has been deemed eligible for a bursary withdraws, you must notify us immediately so we can consider reassigning the funding to another trainee. You must not assume that such funding can be retained or will be allocated to another trainee in your institution unless and until you have received explicit confirmation from us.</p>

<h3>How to apply for a bursary</h3>

<p>You must find out if a trainee and their specific course are <a class="govuk-link" href="#UKeligibility">eligible for a bursary</a> before making an application.</p>

<p>The application form is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fe-funding-initial-teacher-education-ite-bursaries-2022-to-2023"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> funding: initial teacher education (<abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr>) 2022 to 2023</a>. Only applications made using this form will be considered and only the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> provider can make the application. We do not accept applications from trainees.</p>

<p>You can make applications for trainees at any time, either on a case-by-case basis or in batches, ahead of a course starting, by emailing a completed application form to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FE.workforceincentives@education.gov.uk"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>.workforceincentives@education.gov.uk</a>.  <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> requests that providers refrain from sending multiple application forms in a single day, due to the administrative burden that this causes.</p>

<p>You should wait to seek confirmation of whether a bursary can be awarded before informing trainees in writing. You should make sure that trainees are informed of whether they are eligible for a bursary in good time before the start of their <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> course. We cannot provide written confirmation to trainees.</p>

<p>Only one bursary is available per trainee. Prior to making an application, you must ensure that your trainees have not applied for a bursary from another <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> provider. We reserve the right to make further enquiries where necessary to ensure proper use of public funds.</p>

<h2>Bursary payments</h2>
<p>You are responsible for the management and administration of bursary payments, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assessment of eligibility of both the trainee and their specific course</li>
  <li>awarding the bursary to the trainee</li>
  <li>notifying us in a timely manner if a trainee withdraws from their course</li>
</ul>

<p>To be able to receive bursary funding for your trainees, you must complete and return a grant funding agreement (<abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr>). When you first request confirmation of bursary availability for specific trainees we will issue a <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr> for signature by your accounting officer, which you must return as soon as possible. If you are not already registered with us as a recipient of grant funding, it  is particularly important to return the signed <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr> quickly as there is a lead-in time to process these. Failure to do this promptly may mean we are unable to release funding until after trainees have started their courses. You will be issued with a single <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr>, regardless of the number of bursary applications made. No funding can be released for any applicant until we have received and accepted the signed <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are a new <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> provider in the 2022 to 2023 academic year and have not previously received grant funding you will need to set up a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> supply record to receive payments. You can do this at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/provide-information-about-your-banking-and-payments-to-dfe">provide information about your banking and payments to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Details of other requirements, including around maintaining necessary evidence and audit trails, are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#monitoring">monitoring, assurance and data requirements</a>.</p>

<h3>Trainee payments</h3>

<p>You should make bursary payments to trainees throughout the academic year as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexD">Annex D: value and timing for <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary payments</a>.</p>

<p>In a change from the bursary offer in academic years 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022, payments for part-time trainees will be made to you over the lifetime of their course.</p>

<p>These payments are not taxable. However, as with student maintenance loans, they may be treated as capital income for the purposes of assessing income for trainees in receipt of state benefits. We advise you to refer trainees to their local benefits office to determine their eligibility for state benefits.</p>

<p>If a trainee is found to be ineligible for the bursary, we will recover any bursary payments made by you to them. You must make all reasonable efforts to recover bursary payments from your trainee.</p>

<h3>Payment eligibility</h3>

<p>Trainees will typically be entitled to receive the first bursary payment if they are actively engaged on the <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programme on the first day of the month following their start date.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p>A trainee commencing their course in September 2022 will be entitled to their first payment if they are actively undertaking the programme on 1 October. They will be entitled to the second payment if they are on the programme on 1 November, and so on. This is regardless of your individual payment date.</p>
</div>

<p>Where a trainee successfully completes their course before the end of the academic year, you can choose to pay them the full balance of the bursary early at your discretion, but we will continue to make payments to you on the existing monthly cycle.</p>

<p>Training bursary funding must not be paid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as part of maternity or paternity pay arrangements</li>
  <li>during a period of unauthorised absence</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event that a trainee is absent through sickness, you may only make one further payment following the first day of absence. After this, if the absence will continue into the next payment period, the absence should be treated as a period of deferral from the course, and so withdrawal from the bursary scheme, and payments must stop with immediate effect. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#withdrawals">withdrawals and deferrals</a> for more information.</p>

<p>These principles also apply for trainees who start their courses later in the academic year
subject to their still completing no later than August 2023 (for full-time courses) or August 2024 (for part-time courses). For example, if a trainee commences their course in  January 2023, they will be entitled to their first payment (subject to bursaries still being available) if they are actively completing the programme on 1 February.</p>

<p>Payments must not start before the trainee commences the course.</p>

<p>You must maintain an audit trail of all payments made to trainees and any decisions around payment structures.</p>

<p>We maintain the right to request this information at any time for assurance purposes.</p>

<h3>Trainee engagement</h3>

<p>Trainees are entitled to receive bursary payments as long as they are actively engaged on the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programme. If you have valid concerns that a trainee is not engaging appropriately with the course, you have the discretion to withhold bursary payments until you are satisfied that engagement is at an acceptable level and you are confident the trainee will complete the course. Email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FE.workforceincentives@education.gov.uk"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>.workforceincentives@education.gov.uk</a> immediately if these circumstances apply.</p>

<h3>Withdrawals and deferrals</h3>
<p>Eligible trainees who withdraw from a course will be entitled to payment for each month up to, and including, the month in which they formally withdraw. Trainees are not typically able to defer their study where this would mean they complete the course after the 2023 to 2024 academic year and continue to receive an <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary on return, so must be treated as withdrawals for the purposes of bursary management. Contact us immediately if exceptional circumstances may apply.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p>If a trainee starts their programme in September 2022 and withdraws (directly or by deferring) in January 2023, they will be entitled to 4 payments in total as they were engaged on the course on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 October 2022</li>
  <li>1 November 2022</li>
  <li>1 December 2022</li>
  <li>1 January 2023</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Withdrawal information should reflect the dates given to Student Finance England for student support purposes.</p>

<p>In the event of withdrawal, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>suspend all bursary payments to the trainee immediately</li>
  <li>make sure that their records are updated, detailing the formal withdrawal date, by emailing us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FE.workforceincentives@education.gov.uk"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>.workforceincentives@education.gov.uk</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We will recover any overpayments made to you after the trainee has withdrawn and will not reimburse you for any payments made to trainees in error.</p>

<p>We expect you to recover any bursary overpayments from trainees.</p>

<h3>Suspended trainees</h3>

<p>Trainees who are suspended from their course pending investigation may continue to receive their bursary payments. If a decision is reached to terminate the trainee’s programme, you must notify us immediately so we can stop payments straightaway. If you make any payments in error, these should be recovered from the trainee.</p>

<h2>Monitoring, assurance and data requirements</h2>

<h3>Monitoring and assurance</h3>

<p>We have a responsibility to make sure that public funds and assets generated from applicable <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> places are properly managed in line with your <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr>.</p>

<p>You will be required to demonstrate that you have administered all bursary funding in accordance with your GFAs, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>selecting and recruiting the highest-quality candidates to programmes of <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>designing and delivering high-quality programmes of <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>rigorously assessing trainees against all of the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.et-foundation.co.uk/supporting/professional-standards/" rel="external"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> professional standards for teachers and trainers</a>
</li>
  <li>assuring the quality of trainee placements undertaken and mentoring received</li>
  <li>demonstrating propriety and adequate controls in your financial management and comply with relevant financial reporting or governance requirements</li>
  <li>complying with our data requirements and requests as stipulated in all our guidance</li>
  <li>passing on 100% of the training bursary funding issued to you under your <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr> to the trainee</li>
</ul>

<p>You must hold full records of all trainees in receipt of bursaries, including evidence of trainees’ academic qualifications achieved (or other evidence of attainment) prior to starting their <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Trainees must hold the highest eligible qualification on which their assessment was based. In most cases trainees must have obtained the relevant qualifications prior to starting the course. We reserve the right to request evidence of qualification (or delay) at any point during the academic year from you, for the purpose of quality monitoring and funding assurance. This may include copies of original documentation provided by trainees, including qualification certificates.</p>

<p>We also expect to see evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>payments you have made to trainees</li>
  <li>evidence of trainee attendance</li>
</ul>

<p>It is advisable that you keep records for 3 years after the cohort has finished.</p>

<p>We require rigorous assurance of all bursary payments, including your accounting officer verifying the data sets. A sample ‘Annex G’ will be included in your <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr>, which demonstrates the breadth of this requirement, with more detailed guidance regarding the Annex G process to be provided at the end of the 2022 to 2023 academic year (annual certification of expenditure arrangements).</p>

<p>We will also review the allocated <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary funding that you receive and reconcile this amount with the trainee records submitted. Funding will be adjusted to meet the actual amount required. Where funding that you have received is more than the amount that you were entitled to, we will recover the excess by invoicing you or offsetting this amount against any future payments.</p>

<p>Remember to make sure that all trainee records submitted to us are complete. This includes amending the records of trainees who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>withdraw (directly or by deferring) from their <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> course</li>
  <li>start later in the 2022 to 2023 academic year</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to delay or withhold payments if data is inaccurate or incomplete.</p>

<p>We will carry out a reconciliation exercise between the bursaries allocated and the actual trainee records as confirmed by our data collection exercises during and after the period of training. In the event of any variances, we reserve the right to ask you for explanations of the variances and to seek further information. We will not reimburse you for any bursaries paid to ineligible trainees.</p>

<p>You will be asked to complete an Annex G in accordance with published guidance, containing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>income</li>
  <li>expenditure</li>
  <li>trainee data</li>
</ul>

<p>This has to be independently audited and countersigned by the accounting officer (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexF">Annex F: assurance and audit process</a>).</p>

<p>We will use this information to reconcile the funding that you have received with your declared expenditure, taking into account the effect of withdrawn trainees.</p>

<p>We will issue more detailed guidance regarding Annex G at the end of the 2022 to 2023 academic year so that you are able to comply with the <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr> requirements.</p>

<h3>Data requirements and reporting</h3>

<p>You must submit relevant trainee-level data to us, at specific times before, during and after the course, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individual and course data</li>
  <li>applications</li>
  <li>recruitment and employment outcomes</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#annexE">Annex E: <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> provider bursary funding cycle</a> sets out the key timeline, and we will provide further details of requirements if you receive confirmation of bursary availability for your trainees.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with requests for data may be taken into account when we consider further requests for any future funding.</p>

<p>When submitting information to us you must comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. For more information, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#GDPR">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any queries regarding the submission of trainee-level data, email us at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FE.workforceincentives@education.gov.uk"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>.workforceincentives@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>

<p>As bursaries will be dispensed under grant funding from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, you must ensure that you are aware of your obligations under the GDPR. This is on the basis that, for the purposes of grant funding and the terms of funding between <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and your organisation, you are data controller in respect of any personal data you will process as part of the activity you undertake. You will therefore be bound by responsibilities as data controller under data protection legislation.</p>

<p>Should <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> require you to process personal data, then <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will issue written instructions to you in connection with such processing.</p>

<p>For further information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-protection-how-we-collect-and-share-research-data">How <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> share personal data</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex A: list of subjects eligible for a bursary</h2>
<p>We will provide bursaries for the following <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programmes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>computing</li>
  <li>engineering (and/or manufacturing)</li>
  <li>English (capped at 100 awards in the 2022 to 2023 academic year)</li>
  <li>mathematics</li>
  <li>science (including biology, chemistry and/or physics)</li>
  <li>special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Funding will not be provided for any subjects that are not included in this list.</p>

<h2>Annex B: assessing UK academic qualifications</h2>
<p>You must make sure that those responsible for making decisions on bursary eligibility are familiar with, or have access to, advice on the range of qualifications generally regarded as equivalent to GCSE grade 4 (C) or above and level 3 in the UK. This may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>overseas qualifications</li>
  <li>professional or vocational qualifications</li>
  <li>qualifications no longer available but held by mature applicants</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be aware of the range of qualifications awarded by UK institutions. In all cases, you are responsible for deciding whether an individual’s highest relevant qualification meets the bursary eligibility criteria. This includes determining whether a particular qualification demonstrates the breadth and type of academic engagement that would be expected.</p>

<p>Where the trainee does not hold a formal qualification in the subject to be taught, you will need to assess whether the skills, knowledge and experience that they possess in the relevant subject or specialism is sufficient for them to meet the requirements of the training programme.</p>

<p>You must keep an audit trail of how you assess equivalency. In determining equivalency, you may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use internal colleagues, such as those in the relevant subject department</li>
  <li>consult external organisations, such as the awarding body of the equivalent qualification or the professional body representing a particular professional domain</li>
  <li>conduct a review of the course content or transcripts of the other qualification</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to request this information for assurance purposes and to ensure the robustness of your processes.</p>

<p>Where providers lack the institutional experience to assess the validity of academic qualifications, they should refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/quality-code/qualifications-frameworks" rel="external">Frameworks for HE qualifications of UK degree-awarding bodies</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex C: assessing overseas qualifications</h2>

<h3>Overseas qualification equivalency</h3>

<p>When selecting trainees with overseas qualifications, you should make sure that they comply with the <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> bursary requirements. A statement of comparability can be obtained from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.enic.org.uk/" rel="external">UK National Information Centre for the recognition and evaluation of international qualifications and skills (UK ENIC)</a>, which confirms whether or not the trainee’s qualification is comparable to a UK qualification.</p>

<p>You must hold full records of all trainees in receipt of bursaries, including any qualifications or training they referenced in their application which was achieved before starting their <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Decisions on eligibility must be based solely on the content of the qualification itself and must not include any unrelated additional qualifications. Where an individual does not hold at least a level 3 qualification in the subject of training, you must make a professional assessment to determine eligibility. This should include taking into account the skills, knowledge and experience that an applicant has and the extent to which these will stand the applicant in good stead in order to meet the requirements of the <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> programme.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to request these details from you at any point during the academic year for the purpose of monitoring the robustness of your processes.</p>

<p>This may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>copies of original documentation provided by trainees, including qualification certificates</li>
  <li>correspondence related to the decision making process, for example, advice from internal colleagues or external organisations such as awarding bodies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annex D: value and timing of trainee bursary payments</h2>

<h3>Payments for full-time courses</h3>

<p>Bursary awards should typically be paid in a minimum of 10 equal monthly instalments over the duration of the course, as shown in the table. However, you may choose to amend the payment profile, at your discretion, for example to make an enhanced final payment, to help with retention.</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <td>£26,000</td>
      <td>£2,600</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You should not make any payments to the trainee until funding is released. Any payments prior to all eligibility criteria being met are made at the provider’s sole risk. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will not reimburse such payments if the trainee is unable to meet the eligibility criteria in full.</p>

<h3>Payments for part-time courses</h3>

<p>In a change from the bursary offer in academic years 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022, you will receive 50% of the funding for part-time trainees in the first year of their course (2022 to 2023 academic year) and 50% of the funding in the second year of the course (2023 to 2024 academic year).</p>

<p>You should make sure that the bursary payments broadly reflect the proportion of the course that the trainee has completed at any point. This will typically be in 20 equal monthly instalments over the duration of the course, as shown in the table. However, you may choose to amend the payment profile, at your discretion, for example to make an enhanced final payment, to help with retention.</p>

<h2>Annex E: <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> provider bursary funding cycle</h2>

<h3>Key dates in the bursary funding cycle</h3>

<h4>From January 2022</h4>
<p>You will need to submit trainee and course data when seeking confirmation of bursary availability, ahead of receiving any confirmation. After this you will receive your <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr>, which you should sign and return to us as soon as possible after receipt, to allow for prompt processing.</p>

<p>If you are a new <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> provider in the 2022 to 2023 academic year and have not previously received grant funding, you will need to set up a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> supply record to receive payments. You can do this at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/provide-information-about-your-banking-and-payments-to-dfe">Provide information about your banking and payments to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>GFAs must be approved by us and your payment details must be on our system before August 2022 to ensure payments can be made from September.</p>

<p>You must notify us immediately if any trainee subsequently withdraws from their course. We will incorporate this into our bursary model and confirm the process for recovering unallocated funding.</p>

<h4>August 2022</h4>
<p>We will write to you about funding amounts for September 2022 to January 2023 based on your trainee data.</p>
