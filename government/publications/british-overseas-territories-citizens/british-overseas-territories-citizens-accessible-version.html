<h3>Version 3.0</h3>

<p>Guidance for HM Passport Office staff about the British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) nationality status and how to deal with BOTC passport applications</p>

<h2>About: British overseas territories citizens</h2>

<p>This guidance tells HM Passport Office operational staff how to deal with applications sent directly to us, from customers who hold British overseas territories citizenship (BOTC).</p>

<p>For the purpose of this guidance, you must treat any reference to BOTC as British dependant territories citizenship (BDTC), if a customer had a claim to BDTC before 21 May 2002.</p>

<p>This guidance does not apply to customers applying for a BOTC variant passport. Customers who apply for a BOTC variant passport will apply through their territory office and a dedicated team in Peterborough will deal with the application.</p>

  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Montserrat</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>St Helena and Dependencies (renamed as St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha on 1 September 2009)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>St Christopher and Nevis (also known as St Kitts and Nevis) gained independence 19 September 1983</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri, Dhekelia and Episkopi in Cyprus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turks &amp; Caicos Islands</p>
  </li>

<h3>The British Overseas Territories Act (BOTA) 2002</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/8/contents" rel="external">British Overseas Territories Act (BOTA) 2002</a> came into force on 21 May 2002 and amended the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/contents" rel="external">British Nationality Act 1981</a>. The main changes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>‘British dependent territories’ changed to ‘British overseas territories’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘in the United Kingdom’ changed to ‘in the UK or in a qualifying territory on or after the appointed day’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the status of BDTC was renamed as ‘British overseas territories citizen’ (BOTC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘British Dependent Territories citizens’ changed to ‘British overseas territories citizens’ in the relevant sections</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>anyone who was a BDTC on the 21 May 2002 automatically became a British citizen (BC), except those with a connection to The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri, Dhekelia and Episkopi in Cyprus</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Status shown in British passports held by BOTC customers</h4>

<p>Depending on when the customer was issued a passport, their status may show (British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) or British dependant territories citizen (BDTC). Passports issued:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>before 21 May 2002, will show the status as British dependent territories citizens</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on or after 21 May 2002, will show the status as British overseas territories citizen</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rights of BOTC status</h3>

<p>The rights of a customer with British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) status will depend on if they also hold British citizen status.</p>

<h4>Holders of both the BOTC and BC status</h4>

<p>Anyone who holds British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) and British citizen status has the same rights as those who hold BC status (for example, visa free travel to many countries and the right to live and work in the UK).</p>

<h4>Holders of BOTC status only</h4>

<p>Anyone who only has British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>has the right, to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>visa free travel to many countries</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>visit the UK for up to 6 months, without a visa</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>does not automatically have the right of abode or right to work in the UK or any of the remaining dependent territories</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>BOTC’s who became British citizens</h3>

<p>Customers who are British overseas territories citizens (BOTC) may have an automatic claim to British citizenship through 2 different British nationality acts. These are, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/6/contents" rel="external">British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983</a>, which:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>is dated 1 January 1983 and was given royal assent on 28 March 1983 (in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/contents" rel="external">the British Nationality Act 1981</a>)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>gives customers with a connection to the Falkland Islands an automatic claim to British citizenship</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/8/contents" rel="external">British Overseas Territories Act (BOTA) 2002</a>, which automatically gives British citizenship to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>all customers (except those who got their status through the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri, Dhekelia and Episkopi in Cyprus) who held BDTC status on 21 May 2002</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>customers who have an automatic claim to British overseas territories citizenship since 21 May 2002</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Customers who register as BOTCs after 21 May 2002 do not automatically become a British citizen. These people must register as British citizens.</p>

<h2>Passport applications from BOTCs</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office operational staff how to process an application for a British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) passport sent directly to us. It does not include guidance on how to deal with applications sent through immigration offices in a British overseas territory.</p>

<p>Customers applying for a British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) passport, can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>apply for, a:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>variant passport, by making an application at the correct territory office</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>non-variant passport, by making an application direct to HM Passport Office</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a variant passport and a non-variant passport at the same time</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>as many variant books that they are entitled to hold at any one time</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>only one 1 non-variant book at one time (unless they need an additional passport</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>a BOTC and British citizen passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more than 1 variant passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a foreign passport or identity card</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>BOTC applications: what customers must send us</h3>

<p>When a customer makes an application direct to HM Passport Office for a British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) passport, they must send:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a completed application (they must fill in the sections for the service they want)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>passport photos</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the correct fee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the standard documents depending on where they are applying from and the service they are applying for, for example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>identity and nationality documents for overseas applications</p>
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
        <p>change of name documents</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>why</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for alternative documents or evidence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a customer cannot give us alternative documents or evidence, we may be able to consider their application using a balance of probabilities (see supporting documents not available guidance, for who deals with balance of probability decisions).</p>

<h3>How to deal with first time BOTC passport applications</h3>

<p>You must deal with a customer’s British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) application using existing first time applications guidance, if they are a BOTC and they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have never held a British passport in their own right</p>

  <li>
    <p>are renewing or replacing a red (machine readable style) passport that is not on Main Index (MI) or G-search</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This may mean the customer needs to attend an interview. When dealing with the application, you must:</p>

<p>1. Make sure the customer holds BOTC status (in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/contents" rel="external">nationality legislation</a> and this guidance).</p>

<p>2. Be satisfied the customer has given enough evidence to confirm their nationality and identity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fraud or safeguarding (protection) concerns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>risk indicators</p>
  </li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we no longer add a territory immigration observation to BOTC passports</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if they want a territory immigration observation adding to their passport, they must contact their territory immigration office</p>
  </li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>issue, if the customer does not need to attend an interview</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interview, if current guidance tells you</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>11. Check if the customer has other valid British passports. If they do, you must add a Main Index (MI) passport note to all their valid British passport records to show details of the British passports they hold.</p>

<p>If the customer is applying for a British citizen (BC) passport at the same time, you must refer to British citizen guidance for how to process the application.</p>

<h3>How to renew or replace a BOTC passport</h3>

<p>If a customer applies to renew or replace their British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) and they:</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>risk indicators</p>
  </li>

<p>5. Confirm the customer’s nationality.</p>

<p>6. Compare the customer’s photo and personal details on MI, G-search or X drive, with details on their application and supporting documents. If the details do not match, you must confirm the customer’s identity and ask them to resolve the differences.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>‘Main Index/G:search/X Drive check record not held’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Main Index/G:search/X Drive check record confirmed’</p>

<h2>BOTC UK immigration observations</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office operational staff what UK immigration observations they must add to a British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) passport.</p>

<p>When we issue a customer with a British overseas territories citizens (BOTC) passport, we must add the correct UK immigration observation. Some BOTC passports will not need one, for example, if the customer is a dual British citizen. If we need to add a UK immigration observation, it will either be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>subject to immigration control (STC) observation code OBTB, that says:</li>
</ul>

<p>THE HOLDER IS SUBJECT TO CONTROL UNDER THE IMMIGRATION ACT 1971</p>

<ul>
  <li>re-admission to the UK (RUK) observation code OBTE, that says:</li>
</ul>

<p>THE HOLDER IS ENTITLED TO RE-ADMISSION TO THE UNITED KINGDOM</p>

<p>If we need to add a UK immigration observation but do not use the correct one, especially for customers in the UK, it may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>mean if they leave the UK, they can have difficulty when the try to return</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>create similar issues seen with Windrush customers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When deciding if a BOTC passport needs a UK immigration observation and which one to use, our decision will depend on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if a customer is a dual British citizen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if a customer is in the UK or overseas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how long a customer has been in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what UK immigration observations are in a customer’s previous passports</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any immigration documents a customer has from UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Customer applies for their first BOTC passport</h3>

<p>If a UK or overseas customer applies for their first British overseas territories citizens (BOTC) passport, you must check if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a dual British citizen, by checking if they:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>have a have a British citizen passport (for example, using Main Index, G- search or the X-drive)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>are eligible for a British citizen passport, in line with this guidance and the British citizen guidance (you may need to ask the customer for more documents to confirm this)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the UK or overseas</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If during the application for a British overseas territories citizens (BOTC) a customer wants to apply for a British citizen passport, you must deal with the application in line with the British citizenship guidance.</p>

<h4>First BOTC passport: UK customer is a dual British citizen</h4>

<p>Dual British citizens are not subject to immigration control, they do not need an UK immigration observation adding to their passport. If UK customer applies for their first British overseas territories citizens (BOTC) passport and has a British citizen passport (or is eligible for one), you must:</p>

<p>1. Check the status on the system shows British overseas territory citizen. If it does not, you must change it.</p>

<p>2. Send a UK customer, Application Management System (AMS) letter 135. When you do, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>not include phrase 135H (if the customer has a British citizen passport)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include phrase 135H (if the customer does not have a British citizen passport but is eligible for one)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. Add a case note to explain the actions and decisions you made.</p>

<p>4. Continue to process the passport application (in line with current guidance).</p>

<h4>First BOTC passport: UK customer is not a dual British citizen</h4>

<p>Customers in the UK who are not eligible for a British citizen passport are subject to immigration control in the UK. If the customer wants a BOTC passport and they are not a dual British citizen, you must check if, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>documents they sent with their application show they are settled in the UK (for example, they have indefinite leave to remain (ILR), indefinite leave to enter (ILE) or no time limit (NTL))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UKVI systems show the customer is settled (if they did not send any documents with their application that show they are settled)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the customer’s documents or the UKVI system shows the customer is settled, you must refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark54">first BOTC passport: customer is settled</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer’s documents and the UKVI systems do not show if they are settled, you must:</p>

<p>1. Send the customer AMS letter 137. The letter asks for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence that shows their immigration status in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the document they used to enter to the UK (if they cannot give us evidence that shows their immigration status in the UK)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a signed letter that explains when they travelled to the UK and what document they used (if they cannot give us the document, they used to enter the UK)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. Add a case note to explain the actions and decisions you made.</p>

<p>3. Store the application while you wait for a response.</p>

<p>4. Refer to</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark54">first BOTC passport: customer is settled</a> (if the customer provides evidence to show they are settled)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark53">first BOTC passport: asking UKVI if a customer is settled</a> (if the customer cannot provide evidence to show they are settled)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>First BOTC passport: asking UKVI if a customer is settled</h3>
