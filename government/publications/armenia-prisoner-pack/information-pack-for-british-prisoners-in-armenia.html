<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Who can help?</h3>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO):</p>

<p>The FCDO is represented overseas by its Embassies and Consulates (High Commissions in Commonwealth Countries). Both employ consular officers, and one of their duties is to provide help and advice to any British National who gets into difficulty in a foreign country.</p>

<h3>About the British Embassy</h3>

<p>We are impartial; we are not here to judge you. We aim to make sure that you are treated properly and fairly in accordance with local regulations, and that you are treated no less favourably than other prisoners.</p>

<p>We can answer questions about your welfare and about prison regulations but you must ask your lawyer or the court about legal matters. The attached list of lawyers is provided by the British Embassy for your convenience, but neither Her Majesty’s Government, nor any official of the Consulate, take any responsibility for the competence or probity of any firm/advocate on the list or for the consequence of any legal action initiated or advice given.</p>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison, pay fines or stand bail or interfere with local judicial procedures to get you out of prison nor secure you an earlier trial date; we cannot investigate a crime.</p>

<p>We have tried to make sure that the information in this booklet is accurate and up to date, but the British Embassy cannot accept legal responsibility for any errors or omissions in the information. If in doubt contact a lawyer.</p>

<p>Opening hours: 9am to 5pm</p>

<p>Consular section opening hours: 9:30am to 12:30pm by appointment only </p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<h3>Who will know I have been detained?</h3>

<p>As soon as a British citizen is arrested and detained in Armenia, the authorities must let the detainee contact the British Embassy in Yerevan. The police usually also contact us once they are aware a British citizen is involved. We can also learn of arrest cases informally from friends or family members.</p>

<h3>What will my family be told?</h3>

<p>For reasons of confidentiality we are not permitted to tell anyone, even your family, that you have been detained or what the charges are without your permission. However, it is possible that your family and friends could obtain the information from the internet.</p>

<h3>What will the Consulate do?</h3>

<p>We aim to contact you within 24 hours of being informed of your detention but it may be that we are not informed immediately. It is therefore essential that you request to contact the British Embassy as soon as possible after your arrest. We aim to visit you within 48hours initially.</p>

<h3>Would I have a criminal record in the UK?</h3>

<p>You should be aware that if you have been convicted for certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to inform the UK police.&nbsp; It is therefore possible that information about this offence may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Visits</h2>

<h3>How do my family and friends arrange a visit?</h3>

<p>Once you have been arrested you will be held at the police station for up to 72 hours.</p>

<p>If you are male you will then be moved to one of the Criminal Executive Institutions near Yerevan or in some cases out of town, depending on the area the crime had taken place. As a rule it will either Nubarashen or Vardashen prisons.</p>

<p>If you are female you will be moved to Abovyan women’s prison.</p>

<p>You will be in quarantine for a maximum period of 7 days. After this time, at all establishments, family and friends can visits. If you have a calling card, usually available for sale with some of the internet providers, you can call your relatives and arrange a time for them to visit you.</p>

<h3>How many visits am I allowed?</h3>

<p>This is dependent on the crime committed. Immediate family can agree on visit times but this is for less serious crimes. Visiting rules may change if there is a court decision to restrict the visits only to legal adviser and consular staff. Normally pre-trial prisoners are allowed 2 visits per month in Armavir prison, and 1 visit per month in Vardashen.</p>

<p>Once you have been convicted, and dependent on the crime and the length of the sentence, immediate family (spouse and children proven by marriage certificate and birth certificates) are able to stay with you in a family area in prison for up to 3 days once every 1 or 2 months. Lawyers and consular staff can visit you as many times as necessary, round the clock.</p>

<h3>Consular visits</h3>

<p>We will visit you every 3 months. During these routine visits you will have the opportunity to discuss any issues, such as health, security concerns, your treatment in prison and any other general issues you wish to raise. At each Consular visit our staff will complete a “Visit Report Form.”</p>

<p>We will only disclose information to your next of kin with your permission.</p>

<h3>What can visitors bring?</h3>

<p>In all establishments visitors can bring bedding, clothes, books, food (cannot be raw foods such as meats). Non-recording electronic devices – such as DVD players, games consoles, microwaves must be agreed in advance with the prison. There is a list of items prohibited by law which will be provided by the prison, if any of these items are brought by visitors they will be either confiscated or retuned to the visitor.</p>

<p>No glass jars or sharp items allowed.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Prison conditions/services</h2>

<h3>Arrival at police station</h3>

<p>Once you have been arrested you will be taken to the relevant police station. You should be given the opportunity to contact the British Embassy. The police officers will confirm the charges against you and by law you can be held at the police station for up to 72 hours. After this time you will either be released or taken to one of the Criminal Executive Institutions near Yerevan, normally Nubarashen or Vardashen prison.</p>

<h3>Arrival at prison</h3>

<p>On arrival at all establishments you will be placed in a quarantine cell. You will remain in this cell for up to 7 days. You will receive a general medical check. If you are suffering from any injuries you will be given medical help and if the injuries have been sustained whilst in custody then they will be reported and an investigation started. If necessary you will be assessed by a psychologist. You will be given information about what you can and cannot do whilst in prison and whether you have the right to contact family and friends (for example if you have been arrested along with family members/friends you will not be able to have contact with them). A photo will be taken for identity purposes.</p>

<h3>General prison conditions</h3>

<p>Armavir prison is a new establishment, opened in 2015. There are 6 units, 4 prisoners per cell. There are special sections for international prisoners. Relaxed outdoor spaces are available for prisoners to walk and be outside. There is a library, arts and craft room, gym area, games facilities. Prisoners can work in the kitchen, or take part in general maintenance works.</p>

<p>There is Skype Room for prisoners to contact their relatives via video call. It is funded by Red Cross.</p>

<p>Both Nubarashen and Vardashen are located on the same road on the outskirts of Yerevan. The facilities are basic and in some areas suffering from damp damage.</p>

<p>In Nubarashen there is a separate section which houses foreigners. In both Nubarashen and Vartashen there is strict segregation dependent on the crime. The cells are designed to hold up to 12 people but generally hold 8-10 people maximum. All cells have barred windows and bathroom facilities – WC and sink with hot and cold water. The shower facilities are located on the same floor and are usually available once a week. Most cells have a small fridge and a heating plate for warming food. Cells do not have TV’s etc as standard however family members may be able to provide these if requested.</p>

<p>At Abovyan women’s prison there are differing facilities. The rooms hold varying numbers of beds however they are laid out in a dormitory style. There are no bunk beds. If you are expecting a child or have a young child you can request a room to yourself. There are cooking and shower facilities.</p>

<p>Goris prison is located 4 hours outside the Yerevan city. The building is over 200 years old, with high ceilings and archways. The rooms have bunk beds, cooking facilities and private bathrooms.</p>

<p>All prisons have laundry facilities.</p>

<h3>How can I receive money?</h3>

<p>No cash is allowed to be handed to a prisoner. The account departments will open an account and family members and friends can transfer money into this account.</p>

<p>There is no limit on funds in Vardashen, Noubarashen or Goris, but there is 30,000 AMD per month limit in Armavir prison.</p>

<h3>Can I work or study in prison?</h3>

<p>In Nubarashen there is no opportunity to work for payment however if you are willing to work you can help with the domestic chores. You are able to receive books for personal study.</p>

<p>In Vartashen there is a library with a number of books in different languages. You are also able to receive books for personal study. Dependent on the crime committed you will be classed as an open or closed prisoner. If you are a “fully open” prisoner then you will be able to work outside under agreement and you must be returned to the prison by 8pm. If you are a closed prisoner then, also dependent on the crime, you may be able to work in the kitchen etc. You will be paid a monthly salary of up to AMD 50,000 (approximately £71). In Abovyan there are numerous opportunites for work, dependent on the crime committed. There is a small factory producing pasta and other areas which have facilities to produce art, carpets and clay products. There is a school which children under 16 can attend.</p>

<p>In Armavir there is arts and craft room, a library, IT room where prisoners can do long distance learning courses. The prisoners can also work in the kitchen and help with cleaning and maininance jobs in each section of the prison.</p>

<p>In Goris there is a library where prisoners can request books, or read at premises.</p>

<h3>Can I receive medical and dental treatment?</h3>

<p>All prisons have medical centres and Vartashen has a small hospital on the premises. Dental treatment is available.</p>

<p>At Abovyan prison the prisoner can also pay for their personal doctor to attend.</p>

<p>If needed, prisoners can be taken to general hospital for treatment under security supervision, kept until recovery is possible from within prison hospital wards.</p>

<h3>Food and diet</h3>

<p>In all prisons food is served 3 times a day. There is some provision for special diets. Family and friends are also able to bring in up to 70kg of food items per month but this needs to be pre-cooked or non-perishable. Any dietary requirements will be dependent on a doctor’s certificate.</p>

<h3>Mail/parcels</h3>

<p>Mail can be sent and received. All mail will be x-rayed and opened if deemed necessary. Any prohibited items will be removed. Letters are not routinely opened and read and, if wished, can be marked confidential.</p>

<h3>Can I make telephone calls?</h3>

<p>In Nubarashen, restrictions are placed on telephone calls dependent on the crime. If you are able to make calls a schedule is in place and must be adhered to.</p>

<p>In Vardashen, Armavir and Abovyan family or friends must provide you with calling card and you are able to make calls of up to 15 minutes maximum dependent on the call schedule. The prison prioritises contact with family and therefore are willing to be flexible where possible. In Goris free calls are allowed, according to schedule. All requests within reason are satisfied.</p>

<h3>Leisure and entertainment</h3>

<p>In Nubarashen, there is no outside exercise area. Prisoners are walked around an area cell by cell.</p>

<p>In Vardashen, there is a small outside area with a single, old piece of exercise equipment. Access to the prison church is via this area and is only available to you during your exercise period. The prison has a library, a billiard table, table tennis table, indoor board games such as chess, dominoes. There is also the possibility to access art equipment if required. There is a Skype room for prisoners to make video calls.</p>

<p>In Abovyan, there is a large outside area. There are gardens with the facilities to grow plants and vegetables. There is a small theatre and prisoners can perform plays or sometimes outside performers attend. There is a library.</p>

<p>In Armavir, there is a gym area, outside garden for less serious convicts, a library and a Skype Room for video calling.</p>

<p>In Goris, there is an outdoors area, beautifully decorated by prisoners themselves, with plans and painted art works on the walls.</p>

<h3>Drugs</h3>

<p>Tobacco cigarettes are available in all prisons and prisoners are able to smoke freely. The prison shops stock cigarettes.</p>

<p>If a prisoner is caught with drugs then the substance will be confiscated and an investigation will be undertaken. A case will be opened with the relevant department.</p>

<p>In Vardashen there are smoking and non-smoking sections of the prison cells.</p>

<h3>How can I make a complaint about mistreatment?</h3>

<p>The officials of all prisons have said that you can write a complaint to anyone you wish. You can take it up with the prison authorities in the first instance if you wish or you can inform a lawyer or family member and request that they raise the issue. Abovyan prison will provide the stationary and pay for the postage. You can also raise the issue with the British Embassy in writing or during one of our consular visits.</p>

<h2>The Armenian judicial system</h2>

<h3>Is the system the same as the UK?</h3>

<p>The system is similar to the UK in that cases are heard by a court however they can take a long time to be heard and during that time it is likely that you will placed in either Nubarashen or Vardashen prison whilst awaiting the trial.</p>

<h3>What should happen when I am arrested?</h3>

<p>Once you have been arrested you will be taken to the relevant police station. You should be given the opportunity to contact the British Embassy. You have the right to be informed of the nature of charges brought against you and to receive a written summary of your rights. You also have the right to meet with a lawyer and request that the lawyer be present during questioning. If you do not speak Armenian, you have the right to receive interpretation services. This is the responsibility of the investigating authorities and they cannot demand that the British Embassy or anyone else provide an interpreter.</p>

<h3>What happens when I am charged?</h3>

<p>You will be taken straight to the establishment where you will held in custody.</p>

<h3>For how long can I be remanded in custody?</h3>

<p>By law you can be held at the police station for up to 72 hours. After this time you will either be released or most likely taken to Nubarashen Criminal Executive Institution or Vardashen prison if you are male or Abovyan prison if you are female.</p>

<p>It is likely you will remain here until the trial. As a non-convicted prisoner you do not wear the prison uniform and you are not able to work in the prisons. You will not be in contact with anyone else arrested with you.</p>

<h3>What provision is there for bail?</h3>

<p>There is some provision for bail for more minor offences. Your lawyer will be able to advise further.</p>

<h3>What kind of legal assistance is available?</h3>

<p>Some legal assistance may be available prior to being taken to prison however this would very much depend on the circumstances and in most cases, as a non-Armenian, is very unlikely.</p>

<h3>What happens at the trial?</h3>

<p>You will be taken to the court where the trial will be held. Your lawyer should attend with you. If found guilty you will be sentenced at this time and any restrictions will be set.</p>

<h3>Sentences</h3>

<p>These are dependent on the crime committed. A lawyer will be able to advise further.</p>

<h3>How can appeals be made?</h3>

<p>It is advisable to speak to a lawyer for advice about appeals.</p>

<h3>What provision is there for reduction of sentence (remission) e.g. for good behaviour?</h3>

<p>There is provision but it is according to Armenian law and is dependent on the crime. The sentence will not be shortened to less than the legal minimum stated period. Prison reports are taken into consideration.</p>

<h3>What provision is there for early release e.g. on parole?</h3>

<p>In Nubarashen the officials informed us that parole is possible if the minimum time has already been served and the prisoner meets the requirements. An internal committee will vote as to whether they agree the prisoner should be released. If the committee is in agreement then the prison can make the final decision.</p>

<p>In Vardashen and Abovyan the process goes through an internal committee, the Department of Justice and the Higher Court. If the process fails at any of these stages then it will be dismissed and the prisoner will have to serve the full sentence.</p>

<h3>What about any financial penalties?</h3>

<p>There are not usually any financial penalties.</p>

<h3>Is transfer to another prison within Armenia possible?</h3>

<p>A new prison has recently been built in Armenia and there are also prisons in other areas of the country. The prison officials have advised that a transfer is possible but would be very dependent on the reasons for the request and they would then conduct an investigation into the reason.</p>

<h3>Is transfer to the UK a possibility?</h3>

<p>There is no formal bilateral agreement or international convention between the United Kingdom and Armenia regarding the transfer of prisoners. A transfer to the United Kingdom is therefore unlikely.</p>

<h3>What are the procedures for release and deportation?</h3>

<p>For release without deportation, once the sentence is complete the prisoner is able to leave the prison. They will be issued with an official letter showing that they have completed their sentence. If additional work is required, such as checking on the welfare of the prisoner once released then the prison will follow this up.</p>

<p>If a prisoner is due to be deported on completion of their sentence then, usually one month prior to release, the prison will send their passport to the visa department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure the paperwork is in order. The prison will then liaise with the Embassy to arrange the formalities.</p>

<h2>Prisoners Abroad</h2>

<p>Since 1978 the charity Prisoners Abroad has offered practical support and advice to British citizens imprisoned overseas. It is the only UK charity providing this service and it is available to all, whether guilty or innocent, convicted or on remand. Prisoners Abroad is concerned with your health and welfare, both during your imprisonment and also on your return to the UK, through their resettlement service (if you have registered whilst in prison). They can also provide support and advice to your family during your imprisonment. In order to access any services, prisoners must first register with Prisoners Abroad by signing and returning their authorisation form.</p>

<p>Once you seek help from Prisoners Abroad, the Prisoner &amp; Family Support Service will be your point of contact for advice and information. The type of assistance they can offer will vary from country to country, but generally, they can provide you with information, in English, on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your rights as a prisoner and issues that may affect you such as health or transfer to the UK</li>
  <li>obtaining magazines, newspapers, books and the regular Prisoners Abroad newsletter</li>
  <li>writing to a pen pal</li>
  <li>learning the language of your country of imprisonment</li>
  <li>translation of documents</li>
  <li>grants for food if you are in a developing country and don’t have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>grants for essential medicines and toiletries if you don’t have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>preparing for release</li>
  <li>help for your loved ones, including information, family support groups and assistance with the cost of visiting</li>
</ul>
