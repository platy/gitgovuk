<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Context and legal framework</h2>

<p>Local authorities have a statutory duty to submit an annual youth justice plan relating to the provision of youth justice services <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Section 40 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 sets out the youth justice partnership’s responsibilities in producing a plan. It states that it is the duty of each local authority, after consultation with the partner agencies, to formulate and implement an annual youth justice plan, setting out how youth justice services in their area are to be provided and funded, how they will operate, and what functions will be carried out.</p>

<p>The plan should equally address the functions assigned to a youth justice service, including how services will prevent offending behaviour and reduce reoffending <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Whilst these statutory requirements state the minimum information required within the youth justice plan, this guidance sets out further considerations for partnerships on both the content and structure of your youth justice plan; and asks for reflection on how the service takes a strength based approach towards delivering a Child First justice system.</p>

<p>The Youth Justice Board (YJB) recognises the remarkable response of the sector to the effects of the pandemic on delivery and the support that has been provided to children; we do not underestimate that the impacts of this are yet to fully emerge. At this time the importance of partners working together to put plans in place to mitigate the impacts are more crucial than ever.</p>

<p>Annual youth justice plans are an opportunity to review performance and developments over a single year period and plan for the next year. This allows services to be able to respond to any changes that have taken place in the previous year, including new legislation, demographic changes, delivery of key performance indicators, and developments in service delivery. The planning and production of a youth justice plan is beneficial to partnership working and service delivery to ensure the best outcomes for children.</p>

<p>The YJB recommends that partnerships engage their YJB regional leads in reviewing the content of plans and seek timely feedback before formal submission.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Youth justice plans for 2022/23 are required to be submitted using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/youth-justice-plans-governance-for-youth-justice-services/youth-justice-plan-template">template provided</a>, in line with the structure outlined in this guidance.</p>

<p>This is a change to previous requirements and reflects that the data and information contained within the plan is used by the YJB as an intelligence source that supports our oversight function. The standardised template supports consistency of content and structure, accessibility of the information and improves the identification and sharing of best practice.</p>
</div>

<p>We recognise that local areas will have their own governance arrangements in place; however, we encourage the practice for plans to be developed in consultation with children and their families, staff and volunteers, partnership organisations and board members.</p>

<p>The final oversight for plans locally is with the Chair of the board and plans must be signed off by the Chair of the board before they are formally submitted.</p>

<p>There is a requirement on services to publish their youth justice plan <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.  Final youth justice plans must be submitted to the YJB by 30 June 2022 , by e-mailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CBU@yjb.gov.uk">CBU@yjb.gov.uk</a> and copying in your YJB regional lead.</p>

<p>Your youth justice plan can be submitted at any time, but it must be before 30 June 2022 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> on the provided template to ensure timely payment of your Youth Justice Grant for 2022/23.</p>

<p>At the end of this document is a <a class="govuk-link" href="#summary-outline-of-grant-compliances">summary outline of grant requirements against terms and conditions</a> to support services understanding of minimum compliances.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Child First</h2>

<p>You will be aware that the Youth Justice Board’s (YJB) vision is of a Child First youth justice system, which we define as a system where all services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Prioritise the best interests of children and recognising their particular needs, capacities, rights and potential. All work is child-focused, developmentally informed, acknowledges structural barriers and meets responsibilities towards children.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Promote children’s individual strengths and capacities to develop their pro-social identity for sustainable desistance, leading to safer communities and fewer victims. All work is constructive and future-focused, built on supportive relationships that empower children to fulfil their potential and make positive contributions to society.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encourage children’s active participation, engagement and wider social inclusion. All work is a meaningful collaboration with children and their carers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Promote a childhood removed from the justice system, using pre-emptive prevention, diversion and minimal intervention. All work minimises criminogenic stigma from contact with the system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We are satisfied that the evidence supports this as the best approach to achieve better child outcomes. Much of this is explored in the research, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/report/Child_First_Justice_the_research_evidence-base_Summary_report_/14153162" rel="external">Child First Justice – the research evidence base</a>, by Loughborough University alongside UKRI.</p>

<p>Whilst many of you will be employing a Child First approach to a greater or lesser extent, we want to build capacity within the sector further. We recognise that systemically this is a long-term vision which requires policy and legislative changes at the centre, which we are seeking to influence as set out in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/966200/YJB_Strategic_Plan_2021_-_2024.pdf" rel="external">strategic plan</a>. We also recognise that this vision extends far beyond the youth justice system into mainstream services and beyond and again are working to re-frame youth justice across government. Equally, as some services develop their Child First approach and implement these principles, there may be variance and potential tension between that, and previous risk-based approaches. The YJB is actively working with other organisations across the sector to develop a shared understanding of the benefits of the Child First approach.</p>

<p>However, there is much that can be done within the existing system within local arrangements and the content of plans should reflect your activity in working to achieve the above vision.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How to produce your plan</h2>

<p>Your youth justice management board should govern and own the process of producing the local youth justice plan; it is their opportunity to collectively shape the direction of the delivery of youth justice so that it best meets the needs of the locality, children, families and communities. Opportunities for wider participation, significantly where children and their families can themselves shape and influence the delivery of your service, are also strongly encouraged.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Youth justice planning process – what might it include?</h3>

<p>The management board (led by the Chair) should take the lead for planning. This will begin with a planning session with contributions from all partners. The planning process should include the following:</p>

<h4>Reflect and plan</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Look back and learn from the past to recognise achievements and consider plans based on what is known now as well as looking to the future to base plans in context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider current performance, this may include performance data against local and national indicators, self-assessment against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957697/Standards_for_children_in_youth_justice_services_2019.doc.pdf" rel="external">standards for children in the youth justice system</a> and other existing improvement plans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify and understand the needs of children in the justice system within the cohort, and the priorities to support good outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the key risks, issues and challenges, as well as key milestones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consult and co-produce.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Involve input from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://yjresourcehub.uk/participation-with-children/item/920-participation-in-practice-and-co-creation-project-peer-power-project-july-2021.html?highlight=WyJjby1wcm9kdWN0aW9uIiwiY28tcHJvZHVjdGlvbiciLCJ3aXRoIiwiY2hpbGRyZW4iLCJjaGlsZHJlbidzIiwiJ2NoaWxkcmVuIiwiY2hpbGRyZW4nIiwiY2hpbGRyZW4nLiIsImNoaWxkcmVuJ3MnIiwiY28tcHJvZHVjdGlvbiB3aXRoIiwiY28tcHJvZHVjdGlvbiB3aXRoIGNoaWxkcmVuIiwid2l0aCBjaGlsZHJlbiJd" rel="external">children</a> and families, enabling the voice of the child and user feedback and participation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consult with staff and volunteers, particularly regarding, improvements to service delivery and identifying learning and development needs of the workforce to support performance improvement and better outcomes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Engage wider strategic partnerships</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the regional and national context the partnership is operating in. For example, ‘what is the strategy and vision of key stakeholders within which the youth justice plan will ‘sit’?’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look for support from the sector and take the opportunity to plan across wider areas such as your Police and Crime Commissioner area, health footprint, regional or devolved political area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take on board relevant wider strategic plans, (including perhaps your Police and Crime Plan, local authority plans (Children and Young People Plan for example), Violence Reduction Unit/Community Safety Partnership/Local Criminal Justice Board/Public Health Plans).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Share with partners for feedback and amendments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Content of the youth justice plan</h2>

<p>Statute requires the production of an annual plan, if a service is committed to a longer planning period, to align with other delivery plans, this is acceptable, but there must be an annual update on the youth justice plan submitted to the Youth Justice Board (YJB).</p>

<p>Youth justice services are asked to ensure that the information contained is clear and succinct. If there is no information available, that should be acknowledged. Plans should be written in Word. If information is included that is not part of the structured template, this can be added as an appendix.</p>

<p>Plans will cover both strategic and operational elements. The wider strategic picture should be captured, whilst outlining also the key business activities that will be undertaken by services to achieve wider strategic aims.</p>

<p>The plan should seek to include all services that contribute to the prevention of offending behaviour of children in their local area, as well as describing how the youth justice service itself operates and what functions it will carry out. This can be achieved through descriptions of operational partnership approaches across a local area, and the strategic links that underpin them.</p>

<p>The youth justice plan should set out the direction and strategy of youth justice services, describing how in particular, quality services will be provided to ensure positive outcomes for children and improvements in performance indicators, in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing first time entrants to the youth justice system</li>
  <li>reducing the use of custody</li>
  <li>reducing reoffending rates</li>
  <li>locally agreed performance indicators that evidence positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>

<p>The youth justice plan should describe how leadership and governance is set up to monitor the quality and effectiveness of youth justice services across your area.</p>

<p>The revised <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/780504/Standards_for_children_in_youth_justice_services_2019.doc.pdf" rel="external">standards for children in the youth justice system</a> were implemented in 2019 and self-assessments against these standards were carried out by all local partnerships and submitted to the YJB in 2020. The planning process for your youth justice plan should align the gaps or areas for improvement your partnership has identified through the self-assessment process and provide an outline of progress against your action plan to address areas of improvement.</p>

<p>The local governance arrangements are likely to focus on the youth justice management board or equivalent, but where appropriate descriptions of wider governance and leadership should be included.</p>

<p>Effective governance and leadership require quality information being made available to all key partners. It is important to understand the needs and diversity of the local children’s population, to devise and deliver appropriate individual and personalised services. The youth justice plan should contain information on the needs of children in the local area, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a profile of offences by children, including a breakdown by gender, age, ethnicity, looked after status, types of offences</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the needs of your cohort have been assessed to inform delivery decisions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the service demonstrates a Child First ethos and practice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In doing this you may wish to focus upon each of the four Child First tenets (outlined above) individually and consider plans to implement work within each. For example, under the first tenet, how you might plan to move away from offending behaviour programmes towards a model of working which focus on a child’s individual strengths and build positive behaviours and sense of identity.</p>

<p>Your youth justice plan should also reflect your local context. We include suggestions alongside areas where we also wish to drive improvements across the system below. Understanding approaches to these also enables us to capture emerging and existing good practice, to share more widely and to support our advice to ministers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What the staffing of the youth justice service looks like, what the workforce learning and development needs are, and how they will be met.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is known about child criminal exploitation in your area, and any initiatives or plans the partnership has in place to work together to address and prevent the harm arising from exploitation of children (information on serious violence should be considered as part of this).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is known about any groups of over-represented children in the youth justice system in your area, and any initiatives or plans the partnership has in place to work together to address this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What local partnerships are doing to ensure effective services are available for constructive resettlement for children leaving secure estate and settling back into the community or transitioning across to adult secure estate or community services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the partnership and key stakeholders regard as effective practice in youth justice and what aspects of their service delivery and design have contributed to and resulted in key achievements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How youth partnerships hold education to account over levels of exclusion from schools/colleges, referrals to Elective Home Education and the provision and delivery of EHCP’s (Education, Health and Care Plans), and how decisions are being monitored, challenged and addressed to ensure that the actions of all education establishments are appropriate and in the best interests of children.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What local partnerships are doing to prevent children who are at risk of offending from being progressed into the formal youth justice system, and what they are doing to divert children who have offended from being escalated further through the formal youth justice system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Youth justice plan structure</h2>

<p>To aid youth justice partnerships in the production of the youth justice plan, commentary against the structure has been provided below:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Introduction, vision and strategy</h3>

<p>A forward or statement introducing the plan from the Chair, or a senior representative of the local authority, confirming that the plan has been developed and agreed with youth justice partners and offers evidence of governance of the plan.</p>

<p>An executive summary, that outlines the key points in the plan, including opportunities, risks and challenges also works well. This provides a focus on key priorities going forward and key achievements from the last year.</p>

<p>Outlining the vision and strategy of the local partnership at the beginning of the plan, sets the overall tone of the narrative to follow, and gives a wider perspective to the detail of the rest of the plan. This offers the opportunity to develop your own child first vision that all partners are committed to and shapes activity towards achieving it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Local context</h3>

<p>This is an opportunity to provide information about the local context of both the service and the local delivery environment. This can include information about the known demographics of the local population, any issues and concerns that impact on children maximising their potential.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Child First</h3>

<p>The YJB is committed to the principle of Child First <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. This section can be used to demonstrate how the partnership has achieved implementing the four tenants of the Child First principles into practical service delivery. However, the principle of Child First is not limited to this section and the plan should also demonstrate how this ethos is woven throughout other elements of service delivery. If case examples are used, these should be included in an appendix.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Voice of the child <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>
</h3>

<p>The youth justice plan should include information on how the partnership works collaboratively with the child and how their voice is heard. This section should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what has been done with that information or feedback</li>
  <li>any tangible examples of how feedback from children has been used to make changes in service delivery</li>
  <li>information about the process undertaken to gather the feedback, and how that is analysed for service development.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not necessary to include individual quotes from children and their parents/carers in this section, but an additional appendix can be used to provide specific quotes if required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Governance, leadership and partnership arrangements</h3>

<p>This section should provide an overview of how the partnership is meeting statutory requirements for the oversight of youth justice services <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. Full board membership, including attendance, job title of the board member and dates of board meetings should be included in Appendix 1.</p>

<p>An account of the local governance arrangements for youth justice services should be included, outlining how the youth justice management board links in with other partnership and local governance arrangements with relevant oversight responsibilities and shared aims.</p>

<p>A description of the partnership arrangements at both an operational and strategic level, that contribute to support for children in the justice system. As a multi-agency partnership, youth justice services must contain specialists, or access to specialist provision for children being supervised, this includes the police, health, education, social work and probation as a minimum. A description of operational partnerships should include confirmation that this is the case, in addition to describing the workforce available to deliver statutory youth justice work. This section should also include information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Where the service is located within the local authority, or otherwise, and the rationale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The seniority of the youth justice service (YJS) Head of Service role, including any other lead responsibilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The full structure (appendix 2 to your plan). The structure chart should include details of the staff roles in the YJS and the reporting arrangements for the Head of Service. Information on the links to the data analyst should also be included. There should be a separate table in the appendix recording the ethnicity, sex and known disability of staff.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Resources and services</h3>

<p>Your youth justice plan will need to provide assurance that the YJB grant will be used appropriately (as described in the Terms and Condition of Grant).</p>

<p>In this section you are required to include details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how the YJB Grant will be used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>partnership resources that contribute to the aims and expected outcomes of the plan.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A description of effective and efficient use of resources should be linked to performance and outcome measures set out in the plan. e.g. ‘we use our grant, partner contributions and available resources to deliver these services and we believe they produce the following benefits and outcomes. Our performance will be improved in 2022/23 by…….’</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Progress on previous plan</h3>

<p>This section should include a commentary on performance on the key activities identified in the previous plan. Information should be provided on what activities and objectives were achieved in the preceding year. Progress should be reported on those actions that are still outstanding, or partially achieved. Any barriers to the successful completion of activities should be identified, and if still appropriate, what actions are planned to mitigate or overcome any barriers to achievement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>Performance and priorities</h3>

<p>This section should contain a summary of key performance targets, as a minimum describing what current performance looks like and what the partnership is aiming for in the future. Performance against the nationally measured targets should be captured in the plan. Partnerships should demonstrate an understanding in their plan of how they are performing in reducing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use of custody, (in both remand and sentencing)</li>
  <li>first time entrants (FTEs) to the criminal justice system</li>
  <li>reoffending</li>
  <li>over-representation within their cohort.</li>
</ul>

<p>Local performance targets are encouraged, and local data to measure these targets are also welcomed as a useful way of overcoming the challenges to delays in national data. This can include any local targets that aim to improve the outcomes for children.</p>

<p>Information should be included on how the service has achieved good performance, or what actions are planned to address any poor performance on the key performance indicators.</p>

<p>Welsh YJS’s should include their performance in relation to the Welsh blueprint in this section.</p>

<p>Capturing the key priorities for the period is an important aspect of the plan. In challenging times, focusing on key priorities and stating these in your youth justice plan helps to inform key actions in the business plan or improvement plan section.</p>

<p>Within your priorities we would be keen to understand how your youth justice plan is addressing the following:</p>

<h4>Education</h4>

<p>How the partnership is working to ensure all children known to the service are having their education needs met. This should include information of the education staffing provision in the service, and how this links with other partnership arrangements, such as voluntary sector organisations, academy trusts and the local authority and links to education representation on the board.</p>

<p>Data should be provided on how many children are not receiving their education entitlement, how many are excluded, on part time timetables or electively home educated. This data should be analysed to identify any disproportionality and care status of the child. The number of children who have Education and Health Care plans who are open to the service should be provided.</p>

<h4>Over-represented children</h4>

<p>Children from a range of backgrounds are over-represented in the youth justice system <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. Your youth justice plan should offer commentary on any data or intelligence you have about children who may be over-represented in the youth justice system in your area.</p>

<p>Nationally it is known that Black and Mixed ethnicity boys are over-represented and the recent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprobation/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/The-experiences-of-black-and-mixed-heritage-boys-in-the-youth-justice-system-thematic-report-v1.0.pdf" rel="external">HMIP thematic report</a> made a number of recommendations for local authorities, YJS partnerships and YJS managers in relation to these children. Commentary on how the service has responded to these recommendations can be included here. Information should be included on how the management board partnership is fulfilling its duties in line with the Equality Duties Act (2010) and any other work that is being planned or undertaken to address over-representation of children.</p>

<p>However, it is not only Black and Mixed ethnicity children that are over-represented, and the youth justice service should know and respond to any local concerns about all children who are over-represented. This includes, but is not limited to children looked-after, children excluded from school and Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children.</p>

<p>There should be an analysis of any data that identifies all children who are over-represented, and an outline of what plans are in place to address this, and what has been delivered for these children. Tackling over-representation should be a concern across the partnership, therefore this should not be limited to the activities of the youth justice service and can include wider activities led by other partners.</p>

<p>If there is no data to indicate any children are over-represented this should be acknowledged.</p>

<p>Whilst girls tend to be under-represented in the youth justice system, they do have a specific set of needs, and services may need to be adapted to meet the needs of the girls supervised by the service. If there are specific services or programmes that have been developed for girls, this should be included in this section.</p>

<h4>Prevention  <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>
</h4>

<p>Many partnerships are delivering early and/or targeted prevention work with children (and their parents/carers) who may be displaying behaviours associated with offending, antisocial behaviour or vulnerability, to safeguard children and promote positive outcomes to stop them entering the formal youth justice system.</p>

<p>This section can be used to set out the strategy and processes in place for prevention across the partnership. It should include how children are identified for prevention, how the service is delivered, by whom and how success is evaluated.</p>

<p>If data is available on numbers of children who receive a prevention service, this should be included here, along with a description of how this data is recorded and used.</p>

<h4>Diversion  <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>
</h4>

<p>Many partnerships are delivering diversion work with children who have committed an offence(s) to support them to avoid a criminal record and escalation into the formal youth justice system.</p>

<p>This section can be used to set out the strategy and processes in place for diversion. It should include how children are identified for diversion, how the service is delivered, by whom, how success is evaluated and what scrutiny is in place.</p>

<p>If data is available on numbers of children who receive a diversion service, this should be included here, along with a description of how this data is recorded and used.</p>

<p>In both prevention and diversion, it is recognised that some of this work may not be delivered outside the youth justice service; this activity should be included in these sections.</p>

<h4>Serious violence and exploitation</h4>

<p>The YJB’s definition of serious violence is violence against the person offences (which encompasses homicide and weapon offences), robbery and drugs offences which have a gravity score of 5 and above.</p>

<p>The YJB acknowledges the link between the exploitation of children regarding county lines and gangs and the connections with the supply of drugs and serious violence. Harm is caused, not only to the community and victims but also to the children who are often victims themselves, and as a result may become drawn into criminal activity.</p>

<p>In this section services are invited to include information about their activities to address serious violence and county lines. This should include any strategic links to wider partnership arrangements. In addition, any learnings from past serious incidents, such as use of the National Referral Mechanism, if applicable, should be included in this section.</p>

<p>Any work being completed across the partnership as a result of, or to prevent, radicalisation or extremist activity should be included in this section.</p>

<p>If data is available about the details of children involved in serious violence and offence type, then that should also be included here.</p>

<p>Whilst not applicable to all children who are subject to Release Under Investigation (RUI) arrangements, a number of these investigations will relate to serious violence. This section should address what work is being completed across the partnership in relation to children subject to RUI.</p>

<h4>Constructive resettlement and the use of custody (including remands)</h4>

<p>The use of custody has decreased significantly over the past ten years and this is rightly a success in the youth justice system. When children do go to custody it can have a damaging effect on their lives, disrupting education and straining family relationships. Children in custody are likely to be amongst the most complex and vulnerable children in society. Therefore, even in services where custody rates are low, reference should be made to strategic planning, including work across the partnership for these children and any analysis completed on their needs.</p>

<p>This section can include what work the partnership has achieved in implementing the principles of constructive resettlement in practice, and how they plan to implement the constructive resettlement approach in the future. Case examples can be included as an appendix.</p>

<p>The proportion of children on remand rose during 2020/21 and reference to any children subject to remand should be referenced in this section, and if data is available, this should be included. This data should include the age, gender and ethnicity of the child. Information should be included on any strategic plans being delivered across the partnership to reduce the use of remands.</p>

<p>Children leaving custody often face particular challenges in relation to suitable accommodation and this section should include information about how the partnership meets the accommodation needs of children, both leaving custody and those who are in the community.</p>

<h4>Restorative justice and victims</h4>

<p>Restorative justice empowers victims and gives them a voice in the criminal justice process, helping them to move on with their lives. Youth justice services provide services to victims to participate in restorative services and help the child to make amends. In this section information should be included on the strategic process for victim’s participation in restorative services, including services where there is no direct victim. If data is available, the uptake of the offer to victims and satisfaction rates.</p>

<p>Victims should also be considered when planning for their safety and there should also be consideration of the child’s past experience of being a victim and any potential future concern.</p>

<h4>Standards for children in the justice system</h4>

<p>Your youth justice plan should include Information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the findings from your most recent standards for children in justice self-assessments</li>
  <li>actions completed to address gaps found in internal audits</li>
  <li>progress to date against your standards for children in justice action plan</li>
  <li>planned activity for the coming year.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Challenges, risks and issues</h4>

<p>This section should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an outline of current challenges, risks and issues to local youth justice services</li>
  <li>what actions are being taken to address existing issues and challenges</li>
  <li>what proposed action may be needed to address potential risks should they emerge</li>
</ul>

<h4>Service improvement plan</h4>

<p>It is important during the preparation of your youth justice plan that you consider and capture detail around the following:</p>

<h4>Service Improvement</h4>

<p>What key improvements to youth justice services and outcomes for children are needed and how they will be delivered? You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What benefits will be delivered and what success will look like?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What support is needed to improve?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will <a class="govuk-link" href="https://yjresourcehub.uk/youth-justice-sector-improvement-partnership.html" rel="external">sector support</a> be used to improve?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/966200/YJB_Strategic_Plan_2021_-_2024.pdf" rel="external">YJB Strategic Plan 2021-24</a> will influence your local plan?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As part of this consideration, your youth justice plan must present progress against key findings from any relevant local inspections, HMI Probation thematics, reviews or learning exercises that have taken place in the last 18 months including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>learning from any serious incident reviews reported locally</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improvement actions from HMIP inspections, including thematics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improvement actions from other relevant inspections of statutory partners that may impact on youth justice services.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Workforce Development</h4>

<p>What development of the workforce in 2022/23 and beyond looks like? An analysis of the workforce development needs of the staff in the service and the plans to delivery and training and development in the next year. Information should be included on any training or developments that have been delivered in the past year and how this has impacted on service delivery.</p>

<h4>Board Development</h4>

<p>The YJB expects local management boards to take responsibility for all aspects of youth justice service governance; to lead strategically across relevant partners and to ensure a high-quality service is provided to all children. In 2021 the YJB provided updated guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/youth-justice-service-governance-and-leadership/youth-justice-service-governance-and-leadership">youth justice service governance and leadership</a> to support this. Your youth justice plan should set out what are the plans for partnership improvements? What action will be taken?</p>

<h4>Evidence-based practice and innovation</h4>

<p>The definition of evidence-based practice is ‘integration of the best available and accessible evidence with professional expertise, in the context of working with children in contact with the youth justice system’. Its purpose is to promote effective practices and achieve positive outcomes for children. This includes systems, ways of working or specific interventions which are based on the best available research, are child focused and developmentally informed.</p>

<p>In this section examples of practice should be included that meet the definition of evidence-based practice. If there has been any evaluation, either in-house, or externally validated, this should also be included.</p>

<p>In addition, examples where there is emerging practice or innovation should be included in this section. This can include practice that has been developed in response to the specific needs of a group of children, for example young children, or children with refugee experience, or practice in response to a theme, need or behaviour. This could include responses to support prevention and diversion, build strengths, re-engaging children in services, or systems approaches to ensure good communication.</p>

<p>Examples of practice can include small changes, as well as larger projects.</p>

<h4>Looking forward</h4>

<p>This section should be used to lay out plans for your development over the next twelve months. It should be limited to your services key priority areas. The actions should be achievable to be delivered in the relevant timescales.</p>

<p>This section can also be used to identify any emerging concerns relating to the children known to youth justice, or the systems and structures that impact on their lives.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Sign off, submission and approval</h2>

<p>Youth justice plans must be agreed by your partnership and signed off by the Chair of the board before submission to the YJB.</p>

<p>Youth justice plans can be submitted to the YJB at any point, but we request that approved plans are submitted by 30 June 2022 at the latest.</p>

<p>To submit your youth justice plan you should e-mail <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CBU@yjb.gov.uk">CBU@yjb.gov.uk</a> and copy in your YJB regional lead.</p>

<p>If there is wider sign off, scrutiny or governance required for your youth justice plan taking place after the 30 June, your plan can be submitted as long as the management board Chair has approved the plan. The ‘sign off’ by the Chair is an indication that the wider management board have approved the submitted plan.</p>

<p>The YJB regional lead covering your region/Wales are available to review and consult on locally approved plans. Should feedback from them be sought, we advise consultation on a draft version take place as early as possible and before formal submission.</p>

<p>The YJB recommends that you consider the production of a summary version for the general public and a simplified and accessible version for children.</p>

<p>While the YJB provides grant to local areas, it is neither a signatory to the plan nor directly responsible for its contents. Consequently, neither the YJB nor the Ministry of Justice logo should appear on the document.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Summary outline of grant compliances</h2>

<p>The below replicates Annex 3 within the youth justice core grant terms and conditions. Grant payment is made to the local authority as one lump sum when all the compliances set out below have been met. Payment will be made on condition that the following information will be provided by the timescale indicated. A failure to provide this information could result in the YJB on behalf of the Secretary of State for Justice requiring that the grant payment be returned.</p>
