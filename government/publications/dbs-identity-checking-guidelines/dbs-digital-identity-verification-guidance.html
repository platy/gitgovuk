<p>This is the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) digital identity (ID) verification guidance.
This guidance sets out how Registered Bodies (RBs) and Responsible Organisations (ROs) can undertake digital identity verification, for the purpose of verifying an individual’s identity, as part of an application for a DBS check.
A glossary can be found at the end of this guidance document.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1.	This guidance sets out how RBs and ROs can meet their obligations under the DBS Code of Practice (for RBs), and under the Basic check processing standards (for ROs), when an RB or RO as a Relying Party uses certified identity service providers (IDSPs) for digital ID verification.</p>

<p>1.2.	The guidelines outlined within this guidance document and the corresponding operational procedures appendix are equivalent to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-identity-checking-guidelines/id-checking-guidelines-for-standardenhanced-dbs-check-applications-from-1-july-2021">the ID checking guidelines for Standard/Enhanced DBS check applications from 1 July 2021</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-check-guidance-and-policies/basic-check-id-checking-guidelines-from-1-july-2021">the Basic DBS check ID checking guidelines from 1 July 2021</a></li>
</ul>

<p>1.3.	This guidance sets out the rules and standards to validate a person’s identity, for processing Basic DBS checks (medium confidence) and Standard, Enhanced, or Enhanced with Barred Lists DBS checks (high confidence). These are the DBS’ identity evidence verification criteria.</p>

<p>1.4.	It is a legal requirement and a condition of registration for Registered Persons (or their authorised agents) to apply the identity evidence verification criteria set by DBS. If a Relying Party uses the services of another person (such as an IDSP) to verify identity, the Relying Party must ensure that those other persons are: i) suitable, ii) provide appropriate training and guidance, and iii) the person discharges their duties in accordance with DBS’s identity evidence verification criteria.</p>

<p>1.5.	The 2015 update to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/474742/Code_of_Practice_for_Disclosure_and_Barring_Service_Nov_15.pdf" rel="external">DBS code of practice</a> recognises the role of RBs in ID verification and the associated guidance published on GOV.UK. An extract from the code of practice is as follows:</p>

<p>“Identity verification Registered Bodies must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>verify the identity of the applicant prior to the submission of an application for a DBS product by following the current guidelines issued by DBS</li>
  <li>ensure that any person undertaking identity verification checks on their behalf follows the current guidelines issued by DBS</li>
  <li>make sure Lead or Countersignatories do not validate their own applications for any DBS products”</li>
</ul>

<p>1.6.	The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-check-guidance-and-policies/basic-check-processing-standards">Basic check processing standards</a> recognises the role of Responsible Organisations in identity verification and the associated guidance published on GOV.UK. An extract from the processing standards is as follows:</p>

<p>“Identity verification Responsible Organisations must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>verify the identity of the applicant prior to the submission of an application for a basic check by following the current guidelines issued by DBS.</li>
  <li>ensure that any person undertaking identity verification checks on their behalf follows the current guidelines issued by DBS.”</li>
</ul>

<p>1.7.	This guidance makes extensive reference to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-alpha-version-2">DCMS UK digital identity and attributes trust framework</a> (UKDIATF). The UKDIATF will make provision for IDSPs to be certified as providers of identity verification services.</p>

<p>1.8.	The UKDIATF also defines the organisational responsibilities of IDSPs that must be met, in order to be certified, and references the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual">Government Good Practice Guide 45</a> (GPG45) as the standard that is used to define how identities should be verified. The UKDIATF defines ‘levels of confidence’ in ID verification and defines ‘identity profiles’ that can meet the levels of confidence.
The UKDIATF is currently in draft form and will be refined and amended as we move into the live phase post-legislation. In the interim IDSPs will be certified against the most recent version of the Trust Framework available at the time of certification. This will mean using a certification body which has been accredited by the UK Accreditation Service (UKAS) against the UKDIATF.  Once certified IDSPs will be required to undertake annual surveillance audits and biennial recertification against the most recent version of the UKDIATF available at the time.</p>

<p>1.9.	DCMS recommend IDSPs monitor and feedback on the UKDIATF as it develops to ensure they can meet any additional requirements which are not part of the DBS Identity Trust Scheme during the UKDIATF’s initial phases.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Trust</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Risk assessment</h3>
<p>This guidance does not replace the Relying Party’s responsibility to carry out a risk assessment for every transaction. The Relying Party remains liable for undertaking their own due diligence. The ID verification process forms a part of the risk assessment. Certified providers must undertake their own risk assessment during the ID verification process. The use of certified IDSP’s who are providing a verified identity to the required Level of Confidence (LoC) simplifies the risk assessment process. The risk assessment will identify the LoC required and a Relying Party can rely on a verified identity from a certified IDSP as having met the required LoC. A Relying Party does not need to undertake additional due diligence on the IDSP or the verified identity if the LoC meets the required level.
The DBS sets the evidence verification criteria for relying parties, and it is for the Relying Party to ensure that third parties comply with those criteria. A Relying Party can show it has met its obligations in respect of identity verification by using a certified IDSP and demonstrating that the LoC asserted meets the risk profile.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Trusting an IDSP</h3>
<p>The DBS code of practice and Basic check processing standards supports the use of third-party identity providers for ID verification, enabling RBs and ROs to delegate the activity to third parties or customers. This guidance meets this requirement by requiring third-party providers to undertake ID verification following GPG45 and be part of a government or industry trust scheme that requires certification of IDSPs.
DBS’ scheme has adopted specific profiles of GPG45 as the basis of its ID verification requirements for IDSPs. This guidance will be compliant with the requirements of the UKDIATF.
Therefore, IDSPs that are certified and assessed to meet the terms of the UKDIATF, and whose certification includes those specific profiles, will be able to certify their compliance with this guidance. IDSPs may choose to be certified to reach GPG45 medium confidence and/or GPG45 high confidence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Certification and audit</h3>
<p>RBs and ROs must use the services of a certified IDSP. This ensures that trust in the IDSP is founded on compliance with the rules of the scheme. If RBs or ROs undertake digital ID verification using their own processes, they will be required to undergo certification as an IDSP.
More information can be found in section 3.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Using a certified IDSP</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Certified IDSPs</h3>
<p>Certified IDSPs are approved companies responsible for validating the identity of a DBS check applicant on behalf of an RB or RO, known as the Relying Party. Certification will align to the requirements and standards set out in the UKDIATF.</p>

<p>IDSPs carrying out identity verification for DBS checks must demonstrate the following through independent certification:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the requirements set out in the latest version of the UKDIATF available at the time of certification by an independent body</li>
  <li>the above certification must demonstrate the information security requirements in 3.1.1 are met</li>
  <li>the above certification must demonstrate the identity assurance requirements in 3.1.2 are met</li>
  <li>compliant with the requirements listed in section 4</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.1.1 Certified against industry standards for information security</h4>
<p>Certified companies must have appropriate information security management systems in place to look after people’s data and keep it secure.
They must be certified to confirm that they meet an industry standard for information security management. This involves demonstrating that they have adequate processes in place to look after information securely and safely, and how they set up, maintain, and continuously improve an information security management system (ISMS). The ISMS must meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013 or another recognised standard that includes all the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Certified against government standards for identity assurance</h4>
<p>Certified companies also have to be certified by an independent certification body to assure that their service meets DBS’ standards for identity assurance.
The service auditors are accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) for carrying out service assessments.
Certification will confirm the Identity Service Provider meets the requirements set out in the DBS Operational Procedures Manual. 
Further details on how organisations become certified to the UKDIATF will be communicated by DCMS during alpha and beta stages.</p>

<p>Certified IDSPs and associated authorised profiles will be published by the independent certification body.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Verifying identities</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>IDSPs</h3>
<p>Verifying an individual’s identity following GPG45 requires IDSPs to follow a process known as ‘identity checking’. This process is made up of 5 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get evidence of the claimed identity</li>
  <li>check the evidence is genuine or valid</li>
  <li>check the claimed identity has existed over time</li>
  <li>check if the claimed identity is at high risk of identity fraud</li>
  <li>check that the identity belongs to the person who’s claiming it</li>
</ul>

<p>Each step of the process is scored, and these scores are used to determine what LoC has been achieved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Identity profiles</h3>
<p>There are several ways to combine the scores you get for each part of the identity checking process. These combinations are known as identity profiles.
GPG45 has four LoCs. You are required to meet the following:</p>

<h4>4.2.1 Basic DBS check – medium confidence</h4>
<p>This is the minimum LoC required for a Basic DBS check. ROs may choose to proof individuals to the higher LoC required for a Standard, Enhanced, or Enhanced with Barred Lists DBS check.</p>

<h4>4.2.2 Standard, Enhanced, and Enhanced with Barred Lists DBS check – high confidence</h4>
<p>To meet an identity profile, your scores must be the same as, or higher than, the scores needed for each check. Do not add your scores up.
You do not need to do an activity history or identity fraud check to meet some identity profiles. DBS recommends an identity fraud check is undertaken on the claimed identity for all profiles, including those where GPG45 profile does not require it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Right to work</h3>
<p>It’s important to note that a DBS check does not provide evidence of a person’s right to work in the UK. You must do a separate check to make sure a job applicant is allowed to work in the UK which also includes roles for voluntary work. IDSPs may also be certified to undertake right to work checks. This means a single check may be used to confirm a person’s right to work eligibility and identity for a DBS check.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Additional attributes</h3>

<h4>4.4.1.	Name verification and previous names</h4>
<p>The applicant’s identity must be verified against the claimed identity’s current ‘official name’. The ‘official name’ must be used for the DBS check, and is the name on official documents the applicant may have, such as their passport.
The applicant must also declare all previous name changes to the Relying Party.</p>

<h4>4.4.2.	Current address and five-year address history</h4>
<p>The applicant’s current permanent address must be verified within 90 days of the application by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an authoritative source; or</li>
  <li>
    <p>providing documentary evidence from the list of documents set out in the following DBS ID guidelines (dependent on the level of DBS check being requested):</p>
  </li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-identity-checking-guidelines/id-checking-guidelines-for-standardenhanced-dbs-check-applications-from-1-july-2021">ID checking guidelines for Standard/Enhanced DBS check applications from 1 July 2021</a></li>

The permanent address will be the applicant’s correspondence address and where DBS will send the DBS certificate. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-unusual-addresses-guidance/dbs-unusual-addresses-guide">See further guidance on addresses</a>.
If the applicant’s current address is verified using documentary evidence as set out in the DBS Identity Guidelines then a record should be retained by the Relying Party for DBS audit purposes; specifying evidence checked by, date of check and the documents used.
For DBS checks, the applicant must also declare a minimum of 5 years’ address history to the Relying Party. 
The applicant must make sure they fill in the address part of the form correctly if they have an unusual address, for example if they live abroad, in student accommodation, or in a hostel.</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Data retention</h3>
<p>The Relying Party must maintain an audit trail showing details of each application submitted to the DBS via e-bulk; which must be kept for a minimum of 12 months and made available to the DBS if requested.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span>Choosing an identity profile</h3>
<p>GPG45 treats all profiles within a Level of Confidence as being equal. DBS recommends that the strongest piece of evidence available is used, to prove the identity exists such as the Passport, and the strongest method of matching the individual to this evidence.</p>

<p>If the applicant holds a driving licence and / or a national insurance number, the Relying Party should continue to capture this information to support the DBS matching process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span>Reusable identities</h3>
<p>IDSPs or attribute service providers that want to create a reusable digital identity or attribute service, must link the digital identity and/or attributes to an authenticator (such as a password, piece of software, or device). You must follow the guidance on using authenticators to protect an online service. This is also known as GPG44 as specified in 13.1 in the UKDIATF.</p>

<p>IDSPs protecting reusable digital identities must meet the requirements specified in GPG44 and include medium quality authenticators as a minimum.
 </p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Glossary</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Attribute service provider</h3>
<p>An attribute service provider (ASP) is a specialist data provider that may provide ‘attributes’ as part of the ID verification process. The UKDIATF may require that APs are certified under the framework. It is likely that IDSPs will use APs as part of their verification process, in which case it is likely that the IDSP certification process will include assessment of the accuracy of the attributes, rather than certification of the APs themselves.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Authoritative source</h3>
<p>An authoritative source may verify a particular piece of information about the applicant’s identity and is defined in GPG45.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Basic DBS check/certificate</h3>
<p>A Basic DBS certificate is a DBS product that shows unspent convictions and conditional cautions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Certification</h3>
<p>Independent certification builds trust that approved IDSPs will protect a DBS applicant’s privacy and keep their data safe and secure. Certification will be undertaken by an independent certification body to assure their service meets DBS’ standards for identity assurance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Disclosure and Barring Service</h3>
<p>The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) delivers disclosure and barring functions on behalf of government. This includes DBS checks for England, Wales, Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man, and barring functions for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. More information about DBS and how we work to make recruitment safer can be found on the DBS website.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Enhanced DBS check/certificate</h3>
<p>An Enhanced DBS certificate is a DBS product that shows spent and unspent convictions, cautions plus any information held by local police that is considered relevant to the role being applied for.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Enhanced with Barred Lists DBS check/certificate</h3>
<p>An Enhanced with Barred Lists DBS certificate is a DBS product that shows the same as an Enhanced DBS certificate, alongside whether the applicant is on the Adults’ Barred List, Children’s Barred List, or both.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>Good Practice Guide 45</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual">The Good Practice Guide 45 (GPG45)</a> is the government standard for identity verification, against which IDSPs will be certified.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span>Identity profile</h3>
<p>GPG45 has four levels of confidence in terms of proof of identity. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>low confidence</li>
  <li>medium confidence</li>
  <li>high confidence</li>
  <li>very high confidence</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance document refers to medium confidence and high confidence only.</p>

<p>There are several ways to combine the scores you get for each part of the identity checking process. These combinations are known as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual/identity-profiles">‘identity profiles’</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.10 </span>Identity service providers</h3>
<p>An identity service provider (IDSP) is a provider of ID verification services. In the context of this DBS guidance document, they will be certified to provide ID verification to specific levels of confidence, specified by government standards. IDSPs are sometimes referred to as ‘identity providers’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.11 </span>Identity verification</h3>
<p>Identity verification (IDV) refers to the process of proving that an identity exists and that the individual making the claim (applying for the DBS check) is the owner of the identity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.12 </span>Level of confidence</h3>
<p>Completion of the identity proofing process will result in a proof that has a ‘level of confidence’ (LoC). The higher the LoC, the stronger the evidence required to support that LoC. The evidence needed to achieve an LoC is defined within GPG45.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.13 </span>Operational procedures</h3>
<p>An appendix covering operational procedures has been included in this document for clarification on how to implement these guidelines using GPG45. The appendix aims to remove ambiguity and interpretation that exists within GPG45, to allow IDSPs to develop solutions with certainty and provide a simple reference for auditors to certify against.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.14 </span>Orchestration service provider</h3>
<p>Orchestration service providers, also known as orchestration providers, enable data to be securely shared between participants in the trust framework, through the provision of their technology infrastructure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.15 </span>Registered Body</h3>
<p>A Registered Body (RB) is an organisation registered with DBS to submit Standard, Enhanced, and Enhanced with Barred Lists DBS checks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.16 </span>Relying Party</h3>
<p>The role of Relying Party is defined in the UKDIATF. A Relying Party is an organisation that receives, interprets, and, depending on the use case, stores information received from other trust framework organisations.</p>

<p>Relying parties do not themselves need to be certified against the trust framework, but if a Relying Party uses the services of another person (such as an IDSP) to verify identity, the relying party is required to ensure that those other persons are: i) suitable, ii) provide appropriate training and guidance, and iii) the person discharges their duties in accordance with DBS’s identity evidence verification criteria. Using a certified IDSP is part of ensuring compliance with these criteria, as explained in sections 2 and 3 above.</p>

<p>The RB or RO, as appropriate, is the Relying Party when a DBS check is applied for.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.17 </span>Responsible Organisation</h3>
<p>A Responsible Organisation (RO) is an organisation or person registered with DBS to submit Basic DBS checks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.18 </span>Standard DBS check/certificate</h3>
<p>A Standard DBS certificate is a product of DBS that shows spent and unspent convictions, cautions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.19 </span>UK digital identity and attributes trust framework</h3>
<p>The UK digital identity and attributes trust framework (UKDIATF) is being implemented by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, and will be backed by legislation to enable the legal development of digital ID services. This guidance is being created in line with the UKDIATF.

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Appendix 1: Operational Procedures related to implementing these guidelines.</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Verifying identities</h3>
<p>This section should be read with reference to section 4 of the DBS digital ID verification guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Choosing an identity profile</h3>

<p>GPG45 treats all profiles within a Level of Confidence as being equal. DBS recommends that the strongest piece of evidence available is used, to prove the identity exists such as the Passport, and the strongest method of matching the individual to this evidence.</p>

<p>If the applicant holds a driving licence and / or a national insurance number, the Relying Party is requested to capture this information to support the DBS matching process. The IDSP may offer to support the Relying Party to capture these additional attributes.</p>

<h4>6.2.1.	Medium level of confidence for Basic DBS checks</h4>
<p>To achieve a ‘medium’ level of confidence, the following profiles can be used. A single document is acceptable using digital means, as long as it meets the strength, validity, and verification scores detailed below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Scoring identity evidence</h2>

<p>7.1 GPG45 provides a detailed explanation of how identity evidence is scored. This document details specific requirements applicable to DBS requirements. DBS requirements may restrict how evidence is scored or may provide specific guidance where it is considered that GPG45 does not provide sufficient clarity to enable IDSPs to operate as DBS intends.</p>

<p>7.2 IDSPs will be certified against the current published version of UKDIATF GPG45 in full and must therefore refer to the published versions of both UKDIATF and GPG45.</p>

<p>7.3 IDSPs will be required to undergo a specific audit and certification considering this OPM.</p>

<p>7.4 IDSPs must be certified by an independent certification body, such as tScheme, to assure that their service meets DBS’ standards for identity assurance. The service auditors are accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) for carrying out service assessments. Certification will confirm the IDSP meets the requirements set out in the DBS OPM.</p>

<p>7.5 The following information provides additional clarity to enable IDSPs to operate as DBS intends. Please note, headings correlate to headings within GPG45.</p>

<h4>7.5.1. Get evidence of the claimed identity:</h4>
<p>No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<h4>7.5.2. If the user has changed their name:</h4>
<p>No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<h4>7.5.3. Scoring evidence of the claimed identity:</h4>

<h4>Score 1</h4>
<p>Evidence that only score 1 are not acceptable.</p>

<h4>Score 2</h4>
<p>No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<h4>Score 3</h4>
<p>No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<h4>Score 4</h4>
<p>A UK biometric residence permit cannot be used to achieve a score of 4, as the cryptographic keys cannot currently be validated.</p>

<h4>7.5.4. Check the evidence is genuine or valid:</h4>

<h4>Score 1</h4>
<p>Evidence that only score 1 are not acceptable.</p>

<h4>Score 2</h4>
<p>If the evidence is being checked by a person, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be trained in how to detect false documents by a specialist trainer; evidence of the trainer’s specialist capability will be required to be presented to the certification auditor</li>
  <li>refresh their training at least every 3 years</li>
</ul>

<p>All other requirements are as documented in GPG45.</p>

<h4>Score 3</h4>
<p>The requirement to confirm any physical security features are genuine and assess UV or IR security features is for physical, in person checks only. 
Any evidence protected by cryptographic security features will have a score of 3 if you make sure these security features are genuine. Therefore, for a mobile based automated process you must use mobile chip checking capability to obtain a score of 3.
All requirements are as documented in GPG45.</p>

<h4>Score 4</h4>
<p>All requirements are as documented in GPG45.</p>

<h4>Document validation technology:</h4>

<p>Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-document-validation-technology/identification-document-validation-technology">Home Office Identification Document Validation Technology guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>7.5.5. Check the claimed identity has existed over time – activity history</h4>
<p>No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<h4>7.5.6. Check if the claimed identity is at higher risk of identity fraud</h4>
<p>DBS recommends an identity fraud check is undertaken on the claimed identity for all profiles, including those where GPG45 profile does not require it.</p>

<h4>7.5.7. Check that the identity belongs to the person who’s claiming</h4>
<p>DBS recommends that the highest-strength identity document available is used to prove the identity belongs to the individual claiming it.
All other requirements are as documented in GPG45.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Reusable identities</h2>

<p>IDSPs or attribute service providers who want to create a reusable digital identity or attribute service, must link the digital identity and/or attributes to an authenticator (such as a password, piece of software, or device).</p>

<p>You must follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/authentication-credentials-for-online-government-services/giving-users-access-to-online-services">guidance on using authenticators to protect an online service</a>. This is also known as GPG44.</p>

<p>IDSPs protecting reusable digital identities must meet the requirements specified in GPG44 and include medium quality authenticators as a minimum.</p>

<p>Where an IDSP is asserting an identity that is held as a reusable digital identity it is the IDSP’s responsibility to ensure that the asserted identity meets the requirements of these guidelines at the time the identity is asserted. The IDSP must ensure that a reusable digital identity is protected and that the assertion being made is valid at the time of assertion.</p>
