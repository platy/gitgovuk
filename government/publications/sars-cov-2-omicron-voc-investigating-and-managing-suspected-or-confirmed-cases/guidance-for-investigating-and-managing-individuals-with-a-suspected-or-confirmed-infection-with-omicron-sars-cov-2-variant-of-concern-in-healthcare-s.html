<p>The primary audience for this guidance is healthcare staff in England. Country specific advice may be available for each country across the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In response to the emergence and spread of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (<abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr>), precautions and actions are required in relation to the management of individuals with suspected or confirmed infection with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 and their contacts in health care settings. These individuals include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individuals confirmed to have Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2</li>
  <li>individuals with who have been identified as having suspected Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 by a testing laboratory.</li>
  <li>close contacts of suspected or confirmed cases with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 even if they are fully vaccinated and irrespective of age</li>
</ul>

<p>Precautions should also be taken to reflect entry and isolation requirements for individuals who have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">recently travelled</a> to England from another country (with specific instructions for those on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">Red list</a> and their contacts), even if they are fully vaccinated or asymptomatic.</p>

<h2>General principles relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the context of risk from Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2</h2>

<p>The following principles apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anyone seeking routine or emergency care (whether or not they present with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initial-investigation-of-possible-cases" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 symptoms</a>) should be asked about recent travel, and whether they are a close contact of a returning traveller or confirmed or suspected case of Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 infection, to determine whether they are required to isolate. This should occur even if they are fully vaccinated or aged under 18 years and 6 months</li>
  <li>anyone with suspected or confirmed infection with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 in the community who does not require urgent care should be advised to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>healthcare workers should continue to follow the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control">Infection prevention and control for seasonal respiratory infections in health and care settings (including SARS-CoV-2) for winter 2021 to 2022</a> and guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed patients and residents in health and social care settings</a>
</li>
  <li>commonly used <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> assays should continue to be used for testing patients for COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<h2>Entry and isolation guidance</h2>

<p>Travel measures to reduce risk to the UK against new international variants may change over time. For guidance on entry and isolation requirements for travel to England from another country, refer to the following <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Individuals with suspected or confirmed infection with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 seeking routine or elective care</h2>

<p>Any person with suspected or confirmed infection with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 seeking access to non-urgent outpatient, ambulatory or primary care, or elective treatment, should defer their appointment until their 10-day isolation period has ended, unless their need is considered urgent (see below).</p>

<h2>Individuals with suspected or confirmed infection with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 seeking emergency care</h2>

<p>Any person with suspected or confirmed infection with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 who requires urgent care should continue to access emergency NHS services whether for COVID-19 symptoms or for non-COVID reasons.</p>

<p>Regardless of the reason for their presentation, vaccination status or age, these individuals requiring emergency admission or care should immediately be isolated in a single room with en-suite bathroom facilities and tested for COVID-19 using a standard <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. They should remain in a single room under strict isolation for the duration of their isolation period.</p>

<p>Information on dates and places of travel, and any contact with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be recorded. Healthcare staff should ensure systems are in place that enable these cases to be easily flagged and identified.</p>

<h2>Individuals with suspected infection with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 admitted to hospital with a negative test on admission</h2>

<p>Individuals with suspected infection with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 should be managed in isolation in a single room with en-suite bathroom facilities, and with appropriate infection control procedures, for the duration of their isolation period, even if they test negative on admission.</p>

<p>Subsequent testing should be according to NHS testing regimes while in hospital. If the patient develops new symptoms compatible with COVID-19, they should be tested again immediately.</p>

<h2>Management of individuals with confirmed infection with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 at or during their admission</h2>

<p>If an individual has confirmed infection with Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2, hospitals should notify their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team">regional health protection team</a> with the details of these individuals for further public health follow up and contact tracing.</p>

<p>Further support for queries regarding risk assessment and case-management may be obtained from the local or regional specialist infectious diseases centre.</p>
