<h2>CHW1. Sponsoring a Charity Worker: overview</h2>

<p>This section provides an overview of the Charity Worker route, the sponsorship requirements you must meet, and other ways voluntary workers can come to the UK.</p>

<h3>What is the Charity Worker route?</h3>

<p>CHW1.1. The Charity Worker route is for voluntary workers aged 18 or over who wish to come to the UK to do temporary unpaid charity work for a recognised charitable organisation. It does not include those doing paid work.</p>

<p>CHW1.2. Charity Workers can bring their family members (dependent partner and dependent children) to the UK, if they meet the relevant immigration requirements for dependants.</p>

<p>CHW1.3. 12 months is the maximum permitted period in the UK on this route. It is not a route to settlement.</p>

<h3>Who needs to be sponsored on the Charity Worker route?</h3>

<p>CHW1.4.	You will need to sponsor any foreign national to do voluntary work for you if they are not a ‘settled worker’ or do not otherwise have immigration permission to work for you in the UK. This includes most <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU, EEA</a> and Swiss nationals who arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>CHW1.5.	You do not have to sponsor certain categories of people, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Irish citizens (with very limited exceptions)</li>
  <li>EU, EEA and Swiss citizens (and their eligible family members) who have been granted status under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>people with indefinite leave to enter or remain in the UK (also known as ‘settlement’)</li>
</ul>

<p>CHW1.6.	This is not a complete list. For further information on who does, and does not, need sponsorship, see section S1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#who-needs">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>What are the sponsorship requirements for Charity Workers?</h3>

<p>CHW1.7.	If you wish to sponsor a Charity Worker, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold a <a class="govuk-link" href="#CHW2">valid Temporary Worker sponsor licence</a> for the Charity Worker route</li>
  <li>understand <a class="govuk-link" href="#What-is-the-Charity-Worker-route">what the Charity Worker route is</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#eligible">who you can sponsor</a> on this route</li>
  <li>understand the general requirements for sponsoring workers – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>
</li>
  <li>satisfy yourself the worker will be able to meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#CHW3">immigration requirements</a> for this route</li>
  <li>assign a <a class="govuk-link" href="#CHW4">valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)</a> to the person you wish to sponsor and pay the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">relevant CoS fee</a>
</li>
  <li>keep records for each person you sponsor – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keep-records-for-sponsorship-appendix-d">Appendix D</a> to the sponsor guidance</li>
  <li>have eligible ‘key personnel’ in place to manage your licence and assign CoS to workers – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence-accessible-version#L4">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a> for guidance on key personnel</li>
  <li>understand and comply with all of your sponsor duties – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other ways voluntary workers can come to the UK</h3>

<p>CHW1.8.	People in the UK as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor-visa">Standard Visitors</a> can do volunteering while visiting the UK, provided it lasts no more than 30 days in total and is for a charity that is registered with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission">Charity Commission for England and Wales</a>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.charitycommissionni.org.uk/" rel="external">Charity Commission for Northern Ireland</a>, or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.oscr.org.uk/" rel="external">Scottish Charity Regulator</a>.</p>

<p>CHW1.9.	You should note that people who enter the UK as Visitors cannot <a class="govuk-link" href="#Switching">‘switch’ to the Charity Worker route</a> while they are in the UK. If you decide you wish to sponsor such a person on the Charity Worker route, they will need to leave the UK and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk">apply for entry clearance</a>.</p>

<h2>CHW2. How to get a Charity Worker sponsor licence</h2>

<p>This section tells you about the requirements you must meet to be eligible for a Charity Worker sponsor licence.</p>

<p>CHW2.6. If you are applying under a different name to the one under which you are registered as a charity, you must either tell us the name under which you are registered so we can conduct our online check, or submit evidence of your registration.</p>

<h2>CHW3. Immigration requirements for Charity Workers</h2>

<p>This section tells you the immigration requirements Charity Workers must meet and where you can find further information.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>CHW3.1.	People who wish to come to the UK on the Charity Worker route must meet the requirements in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules">Appendix Temporary Work - Charity Worker</a> to the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>CHW3.2.	These requirements include that the applicant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has a valid <a class="govuk-link" href="#CHW4">Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)</a> issued by an <a class="govuk-link" href="#CHW2">approved sponsor</a> to do <a class="govuk-link" href="#eligible">eligible charity work</a>
</li>

</li>

</li>
  <li>is not subject to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Cooling-off-period">‘cooling-off period’</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>CHW3.3.	This is not a full list of requirements – you must refer to the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Immigration Rules</a> for these.</p>

<h3>Eligible charity work</h3>

<p>CHW3.4. You can only sponsor people on this route to do voluntary fieldwork directly related to the purpose of your charity. This means activities which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are not paid or otherwise remunerated (including receipt of benefits in kind) except for reasonable expenses; and</li>
  <li>contribute directly to the achievement or advancement of your charitable purpose</li>
</ul>

<p>CHW3.5. You must not use the Charity Worker route to sponsor workers who will be doing mainly routine activities, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>back-office administrative work</li>
  <li>retail or other sales roles</li>
  <li>fundraising</li>
  <li>maintenance of your offices and other assets</li>
</ul>

<p>CHW3.6. You must not use this route to sponsor workers to fill a permanent vacancy. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes sponsoring individuals on a temporary basis to fill a vacancy for which there is a permanent, ongoing need.</p>

<h4>Payment and expenses</h4>

<p>CHW3.7. You must not offer the individual any pay or remuneration, including benefits in kind, other than reasonable expenses as outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/39/section/44" rel="external">section 44 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998</a> (as amended from time to time).</p>

<p>CHW3.8. If we find out that you are paying or remunerating the individual otherwise than in accordance with section 44 of the National Minimum Wage Act, we will revoke your sponsor licence.</p>

<h3>Financial requirement</h3>

<p>CHW3.9. The applicant must show they have enough funds to support themselves and any family members in the UK.</p>

<p>CHW3.10. If you are an A-rated sponsor, you can certify this requirement is met when you assign a CoS to them (also known as ‘certifying maintenance’). Otherwise, the applicant must provide evidence of funds as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-finance">Appendix Finance</a> to the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>CHW3.11. For further information, see section S7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>Age requirement</h3>

<p>CHW3.12. All applicants applying on the Charity Worker route from 11 October 2021 must be aged at least 18 on the date of application.</p>

<p>CHW3.13. There was no minimum age requirement for applicants applying before 9 a.m. on 11 October 2021. If you are sponsoring a worker aged under 18 (where this was permitted when they applied for permission), you must have regard to your safeguarding children duty – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence-accessible-version#safeguarding">section L2</a> of Part 1: Apply for a licence for information on this requirement.</p>

<h3>Entry requirement</h3>

<p>CHW3.14. Applicants must apply for entry clearance (a visa) to be able to come to the UK on this route. If they arrive in the UK without the relevant visa, they will be refused entry, even if they otherwise meet the requirements.</p>

<p>CHW3.15. If the applicant is applying for entry clearance, you should check they are not subject to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Cooling-off-period">‘cooling-off period’</a>.</p>

<h3>Extension of permission</h3>

<p>CHW3.16. Those already in the UK with permission on the Charity Worker route can apply to extend their stay, up to the maximum permitted period of 12 months, if they meet the relevant requirements. See section S9 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for further information on extension applications.</p>

<h3>‘Switching’</h3>

<p>CHW3.17. Individuals in the UK on another immigration route are not permitted to switch (change immigration category) to the Charity Worker route. If you wish to sponsor a person on the Charity Worker route but they are in the UK on another route, they must leave the UK and apply for entry clearance from overseas.</p>

<h3>How long Charity Workers can stay</h3>

<p>CHW3.18. If the applicant makes a successful application for entry clearance on the Charity Worker route, they will be granted for whichever is the shortest of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the period of charity work stated on the CoS, plus up to 14 days before and 14 days after that period; or</li>
  <li>12 months</li>
</ul>

<p>CHW3.19. If the applicant makes a successful application for permission to stay on the Charity Worker route, they will be granted for whichever is the shorter of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the period of charity work stated on the CoS, plus 14 days; or</li>
  <li>12 months (including time already spent in the UK on this route)</li>
</ul>

<p>CHW3.20. 12 months is the maximum period that a person can stay in the UK on the Charity Worker route. Once a person has completed the maximum period, they must leave the UK, unless they qualify to stay in the UK on another basis. If you wish to sponsor the person again as a Charity Worker, they will need to complete a ‘cooling-off period’ before they can return to the UK.</p>

<h3>Cooling-off period for Charity Workers</h3>

<p>CHW3.21. Before you sponsor a Charity Worker who is applying for entry clearance (not permission to stay), you should check they are not subject to the ‘cooling-off’ period. If they are, we will refuse their application.</p>

<p>CHW3.22. The cooling-off period applies if, during the 12 months immediately before their application for entry clearance, the applicant was in the UK with permission on either the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Glossary">Charity Worker route</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-sponsor-a-minister-of-religion-or-religious-worker">Religious Worker route</a> (including their predecessor routes).</p>

<p>CHW3.23. If the cooling-off period applies, the applicant will not be eligible for a further grant of entry clearance in either route until 12 months have passed since either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date their last permission on either the Charity Worker or Religious Worker route expired</li>
  <li>the date they last left the UK, if they can show this was earlier than the date their permission on the Charity Worker or Religious Worker route expired.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CHW4. Certificate of Sponsorship for Charity Workers</h2>

<p>This section tells you how to assign a valid Certificate of Sponsorship on the Charity Worker route.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>CHW4.1. If you have followed all the rules in this guidance and you wish to sponsor a person on the Charity Worker route, you must assign them a valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), using your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">sponsorship
management system (SMS)</a> account.</p>

<p>CHW4.2. Before assigning a CoS, you should satisfy yourself that the worker can meet the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="#CHW3">immigration requirements</a>.</p>

<p>CHW4.3. You cannot assign a CoS if you’re a B-rated sponsor, unless you sponsored the application which led to the worker’s last grant of permission and you’re continuing to sponsor them. In all other cases, you must have an A-rating. For information on sponsor ratings, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a>.</p>

<p>CHW4.4. For detailed information on what a CoS is, and how many you can
assign, see section S2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<p>CHW4.5. You can find detailed technical guidance on how to assign a CoS on
GOV.UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sponsorship-information-for-employers-and-educators#user-manuals:-sponsorship-management-system-(sms)">User manuals: sponsorship management system (SMS)</a> – see in particular manual 8.</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>CHW4.6. You must pay a fee for each CoS you assign – see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">UK visa fees</a> page on GOV.UK for information on current fee levels.</p>

<h3>Use of the CoS</h3>

<p>CHW4.7. Once you have assigned a CoS, the worker must use it within 3 months to apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>entry clearance (a visa) if they are outside the UK</li>
  <li>permission to stay if they are in the UK and eligible to extend their permission on the Charity Worker route</li>
</ul>

<p>CHW4.8. If the CoS was issued more than 3 months before the date of application, we may reject their application and not consider it.</p>

<p>CHW4.9. The worker must not apply for a visa or permission to stay more than 3 months before the start date recorded on their CoS. If they do, we will refuse their application.</p>

<p>CHW4.10. We will also refuse the application if the CoS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has been withdrawn by you or cancelled by the Home Office – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#Cancelling-or-withdrawing-a-CoS">section S6</a> of Part 2: Sponsor a worker for information on when a CoS can be withdrawn or cancelled</li>
  <li>was used in a previous application that was refused</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the CoS must confirm</h3>

<p>CHW4.11.	For a CoS to be valid, it must meet the requirements of paragraphs CW 4.1 to CW 4.4 in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Appendix Temporary Work - Charity Worker</a>.</p>

<p>CHW4.12.	By assigning a CoS on the Charity Worker route, you guarantee that the worker:</p>

<ul>
  <li>genuinely intends, and is able, to undertake the role for which they are being sponsored</li>
  <li>will be doing <a class="govuk-link" href="#eligible">eligible charity work</a>
</li>
  <li>does not intend to undertake employment other than:
    <ul>
      <li>the charity work for which they are being sponsored</li>
      <li>additional voluntary work, provided it meets the <a class="govuk-link" href="#eligible">definition of charity work</a> in this guidance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>will comply with the conditions of their permission to enter or stay – see section S8 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for further information</li>
  <li>will leave the UK when their permission ends unless they qualify for an extension of stay or permission on another immigration route</li>
</ul>

<p>CHW4.13. The CoS must confirm all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that you are sponsoring the worker on the Charity Worker route</li>
  <li>the worker’s personal information (such as name, date of birth, nationality), passport details and contact details</li>
  <li>the start and end date of the charity work – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#start">Part 2: sponsor a worker</a> for information on start and end dates</li>
  <li>where the worker will carry out their charity work – this should include their main work address and any other regular work addresses, if relevant</li>
  <li>whether the worker was sourced through an agent and, if so, details of that agent</li>
  <li>the job title</li>
  <li>the relevant occupation code for the role (choose from the drop-down list under ‘Job type’) – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#occupation-code">Part 2: sponsor a worker</a> for information on occupation codes</li>
  <li>the main duties of the role for which the worker is being sponsored</li>
  <li>whether you wish to <a class="govuk-link" href="#financial">certify maintenance</a> for the worker (and, if relevant, their dependants) – you can only do this if you’re an A-rated sponsor</li>
  <li>that there is no pay for the voluntary work (except reasonable expenses outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/39/section/44" rel="external">section 44 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting duties and record keeping</h3>

<p>CHW4.14. Once you have assigned a CoS to a worker, you must tell us if they fail to start their employment, are absent without permission, or there are any significant changes to the nature of their work, or to your organisation. For full details of your reporting and other duties,  see: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>.</p>

<p>CHW4.15. You must also keep records for each worker you sponsor as specified in
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keep-records-for-sponsorship-appendix-d">Appendix D</a> to the sponsor guidance.</p>

<p>CHW4.16. If you fail to meet these duties, we may revoke your sponsor licence.</p>
