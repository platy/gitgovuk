<h2>Chapter 2: Preventing, reducing or delaying needs</h2>

<h3>Paragraph 2.51</h3>

<p>…(also see chapter 6, paras. 6.44 to 6.53, about the whole family approach to assessment)</p>

<p>now reads:</p>

<p>…(also see chapter 6, paras. 6.65 to 6.71, about the whole family approach to assessment)</p>

<h3>Paragraph 2.60 changed from:</h3>

<p>‘2.60 The regulations require that intermediate care and reablement provided up to 6 weeks, and minor aids and adaptations up to the value of £1,000 must always be provided free of charge (see also 8.14).’</p>

<p>to:</p>

<p>‘2.60 The regulations require that intermediate care and reablement must be provided free of charge for up to 6 weeks, as must  aids and minor adaptations (ie. adaptations up to the value of £1,000) (see also 8.14).’</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Assessment and eligibility</h2>

<h3>Paragraph 6.71 has been split into 2 separate paragraphs 6.71 and 6.72</h3>

<p>6.72 Inappropriate caring responsibilities should be considered as anything which is likely to have an impact on the child’s health, wellbeing or education, or which can be considered unsuitable in light of the child’s circumstances and may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal care such as bathing and toileting</li>
  <li>carrying out strenuous physical tasks such as lifting</li>
  <li>administering medication</li>
  <li>maintaining the family budget</li>
  <li>emotional support to the adult</li>
</ul>

<p>All preceding paragraph numbers updated to reflect this change.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 6.99</h3>

<p>The last sentence: ‘What is the national eligibility threshold for adults needing care?’ has been changed to a heading.</p>

<h3><span class="number">6.121 </span></h3>

<p>The following text was deleted</p>

<p>6.121	The following section of the guidance provides examples of how local authorities should consider the outcomes set out in the Eligibility Regulations when they determine whether a carer meets the eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>To be eligible, a carer must be unable to achieve any of the following outcomes as a result of their caring duties:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>a)	carrying out any caring responsibilities the carer has for a child</li>
  <li>b)	local authorities should consider any parenting or other caring responsibilities the carer has for a child in addition to their caring role for the adult. For example, the carer might be a grandparent with caring responsibilities for their grandchildren while the grandchildren’s parents are at work.</li>
  <li>c)	providing care to other persons for whom the carer provides care</li>
  <li>d)	Local authorities should consider any additional caring responsibilities the carer may have for other adults. For example, a carer may also have caring responsibilities for a parent in addition to caring for the adult with care and support needs.</li>
  <li>e)	maintaining a habitable home environment</li>
  <li>f)	local authorities should consider whether the the carer is able to maintain a safe home which is an appropriate environment to live in and whether it presents a significant risk to the carer’s wellbeing. A habitable home should be safe and have essential amenities such as water, electricity and gas.</li>
  <li>g)	managing and maintaining nutrition</li>
  <li>h)	local authorities should consider whether the carer has the time to do essential shopping and to prepare meals for themselves and their family</li>
  <li>i)	developing and maintaining family or other significant personal relationships</li>
  <li>j)	local authorities should consider whether the carer is in a position where their caring role prevents them from maintaining key relationships with family and friends or from developing new relationships where the carer does not already have other personal relationships</li>
  <li>k)	engaging in work, training, education or volunteering</li>
  <li>l)	local authorities should consider whether the carer can continue in their job, and contribute to society, apply themselves in education, volunteer to support civil society or have the opportunity to get a job, if they are not in employment</li>
  <li>m)	making use of necessary facilities or services in the local community</li>
  <li>n)	local authorities should consider whether the carer has an opportunity to make use of the local community’s services and facilities and for example consider whether the carer has time to use recreational facilities such as gyms or swimming pools.</li>
  <li>o)	engaging in recreational activities</li>
  <li>p)	local authorities should consider whether the carer has leisure time, which might for example be some free time to read or engage in a hobby</li>
</ol>

<p>And replaced with:</p>

<p>6.123 The following section of the guidance provides examples of how local authorities should consider the outcomes set out in the Eligibility Regulations when they determine whether a carer meets the eligibility criteria. To be eligible, a carer must be unable to achieve any of the following outcomes:</p>

<p>(i) carrying out any caring responsibilities the carer has for a child
Local authorities should consider any parenting or other caring responsibilities the carer has for a child in addition to their caring role for the adult. For example, the carer might be a grandparent with caring responsibilities for their grandchildren while the grandchildren’s parents are at work.</p>

<p>(ii) providing care to other persons for whom the carer provides care Local authorities should consider any additional caring responsibilities the carer may have for other adults. For example, a carer may also have caring responsibilities for a parent in addition to caring for the adult with care and support needs.</p>

<p>(iii) maintaining a habitable home environment
Local authorities should consider whether the condition of the carer’s home is safe and an appropriate environment to live in and whether it presents a significant risk to the carer’s wellbeing. A habitable home should be safe and have essential amenities such as water, electricity and gas.</p>

<p>(iv) managing and maintaining nutrition
Local authorities should consider whether the carer has the time to do essential shopping and to prepare meals for themselves and their family.</p>

<p>(v) developing and maintaining family or other significant personal relationships
Local authorities should consider whether the carer is in a position where their caring role prevents them from maintaining key relationships with family and friends or from developing new relationships where the carer does not already have other personal relationships.</p>

<p>(vi) engaging in work, training, education or volunteering
Local authorities should consider whether the carer can continue in their job, and contribute to society, apply themselves in education, volunteer to support civil society or have the opportunity to get a job, if they are not in employment.</p>

<p>(vii) making use of necessary facilities or services in the local community
Local authorities should consider whether the carer has an opportunity to make use of the local community’s services and facilities and for example consider whether the carer has time to use recreational facilities such as gyms or swimming pools.</p>

<p>(viii) engaging in recreational activities
Local authorities should consider whether the carer has leisure time, which might for
example be some free time to read or engage in a hobby.</p>

<p>As a consequence of that fact there is, or there is likely to be, a significant impact on the carer’s wellbeing</p>

<h3>Paragraph 6.128</h3>

<p>The following text has been removed from ‘Outcomes’ and moved to ‘Wellbeing’</p>

<ul>
  <li>control by the individual over day-to-day life (including over care and support provided and the way it is provided)</li>
  <li>participation in work, education, training or recreation</li>
  <li>social and economic wellbeing</li>
  <li>domestic, family and personal relationships</li>
  <li>suitability of living accommodation</li>
  <li>the individual’s contribution to society</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 8: Charging and financial assessment</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">23 February </span> 2017</h3>

<p>Added new bullet point in 15)
(c)      War Pension Scheme payments made to veterans with the exception of Constant Attendance Allowance payments</p>

<p>Add paragraph 8.21a</p>

<p>Add new bullet point in 29)
(l)      Payments made to Veterans under the War Pension Scheme with the exception of Constant Attendance Allowance</p>

<h4>Paragraph 8.34 changed from:</h4>

<p>8.34 Where a person is a temporary or short-term resident in a care home, a local authority may choose to charge based on its charging policies outside of a care home. For example, where a person is resident in order to receive respite care, for the first 8 weeks a local authority may choose to charge based on its approach to charging for those receiving care and support in other settings or in their own home.</p>

<p>to:</p>

<p>8.34 Where a person is a short-term or temporary resident there is a degree of discretion or modified charging rules to take account of this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a short-term resident is someone provided with accommodation in a care home for a period not exceeding 8 weeks, for example where a person is placed in a care home to provide respite care. Where a person is a short-term resident a local authority may choose to assess and charge them based on the rules for care or support arranged other than in a care home.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a temporary resident is someone whose stay in a care home is unlikely to exceed 52 weeks or, in exceptional circumstances, is unlikely to substantially exceed 52 weeks. Because a temporary resident is expected to return home their main or only home is usually disregarded in the assessment of whether and what they can afford to pay. In addition, for example, certain housing-related costs are also disregarded in the financial assessment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter 9: Deferred payment agreements</h2>

<p>21 October 2016: paragraph 9.67 changed from:</p>

<p>9.67 The national maximum interest rate will change every 6 months on the first of January and July respectively, to track the market gilts rate specified in the most recently published report by the Office of Budget Responsibility. This is currently published in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which is usually published twice-yearly alongside the Budget and Autumn Statement. Local authorities must ensure that any changes to the national maximum rate are reflected within their authority and are applied to any agreements they have entered into (unless they are already charging less than the national maximum). Individual agreements must also contain adequate terms and conditions to ensure that the interest rate within any given agreement does not exceed the nationally-set maximum.</p>

<p>to:</p>

<p>9.67 The national maximum interest rate will change every 6 months on the first of January and July respectively, to track the market gilts rate specified in the most recently published report by the Office of Budget 
Responsibility (<abbr title="Office of Budget Responsibility">OBR</abbr>) plus a 0.15% default component (for example, gilt rate 1% plus 0.15% equals a maximum interest rate of 1.15%). The market gilt rate is currently published in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which is usually published twice-yearly alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/efo/economic-fiscal-outlook-march-2016/" rel="external">Budget and Autumn Statement</a> on the <abbr title="Office of Budget Responsibility">OBR</abbr> website. The web page shows the latest statement but past statements can be found by clicking on ‘choose’ under the ‘previous forecasts’ heading on the page. The market gilt rate figures are near the bottom of the table: Determinants of the fiscal forecast.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Local authorities must ensure that any changes to the national maximum rate are reflected within their authority and are applied to any agreements they have entered into (unless they are already charging less than the national maximum). Individual agreements must also contain adequate terms and conditions to ensure that the interest rate within any given agreement does not exceed the nationally-set maximum.</p>
</div>

<h2>Chapter 18: 	Delegation of local authority functions</h2>

<p>26 October 2016: paragraph 18.5 changed from:</p>

<p>18.5	The power to delegate functions in the Care Act does not supersede the pre-existing ability for NHS and local authorities to enter into prescribed partnership arrangements under Section 75 NHS Act 2006. This means that local authorities can enter into partnership arrangements with the NHS for the NHS to carry out a local authority’s ‘health-related functions’ (as defined in the NHS Bodies and Local Authorities Partnership Arrangement Regulations 2000). This effectively authorises NHS bodies to exercise those prescribed functions, including the safeguarding functions that local authorities are prohibited from delegating under the Care Act (see below). In fact all care and support functions under the Care Act can be included in such partnership arrangements except charging, carrying out financial assessments and debt recovery. However, the local authority would still remain legally responsible for how its functions are carried out via partnership arrangements, as with delegated functions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19: Ordinary residence</h2>

<p>Chapter 19 has been updated to include the Department of Health’s position on the determination of questions of ordinary residence referred to the Secretary of State under section 40 of the Care Act 2014, following the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Cornwall Council v Secretary of State for Health and Others (Cornwall).</p>

<p>The previous version of the Care Act guidance is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160808114441/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/care-act-statutory-guidance/care-and-support-statutory-guidance" rel="external">National archives</a> website</p>

<h2>Chapter 22: Sight registers</h2>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>17 August 2017: Added to end of paragraph 22.4:</p>

<p>If the person consents to registration they will be included on the local authority’s register and be provided with a registration card. The registers can also be used by the local authority to ensure information about services is made accessible to that person for example to ask if support could be given to assist them to participate in electoral events.</p>

<p>Qualifying phrase added to second sentence of paragraph 22.5, which now reads:</p>

<p>22.5 The Certificate of Vision Impairment (CVI) formally certifies someone as being sight impaired or as severely sight impaired. Where the patient has given their consent, a copy of the CVI should be sent to the relevant local authority by the hospital staff. However, people in receipt of a CVI should not be added to the local register until they have given their specific consent to the local authority for registration. If the person has given consent he or she may then be registered. Local authorities may take the date of certification given on the CVI as the effective date of registration. However, if consent has not been given, the person should still be offered a needs assessment.</p>

<p>Last sentence of paragraph 22.7 deleted. The paragraph now reads:</p>

<p>22.7 People who agree to be registered may be entitled to some benefits, for example, an increase in personal tax allowance, a reduction in the cost of a TV license, a free bus pass and parking concessions under the Blue Badge Scheme. It is important that strong links exist between local authorities, health services and voluntary organisations to identify those who may benefit from registration.</p>

<h3>Certification</h3>

<p>Qualifying phrase added to second sentence of paragraph 22.11, which now reads:</p>

<p>22.11 It is expected that NHS services will keep the completed certificate, signed by the consultant and the patient, for their records. Where the patient has given their consent, a copy of the certificate should be sent to the relevant local authority and the patient’s GP within 5 working days of its completion. The ‘Certificate of Vision Impairment Explanatory Notes for Consultant Ophthalmologists and Hospital Eye Clinic Staff provides information on this.</p>

<p>Qualifying phrase added to second sentence of paragraph 22.12, which now reads:</p>

<p>22.12 The Public Health Outcomes Framework (Domain 4: Healthcare public health and preventing premature mortality) has the overarching objective to reduce numbers of people living with preventable ill health and people dying prematurely and has the ‘preventable sight loss’ indicator. The CVI is the key data source for the preventable sight loss indicator and, where the patient has given their consent, a copy of the form is also sent to Moorfields Eye Hospital for epidemiological analysis of cases where sight loss is due to age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and any other cause.</p>

<p>Paragraph 22.13 has been updated, it now reads:</p>

<p>22.13 The Certifications Office at Moorfields Eye Hospital receives the CVIs from hospitals across England and Wales for anonymised analysis by age, sex, visual status, location and ethnicity. These figures are reported to Public Health England so for example, diabetic screening programmes can monitor the numbers of newly certified people in their areas with potentially avoidable eye disease. NHS Digital (previously the Health and Social Care Information Centre) will be issuing their latest report on certification data covering the period 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017 in the latter part of 2017.</p>

<h3>Making contact</h3>

<p>Minor deletion to paragraph 22.16, which now reads:</p>

<p>22.16 Upon receipt of the CVI, the local authority should make contact with the person issued with the CVI within 2 weeks to arrange their inclusion on the local authority’s register (with the person’s informed consent) and offer individuals a registration card as identified on the CVI registration form. Where there is an appearance of need for care and support, local authorities must arrange an assessment of their needs in a timely manner.</p>

<h3>Rehabilitation</h3>

<p>New mention of reablement in paragraph 22.21, which now reads:</p>

<p>22.21 Local authorities should consider securing specialist qualified rehabilitation and assessment provision (whether in-house, or contracted through a third party), to ensure that the needs of people with sight loss are correctly identified and their independence maximised. Certain aspects of independence training with severely sight impaired and sight impaired people require careful risk management and should only be undertaken by professionals with relevant experience and training. This type of rehabilitation should be provided to the person for a period appropriate to meet their needs. This will help the person to gain new skills, for example, when training to use a white cane. As aspects of rehabilitation for people with sight loss are distinct from reablement,   refer to the Association of Directors of Adults Social Services’ (ADASS) position statement of December 2013.</p>

<p>Updated ‘Links to other relevant guidance and documentation’ at end of section, to include ‘Seeing it my way’ and Adult UK sight loss pathway.</p>

<p>End of 17 August update</p>

<h2>Chapter 23: 	Transition to the new legal framework</h2>

<p>Chapter 23 was fully replaced on 15 June 2022.</p>

<p>The update reflects the findings and views from stakeholders on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/operational-guidance-to-implement-a-lifetime-cap-on-care-costs">consultation on ‘supporting local preparation’ draft guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex B: Treatment of capital</h2>

<p>28 June 2017, added to the list of payments that must be disregarded as capital assets at (g) the following:</p>

<p>(xi)  Scottish Infected Blood Support Scheme
