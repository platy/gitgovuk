<h2>Notice under Condition GQAA1.1(b)</h2>

<p>Ofqual gives notice under Condition GQAA1.1(b) that certain Conditions in the General Qualifications Alternative Awarding (GQAA) Framework will be disapplied in respect of GQ Qualifications<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> as specified below.</p>

<p>This notice also contains transitional and saving provisions made under Condition GQAA1.2(c). An awarding organisation must comply with these transitional and saving provisions under Condition GQAA1.3.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>In summary, this notice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirms that awarding organisations may offer assessment opportunities for advanced extension award qualifications and extended project qualifications as part of the autumn / winter 2021 series</li>
  <li>removes the requirement that results for GQ Qualifications (other than in the autumn / winter series) must be determined on the basis of Teacher Assessed Grades</li>
  <li>reinstates obligations on awarding organisations in respect of the Moderation and monitoring of non-exam assessment, in accordance with the 2021 Subject Level Conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>The transitional and saving provisions ensure that any remaining appeals from the summer 2021 series will continue to be determined in accordance with the GQAA Conditions.</p>

<h3>Advanced extension award qualifications and extended project qualifications</h3>

<p>Conditions GQAA1 to GQAA6 (except Condition GQAA1.3) will be disapplied in respect of advanced extension award qualifications and extended project qualifications from 21 December 2021, subject to the transitional and saving provisions specified below.</p>

<p>Condition GQAA1.3 will remain in force to facilitate compliance with those transitional and saving provisions.</p>

<h3>GCE qualifications and GCSE Qualifications</h3>

<p>Conditions GQAA2 to GQAA4 will be disapplied in respect of GCE qualifications and GCSE Qualifications from 21 December 2021, subject to the transitional and saving provisions specified below.</p>

<p>Conditions GQAA1 and GQAA5 will remain in force in respect of GCE qualifications and GCSE Qualifications to allow for the provision of assessments under Condition GQAA5 and certificates under GQAA6.</p>

<h3>Transitional and saving provisions</h3>

<p>In respect of all GQ Qualifications, an awarding organisation must continue to comply with Conditions GQAA1, GQAA3 and GQAA4 in relation to any request for an appeal which it receives under Condition GQAA4.</p>

<p>Nothing in this notice precludes an awarding organisation from accepting, and determining, a request for an appeal made after 21 December 2021 where it considers it appropriate to do so. Where an awarding organisation accepts a request for an appeal after 21 December 2021, it must comply with Conditions GQAA1, GQAA3 and GQAA4 in relation to that appeal.</p>
