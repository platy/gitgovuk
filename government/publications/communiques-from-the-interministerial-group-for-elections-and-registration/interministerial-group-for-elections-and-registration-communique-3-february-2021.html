<p>The Interministerial Group for Elections and Registration met on 3 February 2021 by video conference.</p>

<p>The meeting was chaired by Chloe Smith MP, Minister of State for the Constitution and Devolution.</p>

<p>The attending ministers were:</p>

<p>From the UK Government:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Chloe Smith MP, Minister of State for the Constitution and Devolution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Robin Walker MP, Minister of State for Northern Ireland</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From the Scottish Government:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graeme Dey MSP, Minister for Parliamentary Business and Veterans</li>
</ul>

<p>From the Welsh Government:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Julie James MS, Minister for Housing and Local Government</li>
</ul>

<p>The chair welcomed ministers to the meeting.</p>

<p>The Group discussed and confirmed the terms of reference (TOR) for this Interministerial Group and noted that the TOR could be adjusted in the future if this is needed to incorporate new areas of discussion.</p>

<p>The Group reviewed the current position with regard to the planned elections on 6 May 2021. All administrations agreed they were aiming to hold the elections as scheduled. Ministers discussed that effective contingencies were being put in place and that appropriate support was required for the electoral sector to ensure preparedness given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. Minister Walker noted that there are no polls taking place in Northern Ireland this year but the Northern Ireland Administration elections are scheduled for next year and that the transparency and integrity of elections are important.</p>

<p>The Welsh Government updated on plans to introduce an emergency Welsh Elections (Coronavirus) Bill which puts in place contingency measures to support the handling of the Senedd elections.</p>

<p>The Scottish Government updated that the Scottish General Election (Coronavirus) Bill went through in December, shaped by dialogue with Scottish parliamentary parties and the electoral sector. Dissolution of the Scottish Parliament is set as the day before the election.</p>

<p>The Group discussed the application of covid regulations to elections and the importance of a coordinated approach across England, Wales and Scotland, and of raising awareness of the polls.</p>
