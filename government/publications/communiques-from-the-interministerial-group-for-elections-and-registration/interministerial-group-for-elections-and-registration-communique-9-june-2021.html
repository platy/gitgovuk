<p>The Interministerial Group for Elections and Registration met on 9 June 2021 by video conference.</p>

<p>The meeting was chaired by Chloe Smith MP, Minister of State for the Constitution and Devolution.</p>

<p>The attending ministers were:</p>

<p>From the UK Government:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chloe Smith MP, Minister of State for the Constitution and Devolution</li>
  <li>Robin Walker MP, Minister of State for Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>From the Scottish Government:</p>

<ul>
  <li>George Adam MSP, Minister for Parliamentary Business</li>
</ul>

<p>From the Welsh Government:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mick Antoniw MS, Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution</li>
</ul>

<p>The chair welcomed ministers to the meeting, noting for new ministers the purpose of the Interministerial Group.</p>

<p>The Group discussed the set of polls held across England, Scotland and Wales during May 2021. They discussed the additional complexities of these polls due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that additional measures were put in place by all administrations to support the delivery of these polls. The Group noted that voter turnout demonstrated that the public were engaged and had confidence that it was safe to vote. All ministers agreed that there are lessons to be learned from these polls that could help to improve the conduct of elections in the future, and that insights on this would be shared with the Group.</p>

<p>The Group discussed the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill and the potential for a UK Primary General Election to be called on the same day as (or in close proximity to) a scheduled election to the Scottish Parliament or the Senedd Cymru, which was a matter of concern for Minister Adam and Minister Antoniw. Minister Smith noted that the Government would, in deciding when to call an election, be mindful of any scheduled election in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Minister Smith introduced to the Group the measures for electoral reform being brought forward in the Elections Bill, which was announced in the Queen’s Speech on 11 May. The Group discussed the measures and the implications for devolved legislation with regards to elections. All ministers emphasised the importance of collaborative working in supporting administrators and voters. They noted that there were clear policy differences on some of the topics proposed in the Bill. Minister Adam and minister Antoniw highlighted that the Scottish and Welsh Governments were opposed to the introduction of voter identification, whilst acknowledging that the Bill restricted this change to reserved elections. Minister Walker highlighted the importance of working together on these matters and noted the successful operation of voter identification in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>In line with the Terms of Reference for the Interministerial Group on Elections, ministers agreed that they would share chairing and hosting arrangements, with the next meeting to be chaired by the Welsh Government. The next meeting will be arranged in due course.</p>
