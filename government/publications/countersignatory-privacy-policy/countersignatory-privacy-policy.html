<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> About us</h2>

<p><strong>1.1.</strong> The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) helps employers make safer recruitment decisions and prevent unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups, including children.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.</strong> A countersignatory is a person within a Registered Body. They are registered with DBS to countersign applications, in accordance with Conditions of Registration and the DBS <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-code-of-practice">Code of Practice</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.</strong> A lead countersignatory is a senior figure within a Registered Body. They are registered with DBS to countersign applications and will also oversee the DBS process within their organisation.</p>

<p>All Registered Bodies must have a lead countersignatory.</p>

<p><strong>1.4.</strong> The content of this Privacy Policy applies to both countersignatories and lead countersignatories, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h2>What is it I need to know?</h2>

<p><strong>2.1.</strong> This is our Countersignatory Privacy Policy. It tells you how we will use and protect any information we hold about you as part of your countersignatory application.</p>

<p><strong>2.2.</strong> The Policy also explains what your rights are as a countersignatory under the General Data Protection Regulation. It explains why we need your personal data, what we will do with it and what you can expect from us.</p>

<p>It also explains how to get a copy of any personal data we may hold about you. This is called a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-subject-access-request">Subject Access Request</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2.3.</strong> We do have other Privacy Policies that cover our other statutory functions. They can be accessed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-privacy-policies">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How will we use the personal information supplied to us?</h2>

<p><strong>3.1.</strong> We, at DBS, collect your personal data in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>verify your identity (this applies to lead countersignatories only – see section 3.2)</li>
  <li>assess whether you are suitable to be a countersignatory (see section 3.3)</li>
  <li>contact you regarding consideration or changes to your countersignatory application and/or registration status</li>
  <li>contact you in relation to further information that may be required on any applications you have countersigned (to either progress the application or as part of the compliance process)</li>
  <li>contact you regarding any changes you need to be aware of relating to DBS services and products</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.2. Verify your identity (lead countersignatories only)</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.2.1.</strong> The list of accepted documents to verify the identity of a signatory can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-identity-checking-guidelines/id-checking-guidelines-for-countersignatory-applications">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3.2.2.</strong> On receipt of a lead countersignatory application, the identity documents will be used to verify the identity of the applicant against the information provided on their application. This will be done on either the Registration Application Form or a ‘Change of Lead Signatory’ Form.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>DBS recommends that identity documents should be sent by Special or recorded delivery as only original ID documentation can be accepted.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>3.2.3.</strong> If any of the supporting documents of identification fail to meet the requirements for authentication, the application will be rejected and the documents will be returned to the applying lead signatory.</p>

<p>If however the documents fail any of the document checking procedures, they will be treated as a suspicious and referred for further investigation.</p>

<p><strong>3.2.4.</strong> Where documents have passed authentication, they are scanned onto DBS computer files. The original documents are then placed in envelopes to return to the sender on the same day. They will be sent to either the address provided or to the address recorded on DBS computer files. This is done via recorded delivery unless specifically requested otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>3.3. Assessing countersignatory suitability</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.3.1.</strong> Countersignatories will have access to personal and sensitive information - for this reason, those applying for countersignatory status are checked by the DBS to the level of an enhanced check with both barred lists. This allows DBS to assess whether the individual is suitable to carry out this role.</p>

<p><strong>3.3.2.</strong> The DBS Registration Team is responsible for determining if a countersignatory is suitable. Generally, DBS considers that offences of dishonesty, extortion, serious sexual/violent offences and non-minor drug offences could in principle, have an impact on a person’s suitability.</p>

<p>This is dependent on the circumstances of the relevant offence and how long ago it occurred. Each case will be considered on its own merits. In considering each case, the following factors will be taken into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the nature of the offences and their relevance to the functions</li>
  <li>the seriousness of the offences</li>
  <li>the number of offences</li>
  <li>the date that the offences occurred</li>
  <li>the circumstances surrounding the offending</li>
  <li>whether the offence was isolated or a pattern</li>
  <li>any other mitigating circumstances and/or factors that are considered relevant to suitability</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.3.3.</strong> Where the applying countersignatory is on either of the children’s or adults’ barred lists, they would not be considered suitable to countersign applications for standard or enhanced level disclosures.</p>

<p><strong>3.4.</strong> Your information may also be used for testing purposes. Testing is undertaken to ensure that our systems function as per specified requirements. If it is not practical to disguise your data or use dummy data then we will test our system using your data. This testing will only take place in environments that are secured to the same level as our live system.</p>

<p><strong>Please note, we may use previous applications you have submitted to assist in the checking process.</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Who is the data controller?</h2>

<p><strong>4.1.</strong> A data controller decides the purpose for, and manner in which, any personal data is processed.</p>

<p><strong>4.2.</strong> DBS is the data controller of information held by us for the purposes of GDPR. We are responsible for the safety and security of all the data we hold.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Who are the data processors?</h2>

<p><strong>5.1.</strong> A data processor is anyone (other than an employee of a data controller) who processes data on behalf of the controller.</p>

<p><strong>5.2.</strong> At DBS we have a range of suppliers who process data on behalf of DBS as defined in section 9. We make sure that our data processors comply with all relevant requirements under data protection legislation. This is defined in our contractual arrangements with them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Contacting the Data Protection Officer</h2>

<p><strong>6.1.</strong> The DBS Data Protection Officer can be contacted via telephone on 0151 676 1154, via email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dbsdataprotection@dbs.gov.uk">dbsdataprotection@dbs.gov.uk</a>, or in writing to:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> What are the legal grounds for processing my information?</h2>

<p><strong>7.1.</strong> DBS was established under the Protection of Freedoms Act (PoFA) 2012 on 1 December 2012. Disclosure functions of DBS are contained within Part V of the Police Act (PA) 1997.</p>

<p><strong>7.2.</strong> DBS relies on Section 120 of the Police Act to carry out suitability checks to determine if an individual can have countersignatory status. Section 120A of the Police Act makes clear which information we can consider in making that decision.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Why would DBS hold my personal data?</h2>

<p><strong>8.1.</strong> We will only hold your data if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>previously applied to be a countersignatory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>previously used or are using the disclosure service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>been referred to the DBS for consideration under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (SVGA)/Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order 2007</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>been cautioned or convicted for a relevant (automatic barring) offence that leads to the DBS considering you for inclusion on one or both lists</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>8.2.</strong> If we ask you for personal information, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure you know why we need this information</li>
  <li>only ask for information that we need</li>
  <li>ensure only those appropriate have access to it</li>
  <li>store your information securely</li>
  <li>inform you if the information will be shared with a third party</li>
  <li>ask you to agree to us sharing your information where you have a choice</li>
  <li>only keep your information for as long as we need to – see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-data-retention-policy">Retention Policy</a>
</li>
  <li>not make it available for commercial use (such as marketing) without your permission</li>
  <li>ensure you are provided with a copy of data we hold on you, on request – this is called a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-subject-access-request">Subject Access Request</a>
</li>
  <li>ensure there are procedures in place for dealing promptly with any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-problem-criminal-record-certificate">disputes</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about/complaints-procedure">complaints</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note, we will share information with ‘relevant authorities’ such as the police, government departments etc. under UK Data Protection Act Prevention and Detection of Crime (Sch2, Part 1 Paragraph 2).</p>

<p>We will also share information under UK Data Protection Act (Sch2 Part 2 Paragraph 5 (2)) where disclosures are required by law or made in connection with legal proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>8.3.</strong> In return we ask you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give us accurate information</li>
  <li>tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes to your details, such as a new address</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>8.4.</strong> This helps us to keep your information reliable, up-to-date and secure. It will apply if we hold your data on paper or in electronic form.</p>

<p>This is a requirement for Registered Bodies under the conditions of registrations in section 7(j) of the previously mentioned Police Act under point 7.2 and in the Code of Practice.</p>

This is not an automated process and involves the judgment of the Chief Officer.</p>

<p>You have the right to object to any automated decision-making, it should be noted that you would need to inform us of this on submission of your application by contacting us on 03000 200 190.</p>
