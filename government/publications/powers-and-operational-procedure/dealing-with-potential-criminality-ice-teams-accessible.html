<h3>Publication</h3>

<p>Below is information on when this version of the guidance was published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>version 1.0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>published for Home Office staff on 28 June 2022</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes from last version of this guidance</h3>

<p>This guidance replaces and/or updates guidance previously published as ‘Criminal Investigations’.</p>

<p>Some information in this guidance was previously contained in the guidance ‘Clandestine illegal entry’.</p>

<h2>Terms and definitions</h2>

<h3>Arrival</h3>

<p>An individual arrives in the UK when they reach UK land or inland waters. This does not extend to UK territorial waters. An individual may arrive before they enter the UK.</p>

<h3>Attempts</h3>

<p>The Criminal Attempts Act 1981 makes it an offence to attempt to commit certain criminal acts ‘If, with intent to commit an offence to which this section applies, a person does an act which is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence, he is guilty of attempting to commit the offence’. This applies to offences which are indictable or triable either way. With regard to the investigation and prosecution of migrants where they are intercepted in UK territorial waters, this should be on the basis of an attempted breach of immigration law based on that attempted arrival offence</p>

<h3>Belief and suspicion</h3>

<p>You must give the terms ‘belief’ and ‘suspicion’ their ordinary meaning, the starting point, therefore, being the dictionary definitions.</p>

<h4>Suspicion</h4>

<p>A common direction given to criminal juries on what the term ‘suspicion’ means is that there must be a possibility that a person liable to arrest is on the premises that is more than fanciful.</p>

<p>Moreover, although a vague feeling of unease is not sufficient and there must be a reasonable basis for the possibility, it need not be ‘clear’ or ‘firmly grounded and targeted on specific facts.</p>

<h4>Belief</h4>

<p>This is generally regarded as a higher threshold than suspicion. However, the difference between ‘belief’ and ‘suspicion’ is very slight – both may be satisfied at a low threshold. Belief is, for instance, more equivalent to ‘knowing that a person may’ be on the premises in question. Belief should therefore be clear and founded on specific intelligence.</p>

<h3>CLUE</h3>

<p>Clue3 is the criminal investigations case management system. See: CFI guidance – Clue.</p>

<h3>Entry</h3>

<p>‘Entry’ is defined in section 11(1) of the 1971 Act as meaning disembarking and subsequently leaving the immigration control area. Where a person is detained and taken from the area, or granted immigration bail, they are not deemed to have entered the UK.</p>

<h3>Exhibit</h3>

<p>An exhibit is a document or other thing shown to a witness and referred to by the witness in evidence. At common law it is within the power of, and is the duty of, constables to retain for use in court things which may be evidence of crime, and which have lawfully come into their possession.</p>

<p>Under the Code of Practice issued under part 2 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, any officer investigating alleged crimes has a duty to record and retain material which may be relevant to the investigation.</p>

<p>Generally, the courts entrust the prosecution with the exhibits pending trial and after committal. The prosecution duty is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to take all proper care to preserve the exhibits safe from loss or damage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to co-operate with the defence to allow them reasonable access to the exhibits for the purpose of inspection and examination</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to produce the exhibits at trial</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Legal privilege</h3>

<p>Items subject to ‘legal privilege’ means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>communications between a professional legal adviser and their client or any person representing their client made in connection with the giving of legal advice to the client</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>communications between a professional legal adviser and their client or any person representing their client or between such an adviser or their client or any such representative and any other person made in connection with or in contemplation of legal proceedings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>items, when in the possession of a person entitled to them, that are enclosed with or referred to in such communications and made in connection with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>giving legal advice</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>contemplation of legal proceedings and for the purpose of such proceedings</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Organised crime groups (OCGs)</h3>

<p>OCGs are individuals, working with others, with the capacity and capability to commit <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark12">serious crime</a> on a continuing basis. This must include elements of planning, control, coordination, structure and group decision making.</p>

<p>Section 93 of the Police Act 1997 is applicable in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>CFI focus on the most harmful OCGs and those who present the biggest threat to the government’s target to reduce net migration. For more information see Criminal and financial investigations. CFI teams investigate where OCGs are involved in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>offences relating to modern slavery including trafficking foreign nationals into the UK where there is a clear exploitation of the immigration system, this could be trafficking for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the sex industry</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>organ harvesting</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>forced labour</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>other forms of involuntary servitude</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>facilitation (assisting individuals to breach UK immigration law) of illegal migration in the UK, this includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>marriage abuse</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>lorry drops (clandestine entrants)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>bogus colleges</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>abuse of the points-based system (PBS)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>rogue employers</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>producing and supplying forged or false documents to undermine the UK’s immigration controls</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Officers also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>assess all suspects for enhanced financial investigations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seek to strip them of their criminal assets For more information see: Financial investigation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>PACE</h3>

<p>PACE is used generically within this guidance to refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark59">criminal investigation</a> procedures.</p>

<p>The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) applies in England and Wales only. The Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 applies in Northern Ireland. References to PACE in this manual cover both the 1984 Act, the 1989 Order, and equivalent Scottish criminal procedures legislation except where stated otherwise.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/police-and-criminal-evidence-act-1984-pace-codes-of-practice">PACE codes of practice</a> apply to the police:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>exercising statutory powers to search people and vehicles</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>detaining, treating, questioning and identifying people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>searching premises, and the seizure of property they find on people or premises</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/62/contents" rel="external">Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980</a> details police powers, procedure and evidence and penalties as they apply in Scotland.</p>

<h3>Persistent offender</h3>

<p>‘Persistent offender’ means a repeat offender who shows a pattern of offending over a period. This can mean a series of offences committed in a short timeframe, or which escalate in seriousness over time, or a long history of minor offences.</p>

<h3>PIP – Professionalising Investigation Programme</h3>

<p>PIP is referred to in this guidance in relation to levels of accreditation / training required for certain roles and activities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PIP Level 1: Foundation investigation course for Immigration Officers which includes the core investigatory principles and Authorised Professional Practice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PIP Level 2: Serious and Complex crime course for officers who are accredited at PIP 1 and have undertaken the Immigration Enforcement Investigator Exam</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PIP Level 2 Supervisor/Manager: relates to officers who are managing teams undertaking investigation of serious and complex criminality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PIP Level 2 Advanced Interview: is part of the PIP 2 learning programme and builds on PIP 1 foundation learning incorporating more complex structures in suspect, victim and witness interview</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PIP Level 2 Specialist Suspect Interview: for officers that hold Advanced accreditation, who are undertaking the most difficult interviews requiring significant planning structures and enhanced methodology</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Premises</h3>

<p>A ‘premises’ is defined as any property or building, whether residential or business, which an IO seeks to enter or search under the immigration acts.</p>

<p>In England and Wales, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/23" rel="external">section 23 of Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE)</a> defines premises as any place and, in particular, includes any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>vehicle, vessel, aircraft or hovercraft</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>offshore installation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>renewable energy installation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tent or movable structure</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When, where and how you are allowed to carry out a search of premises depends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether you have made an administrative or criminal arrest</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where you made the arrest</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your powers to enter and search premises under the various acts</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the definition of what constitutes premises is derived from <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/section/412" rel="external">section 412 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1989/1341/article/25" rel="external">article 25 Police</a></p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1989/1341/article/25" rel="external">and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989</a> respectively, but also includes the categories described above (with the exception of renewable energy installations). There is more information on what may constitute premises in Search and seizure</p>

<h3>Public interest</h3>

<p>As part of their consideration under the Code for Crown Prosecutors whether to prosecute, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) l considers two components - evidential and public interest – see also <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark100">consideration, referral and advice</a>. Broadly, the presumption is that the public interest requires enforcement of the law to take place where there has been an administrative breach or contravention of the criminal law. That presumption is the starting point for consideration of each individual case.</p>

<p>ICE managers may make a pre-assessment of public interest prior to making a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark119">Charging Decision Request</a> to CPS. The test is a specific analysis in light of the current circumstances, rather than being constrained by set criteria. The balance of public interest may change over time, and factors for and against any decision or disclosure must be weighed according to current guidance.</p>

<p>See also</p>

    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/immigration" rel="external">The Code for Crown Prosecutors - The Crown Prosecution Service – Immigration</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some immigration related offences carry severe penalties. However, it is generally the case that administrative removal action is a more proportionate and reasonable response, and that prosecution is sought only where there are ‘aggravating’ factors that make it right to prosecute in the public interest. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark101">Consideration of aggravating factors</a></p>

<p>Where an individual can be quickly removed from the UK and it is appropriate to do so, this is the normal case progression, subject to consideration of whether it is reasonable and proportionate to do so, unless there are <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark101">aggravating factors</a> in play such as repeat or persistent offending. Cases involving serious offences such as multiple use or possession of false documents and facilitation or those where there are possible links to organised crime will ordinarily be adopted for investigation.</p>

<h3>Reasonable and proportionate</h3>

<p>Many of the powers described in this guidance and elsewhere use the terms ‘reasonable’, as in reasonable suspicion or reasonable belief and ‘proportionate’ in that the decision-maker considers whether exercising the legal power to limit the rights and freedoms of the individual is necessary to achieve the law enforcement objective and that it is in the public interest to do so.</p>

<p>Reasonable in law means fair, proper or moderate having regard for the circumstances, in this case including your knowledge and training as an IO. It applies an objective test when used with <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark6">‘ suspicion’ or ‘belief’</a> so that decisions must be based on a logical and rational assessment of the facts that other people (such as a court of law or your supervisors) could evaluate, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>what another person has done or failed to do</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>documentary evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information from witnesses</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Reasonable grounds can only be provided by a general assessment of the known facts, the situation, as it is known at the time and a reasonable conclusion drawn from the many possible circumstances that exist. Guesses, hunches and ‘gut- feelings’ are not considered to be reasonable. The reasonable grounds that form the basis of the action must be recorded in your <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark87">arrest notes</a>.</p>

<h3>Serious crime</h3>

<p>Serious crime is defined by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/50/section/93" rel="external">section 93(4) of the Police Act 1997</a> as crime:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>involving the use of violence, results in substantial financial gain or is conducted by a large number of persons in pursuit of a common purpose</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where one of the offences is an offence for which a person who has attained the age of 21 and has no previous convictions could reasonably be expected to be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 3 years or more</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Serious harm</h3>

<p>An offence that has caused ‘serious harm’ means an offence that has caused serious physical or psychological harm to a victim or victims, or that has contributed to a widespread problem that causes serious harm to a community or to society in general.</p>

<h3>Stowaways</h3>

<p>Stowaways are not crew members and are not treated as such. Stowaways are non- paying passengers who board transport without the knowledge of the captain, master, driver and/or crew.</p>

<p>For the purpose of the statutory defence under s.25BB a stowaway is an individual who boards a ship without the knowledge of the master of the ship and the master was not aware of their presence on the ship when it departed from the port.</p>

<p>Stowaways should be examined and, where appropriate, refused as arriving passengers under the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>See: Stowaways: statutory defences</p>

<h3>Criminal prosecution for facilitation</h3>

<p>For the purposes of this section of guidance, clandestine or irregular entry / arrival means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>entry or attempted entry by foot or in an aircraft, train, vehicle or vessel where the individual has evaded the control</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>arrival or attempted arrival by foot or in an aircraft, train, vehicle or vessel where the individual has no entry clearance to enter the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, an individual subject to control commits a criminal offence and you should investigate and consider whether there is evidence to support prosecution.</p>

<p>In addition, you must consider the circumstances of their arrival and whether their arrival has been facilitated by any person whose circumstances and actions suggest strongly that they have not acted in good faith. See: consideration and referral</p>

<p>If there is a reasonable suspicion that the driver or controller of a vessel has facilitated illegal entry or arrival and Criminal and Financial Investigations (CFI) officers are able to attend they will take the lead in gathering evidence. If they are unavailable, ICE officers should attempt to gather as much evidence as is practically possible, taking advice from a CFI officer as soon as possible after the suspected crime has been encountered.</p>

<p>Early liaison with CFI and/or police provides the best opportunity for the evidence to be secured. If CFI officers are unable to attend the scene, National Command and Control Unit (NCCU) will alert the on-call CFI officer to liaise with the ICE team or police officer on the scene.</p>

<h3>Modern slavery and facilitation offences</h3>

<p>See also: Identifying people at risk</p>

<p>Immigration Enforcement must refer, and CFI managers must adopt, human trafficking cases referred whatever nationality the victim or offender is, if there is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>prima facie evidence (actual evidence) to show an offence has been committed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clear evidence those involved have exploited the immigration system</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more information see:</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>victims of modern slavery: guidance for frontline staff including national referral mechanism (NRM) guidance and forms</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>CFI will consider adopting a facilitation case if they have prima facie evidence (actual evidence) to show an offence has been committed. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark63">offences</a></p>

<h4>Facilitation by lorry drivers</h4>

<p>Where a prosecution of the driver for facilitation of illegal entry is being pursued the officer in charge must, if possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>gather further witness statements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>commission expert tachograph analysis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>commission expert refrigerator temperature recorder analysis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>commission expert analysis of electronic devices (such as satellite navigation units, mobile phones and laptops)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Civil penalty referral notices</h4>

<p>Independent of the decision as to whether to prosecute, if there is evidence to suggest that the driver failed to prevent the carriage of clandestine entrants in a vehicle, as required by Part II of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, you must consider issuing a civil penalty referral notice.</p>

<p>You must take copies of all the evidence gathered (as set out in Gathering evidence of clandestine entry: crime scene preservation) and complete forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>IS.11D – Notice of Liability to Penalty</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IS.11E – Clandestine Entry Incident - Civil Penalty Pro-Forma</p>
  </li>

<h4>Counterfeit or forged documents for facilitation</h4>

<p>This has a wide meaning as a category and is often linked to other categories such as marriage abuse, college abuse and abuse of PBS.</p>

<p>This category includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any document which supports the forgery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>anyone producing:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the forgery itself</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>anything else to support that document</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the act of supplying false documentation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If guilty knowledge can be proven it could also include any persons who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide the equipment, funding or material to make the false documents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attempted, conspired, aided, abetted, counselled or procured the crime.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This type of crime will underpin most forms of facilitation and it is important to establish whether it is part of a wider series of forged or counterfeit documents linked to an <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark16">OCG</a>. If you encounter an individual in possession of a counterfeit or forged document for facilitation you and/or CFI must investigate further to establish how the person came to possess the document and where they got it from.</p>

<h4>Facilitation through other means including internal corruption</h4>

<p>This concerns any other offence where the main part of the investigation is the illegal facilitation of migrants into the UK. This could include many offence types such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>people smuggling across the border</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cheating on the knowledge of life test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cheating on the long residency rule</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>corrupt Home Office staff members involved in this abuse</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It deals with any other facilitation not covered in any of the other categories and includes any people involved in the process, for example the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>overseas agents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>transporters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>arrangers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fixers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Home Office staff</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It includes those who attempted, conspired, aided, abetted, counselled or procured the crime.</p>

<p>CFI teams only consider whether it is possible to take on an investigation under this category where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark16">OCG</a> has been identified</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>significant abuse has occurred</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is important with all investigations to establish the full circumstances surrounding the facilitation, including details of any suspects or witnesses. You must debrief all those involved to establish whether this is an isolated incident or part of a wider series connected to an OCG to provide CFI with the relevant information.</p>

<p>Where the offence involves corrupt Home Office staff members all investigations are undertaken by Home Office Security Investigation team. If you have any concerns at all about the possible involvement of corrupt Home Office staff you must not discuss this with any other member of staff including your line manager and contact Home Office Security Investigation team, see Security.</p>

<h2>Criminal powers and constraints</h2>

<p>This page tells Immigration Compliance and Enforcement officers about their powers to undertake criminal investigations and the constraints within which they must operate. ICE teams must follow guidance published by Criminal and Financial Investigation (CFI). Links to relevant areas within that guidance are included within this document for ease of reference.</p>

<h3>Purpose of criminal powers</h3>

<p>You must only use criminal powers when there is a genuine intention to prosecute an individual for immigration related criminal offences. These powers directly relate to the investigation of a suspected immigration offence. They are not about establishing immigration status and are distinct and separate from your administrative powers.</p>

<p>Part 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/contents" rel="external">Immigration Act 1971</a> (the 1971 act), section 109A of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/33/contents" rel="external">Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</a> (the 1999 act), sections 2(10), 14 and 35(5) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/19/contents" rel="external">Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004</a> (the 2004 act) and section 23 (relating to offence of assaulting an IO) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/30/contents" rel="external">UK Borders Act 2007</a> (the 2007 act) provide powers to IOs, allowing you, in certain circumstances, to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>search persons and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark20">premises</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter premises for the purposes of searching for and arresting persons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seize and retain relevant material in relation to criminal offences</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Investigation of an offence involves the process of examining whether an offence has been committed and if so by whom. The usual purpose of investigation where a criminal offence is detected is prosecution; however, in the context of immigration investigations it is often a more proportionate approach to pursue administrative removal action and this remains the policy for most cases detected. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark100">Referral and consideration</a></p>

<p>Using criminal powers to obtain information for the purpose of administrative removal action (such as by searching for evidence of identity to document the offender to effect removal), could be using the powers for an improper purpose. Searching on behalf of other agencies is, similarly, likely to be using powers for an improper purpose.</p>

<h4>Arrest without warrant section 28A</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/28A" rel="external">Section 28A of the 1971 act</a> gives a power of arrest without warrant where you have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed an offence under section 24 (other than section 24(1)(d)) or has committed or attempted to commit an offence under section 24A.</p>

<h4>Special note for Immigration Officers in Scotland</h4>

<p>In Scotland, police constables may still exercise arrest powers under section 28A(3) and (5). See <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/28A" rel="external">section 28A</a> of the Immigration Act 1971 for further details of extent of these powers within England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/28AA" rel="external">Section 28AA of the 1971 act</a> provides a power of arrest with a warrant for an offence under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/24" rel="external">section 24(1) (d) of the 1971 act</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/13/section/21" rel="external">section 21(1) of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (the 2006 act)</a>.</p>

<h4>Entry with warrant to search and arrest: section 28B</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/28B" rel="external">Section 28B of the 1971 act</a> allows a Justice of the Peace (JP) or sheriff, to issue a warrant authorising a police constable or an IO to enter specified premises, by force if necessary, to search for and arrest a person. However, they must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person, who is liable to be arrested for a ‘relevant offence’, is to be found on the premises. Most of the relevant offences for the purposes of section 28B are covered in section 28B(5), that is sections 24(A1), (B1), (C1), (D1), (E1) or (1)(b), (c), (d), but note that section 28B also applies to some offences in later immigration acts.</p>

<p>Under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/28D" rel="external">section 28D of the 1971 act</a> a JP or sheriff may issue a warrant authorising an IO to enter and search premises. The section is based on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/8" rel="external">section 8 of PACE</a> and contains similar safeguards.</p>

<p>Before issuing a warrant under section 28D of the 1971 act, a JP or sheriff has to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a relevant offence has been committed as defined in section 28D(4), that is under sections 24(A1), (B1), (C1), (D1), (E1) or (1)(b), (c), (d).</p>

  <li>
    <p>the material sought is likely to be relevant evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the material does not consist of or include items subject to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark15">legal privilege</a>, excluded material or special procedure material (definitions of these terms can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/10" rel="external">section 10</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/11" rel="external">section 11</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/14" rel="external">section 14</a> of PACE)</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you or the police constable must reasonably believe that employee records, other than items subject to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark15">legal privilege</a>, will be found on the premises and will be of substantial value in the investigation of the immigration employment offence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Entry and search of business premises with warrant: section 28FB</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/section/134" rel="external">Section 134 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a> (the 2002 act) allows the Home Office to require an employer to supply information about an employee in order to establish both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>where the employee is</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the employee’s earnings and employment history</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If there are reasonable grounds for believing that the employer has provided inaccurate or incomplete information, you can consider applying for a warrant under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/28FB" rel="external">section 28FB of 1971 act</a>.</p>

<p>Under section 28FB of the 1971 act a JP or sheriff may issue a warrant authorising an IO to enter and search business premises for personnel records. The warrant will only be issued provided that there are reasonable grounds for believing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an employer has provided inaccurate or incomplete information under section 134 of the 2002 act</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>employee records, other than items subject to legal privilege, will be found on the premises and will enable deduction of some, or all, of the information which the employer was required to provide</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one of the conditions in section 28FB(2) are met</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must read <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/28FB" rel="external">section 28FB</a> before applying for the warrant to ensure the limitations and/or conditions are met.</p>

<h4>Search of people arrested who are not in a police station: section 28G</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/28G" rel="external">Section 28G of the 1971 act</a> applies where a person has been arrested for an offence under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/part/III" rel="external">part 3 of the 1971 act</a> at a place other than a police station. Under subsection (2), an IO may search the arrested person if they have reasonable grounds for believing that the arrested person may present a danger to themselves or others. Under subsection (3), an IO may search the arrested person for anything which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they might use to assist their escape</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>might be evidence relating to the offence for which they have been arrested</p>

<h4>Power to seize cash: Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA)</h4>

<p>Cash seizure is important as the lifestyle and status organised crime brings is the main motivation for most criminals. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/30/section/24" rel="external">Section 24 of the UK Borders Act 2007</a> gives immigration officers powers under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/part/5/chapter/3" rel="external">chapter 3, part 5 of the Proceeds Of Crime Act 2002</a>, to search for, seize, detain and forfeit cash, suspected of being recoverable property obtained through or for use in unlawful conduct, which is linked to immigration or nationality offences. CFI and ICE team officers have comprehensive cash seizure guidance and must ensure that they read this policy in conjunction with these instructions.</p>

<p>During a search of a person or premises, officers may come into possession of cash in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>seized under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/section/294" rel="external">section 294 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA)</a> on suspicion of being recoverable property or intended by any person for use in unlawful conduct</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seized under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/19/section/48/enacted" rel="external">section 48 of the Immigration Act 2016</a> on reasonable belief of being obtained through committing an offence (such as illegal working, made a criminal offence in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/19/part/1/chapter/2/crossheading/offences" rel="external">Immigration Act 2016</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seized as relevant evidence of an offence for which a person has been arrested</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Immigration Enforcement ICE team officers who have completed a National Police Improvement Agency (NPIA) one day cash seizure course may seize cash where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they are lawfully on the premises</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the cash is estimated to be more than the minimum amount (£1,000)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>authorisation to seize the cash has been given by a criminal or financial investigator</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Cash seizure guidance advises you not to count cash until you are in a sterile environment where the counting can be recorded and witnessed – such as a bank. Allegations of theft can be best avoided by cash remaining uncounted on detection and by keeping a full and accurate (witnessed) record of handling.</p>

<h2>Role of ICE officers in investigating criminal offences</h2>

<p>Immigration Officers in Immigration Compliance and Enforcement (ICE) teams have a vital role to play in recording and securing evidence, identifying criminal activity and alerting or referring suspicion of crime to the police, NCA and Criminal and Financial Investigation (CFI) officers. ICE officers have powers with which to pursue arrest and seek to prosecute offences as described above and may do so in certain circumstances which are discussed below.</p>

<p>For a summary of the most common offences likely to be encountered by ICE officers, see CFI adoption criteria – offences commonly encountered by immigration officers</p>

<p>ICE officers have a primary role as first responders for cases of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>trafficking in human beings (THB) and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/contents" rel="external">Modern Slavery Act 2015</a> offences where they apply in England and Wales.

<h3>ICE teams – criminal investigation adoption criteria</h3>

<p>Not all criminal offences that are encountered will result in an investigation and arrest with a view to pursuing prosecution. The primary role of ICE officers is to consider administrative action in relation to those who are liable to removal. It remains Home Office policy that most immigration offences will be dealt with under administrative powers with a view to removing those in breach of immigration law where it is appropriate to do so. Referral to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will therefore be appropriate only where the seriousness of the offence or additional ‘aggravating’ factors means that it is in the public interest to do so. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark100">consideration and referral</a></p>

<p>As a general guide, the ICE remit in relation to criminal investigation is to pursue the following case types through to prosecution subject to consideration of <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark101">‘aggravating factors</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>crimes related directly to a breach of immigration law that would normally result in administrative action (removal) – but there are aggravating factors that make the crime sufficiently serious that it is in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark21">public interest</a> to seek prosecution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>crimes involving identity / document / marriage fraud by foreign nationals where there is no element /suspicion of organised crime activity</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<h4>ICE team – decision to initiate criminal investigation</h4>

<p>The decision whether to initiate supporting action by gathering and securing evidence must be made in consultation with the duty CFI Chief Immigration Officer</p>

<p>Whether to proceed to a criminal investigation with the intention to prosecute for an offence is a decision that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>must comply with <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark64">ICE team adoption criteria</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be authorised by silver commander</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>General principles and constraints</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a clear separation must be maintained between administrative and criminal investigations and the use of powers relating to each. The decision-maker considering whether it is right to administratively enforce liability to removal cannot be the same officer as that investigating a crime by the same individual - to do so may result in a conflict of interests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>suspected non-immigration criminal offences relating to British citizens must be referred to the police</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where intelligence suggests criminal offences are being committed at the address to be visited, CFI and/or police must be notified, consideration of joint working and the appropriate Enforcement Planning Assessment and risk assessment completed: see: Enforcement Planning Assessments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence must be gathered and secured by PIP1 trained officers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a power to arrest for an immigration offence does not provide powers to examine or search in relation to other unrelated offences and cannot be cited as justification.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the course of exercising immigration powers, such as search, you may note evidence of other non-immigration offences, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/19/section/48/enacted" rel="external">Section 48 of the Immigration Act 2016</a> provides officers with power in certain circumstances to secure and seize any evidence that may have been obtained in the consequence of the commission of an offence, or may be evidence of an offence. The officers must be lawfully on the premises and find the evidence while exercising a function under the Immigration Acts. This power does not entitle the officer to look for this evidence alone. For further information see: Search and Seizure – non-immigration offences</p>

<p>Interviews and searches at a police station must be conducted in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark59">PACE</a>, or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/1/contents" rel="external">Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016</a> , and the requirements as directed by the police custody officer. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark88">working under PACE</a></p>

<h3>Role of OIC in criminal investigations</h3>

<p>An Officer in Charge (OIC) must be appointed who shall be in charge of each investigation in accordance with the CPIA Code of Practice and who has the appropriate skills to pursue and manage the investigation and thereafter collect evidence for the case. The responsibilities of an OIC are set out in more detail in the CPIA Code of Practice. The OIC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>is responsible for pursuing all reasonable lines of enquiry and may delegate tasks to other officers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has responsibility for referring a suspected criminal offence to the Gold Commander and/or CFI and/or the police</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is responsible for assigning team members to conduct and record searches, record and secure evidence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Role of Disclosure Officer in criminal investigations</h3>

<p>See: CFI guidance - disclosure</p>

<p>A trained Disclosure Officer (DO) must be appointed from the outset of an investigation and, in accordance with the Code of Practice to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-procedure-and-investigations-act-code-of-practice">Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996</a> (CPIA), they must have sufficient skills and authority, commensurate with the complexity of the investigation, to discharge their functions effectively. In more complex cases, a disclosure officer must be appointed who is separate from the SIO/ officer in charge of the investigation.</p>

<h3>Role of Chief Immigration Officers in criminal investigations</h3>

<p>CIO authority required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Where criminal investigation was not part of the operational planning assessment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for not proceeding with a case that otherwise meets the criteria for prosecution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for referral to CPS]</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Statements and ICE Officers’ role as witness</h3>

<p>Where an ICE officer has performed a role in connection with a criminal investigation they may be required to provide a statement of evidence and may be required to appear in court at a later date to be examined regarding that evidence.</p>

<h4>The statement must be based on the contemporaneous notes that you record at the time of the visit, or as soon as practicable immediately following the visit. It is essential therefore that full and accurate notes are recorded on PRONTO.</h4>

<p>Your statement must include an account of your actions and the justification for them. Relevant actions may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>entry to premises and your power to do so</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decision to administratively arrest and the grounds for this</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decision to search for evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seizure of cash, documents or other items</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In some instances, your statement may be taken by a police officer. See also</p>

</ul>

<h3>Suspicion that a crime has been committed – general principles</h3>

<p>Immigration Officers conduct operations in accord with policy guidance designed to detect individuals who are in breach of immigration law and then consider whether it is right to use administrative powers to arrest and remove them from the UK. Immigration officers may encounter during such investigation an individual who is a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>foreign national or British citizen who is suspected of having committed an offence that carries a power of arrest under the Immigration Act 1971, for instance: facilitation of illegal entry/ arrival See: coercive powers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>foreign national, subject to immigration control, suspected of a crime that may or may not be related to an immigration offence, for instance: forgery or identity theft</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>foreign national, subject to immigration control, suspected of a non-immigration criminal offence, for instance: theft, deception, violent crime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>foreign national not subject to immigration control or a British Citizen suspected of a criminal offence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Deciding whether to begin criminal investigation or administrative action</h3>

<p>Suspicion of criminality may arise either during or after an investigation into an immigration breach and, except in certain circumstances as described elsewhere in this guidance, the broad policy approach is to prioritise the administrative removal process. Administrative action, that is, service of notice of liability to removal, should proceed as normal and the question of whether to take alternative or additional criminal action can be considered separately.</p>

<p>For practical purposes, consideration of prosecution for immigration offences is reserved for the most serious cases and where there are <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark101">aggravating circumstances</a> that make it in the public interest to do so.</p>

<p>It is likely that cases where consideration of prosecution is appropriate will also have met the criteria for administrative detention or the individual may also be in police custody in relation to other offences. Any individual so detained, who is to be questioned in relation to a criminal offence, must be arrested and dealt with under criminal procedures.</p>

<p>The appropriate course of action where a crime is suspected will differ according to the nature of the offence.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Preserving a crime scene: general considerations</h3>

<p>Where evidence of serious crimes is detected, officers must secure the scene, maintain a detailed record of events and actions and await assistance.</p>

<p>The College of Policing authorised professional practice states that, ‘The purpose of securing a scene is to maintain the integrity and provenance of any material which may be recovered from it. This simple and important action reduces the opportunities for the material to become contaminated or inadvertently cross-contaminated’.</p>

<p>Things that immigration officers (IOs) should secure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any victims</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>witnesses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>suspects – keeping them away from each other should there be more than one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>weapons – ensuring they are not moved or touched</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>entry to property by anyone not part of the crime scene</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>IOs have no power to close highways or roads, but depending on the severity of the crime, and the risk to third parties, a cordon may be required around the immediate vicinity of an address. This might be done through using officers to restrict entry to the address or a small area around the address where possible.</p>

<h4>When in doubt use the command structure or call in the police.</h4>

<p>These are the general principles and processes to be followed where there is reasonable belief that a criminal offence has been committed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>inform the officer in charge (OIC) as soon as possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if necessary, secure the area:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>secure relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark78">evidence</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>initiate / maintain communication with the responsible person at the relevant investigating agency - this could be police, HMRC, DWP, CFI or another government organisation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the scene involves injury, death or any other serious crime, officers may consider calling a critical incident and keeping the incident in play until police arrive:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>police will take over the scene and investigate, but will require full accounts from officers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Although officers are ‘seizing in situ’ when they are securing the scene, they would have to rely on the power of arrest in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/28A" rel="external">section 28A(8) of the Immigration Act 1971</a> for obstruction (see <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/26" rel="external">section 26(1)(g)</a> of that act) to prevent anyone who is obstructing the enquiry.</p>

<p>The following table the types of material or situations an IO may encounter and what action to take.</p>

<h4>Scene preservation</h4>

<h4>Preserving a crime scene: necessity to arrest</h4>

<h4>In certain, very limited, circumstances, it may be necessary to use any person powers to detain a suspect and evidence in one location. This is to preserve the scene until a police constable can attend to assume responsibility and/or prevent the destruction or disruption of evidence or crime scene.</h4>

<p>See Arrest and restraint: any person power of arrest.</p>

<h4>Witnesses</h4>

<p>See:</p>

<ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Form MG11 witness statement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where IE have a ‘twin aim’ of seeking prosecution and removing/deporting people who may be witnesses, this needs to be highlighted and discussed with the CPS at an early stage, to ensure the required evidence is available to be adduced at any subsequent trial. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/law-enforcement-liaison-with-the-immigration-and-nationality-directorate-ind-to-support-foreign-witnesses-or-covert-investigations">HO Circular 2 of 2006</a> should be followed.</p>

<p>Where law enforcement officers encounter a foreign national as either a witness, their immigration status must be immediately established in order to avoid any suggestions of inducement. The procedures to ensure that obligations surrounding duty of care issues are complied with are set out in Home Office Circular 12/1997:</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>

<h3>Evidence handling general principles</h3>

<p>If you do not handle evidence correctly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the case may fail</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your evidence may be excluded</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the defence may try to have your evidence discredited</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you may be required to attend court and explain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the prosecution may not be willing to take the case forward</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there will be a financial cost to the department if the case collapses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the reputation of the Home Office may be damaged</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is important in all cases where a criminal prosecution could be a potential outcome that on encountering a suspect, you complete the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>make a contemporaneous (at the time) note of any questions asked and the suspect’s replies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seize and retain any evidence related to the offence and safeguard its forensic integrity by placing it in an evidence bag:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the bag must be completed and signed by the officer exhibiting the evidence</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>everyone who handles the evidence should provide a statement as explained below and complete the evidence bag with their details</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the suspect must not be given an opportunity to destroy evidence, therefore, in cases where prosecution is likely individuals must be searched as soon as possible and must not be left unsupervised</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where an officer discovers documents as part of a search which appear to be evidence of a criminal offence they must be retained and handed over to the criminal investigator at the earliest opportunity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Once evidence has been seized it becomes an exhibit - it is important to be able to account for every exhibit from the moment the offence takes place.</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>retain all original notes made - no matter what their format and whether or not they were made in an official notebook</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in cases involving concealments and where facilities exist take photographs to illustrate how individuals or items were hidden</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>See also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>CFI guidance- Evidence in criminal investigations</p>

    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/exhibits" rel="external">CPS guidance – definitions of exhibits</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For all evidence you seize, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>seal it in a tamper evident bag or any other bag provided for that purpose</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>follow all procedures for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>recording the seizure</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>completing the sections on the evidence bag</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>store the evidence as soon as possible in a secure property store:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make a detailed record of it, stating exactly what evidence was stored and the date and time it was stored</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must record in the property book, and complete the continuation section on the tamper evident bag, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>remove a piece of evidence from the property store</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>open the bag for any reason</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hand the evidence to somebody else</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take a piece of evidence into your possession</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When transferring pieces of evidence to another person or to other locations you must ensure that you hand over the evidence in person. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure the security of the evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure continuity and the chain of evidence is maintained</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>record your actions on PRONTO and/or in the ‘record of investigation’ relating to your case</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Retention (keeping), continuity and safe storage of all exhibits is critical. For more information, see search and seizure.</p>

<h4>Chain of evidence</h4>

<p>See: CFI guidance – Evidence in criminal investigations</p>

<p>The ‘chain of evidence’ refers to the handling of evidence from the moment it is identified and seized, right through the prosecution process. An audit trail must be provided showing where that evidence has been at all times to prove its integrity.</p>

<p>It needs to show how the evidence was seized, including details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>where it was found</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where it was seized</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the time of seizure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the date it was seized</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who seized it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what was done with it after it was seized</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is important for criminal investigators to be able to show the chain of evidence has been maintained because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it proves the integrity of the evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>allegations that the evidence has been tampered with or changed in any way can be refuted</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Maintaining the chain of evidence helps to ensure the integrity of that evidence when it is presented in court.</p>

<h4>Continuity of evidence</h4>

<p>You must keep accurate records in relation to who has handled evidence at the beginning of a prosecution case. Failure to do so may result in the case later being considered by CPS or the court to be fatally flawed, and that it is not appropriate to continue with prosecution action.</p>

<p>Once evidence has been seized it becomes an exhibit. It is important to be able to account for every exhibit from the moment the offence takes place. This may present problems for ICE officers as it is usual for documents to be handed to a variety of officers. It is important to have accurate timings of when things happen and for witness statements to cover the relevant time periods.</p>

<p>All evidence must be placed in an evidence bag which must be completed and signed by the officer exhibiting the evidence. Everyone who handles the evidence must provide a statement and complete the evidence bag with their details.</p>

<p>You must not give the suspect any opportunity to destroy evidence and you must not leave them unsupervised. In cases where prosecution is likely, you must arrange for the search of the suspect to be completed as soon as possible, subject to any advice from CFI.</p>

<h3>Recording and preserving evidence</h3>

<p>There will be obvious crimes where officers must preserve the scene and await investigators to arrive. If you uncover a serious indictable offence, police will respond. Immigration officers (IOs) being present and securing the scene will allow the police to better consider their priorities in responding. IOs need to be aware of the estimated response time.</p>

<p>In other areas you must seek advice of CFI and may seize items on behalf of another responsible authority, for instance, following detection of a small quantity of drugs when searching a person under arrest. Police may ask officers to seize on their behalf and bring the evidence to them. This is the time when officers need to record everything on PRONTO, place objects in evidence bags and fully complete the evidence bag. You are expected to provide a statement when you pass over the evidence.</p>

<p>Items such as nationality documents, particularly false documents, must be removed if doing so will prevent the items being concealed, lost, damaged, altered or destroyed. There may be a chance that CFI and/or professionalising investigations programme (PIP) level 1 officers are unable to deal with this offence but following the process of seizure will assist with any investigation that may commence.</p>

<h4>Contemporaneous notes</h4>

<p>The reasonable grounds that form the basis of the action must be recorded in the arrest notes on PRONTO. Further information on record keeping during visits is found in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>CFI guidance: Notebooks, day logs and decision logs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General Instructions: Record keeping during visits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General Instructions: PRONTO</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Witness statements</h4>

<p>See also: CFI guidance – witness statements</p>

<p>In all cases those officers involved in processing a suspect must complete a witness statement on form MG11 - this is particularly important in the case of the officer conducting the initial examination, forgery officer or person who discovers key evidence of an offence - there should be a large variety of example witness statements held locally by your local CFI, which should provide a starting point.</p>

<p>Witness statements should be produced on form MG11 and should include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>timings, to show when things happened</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who the exhibit was handed to when you finished handling any exhibit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your personal details so the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) can contact you if necessary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the names of anyone who brought the evidence to you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any relevant questions and answers noted in question and answer format.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once the witness statement is completed it must be dated and each page signed. It should then be checked by the Gold Commander or the local CFI office.</p>

<p>You must ensure the above actions are completed before relinquishing responsibility for a case and in all circumstances before going off duty.</p>

<h4>Evidence of document abuse</h4>

<p>In case of forgery/document abuse, the PRONTO record should reflect clearly who first suspected that the document(s) may be forged or counterfeit and to whom the document(s) were passed. This is particularly important where one person hands the case to another to deal with before the documents are examined by a forgery trained officer. This will enable CFI to know which member of staff to approach to provide a witness statement and will ensure continuity of evidence.</p>

<p>The forgery officer will be required to make a statement in line with the Joint Protocol published in 2006</p>

<p>See:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>National Document Forgery Unit</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
    <p>Document examination report template</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Witness forgery statement example / template</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The forgery statement should be placed on file in a clear plastic sleeve along with the application form and the suspected forged document. The exception is the passport which should be placed in a secure passport bank by the forgery officer for seizure in due course.</p>

<h4>Seizing vehicles: prosecution evidence</h4>

<p>In the event that a vehicle requires further examination or is required as evidence as part of a prosecution, the investigating officer will seize the vehicle under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/19" rel="external">section 19 of Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984</a>. Arrangements will then be made by the police to take the vehicle to the most appropriate vehicle or evidence storage location. See also search and seizure</p>

<h3>Interviews in relation to criminal offences</h3>

<p>See: CFI guidance - Interviewing suspects</p>

<h3>Working with police</h3>

<h4>Police call outs: initial contact with National Command and Control Unit</h4>

<p>The first point of contact for the police relating to foreign nationals to the National Command and Control Unit (NCCU) based in Manchester, which is Immigration</p>

<p>Enforcement’s 24/7 primary point of contact for police forces nationally. NCCU can be approached by all police officers who have arrested, are investigating or have encountered a non-British person.</p>

<p>NCCU will look to identify the best option for the public, police and immigration to prioritise action against suspected immigration offenders believed to be engaged in criminality, and particularly the most harmful. Enquiries will be made to ascertain whether they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>might be referred to FNORC to pursue deportation action</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are subject to deportation or administrative removal immediately</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>should be referred to Border Force for consideration of refusal on their next entry into the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Working within police custody areas</h4>

<p>Be aware of your surroundings and act under the assumption that conversation and actions may be recorded for future inspection in case of disputes or incidents - custody has 24hr CCTV and audio recording. Consider who is in the custody area – who may include other arrested persons, solicitors, interpreters, appropriate adults, social workers. It may not be appropriate to discuss confidential case details and care must be taken to preserve data confidentiality.</p>

<p>Best practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>identify yourself to custody officers - the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark95">Custody Officer</a> is responsible for the custody suite and supported by the detention officer: IE staff should introduce themselves, be in uniform and identifiable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be courteous, professional and informed as to what action you plan to take - the custody area is busy, and staff should be patient, wait their turn and be aware that they represent the Home Office</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>custody record - this will detail specifics about the detainee - ask for a printed copy for the file: this will confirm details but also make you aware of medical conditions or welfare concerns that may be relevant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>property – any passport, identity document or property that may be relevant?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>custody handover time - custody officers have a handover time where they transfer responsibility of detainees - this can be busy and IE staff will have to be patient during these times</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>previous experience with Immigration Enforcement - custody may not be aware of your powers, responsibilities or procedures - staff should ensure they are prepared when they arrive, be able to explain any of our powers and processes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) codes of practice.</h3>

<p>Section 145 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 states that an immigration officer exercising a specified power of arrest, question, search or seizure must have regard to the provisions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) codes of practice specified in a direction issued by the Secretary of State. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark60">PACE powers</a></p>

<p>Code G (1.3) of PACE states: The use of the power of arrest must be fully justified and must consider if the necessary objective can be met by other less intrusive means. When the power of arrest is exercised it is essential that it is exercised in a non-discriminatory and proportionate manner which is compatible with the Right to Liberty under Article 5. Arrest must never be used simply because it can be used.</p>

<p>Court cases may be challenged if you cannot justify using the power of arrest.</p>

<p>If you have <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">reasonable grounds</a> for suspecting that an offence has been committed as listed in section 28A of the Immigration Act 1971, you may arrest without warrant anyone whom you have reasonable grounds to suspect of being guilty of it.</p>

<p>Information to be given on arrest: PACE Code G (3.3 note 3) Officers must give an arrested person sufficient information to enable them to understand they have been deprived of their liberty and the reason they have been arrested, as soon as practicable after the arrest. They must be informed of the suspected offence’s nature, when and where it was committed. The suspect must also be informed of the reason or reasons why arrest is considered necessary. Vague or technical language should be avoided.</p>

<p>Failure to inform someone of their arrest and the grounds can render the arrest unlawful.</p>

<p>See: Arrest and restraint</p>

<h4>Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) clock</h4>

<p>Where a criminal investigation is undertaken with further enquiries to determine the individual’s immigration status and whether they are liable to administrative removal must be conducted by separate officers.</p>

<p>A person detained under PACE can ordinarily be kept at the police station for a maximum of 24 hours from the relevant time. This is known as the ‘PACE clock‘. Detention of that person without charge is necessary to secure or preserve evidence relating to an offence for which he is under arrest or to obtain such evidence by questioning him provided that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the offence for which he is under arrest is an indictable offence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The 24-hour period can only be extended in particular circumstances by a police superintendent or above but is very unlikely to be extended where the only issue to be determined is that of the person’s immigration status. In cases where a person is being held pending further investigation relating to a criminal offence, officers are restricted to completing their investigation within the 24-hour period. Whether or not the person is held for the maximum period is a matter for the police.</p>

<p>In accordance with PACE, a person can ordinarily only be held for a maximum of 24 hours during which time a decision must be made to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>charge them with an offenc,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>serve a notice of liability to administrative removal After which they may be:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>granted immigration bail (depending on bail compliance criteria, see Bail</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>released without charge or further administrative action.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>During this period, the detained person must be allowed access to legal advice and 8 hours of continuous rest. When a decision is taken to grant police bail to the detained person so that further enquiries can be undertaken, the 24-hour clock will recommence when the individual reports in compliance with their bail conditions. If there are only 3 hours left when the detained person is bailed, there will only be 3 hours left when they report off bail to conclude the investigation and make a decision on a case.</p>

<p>If the police have arrested the person for a criminal offence but do not intend to pursue the case further, the following options apply. The person must be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>arrested and detained under schedule 2 or 3 to the Immigration Act 1971</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>arrested in connection with an immigration related criminal offence and released on immigration bail</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The person’s detention is reviewed by a police inspector at the following points</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>6 hours after the relevant time (that is, when they arrived at the station)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>then after a further 9 hours (15 hours) and 9 hours (24 hours)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible the inspector might ask you for an update of the case for his/her review. You will need to show that you are actively pursuing the case where the subject is detained under PACE.</p>

<h3>The role and duties of the custody officer</h3>

<p>The custody officer has personal responsibility for the safe and lawful operation of activities in the custody suite and you must act in accordance with their instructions. They may delegate some tasks and functions to officers and staff to assist them.</p>

<p>Where this is done, the custody officer must be satisfied that the officers or police staff concerned are suitable, trained and competent to carry out the task or action in question (refer to note 3F PACE Code C).</p>

<p>The custody officer may be supported by a DDO or Designated Detention Officer, who have designated powers to undertake specific duties – such as taking DNA, fingerprints and photographs, searching of detainees.</p>

<p>When a person is taken to a police station, the custody officer will apply the provisions of PACE Code of Practice C regarding the recording of his presence, belongings and conditions of detention.</p>

<p>These provisions of PACE Code of Practice C apply to persons who are in custody in a police station. Paragraph 2.1A of PACE Code C states that when a person is brought to a police station:</p>

<p>(i) under arrest</p>

<p>(ii) is arrested at the police station having attended there voluntarily; or</p>

<p>(iii) attends a police station to answer bail,</p>

<p>they must be brought before the custody officer as soon as practicable after their arrival at the station or, if appropriate, following arrest after attending the police station voluntarily. When attending a police station you must comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/police-and-criminal-evidence-act-1984-pace-codes-of-practice">PACE Codes of Practice</a>.</p>

<p>Once a person has been served with papers and is detained under Immigration Act powers only certain parts of Pace Code of Practice C apply (sections 8 and 9 of the Code).</p>

<p>If custody officers are requested to serve forms on behalf of IE they should be asked to explain the forms fully and informed that they should provide relevant interpreters to achieve this if necessary.</p>

<p>When a person is brought to a police station under arrest or is arrested at the police station having attended there voluntarily, the custody officer will require a brief explanation as to the circumstances of arrest (why, when, by whom, where). The custody officer must tell him clearly of the following rights and of the fact that they are continuing rights that may be exercised at any stage during the period in custody.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the right to have someone informed of his arrest in accordance with section 5 of Code C of the PACE Codes of Practice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the right to consult privately with a solicitor and the fact that independent legal advice is available free of charge; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the right to consult the PACE Codes of Practice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The custody officer must also give the person various notices in writing for which the person must acknowledge receipt by signing the custody record. The person must also sign the custody record confirming whether they require legal advice.</p>

<p>If the person appears to be deaf or there is doubt about their hearing or speaking ability or their ability to understand English, and the custody office cannot establish effective communication, the custody officer must as soon as practicable call for an interpreter. In addition to the notices in English, translations should be available in the main ethnic minority languages and the principal European languages.</p>

<p>If the person is a juvenile, the custody officer must, if it is practicable, ascertain the identity of a person responsible for their welfare (their parent, guardian, care worker or any other person who has assumed responsibility for their welfare). That person must be informed, as soon as practicable, that the juvenile has been arrested, why they have been arrested and where they are detained. This right is in addition to the juvenile’s right in paragraph 5 of the Code not to be held incommunicado.</p>

<p>If the person is a juvenile, is mentally handicapped or appears to be suffering from a mental disorder, the custody officer must, as soon as practicable, inform the appropriate adult (who in the case of a juvenile may or may not be a person responsible for their welfare) of the grounds for their detention and their whereabouts and ask the adult to come to the police station to see the person.</p>

<p>The custody officer is responsible for ascertaining what property a detained person has with them when they come to the police station and for the safekeeping of any property which is taken from them, and which remains at the police station. If, after service of immigration notices the IO requires some of the person’s property, he or she will have to sign the custody record to confirm that they have taken receipt of the items.</p>

<h3>Rights of the individual</h3>

<p>When a person is brought to a police station under arrest for a criminal offence, they will have 3 basic rights under PACE:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>free legal advice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have someone informed of their arrest</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to consult the Codes of Practice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These rights can be requested at any time whilst the detained person is at the police station, even if they initially declined or they can do so in the middle of an interview for example.</p>

<h4>Reviews of detention under PACE</h4>

<p>Section 40 of PACE requires reviews of detention at a police station, initially after a maximum of 6 hours and subsequently at periods not in excess of 9 hour intervals. You may be asked to explain any perceived needs for continuing detention. In the event of a disagreement with a reviewing officer over the need for a further period of detention (where detention under the 1971 Act has not yet been authorised), you should explain the situation to a senior police officer (consulting a CIO/Inspector if appropriate). However, the police decision will be final.</p>

<p>Section 51(a) of PACE preserves powers of detention under the 1971 Act. Therefore, when a person is detained in a police station under the 1971 Act, for instance, as an illegal entrant or person liable for administrative removal, your written authority should suffice for detention to be maintained when reviews are conducted. But if a reviewing officer (whose attention has been brought to section 51(a) of PACE) requires the release of a person detained under the 1971 Act, and this is not agreed, consult a CIO or Inspector at once. If necessary, they should discuss the matter with a senior police officer.</p>

<h4>The right not to be held incommunicado</h4>

<p>If a person is held at a police station, section 5 of PACE Code of Practice C will apply. Amongst other things, it provides that a person may, on request, have a person known to him or who is likely to take an interest in his welfare, informed of his whereabouts at public expense as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>PACE Code of Practice C includes (see: Section 7) a statement of a person’s right to communicate at any time with their High Commission, Embassy or Consulate. This applies to citizens of independent Commonwealth countries and nationals of foreign countries including the Republic of Ireland. Such a person must be informed of this right as soon as practicable. They must also be informed as soon as practicable of their right to have their High Commission, Embassy or Consulate told of their whereabouts and the grounds for their detention. If a citizen of a country with which a bilateral consular convention or agreement is in force requiring notification of arrest, the appropriate High Commission, Embassy or Consulate shall be informed as soon as practicable. Consular officers may visit one of their nationals in police detention to talk to them and, if required, to arrange for legal advice. However, notwithstanding this and provisions of Consular Conventions, where the person is a refugee or is seeking asylum, a Consular Officer must not be informed of the arrest of one of their nationals or given access to or information about them except at the person’s express request.</p>

<p>If a person is held in a police station, the police will deal with such matters of notification in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pace-code-c-2019">PACE Code of Practice C</a>.</p>

<p>A written report must be retained of any notification made to a persons’ High Commission, Embassy or Consular representative.</p>

<h4>The right to legal advice</h4>

<p>On arrival at a police station, the custody officer must advise the person of their right to consult and communicate privately with a solicitor, and of the fact that independent legal advice is available free of charge. Whenever legal advice is requested, the custody officer must act without delay to secure the provision of such advice. Although not required under the PACE Codes of Practice, in cases in which IE is involved, the person should be advised by the IO that they can contact a representative of an immigrant welfare organisation.</p>

<p>If an IO wants to interview a person about immigration offences at a place other than a police station, the person must be advised that they are entitled to legal representation but that they should arrange this.</p>

<p>Every effort should be made to contact a particular solicitor, or firm of solicitors, who have been dealing with the person’s immigration situation, unless the person specifies otherwise. Paragraph 6.6 of PACE Code of Practice C (including sub- paragraphs (a) to (d)) states that a person who wants legal advice may not be interviewed, or continue to be interviewed until they have received such advice unless:</p>

<p>(a) the restriction on drawing adverse inferences from silence because the detainee is not allowed an opportunity to consult a solicitor applies (see Annexes B and C of PACE Code C); or</p>

<p>(b) an officer of Superintendent rank or above has reasonable grounds for believing that:</p>

<p>(i) the consequent delay might:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>lead to interference with, or harm to, evidence connected with an offence; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lead to interference with, or physical harm to, other people; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lead to serious loss of, or damage to, property; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lead to alerting other people suspected of having committed an offence but not yet arrested for it; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hinder the recovery of property obtained in consequence in the commission of an offence.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>(ii) when a solicitor, including a duty solicitor, has been contacted and has agreed to attend, awaiting their arrival would cause unreasonable delay to the process of investigation.</p>

<p>In considering whether this applies, the officer should ask the solicitor how long it is likely to be before he arrives and relate this to the time detention is permitted, the time of day and the requirements of the investigation. When a solicitor is on his or her way or is to set off immediately, it will not normally be appropriate to begin an interview before their arrival. If, however, it seems necessary to begin before a solicitor’s arrival, the solicitor should be given an indication of how long the police would be able to wait so there is an opportunity to make arrangements for someone else to provide legal advice.</p>

<p>If the solicitor nominated or selected by the individual either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>cannot be contacted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has previously indicated they do not wish to be contacted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having been contacted, has declined to attend and the person, having been advised of the availability of a duty solicitor has declined to ask for the duty solicitor</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>the interview may be started or continued without further delay provided an officer of police inspector rank or above has agreed.</p>

<p>If a person requesting legal advice changes their mind, the interview may be started or continued without further delay provided that the person has given their agreement in writing or on tape to being interviewed without receiving legal advice, and an officer of police inspector rank or above has inquired about the person’s reasons for their change of mind and gives authority for the interview to proceed. An entry should be made on the person’s custody record by the custody officer. A record of the person’s agreement, their change of mind, the reasons for it (if given) and, unless paragraph 2.6A of PACE <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pace-code-c-2019">Code of Practice C</a> applies, the name of the authorising officer must be recorded in the taped or written interview record.</p>

<p>A solicitor may only be required to leave an interview if their conduct is such that the interviewer is unable properly to put questions to a person. If you consider that the solicitor is acting in such a way, you may stop the interview and consult an officer not below the rank of superintendent if one is readily available (or otherwise an officer not below inspector rank who is not connected with the investigation). If that officer, after speaking to the solicitor decides that they should be excluded, the person must be allowed to consult another solicitor before the interview continues and that solicitor will be given the opportunity to be present at the interview. A solicitor is not guilty of misconduct if they seek to challenge an improper question to their client or the way it is put or if they advise the client not to reply to particular questions or if they wish to give their client further legal advice. It is the duty of a solicitor to look after the interests of their client and to advise them without obstructing the interview.</p>

<h3>Consideration of aggravating factors and the public interest</h3>

<p>Immigration breaches may, on their own, not be given the same gravity as the criminal offences described in other sections; however, your assessment may take account of other ‘aggravating’ factors that make it right to prosecute:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a pattern of repeat offending that displays a consistent and ongoing disregard for the law</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the breach is directly associated with, or is the cause, of wider breaches and/or criminality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>multiple breaches of different types or combined with lower-level criminality and/or anti-social behaviour, means that there is a disproportionate negative impact on the community and public services</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Section 24 illegal entry and similar offences</h4>

<p>The following aggravating factors are relevant when considering a decision in favour of prosecution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a potentially substantial confiscation order and the likelihood of timely enforcement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of violence / harm or risk to life, health or safety to (including those who rescue migrants at sea)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disruption to services, such as those relating to train services in the Channel Tunnel, disruption to flights or disruption to shipping / vessels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>economic loss, which may, for example, be linked to any disruption of services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the offending caused a significant investment of police or Immigration resources</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of money flows or financial advantage / gain or benefit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of repeated attempts to enter the UK illegally</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence that the suspect was previously refused entry clearance or a prior application for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the offending compromised the genuine identity of another person, causing them loss, distress, or inconvenience (obtaining leave by deception / entering without leave through fraud)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of provable involvement with an organised crime group behind the criminality</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The different levels of culpability of migrants in boats or lorries, in particular between those who travel on RHIBs with the intention or expectation that they will be intercepted and those whose intention is to avoid immigration controls altogether through concealed entry.</p>

<p>A single aggravating factor does not automatically mean that it is the public interest to pursue prosecution. Each must be considered relative to the other individual circumstances of the case. In considering the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark21">public interest</a> you must consider the following;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the more serious the offence and the greater the number of previous offences committed by a foreign criminal, the greater the public interest in prosecution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where a foreign criminal has also been convicted of an offence outside the UK, the overseas conviction will usually add to the public interest in pursuing prosecution - an example of an exception to this general rule might be where there is evidence that prosecution was pursued solely for political reasons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are factors that add weight to the public interest in prosecution, including where a foreign criminal:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>has a seriously adverse immigration history that includes non-compliance with restrictions and/or deception</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>has entered the UK in breach of a deportation order</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must consider the extent to which the individual has complied with any conditions attached to previous grants of leave, or any conditions of immigration bail. Evidence that the individual has significantly and deliberately sought to delay or frustrate the decision-making process or removal or has not complied with other requirements may be included in an assessment of compliance. This may include:</p>

<p>You must take account of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of deception practised at any stage in the immigration process, including submitting a false identity to the Home Office</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other type of fraud or deception, such as benefit fraud or NHS debt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>failure to attend interviews as requested</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of persistent failure to cooperate with redocumentation or returns processes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of clearly unfounded applications or further submissions lodged to frustrate enforced removal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>persistent failure to comply with bail conditions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>appearance before the First-tier Tribunal or Secretary of State</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>restrictions on work or study</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>residence</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>reporting</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>electronic monitoring</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>such other conditions as specified</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>failure to demonstrate genuine efforts to leave the UK voluntarily</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether they have worked illegally</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an individual’s lawful employment history and how they have supported themselves and/or their family</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a sustained history of compliance, including providing full information in their application, attending interviews, compliance with reporting requirements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Entry in breach of a deportation order</h4>

<p>Multiple instances of entry in breach of an extant deportation order carry an assumption of prosecution. The usual approach for a single breach without additional aggravating factors is likely to be re-deportation. However, in all cases, where the individual was released from a custodial sentence on the premise that they would leave the UK, consideration will be given to whether they should be recalled to prison. In other cases, aggravating factors may include an assessment of other known offences since initial deportation, the nature of their return and the factors described in relation to s24 and s25 cases above.</p>

<h4>Illegal working:</h4>

<p>A distinction is made between illegal working and working in breach. The distinction is subtle; illegal working covers a wider area than working in breach. In addition, illegal working includes individuals who have no conditions on their stay that they can breach. Working in breach could simply involve a student working more than their permitted hours. Illegal working could involve those using forged passports with no leave.</p>

<p>A single instance of working in breach of a condition of stay may also be mitigated but, where it is associated with wider harm, it is reasonable to take account of that fact. If the illegal working facilitates others to work illegally, is the cause of breaches of workplace safety or labour exploitation, or public health concerns, it may be appropriate to assign a higher public impact rating. Similarly, an unqualified or unlicensed individual working within a sector or service industry that requires accreditation and/or licensing for the safety of the public, for instance: health workers, may be considered for prosecution.</p>

<h4>Overstaying</h4>

<p>A short period of overstaying may be outweighed by mitigating circumstances. Longer periods will require a proportionately higher level of mitigation and detailed evidence. Multiple instances of overstaying or breaching restrictions will similarly be less likely to be justified.</p>

<p>Your assessment may take account of whether the individual has been warned regarding their behaviour, the circumstances of their coming to notice (whether it was voluntary) and the length of the period over which the breaches occurred. It is reasonable to attach more seriousness to repeated disregard for lawful restrictions where it can be shown that the individual had full knowledge of their status. In addition, you may take account of the cost to the public purse where repeated non- compliance can be shown to have caused a significant administrative and operational burden.</p>

<p>Mitigating factors may include evidence of administrative error in service of relevant notices or circumstances beyond the individual’s control which must be considered on their individual merits.</p>

<h4>Section 25 and 25A offences</h4>

<p>You must take account of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the level of culpability involved in securing or assisting the illegal entry of individuals or asylum-seekers to the UK or a member State in breach of immigration laws (this might include other offences committed alongside immigration offences)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the suspect’s actions caused harm to others, or placed other persons’ life, health or safety at risk (including those who rescue migrants at sea)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where only evidence of facilitation is steering the boat for a short period, for example a hand on the tiller, it may be more appropriate to charge for attempted entry. Where there is significant evidence however of organised facilitation and piloting the boat and/or arranging the journey, a charge of facilitation would be appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disruption to services, such as those relating to train services in the Channel Tunnel, flights or disruption to shipping / vessels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>economic loss, which may, for example, be linked to any disruption of services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the offending caused a significant investment of police or Immigration resources</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Exclusion from s25 and s25A prosecution and reasonable excuse</h4>

<p>S25A(1) of the Immigration Act describes how assisting as asylum seeker to enter may constitute an offence. However, it also states that this ‘does not apply to anything done by a person acting on behalf of an organisation which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>aims to assist asylum-seekers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>does not charge for its services’</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The requirement for ‘significant’ evidence of facilitation applies also to those who rescue those in apparent distress at sea. It is in the public interest that organisations and individuals who rescue those in distress may continue to do so and will not be convicted for facilitation offences. Under s25BA, those organisations, bodies or individuals who provide assistance and who are acting on behalf of or co-ordinated by Her Majesty’s Coastguard (HMCG), are protected from prosecution for the offence of facilitation. Most vessels that come across another vessel or persons in danger or distress at sea will inform HMCG or their foreign equivalent or will be responding to a mayday relay from them.</p>

<p>Seafarers may however act independently of HMCG, and it may be the case that there is a good reason for this, such as there not being enough time to contact HMCG, or not being able to make contact due to technical issues. A statutory defence exists for persons who can show that they had to assist an individual in danger or distress at sea for the time between that individual first being in danger and them being delivered to the nearest place of safety on land unless there is good reason for not doing so. The effect is that we will assume that, in such circumstances, the seafarer is telling the truth and acting in good faith unless we can disprove what he or she says beyond all reasonable doubt. The statutory defence will not be available to those persons steering small boats as it is not acceptable that those who are assisting unlawful immigration in this way should be able to easily escape prosecution if they claim that they were doing so as an act of rescue.</p>

<p>However, such individuals will still have access to defences available at common law.</p>

<p>It is right that in investigating a serious offence, all available evidence should be considered, and all relevant behaviours considered. Investigators will consider evidence that the rescuer is not acting in good faith, such as intelligence suggesting they are linked to people smuggling gangs, or the same person launching multiple ‘rescues’ over several days with no good reason for being at that location.</p>

<h4>Stowaways – statutory defences</h4>

<p>Section 25BB provides statutory defences for the master of a ship and crew in relation to stowaways. As long as they appropriately notify the authorities as soon as reasonably practicable before they then dock in the UK, and for crew members or passengers to provide humanitarian assistance to the stowaway so long as the presence of the stowaway is reported to the master of the ship as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>

<p>For stowaways on other modes of transport (that is, aviation and international rail), investigative and independent prosecutorial discretion will be relied on, on a case-by- case basis, in deciding whether a prosecution is in the public interest, taking into account what security measures are in place to prevent access to potential stowaways.</p>

<h3>Referral to Criminal and Financial Investigation (CFI)</h3>

<p>ICE officers and NCCU must, in all cases, refer details of a clandestine arrival to CFI who will decide whether to attend and consider criminal arrest and scene of crime procedures. CFI teams are responsible for investigating organised immigration crime and disrupting and dismantling organised crime groups (OCGs). and deal with immigration related criminal investigations categorised as level 1 and level 2, as defined within the Professionalising investigations programme (PIP) policy. They are divided into 3 operational areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>criminal investigation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>financial investigation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cash forfeiture and condemnation legal team.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>During office hours, the referral will normally be directly to the CFI team with responsibility for the area where the event has taken place. Out of office hours,</p>

<p>NCCU will make the referral to the on-call CFI CIOI for the relevant area who will decide on whether the case can be adopted.</p>

<p>Outside of office hours, when you suspect a criminal offence has taken place inland and you need an, immediate decision on whether CFI will adopt a case, you must contact the National Command and Control Unit (NCCU) by email or telephone and provide details of the relevant points regarding the suspected offences and offenders. NCCU will assess whether it meets CFI adoption criteria.</p>

<p>NCCU hold copies of the CFI on-call rota. Once the referral has been made by NCCU, CFI will also contact the police for further information as required telephone NCCU on 03000 194 999</p>

<p>Contact NCCU by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>telephone NCCU on 03000 194 999</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>email NCCU at CCU CIO</p>
  </li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>contact the on-call CFI manager (available on a 24/7 basis) for the region in which the suspected offence was committed who will assess the information and decide whether to adopt and direct resources accordingly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide CFI with contact name and number of ICE officer or police officer at the scene if applicable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If no response from on call CFI manager ICE must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>contact on-call regional Inspector (HMI)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact on-call grade 7 if no response received from HMI</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assess the case in real-time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact the referring officer for further information and make a decision based on the facts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider each case on an individual basis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>if the adoption criteria have been met</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>whether to adopt the case and decide the appropriate level of response</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>what resources are available</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if not arrested, decide whether the suspected offenders must be arrested immediately</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>update:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Pronto and Atlas/CID with actions taken</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>CLUE as soon as practicable with the referral details.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some referrals may not immediately meet the adoption criteria for CFI to adopt them as a criminal investigation case. ICE teams should consider whether the known facts of the case indicate that it falls within the current remit for criminal investigations by ICE teams or whether it may be better adopted by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark112">NCA or Border Police Command (BPC)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark115">other law enforcement partners</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Immigration Enforcement officers will record the referrals on PRONTO, CLUE and Atlas/CID.</p>

<h4>CFI - Threshold for adoption</h4>

<p>CFI will consider adoption of all cases referred to it by ICE teams, NCCU, the NCA, Border Force and other partner agencies. Cases will only be adopted where the facts of the case indicate that it meets the current CFI remit and objectives and where there is clear evidence of an offence and a realistic prospect of obtaining evidence sufficient to support a prosecution. A decision to adopt may also be subject to any joint tasking and co-ordination criteria that may apply.</p>

<p>It should be noted there is no power to detain individuals under the immigration act solely for the purpose of prosecuting a facilitator and that there have been successful prosecutions of facilitators when the illegal entrants have been removed and that an ICE officer may be required to give evidence that the persons removed were illegal entrants.</p>

<h4>Asylum cases</h4>

<p>All cases involving suspected criminal offences committed by asylum seekers have to be considered in the context of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/33/section/31" rel="external">section 31 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</a> which enshrined key principles of article 31 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees in UK law. Article 31(1) of the convention states that penalties should not be imposed on refugees where certain criteria apply.</p>

<p>Not all immigration offences covered by Article 31 Refugee Convention are covered by s.31 IAA 1999. In that case the CPS will consider the matter under its prosecutorial discretion - see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/immigration#a07" rel="external">Immigration - The Crown Prosecution Service (cps.gov.uk) - Public Interest, point 1.</a></p>

<p>Where an individual makes a claim for asylum on arrival or subsequent detection, and is suspected of committing a criminal offence, the CFI team will consider whether to adopt such cases for further investigation but depending on the circumstances of a case and the potential availability of a section 31 defence may defer any arrest or further investigation until the post decision stage. In this instance the CFI team may request initial information including a copy of the asylum screening record before making their decision. In cases where no immediate action is to be taken by CFI, officers should process the applicant in the normal manner.</p>

<h3>Multi-agency public protection arrangements MAPPA: scope</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/325" rel="external">Section 325 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003</a> (CJA 2003) provides for the establishment of MAPPA in all of the criminal justice areas in England and Wales. These are designed to protect the public, including victims of crime, from serious harm by sexual and violent offenders. They require the local criminal justice agencies and other bodies dealing with offenders to work together in partnership in dealing with these offenders.</p>

<h4>Responsible authority</h4>

<p>The responsible authority is the primary agency for MAPPA. This is the police, prison and Probation Service in each area, working together. The responsible authority has a duty to ensure that the risks posed by specified sexual and violent offenders are assessed and managed appropriately.</p>

<p>Other bodies have a duty to co-operate with the responsible authority in this task. The duty to co-operate agencies (DTC agencies) will need to work with the responsible authority on particular aspects of an offender’s life (such as education, employment, housing and social care).</p>

<p>MAPPA’ role is to ensure the successful management of violent and sexual offenders. The National MAPPA team, HM Prison and Probation Services, Public Protection Group has produced guidance which sets out the responsibilities of the police, probation service and prison service. It also touches on how other agencies may become involved, for example the Youth Justice Board will be responsible for the care of young offenders.</p>

<p>See also Foreign National Offender Returns command (FNO RC) guidance Multi- agency public protection (MAPPA) cases.</p>

<h2>Decision and disposal</h2>

<h3>Decision to pursue administrative removal action rather than prosecution</h3>

<p>Criminal or administrative action against law-breakers has the aim of removing or limiting the harm caused by an individual to the community and to act as a deterrent for others. It is not always in the public interest to pursue prosecution where other avenues are available and another approach would achieve the same objective. A rational balance has to be achieved and it is reasonable to take account of all relevant factors including the seriousness and frequency of offences, the cost of judicial action, whether it is in the public / community interest to prolong the stay of an individual that could be removed.</p>

<p>Administrative removal is therefore the normal course of action where an immigration offender is encountered. However, IE will consider adopting individual volume immigration crime (VIC) (level 1) cases for investigation depending on the level of harm they present to national security, to our immigration and border controls or the community.</p>

<p>In reaching decisions to adopt an investigation or not, IE will consider other available sanctions such as refusal of leave or curtailment of leave, service of civil penalties, removal and withdrawal of services.</p>

<p>Administrative removal will normally be appropriate where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an immigration offender can be removed within a reasonable time period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the immigration offender has previously complied with directions such as temporary release and the re-documentation process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are no outstanding applications for leave to remain or enter which require consideration or outstanding applications can be resolved within a reasonable time period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the immigration offender is not suspected of having committed an offence which would attract a prison sentence of 12 months or more</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Decision to prosecute</h3>

<p>See: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/immigration" rel="external">The Code for Crown Prosecutors - The Crown Prosecution Service – Immigration</a></p>

<h4>Referral to Crown Prosecution Service</h4>

<p>CFI or ICE Volume Crime Team officers must notify the CPS as soon as possible where substantial prosecution resources are likely to be required, whether in relation to a specific case, or a series of cases as appropriate.</p>

<p>Early advice to CPS is strongly recommended in respect of the following case types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>where the case is serious, sensitive, or complex</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where the case involves another death or risk of death to a passenger</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where there are multiple suspects involved in the facilitation or arrangement of illegal entry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where the case involves Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking including cases involving exploitation where charges under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 are under consideration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>large scale human facilitation / trafficking bearing the hallmarks of organised crime, including the employment of illegal workers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where an International Letter of Request is required, or where a Joint Investigation Team is being considered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where the suspect(s) is a minor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extensive volumes of electronic data, multi-media evidence, or third-party material</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where the suspect(s) is wanted by Europol or Interpol</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>organised manufacture or sale of forged or stolen documents for use in immigration crime</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>serious and complex money laundering offences, with complex restraint and confiscation issues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cases requiring multiple foreign enquiries and overseas liaison</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extensive or complex and sensitive disclosure issues</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Conditional cautions</h3>

<p>See:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>CFI guidance – Foreign national offenders and criminal cautions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ministry of Justice information - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-adult-conditional-cautions">MoJ Code of Practice Adult Conditional Cautions.</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A conditional caution allows an authorised person (usually a police officer) or a relevant prosecutor (usually the CPS) to decide to give a caution with one or more conditions attached. When an offender is given a conditional caution for an offence, criminal proceedings for that offence are halted while the offender is given an opportunity to comply with the conditions</p>

<p>You cannot administer (give) a conditional caution with foreign offender conditions because criminal investigators in IE are not authorised to do this. However, you can advise the police lead or the CPS whether it might be an appropriate disposal. Only the police lead or the CPS can make the final decision on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether a foreign offender conditional caution will be given</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what the conditions will be</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have established the offender’s removability you must first seek authority from a CIO to inform the police or CFI team of this. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>complete the conditional caution notification form and indicate whether the person is either:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a ‘relevant foreign offender’ (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark120">Conditional cautions</a>) and may be removed</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>not a ‘relevant foreign offender’</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>immediately email the form to the requesting police officer, custody officer or CFI team</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The police or CPS will then decide whether a conditional caution is the appropriate disposal option.</p>

<h3>Consideration of liability to civil penalty</h3>

<p>In addition to, or as well as, prosecution, you must consider whether to also pursue a civil penalty.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if there is not adequate evidence to pursue a prosecution for facilitation, is there adequate evidence to pursue the civil penalty where there is insufficient evidence of a crime but there has been a failure to comply with the requirements in Part II of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, that require carriers to take steps to prevent the carriage of clandestine entrants in a vehicle?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>see: Civil penalty notices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Marriage abuse</h4>

<p>See also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>General Instructions - Marriage investigations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CFI guidance – Criminal investigations – sham marriages</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The facilitation of individuals in relation to marriage, often referred to as a ‘sham marriage’, commonly involves marriage between a person subject to immigration control and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a person with indefinite leave to remain in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an individual with right of abode in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a British citizen</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>so they gain some entitlement or right to stay in the UK and access to provision of services. This could include anybody involved in the sham marriage, for example the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>bride or groom</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>witnesses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>church or registrar staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>immigration advisor or solicitor, if you can prove they acted in their capacity knowing it was a ‘sham marriage’</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It can also include anybody else who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>conspired</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>aided</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>abetted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>counselled</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>procured the crime:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>‘Procure’ means ‘arrange’ or ‘facilitate’ – the courts have defined it as ‘to produce by endeavour, by setting out to see that it happens and taking the appropriate steps to produce that happening’</p>

<p>If, on investigating the marriage, guilty knowledge can be proven the offence can include those who are remotely involved. For example the people organising the plans, such as booking the flights going in and out of the UK or booking the registry office, to assist the sham marriage taking place.</p>

<p>There is a duty on a registrar to report a suspicious marriage under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/33/section/24" rel="external">section 24 Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</a>.</p>

<p>CFI teams are responsible for investigating and prosecuting OCGs involved in marriage abuse. This does not include ‘single event’ marriages unless there is evidence it is linked to a wider series of crimes or there are other factors that mean a prosecution will be pursued. These factors are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high harm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>community impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reputational damage to the Home Office</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a single event marriage, that does not have these factors, it will be referred to the local ICE team.</p>

<p>In any investigation of a ‘sham marriage’ it is important to establish the full facts including details of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>bride and groom</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>witnesses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>organisers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any illegal involvement by persons conducting the ceremony or registry office staff</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An important element in intelligence gathering is the debriefing and prompt submission of relevant intelligence to ascertain if an OCG is involved. Retention (keeping), continuity and safe storage of all <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark13">exhibits</a> are critical.</p>

<p>For more information see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Search and seizure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>section ‘Operational debriefing’ of Post enforcement visit actions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Although criminal prosecution is normally the best solution when an OCG is involved, each case is judged on its own merits as there might be occasions when administrative removal (providing an immigration solution of removing the person from the UK rather than prosecuting them) for some suspects is the most proportionate option and in the public interest.</p>

<p>For more information on administrative removals see 50 Liability to administrative removal under section 10 (non-EEA).</p>

<h4>College abuse</h4>

<p>This is linked to the Student route under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/appendix-student">Immigration Rules: Appendix Student</a> where a prospective student receives a visa to enter the UK on the condition that they will study at a nominated college. Abuse of this system happens when the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>college does not exist</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>student is not enrolled</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>student is enrolled but they do not attend</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, bogus students receive access to the UK and entitlements, such as the ability to legally work. The scope of this offence is wide. It would involve any person knowingly involved. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an immigration advisor or solicitor submitting a false application to the Home Office</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff at the college</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>anybody else providing false information to undermine Home Office procedures or UK laws</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In any college abuse investigation, it is important to establish the full facts including details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how the person got their leave to enter or remain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether a legal representative or staff member from the college was involved</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The debriefing and submission of relevant intelligence of all those involved is an important element in building intelligence to link college abuse and determine any OCG involvement.</p>

<h4>Abuse of points-based system (PBS)</h4>

<p>CFI teams are responsible for tackling OCGs involved in PBS abuse. This does not include individuals who have fraudulently gained or attempted to gain leave under one of the PBS routes unless there is evidence it is linked to a wider series of abuse. In all PBS investigations it is important to establish the full facts including details of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>abuse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>method used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>suspects involved</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether there is enough information to establish a pattern of abuse involving an OCG or whether it is an individual acting alone</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Rogue employers / labour exploitation</h4>

<p>See also Illegal working operations. This category applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>employers who knowingly, or with reasonable cause to believe, employ illegal workers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other person involved in the chain, up and down, who knowingly committed a criminal act connected to employing illegal workers, providing guilty knowledge can be proven, it could include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>those who supply illegal immigrants knowing they are going to be employed</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>contractors</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>first line managers</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>directors</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>company owners</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those who attempted, conspired, aided, abetted, counselled or procured the crime</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>One of the aims of CFI teams is to tackle rogue employers who are knowingly, or with reasonable cause to believe, employing illegal workers in the UK. Rogue employers are often closely linked with facilitating illegal immigrants of whom some might have been trafficked into and across the UK. The focus must be on prosecuting those who are ultimately benefiting from exploiting vulnerable people.</p>

<p>CFI will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence (record) previous illegal working visits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gather the details of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>who was in charge</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the illegal workers encountered</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>get accounts of who employed them and under what circumstances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence (record) what action was taken to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>establish if a referral notice has been served</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>determine what was the outcome</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h4>Non-compliance with documentation process</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/19/section/35" rel="external">Section 35 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004</a> is aimed at dealing with foreign nationals who try to avoid removal by refusing to cooperate with the documentation process. It allows the Secretary of State to require a person to take specified actions that will assist the removal process. If the individual fails to comply with these requirements they can be prosecuted. For more information see Travel document interview process and prosecution under section 35.</p>

<p>CFI only consider adopting section 35 cases when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the section 35 process has been followed correctly up to the point of referral</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are no barriers to removal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>immediate removal would take place if the suspected offender possessed a valid travel document</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These cases will not be adopted if there is no intention to remove the suspected offender as soon as a travel document is available.</p>
