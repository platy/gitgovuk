<h2>Management of the scheme</h2>

<p><strong>1. What is the purpose of the competition guidance document?</strong></p>

<p>The competition guidance outlines the full policy requirements of the SHDF Wave 2.1 scheme, as well as setting out some of the high-level terms and conditions attached to projects that receive funding. It is not a legal document, nor is it a detailed view of how BEIS will manage the scheme and the processes projects will need to follow during delivery.</p>

<p><strong>2. How will BEIS manage the scheme?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS will appoint 3rd party organisations, including a Delivery Agent and a Delivery Partner, to act on its behalf in management of the scheme.  Grant Recipients will be required to work collaboratively with all organisations working on BEISâ behalf. Within the competition guidance and FAQs, references to BEIS stand not just for BEIS but also any 3rd party organisations that act on BEISâ behalf.</p>

<h2>Eligible applicants</h2>

<p><strong>3. I am a small landlord with fewer than 100 homes, can I apply?</strong></p>

<p>Bids must include a minimum of 100 social homes below EPC C, however this can be as part of a consortia bid with different partners each contributing fewer than 100 homes. Landlords with small amounts of stock are encouraged to bid as part of consortia and there is support to do so through the SHRA.</p>

<p><strong>4. Can I bid if I am not a Registered Provider?</strong></p>

<p>Non-registered providers of social housing that are registered charities or ALMOs can apply as part of a consortium that is led by a Local Authority, Combined Authority or Registered Provider of social housing.</p>

<p>We continue to look carefully at how to ensure the whole sector can engage with the fund and are further exploring how charitable organisations might directly access funding. We will communicate the outcome of this review in the coming weeks.</p>

<p><strong>5. Are combined authorities or other non-stock holding local authorities able to bid on behalf of a consortium?</strong></p>

<p>Non-stock-holding local authorities and combined authorities may bid as the lead of a consortium on behalf of eligible stock-holding applicants under Wave 2.1 of the SHDF to support the installation of energy performance measures in social homes in England.</p>

<h2>Eligible properties</h2>

<p><strong>6. Can I retrofit a home in SHDF Wave 2.1 that I retrofitted in a previous wave of the SHDF?</strong></p>

<p>No â SHDF Wave 2.1 grant funding cannot be used to fund works or activities that were funded as part of a previous wave of the SHDF. We will continue to revisit this position for future waves.</p>

<p><strong>7. Will there be a cap on the number of homes that start at EPC D?</strong></p>

<p>There is no cap on the number or proportion of EPC D homes that can be applied with.</p>

<p><strong>8. What happens if we have e.g. a small site office (i.e. non social home), as part of a block of social housing that e.g. needs external wall insulation - can the EWI be funded on that specific part of the building?</strong> (added 2 August 2022)</p>

<p>SHDF Wave 2.1 funding is reserved for social housing stock as defined by the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (except in the purposes of infill for non-social homes, as outlined in section 2.5.2 of the competition guidance) and cannot be used for other purposes.</p>

<p>Works to non-domestic buildings or parts of buildings would need to be 100% funded by applicants and cannot be used as part of your co-funding contribution.</p>

<p><strong>9. Are tenanted bedsits in sheltered accommodation eligible for Wave 2.1 funding?</strong> (added 2 August 2022)</p>

<p>SHDF funding is reserved for social housing stock as defined by the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (except in the purposes of infill for non-social homes, as outlined in section 2.5.2 of the competition guidance). If the tenanted bedsit falls under this definition, it is eligible for Wave 2.1 funding.</p>

<p><strong>10. Are communal spaces within a social home (e.g. a social care home) eligible for SHDF funding?</strong> (added 2 August 2022)</p>

<p>If a communal space (e.g. living room) is within self-contained social housing accommodation, this would be eligible for SHDF funding.</p>

<p><strong>11. What if Iâve already started a project, but I have homes in the project that work is yet to begin on? Can I apply with these homes?</strong> (added 2 August 2022)</p>

<p>SHDF Wave 2.1 funding may only be used for homes where installations of measures have not yet commenced. If preparatory work has already occurred (for instance teams set up, overarching plans in place, tenants engaged, designs developed, remedial/enabling works undertaken, etc), this does not preclude the project from bidding for Wave 2.1 funding.</p>

<p><strong>12. Are projects based around void properties viable?</strong> (added 2 August 2022)</p>

<p>Yes, projects based around void properties are acceptable â although landlords should consider whether prioritising immediate benefits to in-situ tenants is more appropriate when selecting stock to apply with. We recognise that forecasting what properties will be void may be a challenge â therefore, bids submitted on the basis of expected void archetypes will be acceptable, but you will need to demonstrate how youâve modelled that data in your application. Recognising the challenging nature of developing these bids, we recommend taking a realistic approach to the deliverability, and ensure you plan your projects with contingency. If in reality the number of voids you applied with do not occur, an alternative plan should be in place to fulfil your commitment at bid stage â so for instance, bids still need to include a tenant engagement plan.</p>

<h2>Works to non-social homes</h2>

<p><strong>13. Is installation of communal heating (e.g. shared ground loop) within a mixed tenure block eligible for funding?</strong></p>

<p>It is anticipated that the only measures covered by the infill policy on non-social homes will be external wall insulation and associated ventilation. Any additional measures, including installation of communal heating systems, would need to be accompanied by a clear argument for why they require a full block application. In the case where non-social homes would still maintain access to their original heating source following the installation of the communal heating system, funding will not be provided and connection costs would need to be provided separately.</p>

<p><strong>14. Are non-social homes funded under infill policy on non-social homes required to meet the same performance targets as social homes?</strong></p>

<p>No, non-social homes are not expected to meet the performance targets required of the social homes.</p>

<p><strong>15. Is co-funding required on non-social homes included as part of infill policy on non-social homes?</strong></p>

<p>No, co-funding is not required on non-social homes being included as part of the infill policy on non-social homes. It should be noted that if a contribution from the leaseholder, freeholder, or shared ownership is withheld or refused, the Applicant may be required to underwrite this.</p>

<p><strong>16. Where there are non-social homes the guidance states âLow Income â OO Only (&lt;Â£31K gross household income) â SHDF will fund 100% of costs of the infill measure.â Does this mean that there would be Â£20k available to this property (if it was a solid wall EPC D) or does it mean SHDF will pay all the costs needed to get up to the same standard as neighbouring properties that are being retrofitted (next door could potentially be having more than Â£20k spent on it split between the social landlord &amp; SHDF)?</strong></p>

<p>All works on non-social homes funded by SHDF Wave 2.1 will be capped at the value indicated by the âtotal spend if utilising maximum grant funding and associated minimum co-fundingâ column in Table 1, based on the starting EPC and wall type. Where a contribution is required as defined by the infill policy on non-social homes (Private Rental Sector or Owner Occupier with a &lt;Â£31k gross household income homes), the SHDF will fund the value outlined in Table 1 minus the contribution. Any additional spend will need to come from the Applicant.</p>

<p><strong>17. What is an example of a measure that is not an infill measure?</strong></p>

<p>An example of a non-infill measure is a Solar PV being installed on each roof of a terrace consisting of both social and non-social homes â the installation of solar PV on the non social homes would not be on an âinfillâ basis</p>

<h2>Bid size</h2>

<p><strong>18. Is there a maximum number of homes per bid?</strong></p>

<p>There is no maximum number of homes per bid. Wave 2.1 signals a significant scale up in funding and bidders are encouraged to think about large-scale projects. Bids must include a minimum of 100 social homes below EPC C.</p>

<p><strong>19. Is there a minimum bid size in terms of bid value?</strong></p>

<p>There is no minimum bid size in terms of the amount of funding requested. Bids must include a minimum of 100 social homes below EPC C and costs must fall within the cost parameters set out in the guidance.</p>

<p>Funding will need to be proportionate and limited to what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the scheme. BEIS reserves the right to review the distribution of funding across England comparative to the number of social homes per region and allocate funding in line with this.</p>

<p><strong>20. What happens if fewer than 100 homes are delivered due to resident refusals?</strong> (added 2 August 2022)</p>

<p>Positive tenant engagement is a critical aspect of successful delivery and we expect to see clear strategies and plans for how this will be achieved. In addition, projects are expected to have contingency plans in place to address tenant refusals. All changes that are submitted beyond your application need to be approved by BEIS, or third parties acting on BEISâ behalf, via the change control process.</p>

<h2>Eligible installers</h2>

<p><strong>21. Our tender process will allow for us to select a main contractor to oversee the work, this main contractor will purely be there for a health and safety/management point of view, they will then employ a sub contractor who will have the necessary Trustmark registration (or equivalent) and follow PAS2035 standards. The main contractor is unlikely to have Trustmark registration but the installer (sub-contractor) will. Could you confirm that this would be acceptable?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, this would be acceptable. There are multiple different models for a successful delivery, but all projects must ensure they have in place the required PAS2035 roles with suitably qualified people (as set out in PSA2035 Annex A) and the installers of energy efficiency measures are qualified and registered in line with PAS2030:2019 requirements including the use of any sub-contractors. Whilst the PAS2035 Retrofit Co-Ordinator may or may not be employed by the main contractor, they must be registered with one of the Trustmark (or equivalent)-approved Retrofit Coordinator schemes.</p>

<h2>Performance outcomes</h2>

<p><strong>22. I would like to install a heat pump, but this makes the space heating demand of the home worse due to assumptions in SAP about heat pump running time. Will stopping short of 90kwh/m2/year for this reason adversely affect my application?</strong></p>

<p>The space heating demand level of 90kwh/m2/year is a consideration âwhere reasonable and cost effectiveâ â it will not be mandatory for applications to hit 90kwh/m2/year for homes, so long as they appropriately justify the end energy performance the homes will reach bearing in mind consideration of the 90kwh/m2/year, and the âreasonableâ and âcost effectiveâ considerations in the application. The justification outlined in this question may be one reason that some applicants give for not hitting the 90kwh/m2/year level in some instances â although the application will also need to appropriately consider the fabric levels of a home as part of the justification of end energy performance of the home.</p>

<p><strong>23. What are the air tightness/ ventilation performance requirements?</strong></p>

<p>Airtightness testing can be a very useful tool to measure and identify potential sources of leakage and heat loss or to as part of checking the adequacy of the ventilation. For specific performance requirements such as the requirement to undertake airtightness tests or the need to address the adequacy of the ventilation bidders should refer to PAS2035 standard and have a Retrofit Co-Ordinator who will ensure the requirements are identified as part of the risk assessment process.</p>

<h2>Eligible measures</h2>

<p><strong>24. Will BEIS prioritise projects proposing fabric over those with low carbon heating, even if the justification for only doing low carbon heating fitted their definition of reasonable?</strong></p>

<p>Evaluation criteria are designed in alignment with the guidance provided to landlords â a landlord that applied with just an appropriate low carbon heating measure (see section 2.10.1 of the competition guidance) would not be disadvantaged compared with one that also/instead included fabric in their application, unless the retrofit approach was not sufficiently justified.</p>

<p><strong>25. Do I have to apply with fabric measures, or can I apply with just non-fabric measures (e.g. low carbon heating or solar PV) on some or all homes?</strong></p>

<p>A fabric first approach to works is required. However, if the level of fabric is sufficient pre-retrofit, then an application with only non-fabric measures (e.g. low carbon heating or solar PV alone) on some/all homes can be considered, with significant justification required. If sufficient justification is not provided, the application is unlikely to score well on strategic fit or value for money.</p>

<h2>Funding and eligible costs</h2>

<p><strong>26. If measure costs inflate, will grant cost caps inflate along with them/does BEIS hold the right to raise cost caps post award?</strong></p>

<p>For Wave 2.1, the cost cap levels are those outlined in section 2.11.2 of the competition guidance and it is expected that these will not be adjusted for any 20inflation. There will be a change control process to consider any changes that arise during delivery, but this is not expected to result in an increase to the cost caps. The expectation is that bidders use the certainty provided by the longer delivery windows for Wave 2.1 to secure a contract within the stipulated grant funding levels (plus co-funding) over the delivery period. Bidders are expected to provide as accurate costs as possible at bid stage â including through engaging with the supply chain, but also factoring in any estimates of inflation. If costs do increase during delivery, then landlords may input more co-funding to cover these.</p>

<p><strong>27. What will be the process if my costs go up due to inflation, particularly where I could not anticipate this at application stage?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS will not increase the grant funding allocated to a project. Projects will be held to account for the contents of their application.</p>

<p>Applicants are expected to provide as accurate costs as possible at bid stage â including through engaging with the supply chain, but also factoring in any estimates of inflation. Projects should control their costs as much as possible by maintaining accurate estimates and implementing financial controls and good procurement practices.</p>

<p>Any changes to the agreed project scope will be subject to the change control process.</p>

<p><strong>28. Do the cost caps include VAT and if so, what do we assume VAT to be? 10% 5% or 0%?</strong></p>

<p>The cost caps include VAT. Grant applicants are expected to seek their own advice on VAT (e.g. internal finance team/HMRC) before application. Inaccurate submission of VAT is a potential blocker to effective delivery.</p>

<p><strong>29. Should costs for non-SHDF eligible measures be included as co funding?</strong></p>

<p>No â only SHDF eligible measures should be included as co funding. Any non-eligible measures must be funded by the applicant in addition to the 50% co funding requirement for eligible measures, and should not be included in the application.</p>

<p><strong>30. Can I carry out modelling or start works before I receive grant funding? If so, what can I spend funding on?</strong></p>

<p>All eligible costs that are incurred by a project between competition launch and signing of the GFA can be claimed against the overall co-funding requirement should the project be successful in grant award. BEIS does not take on any risk or liability for funds spent in this period, including if a project is not successful in competition.</p>

<p>Activities that are necessary pre-requisites for writing a high quality bid cannot be claimed. This principle is designed to incentivise early project kick off and utilisation of the time between competition launch and GFA signature.</p>

<p><strong>31. How will the process for counting pre-GFA activity towards co-funding work?</strong></p>

<p>Eligible costs incurred between the launch of the Wave 2.1 competition and the signing of the Grant Funding Agreement (GFA) may be counted towards a projectâs co-funding requirement. Eligible costs are described in section 2.11 of the competition guidance and defined in the GFA. Projects should keep a record and evidence of any spend incurred. Once the GFA has been signed, projects will be required to evidence their co-funding spend in the first monthly reporting cycle. This spend will be at the projectâs risk pending successful award and projects carry the risk for any contractual arrangements that they would not be able to uphold if they are unsuccessful in the SHDF competition.</p>

<p><strong>32. We are hoping to receive funding from Homes Englandâs Building Safety Fund to upgrade existing cladding and external wall insulation on Council owned tower blocks. These tower blocks are also being considered for a SHDF Wave 2.1 bid. Would these properties still be eligible for SHDF Wave 2.1 funding if HE funding was awarded? If these funding streams could work in tandem, would these properties be looked upon favourably in a SHDF bid, as evidence of greater value for money for BEIS?</strong> (added 2 August 2022)</p>

<p>SHDF funding may be used alongside funding from other schemes, as long as the same measure is not funded twice. We recognise that in exceptional circumstances value for money investments may be made where other Government funding is used as an appropriate part of co-funding for SHDF Wave 2.1 works, for example to support building safety work. However, we would not anticipate that the majority of the co-funding for a project would come from these sources â and any âblended fundingâ that were to be considered for co-funding would need to be spent on an eligible cost of SHDF Wave 2.1, as outlined in the guidance document.</p>

<p>Whilst the SHDF is open to blending funding across schemes, the applicant must ensure that any funding awarded through the SHDF Wave 2.1 meets SHDF Wave 2.1 objectives. Funding from other schemes must be used correctly and in line with the eligibility criteria of that scheme. SHDF is not responsible for ensuring the correct use of funding from other Government schemes. Any blended funding from another scheme has to be secured by the point of application to SHDF, and evidenced in the SHDF application, rather than being assumed that it will be secured at a later date at the point of application to SHDF.</p>

<p>The Grant Funding Agreement will require grant recipients to declare that acceptance of the grant offered will not result in double funding of a single measure, for example, they are receiving funding from another source for the same or similar activity.</p>

<h2>Scaled cost caps by wall type</h2>

<p><strong>33. What properties can utilise the solid wall cost cap?</strong></p>

<p>Any home that i not classed as âcavityâ in the SAP wall type categorisation may use the solid wall cost cap if appropriate to do so. This includes brick, stone (granite, sandstone or whinstone), timber, system build, or curtain walls. Applications wishing to utilise the solid wall cap will be required to justify why they are doing so. As with any application, value for money proposals will be required. The level of funding applied for should be dependent on the cost of improving the stock to the SHDF performance outcomes and should not be dependent on the maximum level of grant funding for retrofit works available. On a by exception basis, some homes that are not âsolid walledâ may be eligible for the higher cost caps, where the specifics of the archetype requires a treatment more aligned with the solid wall cost cap (e.g. cavity wall homes with cavities so thin that they cannot be filled, and thus requiring solid wall insulation). BEIS anticipates a very small number of homes will fall into this category, and strong justification is required in such cases.</p>

<p><strong>34. What about properties that have a mix of cavity and solid walls?</strong></p>

<p>We would anticipate that these homes would be eligible for the solid wall cap. Applications should justify this use of the cap.</p>

<p><strong>35. We have some properties in our stock that have been recommended partial external wall insulation by our retrofit team and I wanted to ask if a partial insulation measure would be fully funded if it were to improve the SAP and energy efficiency of a property?</strong></p>

<p>Yes â partial insulation would be eligible for SHDF Wave 2.1 funding as long as works meet the performance requirements, and are in alignment with other areas of the SHDF guidance e.g. PAS 2035.</p>

<p><strong>36. What level of evidence is required to justify the use of the solid walled cost cap?</strong></p>

<p>For homes that fall within the definitions of brick, stone (granite, sandstone or whinstone), timber, system build, or curtain walled homes, statement of these wall types along with why the cavity cap is not appropriate for the specific homes will be sufficient justification. For other homes wishing to utilise the solid wall cost cap (e.g. homes with cavities that are too thin to fill), a clear statement of why they cannot be appropriately treated with cavity wall insulation will be required.</p>

<p><strong>37. Will my bid score better if I include a high proportion of hard-to-treat homes?</strong></p>

<p>No â it is not mandatory for homes to be hard to treat, and BEIS recognises that many homes will not need a significant number of measures to reach the SHDF performance outcomes. All applications should consider how best to deliver at scale towards the improvement of social homes below EPC C.</p>

<h2>Additional low carbon heating cost cap off gas grid</h2>

<p><strong>38. How do cost caps work for homes on the gas grid that wish to install low carbon heating?</strong></p>

<p>If retrofitting a cavity wall EPC D home that costs Â£6k (Â£3k grant funding+Â£3k co-funding) to reach EPC C with appropriate 90kwh/m2/year consideration, a landlord can use the additional Â£2k grant funding within the Â£5k cost cap towards cost of LCH. This would need to be matched by an additional Â£2k co-funding. Any extra spend to complete the retrofit would be required to come from additional co-funding. The retrofit must comply with the key principles outlined in section 2.10.1 of the competition guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>39. If a home is connected to the gas grid but is electrically heated, is it eligible for additional low carbon heat cost caps (i.e. is it treated as an âoff gridâ home)?</strong></p>

<p>For the purposes of SHDF Wave 2.1, an off gas grid home is defined as one that does not use mains gas for heating purposes.</p>

<p><strong>40. I have a small block of flats where 1 is on gas and the others have storage heaters. I would like to install heat pumps to the whole block. Would SHDF consider this as an infill measure to include the flat on gas with the heating?</strong></p>

<p>The homes using electric storage heaters classify as off gas grid homes â and are therefore able to utilise the cost cap structure for off gas grid homes in Table 1, section 2.11.2 of the competition guidance. The one home that uses mains gas for heating would fall under the on gas grid cost cap structure â see table 2 in guidance.</p>

<p><strong>41. Can I use the energy efficiency cost cap as well as the low carbon heating cost cap for a low carbon heating solution off gas grid?</strong></p>

<p>The primary source of funding for low carbon heating off grid will be through the low carbon heating grant funding, and it is expected that in most cases this will be sufficient to fund installation of low carbon heating alongside associated co-funding. However, if necessary, bids will also be able to use some of the energy efficiency grant funding for installation. This must not compromise the delivery of appropriate energy efficiency measures, and should represent value for money.</p>

<h2>Admin and ancillary costs</h2>

<p><strong>42. Can I spend more than 15% of total project costs on Administration &amp; Ancillary costs (A&amp;A)?</strong></p>

<p>Grant funding on A&amp;A must be less than 15% of total grant funding - the expectation is that A&amp;A spend should make up less than 15% of total costs. There is not scope to increase this proportion of grant funding used on A&amp;A; however, in exceptional circumstances there may be scope for landlords to use slightly more than 15% of overall project costs for A&amp;A purposes through spending slightly greater than 15% of the co-funding contribution on A&amp;A. Note that this approach is not encouraged in general. Administration and ancillary costs are expected to be as low as possible, and BEIS will be assessing applications on value for money grounds, including requiring justification of costs.</p>

<p><strong>43. How would I work out the maximum spend on administration and ancillary?</strong></p>

<p>To work out the maximum spend on administration and ancillary after knowing what the total spend on retrofit works would be, first calculate what the total spend would be by dividing the spend on retrofit works by 85, then multiplying by 100. Then subtract the spend on retrofit works from the total spend to find the maximum spend on administration and ancillary.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>If a project plans on spending Â£8.5m on retrofit works (including both grant and co-funding), this would comprise at least 85% of total spend, if we assume A&amp;A is less than 15% of total spend. Dividing Â£8.5m by 85 gives Â£0.1m, and multiplying by 100 gives Â£10m. Â£10m-Â£8.5m = Â£1.5m â therefore, it is expected that less than Â£1.5m would be spent on A&amp;A costs in this example.</p>

<p><strong>44. Would SHDF Wave 2.1 funding cover cost of the removal of gas supply from properties if the move to a heat pump takes place?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the remedial aspect of administration and ancillary costs covers those elements vital to the retrofit of social homes that arise through reasons other than landlord neglect. This would encompass the removal of gas supply from properties, but this would need to comply with the expectations and requirements on A&amp;A spend (see section 2.11.3 of the competition guidance). Any inclusion of spend on remedial works would need to be proportionate â with value for money on measures delivered being a key driver of SHDF funding award.</p>

<p><strong>45. We have some blocks that have benefited from previous cavity wall insulation and the majority of the properties are at EPC C. However, we know that the building insulation and fabric is failing. Will SHDF Wave 2.1 allow the insulation to be removed and a new EPC to be completed at that stage (we expect them to be EPC E) and then to develop the retrofit plan?</strong></p>

<p>The remedial aspect of A&amp;A costs covers those elements vital to the retrofit of social homes that arise through reasons other than landlord neglect. This would encompass the removal of failed cavity wall insulation, but this would need to comply with the expectations and requirements on A&amp;A spend (see section 2.11.3 of the competition guidance). Any inclusion of spend on remedial works would need to be proportionate â with value for money on measures delivered being a key driver of SHDF funding award.</p>

<p>Any home with a valid EPC currently at or above EPC C would need to have an updated EPC assessment to prove that it was below EPC C, and thus eligible for SHDF funding, unless being included on an infill basis (see section 2.5.1 of the competition guidance on âHomes at EPC C or aboveâ.</p>

<p>BEIS would not expect that the default replacement for the removed cavity wall insulation would be external wall insulation â unless cavity wall insulation is not technically possible for the archetype.</p>

<p>All installs need to be in alignment with PAS 2035/2030:2019.</p>

<p><strong>46. Can administration and ancillary costs be used to train both in house and contractor retrofit coordinators to deliver the project?</strong> (added 2 August 2022)</p>

<p>In house training of Retrofit Co-ordinators could be included as an administration and ancillary cost. We would not expect SHDF funding to be used to train external retrofit co-ordinators.</p>

<h2>Digitalisation</h2>

<p><strong>47. Is it compulsory to include digitalisation? Will it make the bid more attractive?</strong></p>

<p>It is not compulsory to include digitalisation and a bid will not be negatively affected for not doing so.</p>

<p><strong>48. Digitalisation attracts annual costs. Is this likely to be covered for a number of years or is it solely for install?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS will not cover ongoing annual costs for digitalisation.</p>

<p><strong>49. Will the digitalisation funding also need to be co funded?</strong></p>

<p>Digitalisation is an eligible cost, and 50% of eligible costs need to be provided by landlords.</p>

<p><strong>50. Is the 2% digitalisation funding additional to the Capital spend limits and A&amp;A requirements?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, this would be a capital cost, which would be separate from the cost cap limits.</p>

<p><strong>51. Can we apply for funding under the digitalisation area for SAP based modelling software?</strong></p>

<p>Routine stock modelling, using modelled expected data for archetypes has a valuable role within retrofit. However, the data processing of modelled data is excluded from this definition of the digitalisation of retrofit.</p>

<h2>Delivery and grant funding spend</h2>

<p><strong>52. Delivery up to 30 June 2025 may not be long enough for the project I am planning, and there is no room for contingency. How can I ensure that the project can carry on despite potential delays? Will projects be able to go past 30 June 2025, and what will be the process?</strong></p>

<p>The delivery window for SHDF Wave 2.1 will go up to 30 June 2025. Projects must spend all their grant funding by 31 March 2025. Projects are expected to deliver within this timeframe, and all applications should be based on these timelines.</p>

<p>Projects can utilise the offer to use co-funding upfront to kick off their projects at SHDF Wave 2.1 competition launch (late August/ early September 2022). âCompetition launchâ means the date on which the final set of competition and grant documents will be published.</p>

<p>Any changes to the agreed project scope will be subject to the change control process.</p>

<p>These principles will be reflected in the Grant Funding Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>53. What is the required split between grant funding and co-funding throughout the project?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS generally expects projects to fund activities by equal parts grant funding and co-funding throughout delivery. Projects must plan for this outcome.</p>

<p>Projects running to 30 June 2025 will be utilising only co-funding in the last 3 months of delivery, and so small deviations from the equal parts principle may occur.</p>

<p>Projects must uphold their co-funding commitment. Evidence that the required level of co-funding has been secured within the Lead Applicantâs organisation will be collected at application stage. Projects will need to evidence their continued commitment to the agreed co-funding throughout delivery. Failure of projects to contribute the overall agreed level of co-funding will result in a reduction in grant funding and clawback where necessary, or potential termination of the agreement.</p>

<p><strong>54. What will be the process in managing my project if I am not able to spend grant funding allocated in the financial year? What are the flexibilities around this?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS expects projects to spend their baselined, agreed grant funding amount in each financial year. Projects must spend all their grant funding by 31 March 2025.</p>

<p>Where there is expected or actual underspend against this baseline in any financial year, projects should make BEIS aware of this eventuality as early as possible and submit a change request which will go through the change control process. There is no guarantee that a projectâs grant funding can be moved between financial years.</p>

<p><strong>55. The guidance specifies that projects can receive a one-off upfront payment at the start of the project where there is âexplicit needâ. How do you define this and who is eligible?</strong></p>

<p>Projects that can provide a clear reason as to why an upfront payment will materially improve the delivery of their project in time, cost and/or quality will be eligible for this payment. BEIS takes on risk by giving upfront payments and therefore there needs to be a corresponding identifiable benefit to justify the provision of funding. BEIS will assess the need for this on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>BEIS views the lack of early cash flow in an organisation as an example of explicit need, however BEIS is open to any case for upfront funding and will look at each request on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the upfront payment can be provided. BEIS will follow the âManaging Public Moneyâ guidelines in all instances when making these decisions.</p>

<p><strong>56. Which documents need to be signed by successful Lead Applicants before grant funding payments will be made? Can I start work on my project ahead of all documents being signed?</strong></p>

<p>Lead Applicants will need to sign their Grant Offer Letter and Grant Funding Agreement (with all associated documents including the Data Sharing Agreement) before grant funding payments can be made. This is to ensure that all projects are operating on a level playing field and have formally signed up to the scheme terms and conditions before receiving funding.</p>

<p>Projects may start work ahead of these documents being signed using co-funding and at their own risk.</p>

<p>BEIS is making every effort to give Lead Applicants early sight of the Grant Funding Agreement and Data Sharing Agreement, so they can review the generic documents and ask for any clarifications well in advance of execution. The GFA, GOL and DSA draft templates are planned to be published in early August 2022 (subject to changing timelines) and signature of these documents is expected in February/March 2023 (subject to changing timelines).</p>

<p><strong>57. The guidance and GFA say projects should plan for 40/60 grant funding split over FY23/24 and FY24/25, and also that grant and co-funding should be spent in roughly equal measure throughout delivery. Will I be marked down or not awarded funding if I am not able to plan for this split? What are the flexibilities and process?</strong> (added 2 August 2022)</p>

<p>Project grant funding spend should be aligned to the SHDF spend profile of 40/60 over FY23/24 and FY24/25. BEIS expects that co-funding and grant funding are spent in roughly equal measure throughout delivery, however from April 2025 onwards only co-funding can be used, and projects have the option to utilise co-funding at their own risk in the period from competition launch to GFA signature.</p>

<p>Each successful project will have a percentage of grant spend agreed for FY23/24 and FY24/25 based on their application and any subsequent discussion with BEIS. These figures will then be added to Annex 6 of the GFA for each individual project.</p>

<p>Where projects are not able to spend the grant funding agreed for each financial year, requested changes to the agreed project scope will be subject to the change control process. BEIS will reserve the right to reduce the overall grant funding amount given where projects underspend in any given financial year.</p>

<h2>Application process</h2>

<p><strong>58. Will there be multiple tranches of funding within the SHDF Wave 2 process?</strong></p>

<p>As part of the 2021 Spending Review process, Â£800 million of additional funding was secured by the SHDF. The Wave 2.1 competition will look to allocate as much of this funding as possible to upgrade the social housing stock in England currently below EPC C up to that standard.</p>

<h2>Modelling at bid stage</h2>

<p><strong>59. Does the principle on bill decreases take into account the general increase in fuel bills, for example installing an air source heat pump might not deliver a huge bill saving just due to the increasing cost of electricity? Can I use methods such as actual bills to evidence a bill reduction to strengthen my application?</strong></p>

<p>Evidence of bill decrease should be based upon modelling via Full SAP, or PHPP as an alternative. The modelling methodology used needs to be the same before as after retrofit â for instance, if using SAP 2012 before retrofit then this also needs to be used post retrofit. BEIS requires homes to reach EPC C, and modelled evidence needs to be provided to support this. Any further evidence beyond modelled improvement to EPC C (e.g. submission of actual current bills with estimates based on future bills post retrofit) will not further benefit an application compared to the bill improvements evidenced through modelling.</p>

<p><strong>60. Can the PHPP modelling tool be used as an alternative to SAP?</strong></p>

<p>Yes PHPP is a recognized tool for domestic energy model in PAS2035 in assessing and designing your retrofit projects however for compliance with the SHDF Wave 2.1 funding you will need to demonstrate that the dwellings that have been retrofitted now meet an EPC C rating.</p>

<p><strong>61. Do all properties in a bid need to have PAS2035 medium term plans registered on Trustmark (or equivalent), or can we base a bid around a representative sample of properties and then carry out missing PAS2035 surveys after award, but before work starts? Do I need to do individual airtightness tests?</strong></p>

<p>The guidance with the PAS2035 standard provides some discretion in taking samples at different stages within the process e.g. 7.1 Risk assessment process:</p>

<p>7.1.1 The Retrofit Coordinator shall ensure that a retrofit risk assessment is undertaken of each dwelling or dwelling type within the project that is subject to retrofit.</p>

<p>An example of this in practical terms for is the PAS 2035 compliance for Path C projects, it would be acceptable to carry out sample air pressure tests on a dwelling of each type in a building, both at assessment and post-completion.</p>

<p>However, the overall strategy for this would be developed the Retrofit Coordinator, who needs to come to an informed view on whether any set of sample results is adequate, based on the information in the retrofit assessments, the measures proposed and the consistency of the results in the sample. The strategy may differ between pre and post retrofit testing.</p>

<p><strong>62. What EPC data do we use if RdSAP data is considered not desirable. It was mentioned earlier that guidance will be issued about how we measure the ratings of our buildings. What will that look like? What measure can we use to benchmark the homes?</strong></p>

<p>It is recommended that Full&nbsp;SAP&nbsp;is used as the acceptable modelling methodology as it would demonstrate the applicant fully understands the technical challenge they are undertaking. PHPP would alternatively be an acceptable method of modelling the design intent.</p>

<p>Whilst recognising that RdSAP can be used for PAS 2035 dwellings, we would prefer a higher level of modelling and more accurate level of energy demand estimation than RdSAP for the purposes of setting performance targets for this project, in alignment with the PAS 2035 standard (preferably Full SAP software).</p>

<p>It is acceptable to use recent&nbsp;EPC&nbsp;certificates combined with stock analysis at the application stage of the proposal.</p>

<h2>Consortia bids</h2>

<p><strong>63. In consortia bids, do all consortia members need to sign the Grant Funding Agreement, or just the Lead Applicant?</strong></p>

<p>The Grant Funding Agreement will be signed solely between the Lead Applicant and BEIS for consortium applications. BEIS expects the Lead Applicant to ensure necessary agreements between consortium members are in place. These agreements should ensure the overall funded activities within the GFA are deliverable, and that all consortium members understand the terms and conditions attached to receiving BEIS funding.</p>

<p><strong>64. Does BEIS have any expectations on how the Lead Applicant should manage consortia members?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS understands that consortia are formed for a variety of important reasons and so seeks to give as much flexibility as possible to consortia that BEIS has confidence can deliver on the funded works. However, there are several aspects to consortia management that are essential for the smooth operation of the SHDF scheme and BEIS requires these aspects to be evidenced at application stage and demonstrated throughout delivery. Please refer to section 8.2 of the competition guidance for these elements.</p>

<p><strong>65. The competition guidance states that all grant funding for SHDF Wave 2.1 projects must be transferred and spent by the Grant Recipient by 31st March 2025. If I am in a consortium, does âGrant Recipientâ apply to just the Lead Applicant, or all consortium Applicants?</strong></p>

<p>The term Grant Recipient applies to the Lead Applicant in a consortium, and BEIS in most cases will only interact with the Lead Applicant regarding finance and payments. All grant funding for consortia must be transferred and spent by 31 March 2025, and since BEIS will only transfer funds for works already completed, this rule will logically apply to all consortia members. Consortium members will need to evidence their spend to the consortium Lead Applicant, who will in turn evidence this spend to BEIS and receive the corresponding payment.</p>

<p><strong>66. What will be the requirements for consortia when signing the Grant Offer Letter?</strong> (added 2 August 2022)</p>

<p>The Consortium Lead is responsible for ensuring the consortium and all its members comply with the terms, conditions and requirements of the Grant Funding Agreement. The GFA will be contingent on all consortium members entering into a legally binding agreement (a âCollaboration Agreementâ) which at least confirms all consortium members have read the GFA and associated documents, and agree to the requirements within it. BEIS will have the right to request and receive information and evidence demonstrating that consortium members are complying with the GFA, and BEIS will reserve the right to request repayment of the Grant from any individual consortium member where it is reasonable to do so.</p>
