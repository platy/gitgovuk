<p>This week figures on testing in care home settings are included in this publication for the first time.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This statistical publication aims to provide information on rapid testing for people without COVID-19 symptoms in England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in England by test result</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in England by region</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in England in education settings</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in England in care homes</li>
</ul>

<p>This publication focuses on rapid testing using lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests, however polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests are included where appropriate, either for comparison or where regular asymptomatic <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing is used. All data used in the report can be found in the ‘Tests conducted’ data tables on the weekly collection page. This includes information on both <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests at lower-tier local authority level.</p>

<h4>The figures in this report are not deduplicated and refer only to the number of tests taken, not the number of people tested. Because people can have more than one test, the data should not be compared with prevalence or case positivity rates.</h4>

<p>The figures in this report include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests which were registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure. They do not currently include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted where the tests were not registered via this route. <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests for the majority of secondary care NHS staff and some testing within the private sector testing are therefore not included.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#about-this-data">About this data</a> section below for more information.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Types of tests</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests check for the genetic material of the coronavirus in the sample, which is taken using a swab and is processed in a lab via a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>). This type of test is predominantly used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anyone who has symptoms</li>
  <li>to confirm a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result in certain use cases, including:
    <ul>
      <li>self-reporting LFDs<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
      <li>cross channel hauliers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>regular asymptomatic testing in social care</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lateral flow device tests</h4>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, often referred to as rapid tests, test for the presence of proteins called ‘antigens’ which are produced by the virus. They are swab tests that give results in 30 minutes or less, without the need for processing in a laboratory. These tests are primarily used for those who do not have symptoms.</p>

<p>From 21 October 2020, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were made available in limited capacity except where rapid testing pilots were conducted. Since then, their availability has expanded to a broader range of settings.</p>

<h3>Rapid testing for people without symptoms</h3>

<p>Rapid testing using <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests is currently being offered to people who do not have symptoms, in a range of different settings.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is carried out at asymptomatic test sites, which are deployed in a range of community settings such as universities, schools, care homes and workplaces. They are also set up by local authorities as part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-testing-explainer/community-testing-a-guide-for-local-delivery#how-the-community-testing-programme-works" class="govuk-link">community testing program</a>. Testing at these sites is assisted: a person will take a swab test under the supervision of a trained operator who then processes the test then reads and records the result.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is carried out entirely by individuals themselves (that is an individual takes their own test, unassisted, and reports their own result), however in these specific situations (see the <a href="#types-of-tests" class="govuk-link">Types of tests</a> section above) if a positive test result is returned the individual is required to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-lateral-flow-antigen-testing-for-people-without-symptoms">understanding lateral flow tests for people without symptoms</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted, England<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup>
</h2>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted has been increasing overall since their introduction in October 2020.In the latest week (4 March to 10 March), 6,294,877 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted. The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted has increased in each of the latest 3 weeks. The number of tests conducted in the latest week is more than twice as many conducted in the previous week, which coincides with return of secondary students to school.</p>

<p>In comparison, in the latest week 1,070,948 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests were conducted. This is the seventh successive week for which more <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted than <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. Previously the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted had always been higher than <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. This reflects the increasing use of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, as well as a decrease in symptomatic people taking a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test due to decreasing COVID-19 prevalence.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests have different uses and are therefore applied in different situations (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-tests">Types of tests</a> section above for more information). The primary purpose of rapid <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is to identify people with COVID-19 who do not have symptoms. As the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted increases, more asymptomatic positive cases are identified earlier and therefore they are less likely to transmit the virus to their contacts.</p>

<p>Of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in the latest week, 6,447 tests returned a positive result, and 6,279,530 tests returned a negative result. Since <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were introduced, 103,107 positive results and 23,395,443 negative results have been reported.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by region, England</h3>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted has increased steeply across all regions in the latest week, continuing the upward trend from previous week. This follows a decrease between 11 February and 17 February which coincided with half term. Between 4 March and 10 March 2021, the most <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted in the South East followed by London.</p>

<p>*Students in this time period only included children of critical workers and those in vulnerable groups who were currently attending school.</p>

<p>Staff, students, household bubbles and support bubbles who test positive after using a home <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test kit are required to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Individuals who test positive from an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test taken at an on-site test centre do not require a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>. For more information on the testing methods for the different phases of education see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by phase of education</h3>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted within primary schools, school-based nurseries and maintained nursery schools increased substantially between 14 January 2021 and the beginning of February to over 700,000 tests in a week. Between 11 and 17 February the number of tests conducted decreased compared to the previous week, which coincided with half term. In the latest week the number of tests conducted has increased to 832,007 tests. 757 positive test results were returned in the latest week within primary schools and nurseries, an increase from 549 positive results in the previous week.</p>

<p>Similarly, within secondary schools and colleges, the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted increased gradually since the week commencing 31 December 2020 to over 400,000 in the week commencing 4 February. The number of tests conducted decreased between 11 and 17 February compared with the previous week, which coincided with half term. In the latest week, the number of tests has increased sharply to 3,733,229 tests which reflects the return of children of non-key workers to school. The number of positive test results has increased for 3 consecutive reporting weeks, up to 2,039 positive results in the latest week.</p>

<p>91,934 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted in the latest week in higher education, which is an increase from the previous week. The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in higher education peaked between 3 December to 9 December 2020 which coincides with students getting tested to enable them to travel home for the winter break. There has been an increase in positive results in higher education in the latest week, with 102 positive test results returned.</p>

<h4>The number of positive test results is not published as a proportion of the total tests conducted due to the data quality. In addition, because there are differences in the testing operation between the different phases of education, they cannot be directly compared. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#data-quality">Data quality</a> section below for more information.</h4>

<h3>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by staff, students, household bubbles and support bubbles</h3>

<p>In the latest week 581,208 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were taken by staff in secondary schools, in comparison with 755,247 tests taken by staff in primary schools, school-based nurseries and maintained nursery schools. The number of tests conducted by primary, nursery and secondary school staff rapidly increased over the last 3 reporting weeks. This follows a low number of tests in the week commencing 11 February, coinciding with half-term.</p>

<p>In the latest week, 2,762,775 tests were taken by students in secondary school this is over 8 times the previous week and coincides with students returning to school from 8 March.</p>

<p>80,383 tests were taken by individuals that belong to a household bubble of a student or staff member at school or nursery and 9,416 were taken by individuals in their support bubbles.</p>

<h2>Tests conducted and registered to care home settings, England</h2>

<p>The rapid asymptomatic testing operation has been rolled out differently across care home residents, staff and visitors, as summarised in the table below. In addition, <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests are also being used for regular asymptomatic testing of residents, staff and visitors.</p>

<p>The number of tests conducted in care homes includes staff, residents and visitors tested via test kits directly sent to the care home which were registered. It will not include care home staff, residents or visitors who are tested via a different route, for example at a regional or local test site or a mobile testing unit, or tests that were not registered.</p>

<p>*Close contact visits with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing began on 14 December 2020 but ceased on 6 January 2021 as a result of the national lockdown. Throughout the period of national restrictions, visits were limited to outdoors, in visiting pods, or with a substantial screen; as well as those in exceptional circumstances such as end of life.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted and registered to care home settings, England</h3>

<p>The number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted within care homes increased overall from 40,000 tests at the beginning of July 2020 to over 550,000 tests in the week commencing 7 January 2021.This has decreased across the last 2 months to 442,449 tests in the latest week (4 to 10 March 2021) as prevalence and the number of outbreaks has reduced.</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted within care homes increased steeply from the week commencing 10 December 2020 to over 560,000 tests in the week beginning 4 February 2021. Since then, the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted has decreased slightly to 536,675 tests in the latest week (4 to 10 March 2021) as prevalence and the number of outbreaks has reduced.</p>

<p>The week commencing the 4 March 2021 was the seventh successive week for which more <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted than <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. Previously the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted had always been higher than <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. This reflects the increasing use of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, as well as a decrease in symptomatic people taking a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test due to decreasing COVID-19 prevalence.</p>

<p>Of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in the latest week (4 to 10 March 2021), 486 tests returned a positive result, and 536,018 tests returned a negative result. Since <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were introduced, 20,003 positive results and 4,693,697 negative results have been reported.</p>

<p>This data can be found in the ‘table_8’ and  ‘table_9’ tab of the ‘Tests conducted: 28 May 2020 to 10 March 2021 data tables’ on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/weekly-statistics-for-nhs-test-and-trace-england-4-march-to-10-march-2021">weekly collection page</a>.</p>

<h2>About this data</h2>

<p>Lateral flow device tests were first made available from 21 October 2020 in England. This data contains <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported through the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and does not include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted where the tests were not registered via this route that is used to collect data for this report.</p>

<p>The following use cases for <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are not currently reporting results digitally into Test and Trace systems, and therefore are excluded from this report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>testing for the majority of NHS secondary care staff</li>
  <li>testing for some staff in private sector industries</li>
  <li>testing for some hauliers, these are published separately see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/haulier-coronavirus-testing" class="govuk-link">haulier coronavirus testing</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, test results should be reported directly into Public Health England. In future, all <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests will be reported via the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and will be included.</p>

<p>A full explanation of the data sources and methods used to produce these statistics can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>Data quality</h3>

<p>Given the importance of this service and the commitment of NHS Test and Trace to be open and transparent with the public it serves, this data is being released at the earliest possible opportunity. However, this data should be treated with caution whilst the understanding of the data and its quality improves.</p>

<p>The requirement for care home staff to register negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results was suspended between 31 December 2020 and 15 January 2021 inclusive, following a change in guidance issued on 23 December 2020 to increase testing in care home staff. As a result, a proportion of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted on care home staff will not be included for these dates.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test produces a result on the device almost immediately, without it being automatically recorded, therefore some results might not be captured. For settings where self-reporting <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing procedures<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link">[footnote 4]</a></sup> are in place, it is likely that the number of tests conducted are underreported. It is however their statutory duty to do so, and easier reporting tools are being rolled out to support these individuals to report their tests as quickly and efficiently as possible. It is possible that tests with a negative result are more likely to be affected, therefore it is not advisable to calculate a positivity rate with the data.</p>

<p>Positive test results are not published as a proportion of the total number of tests conducted. There are several reasons why it is not advisable to calculate a positivity rate with this data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of tests conducted is not deduplicated and refers to the number of tests taken and not the number of people tested. Because people can have more than one test, the number of tests conducted therefore cannot be compared with prevalence or case positivity rates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rapid testing is primarily used for repeat testing of asymptomatic individuals and the frequency of testing varies across different settings, therefore positivity rates would not be directly comparable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the potential underreporting of tests conducted by individuals self-reporting is more likely to affect negative test results than positives thus skewing any positivity rate calculation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More information on data limitations and how the figures in this publication can and can’t be used is outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>Future developments</h3>

<p>We continue to explore the feasibility of adding new breakdowns to the publication on rapid testing to support user needs. Over the coming months, we intend to make data available on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>individuals tested in care homes (staff, residents, visitors)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rapid testing for asymptomatic NHS staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rapid testing in public and private industries</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>community testing programme</p>
  </li>
</ul>
