<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Background</h2>

<p>The Insolvency Service has a general duty to deter unfit conduct by company directors and individuals. One way we do this is to publish details online of recent disqualifications, bankruptcy restrictions and debt relief restrictions. These include details of the unfit conduct that led to the enforcement action against the people concerned. Two search facilities enable you to see the details.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> _ <strong>When informing the public about unfit conduct, we disclose personal information. This contributes to our regulatory objectives, so it is allowed by the Data Protection Act.</strong> _</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>What are the search facilities?</h3>

<p>Our two search facilities enable you to find out about the unfit conduct that led to a court making an order or a director or debtor giving an undertaking (a legally binding promise).</p>

<p>The search facilities give details of recent results we have achieved with regard to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>company director disqualification orders and undertakings (disqualifications)</li>
  <li>bankruptcy restrictions orders and undertakings (restrictions)</li>
  <li>debt relief restrictions orders and undertakings (restrictions).</li>
</ul>

<p>We also provide details of disqualifications obtained by other prosecuting and regulatory authorities when these are notified to us.</p>

<p>On <em>disqualifications</em>, our results relate to companies that were, or could be, wound up under the Insolvency Act 1986 in England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p>On <em>restrictions</em>, our results relate to individuals who entered into bankruptcy or debt relief proceedings in England and Wales only.</p>

<p>The links below lead to the search pages.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.insolvencydirect.bis.gov.uk/IESdatabase/viewdirectorsummary-new.asp" rel="external">Click here to view disqualification results</a></p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.insolvencydirect.bis.gov.uk/IESdatabase/viewbrobrusummary-new.asp" rel="external">Click here to view restrictions results</a></p>

<p>Note: <em>These search facilities add to and do not replace the statutory registers that give details of all current disqualifications and restrictions. You can find more about these registers below</em>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Unfit conduct (orders and undertakings)</h2>

<p>The Insolvency Service obtains disqualifications and restrictions by court order or by undertaking, both of which have the same legal effect.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Orders</h3>

<p>If the defendant disputes our application for disqualification or restrictions or fails to respond to it, the case is heard at court. If the court makes an order, our search facilities give you a summary of its findings about the unfit conduct.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Undertakings</h3>

<p>An undertaking is where the director or debtor admits to unfit conduct and agrees to be disqualified or restricted. It is a legally binding agreement that has the same effect as a court order.</p>

<p>Our search facilities give you details of the unfit conduct admitted by the defendant solely for the purpose of the proceedings. This is made clear in the wording of the undertaking.</p>

<p>Prosecuting and other regulatory authorities may also obtain director disqualifications by court order or undertaking. Where these are notified to us then we will publish details.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How long are records stored on the search facilities?</h2>

<p>We publish new results on a weekly basis and they are accessible for 3 months from publication. A disqualification may last up to 15 years and restrictions between 2 and 15 years. You can contact the Insolvency Service to obtain details of current restrictions and disqualifications obtained by us that are not currently displayed on our search facilities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Who do I contact for details of cases not currently displayed?</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Disqualifications</h3>

<p>If you want details of the unfit conduct of an individual currently subject to a period of disqualification who is not included in our disqualification search facility, please email our Civil Proceedings Team: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:legalservices@insolvency.gov.uk">legalservices@insolvency.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that if the disqualification was obtained by another authority then the Insolvency Service may hold little, or no, information; please contact that authority directly if you know the details</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Restrictions</h3>

<p>If you wish to request details of the unfit conduct of an individual currently subject to bankruptcy/debt relief restrictions who is not included in our restrictions search facility, please contact the official receiverâs office dealing with the case.</p>

<p>You will find details of the relevant office by searching for the individual in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/search-bankruptcy-insolvency-register">Individual Insolvency Register</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot find the individual on the Individual Insolvency Register, please email the Insolvency Enquiry Line <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:insolvency.enquiryline@insolvency.gov.uk">insolvency.enquiryline@insolvency.gov.uk</a> . Give as much detail as possible, for example the individualâs full name and address, the court name, case reference, trading name and address or date of birth. They will forward your enquiry to the relevant office. If you prefer, you can contact the Insolvency Enquiry Line on 0300 678 0015 between 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday; they will take your contact details (including an address for a written response) and forward a message on your behalf to the right office.</p>
