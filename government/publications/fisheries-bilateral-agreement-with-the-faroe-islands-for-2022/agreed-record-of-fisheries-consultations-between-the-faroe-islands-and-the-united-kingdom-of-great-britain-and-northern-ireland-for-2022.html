    <p>A Delegation from the Faroe Islands, headed by Herluf Sigvaldsson and a Delegation from the United Kingdom, headed by Will Francis, met in Tórshavn on 23 and 24 November 2021, and by video conferences on 17 December 2021 and 31 January 2022 for consultations on mutual fisheries relations for 2022. A list of participants is attached in Annex III.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Delegations recalled the Framework Agreement on Fisheries between the government of the Faroes and the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland signed in Copenhagen on 29 October 2020 (‘the Framework Agreement’). They recalled the principles which underpin their close cooperation as set out in Article 1 of that agreement. They further recalled their close cooperation in 2021 in international fisheries forums, including Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, and looked forward to deepening their dialogue on the management of shared stocks in 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Delegations agreed to recommend to their respective authorities the fishery arrangements for 2022 as outlined in this Agreed Record, including Annex I.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this Agreed Record, references to a ‘Party’ are references to the Faroe Islands and the United Kingdom as contracting parties to the Framework Agreement and references to the waters of a Party are references to the Parties’ respective areas of fisheries jurisdiction as defined in Article 2(3) of the Framework Agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Delegations reiterated their determination to cooperate, in their mutual interest, in securing continued responsible fisheries and ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of marine living resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Delegations further restated the importance of cooperation in terms of the facilitation of scientific research with regards to marine biology and the marine environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Delegations agreed to meet during 2022 and to establish an annual intersessional process, to ensure the successful implementation of this Agreed Record and to deepen the strategic relationship between the Parties.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Exchange of opportunities</h2>

<p>8.1.	The Delegations agreed to exchange quotas for a number of stocks, as set out in Annex I.</p>

<p>8.2.	The Delegations agreed that the Faroe Islands may request a quota review meeting once they have fished at least 90% of the UK’s initial haddock transfer of 400 tonnes.</p>

<p>8.3.	The Delegations decided that, if requested by the Faroe Islands no later than 15 June 2022, the Parties will reconvene to discuss an additional transfer of up to 1,600 tonnes of haddock in UK waters of 4 to the Faroe Islands (bringing the total transfer to 2,000 tonnes) and commensurate further transfers of stocks in Faroese waters to the UK.</p>

<p>8.4.	Additionally, so long as the Faroe Islands have requested a review meeting no later than 15 June 2022, the Delegations agreed to hold the review meeting within 15 working days of the date of the request to discuss the potential exchange of additional quotas between themselves as outlined above.</p>

<p>8.5.	In 2022, the Delegations decided that the review meeting will also consider data to date on the catch composition of each Party’s fleet fishing in the other’s waters. The Delegations agreed to share per set or haul catch data, at a kg-per-species-caught level of detail, at least 5 working days before the review meeting and provide any updates to this data immediately before the meeting.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> UK-Faroe Islands special area</h2>

<p>9.1.	The Delegations recalled the provisions in the Agreement between their governments, relating to the Maritime Delimitation in the area between the Faroe Islands and the United Kingdom done at Tórshavn on 18 May 1999, hereinafter referred to as ‘the 1999 Agreement’, concerning the exercise of fisheries jurisdiction by the Contracting Parties in the Special Area defined by that Agreement.</p>

<p>9.2.	In order to effectively regulate third country vessels fishing in the Special Area and practically implement the 1999 Agreement, the Delegations agreed to continue consultations between them during 2022 until they reach a legally robust, bilaterally agreed system for the licensing of third country vessels fishing in the Special Area. The Delegations agreed that they will establish such a system during 2022 and make said system operational as soon as possible and no later than 31 December 2022.</p>

<p>9.3.	The Delegations have decided that, solely as an interim approach during 2022 while consultations continue, they will exchange information on all third country vessels to which they have issued a licence that either implicitly or explicitly grants access to fish within the Special Area. The aforementioned exchange of information will include Vessel data (International Maritime Organisation (<abbr title="International Maritime Organisation">IMO</abbr>) number or registration.) and the licence conditions that apply to such vessels, including any conditions which apply specifically to the Special Area. This exchange of information will take place no later than 24 hours after the issuing by either Party of a licence to a third country vessel that either implicitly or explicitly grants access to fish within the Special Area.</p>

<p>9.4.	The Delegations recognised the importance of the unique marine and benthic habitats that lie within the Special Area and reaffirmed their mutual obligations, under Article 7 of the 1999 Agreement and Article 2 of the 2013 Protocol to the 1999 Agreement, to cooperate on measures to protect the marine environment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Monitoring, control and surveillance</h2>

<p>10.1. The Delegations recognised the importance of cooperation in regard to monitoring, control and surveillance measures stipulated in the Technical Annexes to this Agreed Record in Annex II. They agreed that there are significant benefits for both sides in sharing relevant information and intelligence and in enhancing co-operation in areas of mutual interest. The Delegations agreed to strive to meet regularly to discuss relevant topics and evaluate the cooperation regarding the Special Area.</p>

<p>10.2. The Delegations noted the ongoing issues in relation to e-log book reports. The Delegations welcomed indications that an interim e-log agreement should be in place for 1 March 2022, which will allow for the current solution to continue, whereby the UK Fisheries Management Centre receives information from Faroese vessels by email. The Delegations decided to work together in 2022 on a long-term solution for <abbr title="Electronic Reporting Systems">ERS</abbr> data exchanges using an agreed format.</p>

<p>10.3. The Delegations agreed to communicate in a timely manner the introduction of new fisheries legislation and technical measures, in particular, recognising the need to provide such information in an expeditious manner to fishers from both Parties.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Annex 1: Licensing arrangements</h3>

<p>This annex sets out the types of activity that will be licensed and any licence limitations.</p>

<h4>1. General rules</h4>

<p>1.1.	All UK vessels fishing in Faroese waters will be on the licence list issued by the appropriate licensing authority, Vørn acting on behalf of the Ministry of Fisheries in Tórshavn, Faroe Islands.</p>

<p>1.2.	All Faroese vessels fishing in UK waters will possess a licence issued by the appropriate licensing authority, The UK Single Issuing Authority (<abbr title="UK Single Issuing Authority">UKSIA</abbr>), acting on behalf of the Marine Management Organisation, the Scottish ministers, the Welsh ministers and the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>

<p>1.3.	The vessels of one Party will comply with any non-discriminatory area closures decided by the other Party.</p>

<p>1.4.	Licences issued by one Party to a vessel of the other Party, and their associated conditions, will be kept on board that vessel when fishing in the issuing Party’s waters and produced to an enforcement officer of that Party on demand. Electronic versions will be sufficient.</p>

<p>1.5.	A UK vessel conducting a directed fishery in Faroese waters may change to another directed fishery on condition of prior notification of the change to the Faroese authorities.</p>

<p>1.6.	A Faroese vessel conducting a directed fishery in UK waters may change to another directed fishery on condition of prior notification of the change to UK authorities.</p>

<h4>2. Publication of licence conditions</h4>

<p>2.1.	The UK will publish the conditions <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> that apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/united-kingdom-single-issuing-authority-uksia">vessels licensed to fish in UK waters</a> on GOV.UK</p>

<p>2.2.	Conditions that apply to vessels licensed to fish in Faroese waters can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.kunngerdaportalur.fo/default.aspx" rel="external">Faroese Law Gazette database</a></p>

<p>2.3 Vørn will strive to publish the license list on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.vorn.fo" rel="external">www.vorn.fo</a></p>

<p>2.4.	The licences list issued by one Party to a third Party to fish in the special area, will be sent to the other party as soon as possible. </p>

<h3>Annex 2: Arrangements for the electronic exchange of licensing data</h3>

<p>An interim solution for licensing data exchange for the period covered by the Agreed Record is set out in this Annex. During this period, the Parties will continue to develop exchange procedures.</p>

<h4>1. Licensing Authorities</h4>

<p>For the purposes of this Annex</p>

<p>The ‘licensing authority’ will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vørn acting on behalf of the Ministry of Fisheries in Tórshavn, Faroe Islands, for UK vessels</li>
  <li>the UK Single Issuing Authority (<abbr title="UK Single Issuing Authority">UKSIA</abbr>), acting on behalf of the Marine Management Organisation, the Scottish ministers, the Welsh ministers and the Northern Ireland Executive, for Faroese vessels</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘flag authority’ will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vørn in Tórshavn, Faroe Islands for vessels flying the flag of the Faroe Islands</li>
  <li>the UK SIA for vessels flying the flag of the UK</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Procedure for licensing of fishing vessels</h4>

<p>2.1 The flag authority will submit an application to the licensing authority for each individual vessel requesting to be licensed. The application will contain the information set out in Appendix I.</p>

<p>2.2 The licensing authority will respond as soon as reasonably practicable to a licence application, indicating whether a licence has been granted or rejected. If a licence application is rejected, the reason for rejection will be provided.</p>

<p>2.3 If the flag authority becomes aware that a vessel is not or is no longer eligible to fish under a licence that has been applied for or granted, the flag authority will notify the licensing authority without delay.</p>

<p>2.4 If there are any changes to a vessel’s characteristics and the details provided at point 2.1,  the existing licence will be withdrawn and without delay the flag authority will send a new application to the licensing authority if the conditions for eligibility are still met.</p>

<p>2.5 The licensing authority may refuse, suspend or withdraw a licence where a fundamental change of circumstances has occurred or in cases of a serious threat to the sustainable exploitation, management and conservation of marine biological resources, or where it is essential in order to prevent or supress illegal, unreported or unregulated (IUU) fishing, including serious non-compliance with the rules in their waters.</p>

<h3>Annex 3: Arrangements for the exchange of fleet registers</h3>

<p>The fleet register is important for the application of the <abbr title="Electronic Reporting Systems">ERS</abbr> (see Annex 4) and VMS (see Annex 5) to the agreed record.</p>

<ol>
  <li>This annex is yet to be agreed. Revision of this annex will be contingent upon the development and implementation of data exchange procedures.</li>
  <li>The Faroese fleet register published at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.teyggjan.fo/" rel="external">www.teyggjan.fo</a>
 </li>
</ol>

<h3>Annex 4: Arrangements in respect of electronic exchange of catch and activity data (Electronic Reporting Systems)</h3>

<p>This Annex sets out the technical arrangements relating to the electronic reporting system (<abbr title="Electronic Reporting Systems">ERS</abbr>) for 2022:</p>

<h4>1. Simple interim <abbr title="Electronic Reporting Systems">ERS</abbr> solution</h4>

<ul>
  <li>the Parties will continue with the same format currently in place which is the exchange of <abbr title="Electronic Reporting Systems">ERS</abbr> data by email.
This includes COE (Catch on Entry), CAT, COX (Catch on Exit), CON (Control Areas) that are exchanged through email</li>
  <li>the electronic catch reports sent from Faroese vessels while fishing in UK waters, will be sent to UK Fisheries Monitoring Centre (<abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr>) email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:UKFMC@gov.scot">UKFMC@gov.scot</a>
</li>
  <li>the electronic catch reports sent from UK vessels while fishing in Faroese waters, will be sent to Faroe Islands Fisheries Monitoring Centre (<abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr>) email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:vakt@vorn.fo">vakt@vorn.fo</a>
</li>
  <li>daily reports will be sent by vessels of each party when in the waters of the other Party</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Long-term solution</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Parties will work towards agreeing and implementing an electronic exchange of <abbr title="Electronic Reporting Systems">ERS</abbr> activity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Annex 5: Satellite tracking of fishing vessels (Vessel Monitoring System)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>All fishing vessels will have an operational satellite tracking device installed on board and be tracked by their flag State Fisheries Monitoring Centre (<abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr>) when fishing in waters of the other Party.</li>
  <li>For the purpose of the satellite tracking, the Parties will exchange consistent latitude and longitude coordinates of their waters. Such coordinates will be for operational purposes only. The data will be communicated in computer readable form, as decimal degrees in the WGS-84 datum.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vessel Monitoring System hardware and software components will be tamper proof, such as, will not permit the input or output of false positions and will not be capable of being manually over-ridden. The system will be fully automatic at all times regardless of environmental conditions. Each Party will ensure that it is prohibited to destroy, damage, render inoperative or otherwise interfere with the satellite tracking device. In particular, the masters will ensure that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the satellite tracking devices are fully operational</li>
      <li>data are not altered in any way</li>
      <li>the antenna or the antennas connected to the satellite tracking devices are not obstructed in any way</li>
      <li>the power supply of the satellite tracking devices is not interrupted in any way</li>
      <li>the satellite tracking devices are not removed from the vessel</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The satellite tracking device will ensure the automatic transmission at all times of the following data:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the fishing vessel identification</li>
      <li>the most recent geographical position of the fishing vessel, with a position error which will be less than 500 metres, with a confidence interval of 99%</li>
      <li>the date and time expressed in UTC of the fixing of the position of the fishing vessel</li>
      <li>the speed and course of the fishing vessel</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When a vessel of one Party subject to satellite tracking enters or exits the waters of the other Party, the flag state will forward to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre (<abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr>) of the other Party (the UKFMC (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ukfmc@gov.scot">ukfmc@gov.scot</a>)) and Faroese authorities (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:vakt@vorn.fo">vakt@vorn.fo</a>)) an entry or exit message as described in Appendix I. These messages will be transmitted without delay. The tracking frequency by the flag state <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr> of a vessel being in the waters of the other Party will be on an hourly basis, or more frequent if the other Party requests.</li>
  <li>When a vessel has moved into the waters of the other Party, the first position message from the vessel will be communicated from the flag state <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr> to the relevant <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr> of the other Party within the hour after moving into the waters of the other Party. These messages will be identified as position messages as described in Appendix I.</li>
  <li>It will be prohibited for a vessel to switch off its satellite tracking devices when in waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party.</li>
  <li>Messages according to paragraphs 5 and 6 will be in computer readable form, utilising Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) or other secure protocols, subject to prior agreement between relevant FMCs.</li>
  <li>In the event of technical failure or non-function of the satellite tracking device fitted on board a vessel, the master of the vessel or the owner or their representative will communicate to their flag state <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr> the up-to-date current geographical position and the information contained in paragraph 5 and 6. At least one position report per 4 hours will be sufficient under such circumstances, as long as the vessel stays within the waters of the other Party. The flag state <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr> or the vessels will forward such messages to the <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr> of the other Party as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Such faulty equipment will be repaired or replaced before the vessel commences a new fishing trip.</li>
  <li>The flag state <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr> will monitor the tracking of its vessels when in the waters of the other Party. Information will be forwarded to the <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr> of the other Party without delay in the event that it is discovered that the tracking of vessels does not function as approved in this Annex.</li>
  <li>In the event that an <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr> of either Party discovers that information is not being communicated by the other Party in accordance with paragraphs 5 and 6, the other Party will be notified without delay.</li>
  <li>The stored messages will be transmitted as soon as electronic communication is re-established between the relevant FMCs.</li>
  <li>Communication failures between FMCs will not affect the operation of the vessels.</li>
  <li>The Parties will exchange information concerning addresses and specifications that will be used for electronic communication between their FMCs in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7. Such information will, to the extent available, also include names, telephone numbers and email addresses that can be useful for general communication between the FMCs.</li>
  <li>The Parties will exchange, upon request, information on the equipment used for the operation of the satellite tracking system in order to confirm that such equipment is fully compatible with the requirements of the other Party.</li>
  <li>The Parties may review this annex, as appropriate.</li>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Each message in a data transmission is structured as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>double slash (//) and the character ‘SR’ indicates the start of a message</li>
      <li>double slash (//) and field code indicates the start of a data element</li>
      <li>single slash (/) separates the field code and the data</li>
      <li>pairs of data are separated by space</li>
      <li>field code followed by 3 slashes (///) indicates a mandatory data element with no value. The first slash is the separate slash of the actual data element, the double slash is the start of the following element</li>
      <li>the character ER and a double slash (//) indicates the end of the record</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>

<h3>Annex 6: Catch statistics</h3>

<h4>1. The Delegations agree that:</h4>

<p>1.1.	Each Party will submit to the other Party monthly catch reports by species, area <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and EEZ by the end of the month following the month which the statistics relate to. Parties will use this to ensure quota uptake does not exceed 100%.</p>

<p>1.1.1. In the case of the Faroe Islands, the Faroese authorities will submit this information to the MMO (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:statistics@marinemanagement.org.uk">statistics@marinemanagement.org.uk</a>). In the case of the UK, the authorities will submit this information to the Faroese authorities (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fmc@vorn.fo">fmc@vorn.fo</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:vorn@vorn.fo">vorn@vorn.fo</a>).</p>

<h4>2.Future development of catch statistics</h4>

<p>2.1.	A semi-automated process will be developed in the future to diverge from emails and an end of year summary of data will be established in the future to reduce erroneous data.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Annex 7: Real time closures</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The licensing authority of the Faroe Islands (Vørn) will without delay inform the UK <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr>: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ukfmc@gov.scot">ukfmc@gov.scot</a> regarding real time closures. In so doing, the authorities of the Faroe Islands will submit a copy of the measure and the elements justifying the adoption of this measure.</li>
</ol>

<p>UK <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr> will without delay inform the relevant vessel of measures. The vessel shall leave the relevant areas within 6 hours from the time and date indicated in the notice sent to UK <abbr title="Fisheries Monitoring Centre">FMC</abbr>.</p>
