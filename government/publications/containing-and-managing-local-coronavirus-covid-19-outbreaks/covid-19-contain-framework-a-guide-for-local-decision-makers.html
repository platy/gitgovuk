<h2>Overview and purpose</h2>

<p>In order to prevent, manage and contain outbreaks of COVID-19, this framework sets out how national, regional and local partners should continue work with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>each other</li>
  <li>the public</li>
  <li>businesses</li>
  <li>institutions (including schools, prisons, hospitals, care homes and homelessness settings)</li>
  <li>other local system partners in their communities</li>
</ul>

<p>Successful prevention and management of local outbreaks is a core element of our shared ambition to break the chains of COVID-19 transmission, to enable people to return to, and maintain, a more normal way of life, living safely with COVID.</p>

<p>Local communities are at the heart of breaking the chains of transmission; and it is important that there is a continued strong local, regional and national partnership to support people to understand and comply with the guidance and regulations designed to protect their health.</p>

<p>Local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) and their local system partners are an integral part of the response to COVID-19, working closely with Public Health England’s (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) regional health protection teams (<abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>). This updated contain framework builds on the version published in July 2020 and sets out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the roles and responsibilities of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and local system partners, and those of regional and national teams, as well as the decision-making and incident response structures</li>
  <li>the core components of the COVID-19 response, including on variants of concern and enduring transmission, and emphasises the need to consider inequalities in every aspect of the response</li>
  <li>the requirements of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> on the continued COVID-19 response, as well as how this should be factored into local outbreak management plans (<abbr title="local outbreak management plans">LOMPs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the support <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can expect from regional and national teams</li>
</ul>

<p>This framework should be read in the context of the Government’s roadmap to ease restrictions in England ( <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021">COVID-19 response: Spring 2021</a>) and the Government’s overall public health objectives for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The contain framework and the supporting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reporting-outbreaks-of-coronavirus-covid-19">outbreak management response toolkit</a> will continue to be updated as the response evolves, and to capture good practice from local outbreak management plans.</p>

<h2>The next phase of the response</h2>

<p>We have all learnt so much since the COVID-19 response began and our approach to breaking chains of transmission and protecting the public’s health has evolved significantly. This has only been possible by working in partnership as a ‘team of teams’ with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr></li>
  <li>Directors of Public Health (<abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr>)</li>
  <li>local councillors</li>
  <li><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr></li>
  <li>the NHS</li>
  <li><abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr></li>
  <li>public, private and not-for-profit sector partners.</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and their local system partners have made great strides in responding to the challenges of this pandemic, innovating in the face of adversity to keep their local communities safe. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>’ local outbreak management plans are central to the next phase of the response and will be regionally supported and nationally enabled. NHS Test and Trace and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> are committed to empowering local leaders, ensuring they have the tools and resources needed, and working in partnership to co-design the ongoing response to COVID-19.</p>

<p>The government recently published the detail of the roadmap out of the national lockdown, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021">COVID-19 Response: Spring 2021</a>. In the absence of significant regional disparity, the government will ease restrictions at the same time across the whole of England. The roadmap seeks to balance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health, including mental health</li>
  <li>economic and social factors and how they disproportionately impact certain groups</li>
  <li>epidemiological evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a need to learn to live safely with COVID-19, as the ambition of very low numbers of the virus is still some way off. There will be a minimum of five weeks between each step towards easing restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>four weeks for the scientific data to reflect the changes in restrictions and to be analysed</li>
  <li>one week’s advance notice of the restrictions that will be eased</li>
</ul>

<p>Only when the government is sure that it is safe to move from one step to the next will the final decision be made. The decision will be based on four tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully</li>
  <li>evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated</li>
  <li>infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS</li>
  <li>our assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The priorities for the continued response to enable these tests to be met are set out in more detail below and later in the framework, consistent with the request to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to refresh their local outbreak management plans.</p>

<p>Local teams must ensure they make every contact with the public count to support the development of new habits and reinforce the ongoing national COVID-19 public health messages, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hands, face and space</li>
  <li>ventilation in enclosed public spaces</li>
  <li>regular asymptomatic testing</li>
  <li>encouraging people to accept the vaccination when it is offered</li>
</ul>

<p>This is imperative as prevalence remains high, the percentage of the population with immunity is gradually increasing with the vaccination programme, and the efficacy of vaccines – particularly against concerning new variants of COVID-19 – continues to be investigated.</p>

<p>An effective test, trace, isolate and contain response is critical to supporting the easing of social and economic restrictions, sitting alongside vaccination. We know that the vaccine is effective at reducing the spread of the virus, as well as the risk of mortality and hospitalisation from COVID-19. However, it is still possible for someone that’s received the vaccine to catch the virus, and have no or few symptoms, potentially infecting others who are unvaccinated. For this reason, it is important that vaccinated people continue to adhere to guidance and restrictions.</p>

<p>While self-isolation is critically important to halting the spread of the virus, it is never easy for those affected. Supporting self-isolation is a complex part of our response and will remain a key priority for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and wider local system partners. Many local systems are already providing successful support for self-isolation, and we will all need to learn from innovative practice from across the country. Targeted local communications, more rapid support payments, and more personalised non-financial support are also likely to be key to continuing to improve the numbers of people who isolate.</p>

<p>All viruses regularly mutate as they replicate, creating new variants. Most have no effect and are not a cause for any concern. Some, however, pose an increased risk to public health due to changes in transmissibility, infection severity, ability to evade immune responses or the virus’s susceptibility to therapeutic treatments. Of particular concern would be the ability of a variant to undermine the efficacy of existing vaccines.</p>

<p>The impact of these variants can be significant, as we saw with the new variant that was first detected in Kent in November 2020, which is more transmissible and may have an increased mortality rate. Every time the virus replicates, it is an opportunity for a new variant to be created. Our best defence against mutations is therefore to reduce viral transmission and replication, and possible mutation.</p>

<p>Robust science needs to continue to underpin all our efforts. We must keep learning from and adapting our response in the light of new data and evidence coming from high quality epidemiology, virology, genomics, behavioural science, modelling and more. This will help ensure the latest scientific findings are considered at every level of pandemic-related decision-making.</p>

<p>Collectively, we have achieved so much but there is more to do to break the chains of transmission and enable people to return to, and maintain, a more normal way of life, living safely with endemic COVID. Local teams will need to keep their capacity and capability under close review, as colleagues redeployed from other local services and partner organisations return to their functions, and short-term contracts end.</p>

<p>Regional and national teams, dedicated surge support, and mutual aid will provide some further capacity. <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will also continue to work in an agile way to support their <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with specialist health protection functions. Finally, as fatigue from the response sets in, local leaders will need to look after their teams, supporting them to look after their physical and mental health and wellbeing, whilst fostering sustainable working patterns.</p>

<h2>Ways of working</h2>

<p>NHS Test and Trace, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and the NHS will continue to deliver a strong and integrated, local, regional and national response in England, working in partnership with local systems. Local systems should build on the flexible and agile partnership working that has been brought about by the local response to COVID-19.</p>

<p>Nationally, we are committed to empowering local decision-makers to support local delivery of their outbreak management plans, ensuring that they are locally led, regionally supported and nationally enabled. NHS Test and Trace and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> will continue to work with local systems with shared purpose to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a cross-system view of issues and develop a joint understanding of the local context</li>
  <li>ensure even greater coordination and coherence of our response, a commitment to working across teams to understand impacts at a local level and planning ahead from a shared set of assumptions</li>
  <li>pool and share resources, evidence and data</li>
  <li>ensure we’re using and sharing our combined resources efficiently, effectively and more systematically, so our response continues to adapt to the latest evidence and good practice to deliver our shared goals of living safely with COVID-19</li>
  <li>engage, inform and involve our communities</li>
  <li>build a confident narrative about the response that reassures people and enables them to feel optimistic about the future and clear about the expectations of them – with more support for locally tailored communications and local decision making that recognises the diversity of local communities</li>
</ul>

<p>NHS Test and Trace, NHS England, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, NHS Improvement and Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) will work with local systems and the relevant professional and membership bodies to continue to shape the future public health landscape.</p>

<h2>Roles and responsibilities</h2>

<p>While COVID-19 presents an unprecedented challenge, well-established local, regional and national arrangements for public health and emergency planning continue to be used as the basis of this enhanced response. The decision-making model follows the tried and tested approach to civil emergencies, based on the concept of subsidiarity. National, regional and local teams have been working in partnership for many months to develop the response to the virus.</p>

<h3>Local role and responsibilities</h3>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and their <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr>, in upper tier local authority areas (<abbr title="upper tier local authorities">UTLAs</abbr>), and wider teams are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>undertaking ongoing surveillance</li>
  <li>community testing</li>
  <li>local enhanced contact tracing</li>
  <li>supporting self-isolation</li>
  <li>working closely with <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> to control outbreaks</li>
</ul>

<p>They work with local health protection boards, supported with resource deployment by local ‘gold’ incident management structures, led by local authority chief executives, and local arrangements are in place to communicate and engage with communities led by council leaders. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr> will work with system partners, in particular local NHS providers, blue light responders and integrated care systems.</p>

<p>Whilst local arrangements will reflect local systems, clear governance is essential to ensure that each area operates effectively. Local governance of COVID-19 builds on existing practice and structures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the COVID-19 health protection board co-ordinates the response to COVID-19 at a place level, including on infection control. These Boards (which include the local NHS, local authority environmental health and other key partners) have a range of reporting arrangements into key elected members and political meetings</li>
  <li>the director of public health leads the local outbreak management plan</li>
  <li>the local ‘gold’ structure provides resource coordination, and links to COVID-19 regional partnership teams (that include <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s regional director of public health) and other key category 1 responders from the local resilience forum (<abbr title="local resilience forum">LRF</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the local authority chief executive is accountable and responsible for:
    <ul>
      <li>the local response</li>
      <li>providing strategic leadership and direction</li>
      <li>ensuring delivery of the local outbreak management plan</li>
      <li>shaping local communications and engagement</li>
      <li>deploying local government resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Civil Contingencies Act</a> provides that responders, through the <abbr title="local resilience forum">LRF</abbr>, have a collective responsibility to plan, prepare and communicate in a multi-agency environment. <abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr> are being used for the local system COVID-19 response</li>
  <li>councillors, as local democratically elected representatives, are directly accountable to their local community for the local response, decisions and spend undertaken by the council</li>
  <li>chief executives and directors of public health are accountable to their local councillors, in particular the leader of the council or elected mayor and the council cabinet or executive, who will also agree the local COVID-19 response budget. Councillors are local systems leaders and local community leaders, and can facilitate systems relationships and community engagement</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have a number of powers to impose restrictions on settings and members of the public. These are set out in more detail in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reporting-outbreaks-of-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">outbreak management response toolkit</a> and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> legal departments will be best placed to advise on the use of these powers.</p>

<h3>Regional role and responsibilities</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 regional partnership teams (RPTs) play a pivotal role in communicating and connecting the national and local response. RPTs work closely with national teams to ensure policy and operational coherence across:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the NHS Test and Trace and community testing programmes</li>
  <li>NHS England and Improvement regional teams</li>
  <li><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr></li>
  <li>other key government departments</li>
</ul>

<p>The COVID-19 regional partnerships, formed to support the COVID-19 response, consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the regional convenor</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> regional director</li>
  <li>the regional joint biosecurity centre (<abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Centre">JBC</abbr>) lead</li>
</ul>

<p>These regional partnerships bring their collective capability together to support local areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contain, regional convenor – this is a senior local government figure with experience in the commissioning and delivery of frontline services and in managing the interface of such operations with national and local political leaders. They ensure a coordinated approach in engagement activities</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, regional director and NHS regional director of public health – the regional director of public health is responsible for the work of the regional <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and provides professional public health leadership to the response to this pandemic, working in partnership with local authority directors of public health, chief executives and local authority leaders</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Centre">JBC</abbr>, regional lead – provide links to other government departments regionally and nationally, escalating and resolving issues and acts as a Whitehall ‘gatekeeper’ to funnel communications</li>
</ul>

<p>RPTs work closely with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and wider local systems to support their response, ensuring they are able to implement their local outbreak management plans. They provide ongoing oversight and assurance, escalating risks and issues as needed via the national local action committee command structure; providing additional support and escalating requests for surge assistance; as well as identifying good practice for spread and scale.</p>

<p>Each region also has a <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> ‘local’ health protection team (HPT), which include specialist expertise in communicable disease control, epidemiology, outbreak management and related issues. They have strong professional working relationships with directors of public health and, in partnership with their teams, are an integral part of the expert local response to COVID-19. They provide local directors of public health with access to highly specialised public health advice and support, and often lead on complex outbreak investigation and management. The regional <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> is responsible for feeding in local intelligence and providing professional public health advice into the bronze, silver and gold command structure.</p>

<h3>National role and responsibilities</h3>
<p>Ministers are accountable nationally for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>setting the overall framework for the COVID-19 response</li>
  <li>the national communications strategy</li>
  <li>enabling and supporting the local response</li>
  <li>oversight and intervention where necessary</li>
</ul>

<p>Ministers also work with the devolved administrations and international governments as required.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care takes day to day policy and operational decisions on the COVID-19 response, as appropriate. Oversight of the ongoing incident response takes place through the government’s local action committee command structure (bronze, silver, gold) which can escalate concerns and issues for discussion and decision by ministers across government. Recommendations on escalation of issues or requests for significant surge support can be taken by the ‘gold’ incident management structures to ministers for final decision.</p>

<p>Ministers have powers to take action against specific premises, places and events, as well as to direct <abbr title="upper tier local authorities">UTLAs</abbr> to act, and to consider whether a <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> direction is unnecessary and should be revoked.
To address more serious and wide-spread cases, ministers can use their existing powers (under the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/22/contents">Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984</a>) to implement more substantial restrictions (regulations would be produced and approved by Parliament on a case-by-case basis) which could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>closing businesses and venues in whole sectors or geographies</li>
  <li>imposing general restrictions on people’s movements or gatherings</li>
  <li>restricting or closing local and national transport systems</li>
  <li>mandating use of face coverings in public places</li>
</ul>

<h2>National de-escalation</h2>

<p>The government has set out that there will be a minimum of 5 weeks between each step of the roadmap out of national lockdown – it takes around 4 weeks for the data to show the impact of easing restrictions and the government will provide a further weeks’ notice ahead of any further changes. Before proceeding to the next step, the government will examine the data to assess the impact of the previous step. The assessment will be based on four tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully</li>
  <li>evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated</li>
  <li>infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS</li>
  <li>our assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern</li>
</ul>

<p>The steps are set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021/covid-19-response-spring-2021-summary" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 Response: spring 2021</a>. The roadmap sets out indicative, “no earlier than” dates for the steps which are 5 weeks apart. These dates are wholly contingent on the data and are subject to change if the 4 tests are not met. The government has also announced a series of additional reviews, including a review of social distancing measures.</p>

<h2>Oversight and assurance</h2>

<p>So that NHS Test and Trace, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are able to spot concerning patterns in the epidemiology, to enable swift and decisive action, national and regional teams use a range of system indicators as part of ongoing oversight and assurance, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>case detection rates and testing – covering all ages, including over 60s and additional age categories (e.g. primary and secondary school ages)</li>
  <li>prevalence – at regional and sub-regional level, including from surveillance studies</li>
  <li>trajectory – rates at which cases are rising or falling</li>
  <li>pressure on the NHS – occupancy and admissions</li>
  <li>variants – descriptive epidemiology of variants of concern</li>
  <li>vaccine uptake – across regions and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, different populations, and the impact on case rates, hospitalisation and mortality</li>
  <li>effectiveness of operational response – testing infrastructure and usage, effectiveness of contact tracing, uptake of self-isolation financial and non-financial support, compliance and enforcement performance</li>
  <li>local characteristics – mobility, deprivation, ethnicity, data on reported contacts</li>
</ul>

<p>These system indicators, together with qualitative insights, are also used to inform thematic and geographical ‘deep dives’ to ensure we have a full picture of the epidemic through different lenses.</p>

<p>In the event that ongoing national and regional oversight and assurance or local gold command identifies a serious concern in the epidemiology – for example, suggestive of a variant or enduring transmission – that may pose a risk nationally, the national local action committee response structure will be used to mobilise surge support, at the request of the local system. The government will also act quickly where an area sees unmanageable virus growth or the NHS is at risk, with local intervention centred on testing, communications and enforcement.</p>

<h2>Local outbreak management plans</h2>

<p>COVID-19 local outbreak management plans (<abbr title="local outbreak management plans">LOMPs</abbr>) are based on the tried and tested practice of breaking chains of transmission and preventing and containing outbreaks. As more of the population is vaccinated, levels of immunity in the population rise and prevalence declines, we increasingly expect to be dealing with localised outbreaks that require decisive local-led action.</p>

<p>However, our biggest challenges will be tackling enduring transmission and variants of concern, that have the potential to undermine the progress we have collectively made. For this reason, it is critical that <abbr title="local outbreak management plans">LOMPs</abbr> set out an effective response to these issues, and that NHS Test and Trace performs to very high standards to support and enable this local response.</p>

<p>Local outbreak planning and management is led by <abbr title="upper tier local authorities">UTLAs</abbr> within a national framework, supported by NHS Test and Trace and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> regional and national teams, and other government departments as needed. In 2 tier areas, county councils work closely with district, borough and city councils, particularly recognising the role they play in supporting community compliance and business enforcement.</p>

<p>Each <abbr title="upper tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> already has a local outbreak plan developed in line with the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.adph.org.uk/2020/06/guiding-principles-for-effective-management-of-covid-19-at-a-local-level/">Association of Directors of Public Health guiding principles</a>  that set out how local systems should work together to develop and implement the plans, including across geographical and administrative boundaries. These four principles, which should enable maximum effectiveness, are that plans should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be rooted in and led by public health</li>
  <li>adopt a whole system approach</li>
  <li>be delivered through an efficient and locally-effective system</li>
  <li>be sufficiently resourced, both financially and with expertise</li>
</ul>

<p>Local plans should be regularly refreshed to reflect learning from exercises, incidents, good practice and remain aligned with the overall national response as it evolves. They should enhance, expand and reinforce the outbreak work of the <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> within <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and, as a minimum, cover the following themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>higher-risk settings, communities and locations e.g. care home, prisons, hospitality, hospitals, education<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> and homelessness settings</li>
  <li>vulnerable and underserved communities, including the clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV)</li>
  <li>compliance and enforcement</li>
  <li>governance</li>
  <li>resourcing</li>
  <li>communications and engagement, including community resilience</li>
  <li>data integration and information sharing</li>
</ul>

<p>Plans should also reflect the approach to the core aspects of the end-to-end COVID-19 response, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>surveillance</li>
  <li>community testing</li>
  <li>contact tracing</li>
  <li>support for self-isolation</li>
  <li>outbreak management, including enhanced contact tracing, in partnership with <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, plans should address the following developments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>responding to <abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>action on enduring transmission</li>
  <li>enhanced contact tracing, in partnership with <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>ongoing role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to prevent cases and reduce transmission</li>
  <li>interface with vaccines roll out, including local areas’ plans to tackle disparities in vaccine take-up</li>
  <li>activities to enable ‘living with COVID’ (COVID secure)</li>
</ul>

<p>The updating of <abbr title="local outbreak management plans">LOMPs</abbr> should involve local and regional system partners, building on the extraordinary work undertaken during 2020 and early 2021. For example, the <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, voluntary and community sector, business community, blue light responders, Integrated Care Systems and local NHS providers. Effective actions to respond to COVID-19 require strong partnership with local communities, on the basis of tailored communications and engagement, and informed consent. Each local system is required to publish its LOMP.</p>

<p>To support the cautious easing of lockdown, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should also prepare for how they will manage events such as religious festivals, performances and other large gatherings that may be permitted later this year. This means outbreak management planning needs to be flexible in order to take into account both the changes that come with seasonality, and the full range of upcoming events and gatherings. The government’s events research programme will test the outcome of certain pilot events through the spring and summer, trialling the use of testing and other techniques to cut the risk of infection.</p>

<h2>The COVID-19 response</h2>

<p>The following section provides a high-level overview of the COVID-19 response, setting out the role of local systems. Each section corresponds to a more detailed section of the underpinning <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reporting-outbreaks-of-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">outbreak management response toolkit</a> which also links to further guidance and resources. This Toolkit will continue to evolve as the response evolves and the regional and national tools to support and enable local systems expands.</p>

<h3>Surveillance</h3>

<p>As we move forward with the roadmap that has been set out by the Government, surveillance will play an even more critical role in preventing, understanding and responding to outbreaks. Surveillance helps us to assess the impact of measures taken to contain the virus and to inform current and future actions. There are various innovative tools that will play an important part in surveillance in the months ahead, underpinned by high quality, timely data.</p>

<h3>Wastewater Testing</h3>

<p>Wastewater testing helps us understand where the virus is circulating in the population, regardless of whether people have symptoms or have been tested, and to swiftly identify future potential spikes in infection. The Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection (EMHP) Programme involves monitoring wastewater for the presence of COVID-19, including <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The process involves working intensively with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and public health teams to identify areas for focused wastewater testing. The testing results are analysed by the <abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Centre">JBC</abbr>, then are considered jointly to rapidly build up a picture of infection levels. This enables the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and public health teams to devise responses that are focused on specific areas of concern in a way that makes best use of their resources. It also provides important reassurance to local communities who are impacted. The programme is rapidly expanding its coverage to provide continuous monitoring at the local level and across England. There are also pilots analysing the wastewater from specific institutions such as food supply chains and schools.</p>

<h3>Population Surveillance Programmes</h3>

<p>Robust population surveillance programmes are essential to understand the rate of COVID-19 infection, and how the virus is spreading across the country. The National Surveillance Programme, currently including the Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey and the Imperial College London/Ipsos MORI REACT study, provides the necessary information and intelligence to develop shared situational awareness to prioritise the ongoing planning and response to COVID-19. It supports <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in their shared effort to develop high quality COVID-19 related intelligence through assessment of local needs, and in planning for the immediate and long-term impact of COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr> receive timely and relevant data to support local system decisions around preventative actions to curb the spread of COVID-19. While it is important to provide this data, it is also important that we ensure that local partners receive the relevant analytical support to interpret and use this effectively. NHS Test and Trace and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> will continue to work with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to improve the data architecture and flow of data into their systems. In line with data security requirements, <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr> can access data from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> including record-level test, case and contact tracing data, outbreaks, clusters and settings data, plus modelling and forward plans. Dashboards with epidemic-phase modelling and with information on NHS 111 calls and online triage information are now available.</p>

<h3>Local data spaces (LDS) initiative</h3>

<p>Since March 2020, the government has significantly strengthened its sharing of key COVID-19 relevant data and information with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s Power-BI Portal regularly shares data and information with local areas, and <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr> can authorise access to record-level health data with their analytics teams, to enable them to better understand outbreaks and incidents in their local area.</p>

<p>LDS builds upon the secure data sharing, analytical infrastructure and technical expertise of the ONS. It provides <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> analytics teams with a safe and secure mechanism to share and carry out analysis on granular health and non-health datasets. The LDS also leverages academic partnerships to boost the analytical capability of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> by working collaboratively on their LDS. The LDS initiative will be evaluated to determine whether and how this capability becomes part of the future health protection landscape.</p>

<h2>NHS COVID-19 Application (app)</h2>

<p>We are increasing the amount of data available to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> about how the NHS COVID-19 app is being used. The data show that, since its launch, over 1.7 million app users across England and Wales have been advised to isolate following a close contact with someone who has tested positive. Research by the Alan Turing Institute<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and Oxford University<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link">[footnote 3]</a></sup> suggests that the app has prevented approximately 600,000 cases of COVID-19 since its launch and that for every 1% increase in app users, the number of COVID-19 cases in the population can be reduced by 2.3%. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can help by seeking to increase uptake of the app among communities known to be less likely to download or use it.</p>

<p>In addition to the number of app downloads and QR posters printed which have been available since August 2020 (from the ‘early-adopters’ trial) we now also publish the following national-level metrics weekly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of times one or more COVID-19 symptoms were reported in the app</li>
  <li>number of test results linked to the app (positive and negative results)</li>
  <li>number of contact tracing alerts sent</li>
  <li>number of venue check-ins using NHS QR code posters</li>
  <li>number of ‘at risk’ venues that have triggered a venue alert</li>
</ul>

<p>We have also have recently made four of the above metrics (symptoms, tests, contact tracing and check-in) available at <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> level to support understanding about how the pandemic is progressing in those areas. This app data should support local decision-making and planning, including where to target local marketing and communications to help manage the pandemic locally. This data can also help encourage business uptake of the official NHS QR codes and encouraging the use of venue check-ins.</p>

<h3>Testing – community and employer led</h3>

<p>Testing, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, performs a central role in the identification of people who have the virus to then trace their contacts and ensure both parties self-isolate to prevent onward spread. Another role of testing is in disease surveillance, including the identification for vaccine-evasive disease and new strains. It is also used to investigate and manage outbreaks and to enable a safer re-opening of society and the economy.</p>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr> have been crucial partners in delivering testing so far, from helping to establish over 700 regional and local test sites, prioritising and directing the use of Mobile Test Units, and communicating with the public about the availability of testing.</p>

<p>Since the first contain framework, working with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, we have established a number of asymptomatic testing programmes to find the around one in three individuals who test positive for coronavirus but have no symptoms at all. Identifying those who unknowingly have the virus will enable those who test positive and their contacts to self-isolate and break the chains of transmission.</p>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are best placed to understand the local context and to engage and deliver testing for those who cannot access it through other routes, helping ensure we reach individuals and communities most at risk. The CTP supports all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with responsibility for public health in England to deliver asymptomatic testing using lateral flow devices (LFDs) at local asymptomatic testing sites (ATS). <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr>, supported by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> regional directors, design the programme that delivers asymptomatic testing in their area. This approach has built on existing local testing plans developed for <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr>-led testing, which has now been merged with the CTP.</p>

<p>The programme enables asymptomatic testing for local public services, small businesses, self-employed people and communities that have been disproportionately affected by the virus. Testing programmes are encouraged to draw on the contributions of the voluntary sector, faith groups and wider civil society, as well as nominated Community Champions, to drive up participation, develop tailored communications and combat misinformation. National Equality and Inclusion teams are well-placed to be able to support local testing initiatives and provide additional guidance.</p>

<p>In the next stage of improving access to asymptomatic testing, and with the introduction of lateral flow self-test kits (LFDs), NHS Test and Trace and the CTP recently launched community collect. Community collect enables the collection of LFDs from test sites. This allows some people to carry out their test away from ATSs. This was launched on the 1 March 2021, alongside a direct-to-home channel for LFD kits.</p>

<p>Eligibility for LFD kits through community collect and direct-to-home was initially restricted to support the return to school at the beginning of March 2021. Work is happening rapidly to expand eligibility with local authorities playing a role in prioritising the availability of LFD kits in their area.</p>

<p>Rapid testing in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-schools-coronavirus-covid-19">schools</a> and colleges using LFDs is supporting the return to face-to-face education by helping to identify asymptomatic pupils and staff. Secondary schools and further education colleges have been supplied with lateral flow self-test kits so pupils and staff can test themselves twice a week at home. Staff in primary schools will continue to test with LFDs twice a week at home, as per existing guidance, and the families and support bubbles of all school and college age pupils should test themselves.</p>

<p>Tests are available online and through community collect for anybody unable to access testing through their employer or institution. We also continue to pilot the use of daily contact testing in a range of settings as an alternative to self-isolation for those who are close contacts of a confirmed case, which also has benefits for positive case finding.</p>

<p>The national workplace testing programme (part of NHS Test and Trace) provides access to regular testing for organisations (private and public) whose employees are unable to work from home. The aim of the programme is to test employees twice a week to find more positive cases and to reduce transmission among those who cannot work from home.</p>

<p>Under the current scheme, which will run until the end of June, LFDs are provided to businesses free of charge for employees who cannot work from home. Under the national workplace testing programme, <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr> should be notified of where testing is happening and receive the results of the testing. We continue to work to improve how the data is communicated. Going forward, <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr> will have an important role to play in promoting self-funded employer-led testing schemes.</p>

<h3>Contact tracing</h3>

<p>A critical step in the effective controlling of community transmission is the fast and efficient contact tracing of index cases and their close contacts, and then following this up with the appropriate isolation advice. Local trace partnerships (LTPs) are now the norm with 312 of 314 lower tier Local authorities (LTLAs) in operation (149 of 151 <abbr title="upper tier local authorities">UTLAs</abbr>). LTP partners work alongside the national Trace team to enhance the overall service provided, bringing invaluable local knowledge, resource and expertise where available.</p>

<p>A range of methods are used to make contact, including in-person visits to people’s homes. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> work with the national trace team and <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> to train staff, ensuring that as many local tracing teams have access to the contact tracing systems as possible. Where volumes of cases become too great to manage locally, national support continues to be available. We are working to maximise the potential of each LTP and to optimise the relationship with the national service, as well as developing additional opportunities for tracing in a more segmented manner, either earlier in the journey or for targeted populations.</p>

<p>We have been working with local and regional colleagues to support enhancements to the service that better serve the citizen and reduce the spread of COVID-19. NHS Test and Trace and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> are currently working with a number of local areas piloting new capabilities building on the core LTP. This includes working with the North East COVID-19 Hub to create a regional model for all 12 of its <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and working with Yorkshire and Humber on locally enhancing communications to drive engagement. The new integrated trace system (ITS) is also due to come online, which will enhance the trace journey for everyone involved, enabling LTPs to access cases and contacts in a timely manner based on local criteria.</p>

<h3>Enhanced contact tracing (ECT)</h3>

<p>ECT describes a systematic approach to gathering and analysing contact tracing data and other information to rapidly detect and risk assess signals of new COVID-19 case clusters locally. The data is gathered from people who have tested positive for COVID-19 (through national and local contact tracing partnerships) to help identify where and when they were likely to have been infected. This information is then used by analytical tools to identify ‘clusters’ of new cases linked to a common setting which may be an early indication of an outbreak. This, and other intelligence, allows local public health teams and <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> to swiftly investigate and take appropriate actions to prevent wider community transmission.</p>

<p>To further support local public health teams and <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, we have developed a new analytical took that uses complex network analysis (CNA) to rapidly and more accurately identify clusters than the traditional approach. NHS Test and Trace and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> are working together to make this tool available as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Risky venue alerts</h3>

<p>Designated venues are legally required to request and maintain customer, visitor and staff contact details and display an official NHS QR code poster. Should an outbreak occur at a venue, this will support NHS Test and Trace to be able to contact those who are at potential risk of COVID-19 and give them the necessary public health advice, via a ‘warn and inform’ or ‘get a test’ message depending on how many cases are associated with the venue via SMS or the NHS COVID-19 app. Daily reports will be distributed to inform <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> when a venue alert has been generated in their area. This should ease the significant administrative burden on local public health teams.</p>

<h3>Support for self-isolation</h3>

<p>Ensuring that individuals who have COVID-19 or are at high risk of having the virus through contact with an index case, self-isolate is an integral part of the COVID-19 response. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have a critical role in raising awareness of and supporting self-isolation, as well as administering the main test and trace support payment scheme (<abbr title="test and trace support payment scheme">TTSP</abbr>) and discretionary scheme.</p>

<p>Since September 2020, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have received funding to administer the <abbr title="test and trace support payment scheme">TTSP</abbr> of £500 payments made to people on low incomes who need to self-isolate, as well as receiving funding for discretionary payments to people who fall outside the main scope of the scheme (see the section on <a href="#funding" class="govuk-link">funding</a>).</p>

<p>We have been working with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to provide a more consistent, visible and accessible framework of practical, social and emotional support for people self-isolating who have no other means of getting that support. The framework sets out the essential elements of practical support so that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can ensure they have appropriate arrangements (where they do not already exist) by the end of March 2021 at the latest to offer help to people self-isolating. We are also launching a medicines delivery service for people self-isolating that will go live in March 2021.</p>

<p>Further information will also be provided to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> outlining the enforcement methods.  The police are responsible for enforcement against individuals who break self-isolation. While <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are responsible for enforcement against employers, in particular, where employers pressure their employees to disregard self-isolation. Both national and local Government must continue to work with businesses and employers to better support those not in stable employment – NHS Test and Trace and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) are considering how to improve existing enforcement of the employer duty, as well as working to strengthen communications with employers around why self-isolation is important and why it is in their interest to support their employees to self-isolate.</p>

<p>An updated communications strategy is being developed that will equally support locally tailored communications. It will challenge the idea that people are not self-isolating by providing clear, targeted and practical information about why self-isolation is vital, even with the vaccine roll out, and outline how people can self-isolate effectively and the support available.</p>

<h3>Outbreak management</h3>

<p>The majority of COVID-19 outbreaks will be best dealt with at a local level, and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have a range of powers, such as enforcement of deep cleaning or temporary closure, to ensure an appropriate response. <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> in partnership with local public health teams, will be able to assist with outbreak control, drawing on their specialist expertise in epidemiology, infection control enhanced testing and effective local contact tracing, and strong communications and engagement.</p>

<p>For the most extensive, highest risk or complex outbreaks, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, in partnership with their local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, can call on a national multi-agency incident surge response. This will be deployed to significantly bolster local resources to support outbreak management. This team includes epidemiologists, health protection experts, logisticians and general managers, communications specialists and other skills as needed depending on the scale and type of outbreak. (Outbreaks of variants of COVID-19 are dealt with below.) There is also national support for preventing and managing outbreaks in specialised settings such as prisons.</p>

<h3>Response to variants of concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr>) or variants under investigation (VUI)</h3>

<p>While our response to <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr> and VUIs will use many of the same approaches as our response to other forms of outbreaks, the risk from <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr> and VUIs can be far greater and therefore the response may need to be carried out at far greater pace and scale. These responses are more likely to require additional national and surge support, as <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr> and VUIs represent a wider public health risk to the country.</p>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will play a critical role in the response when a <abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr> or VUI is identified – join up between the local response and national government will be crucial. Where cases of new variants are detected, <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr>, supported by the HPT and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> regional director, should work to quickly assess the risks, drawing on surge testing and sequencing to rapidly bring in more data, evidence and understanding to support making the risk assessment as robust as possible.</p>

<p>A local incident management team should rapidly be convened by the HPT to work alongside the <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> and their team to investigate individual cases or clusters, identify potential routes of transmission, and create a risk management plan. Local teams should liaise closely with national and regional teams on the specific steps being proposed to manage risk to ensure we are applying a consistent risk appetite across the country and to support the rapid deployment of national support as needed.</p>

<p>Accelerated contact tracing should be undertaken to identify contacts and the local authority team should ensure all positive or probable variant cases are strongly supported to comply with self-isolation. When additional surge testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in particular postcodes or settings, and genome sequencing, is required to identify additional cases, local teams should work with the HPT and regional team to mobilise this.</p>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will also work with their communities to raise awareness of the threat and to seek their cooperation with control measures using targeted, culturally-sensitive and reassuring communications and engagement campaigns, as well as through greater compliance.</p>

<p>The government will continue to protect the public by ensuring local outbreaks are managed quickly and effectively and that we combat new dangerous variants, both within the UK and at the border. As laid out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021/covid-19-response-spring-2021-summary">COVID-19 Response: Spring 2021</a>, the government cannot rule out re-imposing economic and social restrictions at a local or regional level if evidence suggests they are necessary to contain or suppress a variant which escapes the vaccine.</p>

<p>Published figures on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-variants-genomically-confirmed-case-numbers/variants-distribution-of-cases-data"><abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr> and VUI</a> are updated twice weekly to support <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in communicating with their communities. This data set will be kept under review, with a view to making more available in future.</p>

<h3>Vaccinations</h3>

<p>The COVID-19 vaccination programme is proceeding at pace. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, working with local NHS colleagues, will continue to play a key role in delivering this and driving uptake, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-covid-19-vaccines-delivery-plan">COVID-19 vaccines delivery plan</a> and the vaccine uptake plan. This could include improving access to vaccination sites through providing transport support and looking for opportunities to create temporary capacity, as well as supporting the operation of vaccination centres. Where we look to scale up deployment in an area, national and regional teams will work with local teams to enable this.</p>

<p><abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr> and their teams, working closely with <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s screening and immunisation teams, bring deep experience of immunisation and screening programmes and can play a decisive role in understanding the population of an area. They therefore have a key role in ensuring as many people as possible take up the offer of a vaccine and in combating vaccine hesitancy in under-served groups. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should work in partnership with the NHS locally to help shape local plans to tackle disparities in vaccine uptake and build on their existing role in the programme. This could include providing functional support through learning and good practice examples, working with communities including faith leaders and health leaders to actively encourage vaccine take up.</p>

<p>Alongside this work, health and wellbeing boards will support decision-making as the key leaders from the local health and care system in each area. Integrated care systems will also offer local-level support and insights into where the vaccine needs to be deployed to ensure diverse communities and unvaccinated groups are reached.</p>

<p>We know that to support delivery of the vaccination programme, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr> need data to understand uptake in their local areas and tailor efforts to reach those who have not yet taken up the vaccine. The use of datasets, mapping tools and other equality tools will be key to driving up participation in the programme. National data is published on a daily basis, with <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr> receiving a core dataset from NHS England and Improvement, that includes breakdowns by cohort, age and ethnicity. Recognising the urgency, NHS England and Improvement will continue to work at pace with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and colleagues at <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> to make sure systems have the essential information they need to support all communities in taking up the vaccine, in particular the most under-served.</p>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and NHS teams will also work closely to provide the information they need about COVID-19 vaccines and the vaccine programme to engage actively with communities in the most effective ways. We are committed to making every contact count to encourage vaccine uptake and help to dispel myths to combat vaccine hesitancy. NHS Test and Trace contact tracing scripts will include a statement about taking up the vaccine when offered and signposting if the citizen has further questions on vaccines.</p>

<p>Longer term, the government will begin planning to enable the deployment programme to move from a central incident response to a core part of local infrastructure within <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> responsibility for public health. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are encouraged to consider this as part of the move to a sustainable, more local response to coronavirus in the longer term.</p>

<h3>Shielding</h3>

<p>During any pause of shielding advice, <abbr title="upper tier local authorities">UTLAs</abbr> remain responsible for maintaining a contingency plan to stand up a support offer to clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) individuals should shielding advice be re-introduced. This contingency would be based on the support model for CEV individuals used during national restrictions. MHCLG has recently issued guidance to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> regarding planning and support for people on the shielded patient list (SPL) during a pause of shielding advice.</p>

<p>In the event of a major outbreak or <abbr title="variants of concern">VOC</abbr> that poses a significant threat to individuals on the SPL, re-introduction of shielding can occur by agreement of Ministers. Shielding would be considered in addition to other NPIs to address the residual risk to people on the SPL, once the wider interventions are taken into account. If the deputy chief medical officer and local <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> believe shielding advice might be needed, a formal recommendation would be made to ministers, who would make the final decision.</p>

<p>If agreed, shielding notifications would be issued by post, to all people on the SPL in an affected area, and information cascaded to local systems and charities making them aware of the advice.</p>

<h3>Living with COVID (COVID-secure)</h3>

<p>We know that the virus will remain with us for some time and it may have seasonal resurgences, although we hope it will eventually become endemic. Currently, scientists do not know when this transition will occur. The government will ensure the country can live with the virus in the longer-term without imposing restrictions which bear heavy economic, social and health costs. This points to the need for a sustainable locally delivered response to the virus. With the success of the vaccine, we expect that infection rates can rise without a corresponding increase in hospital admissions or serious infection. However, we will still need a sustainable locally delivered response to enable communities to live safely with the virus.</p>

<p>The government is carrying out a review of social distancing and other long-term measures that have been put in place to cut transmission. This will inform decisions on the timing and circumstances under which the rules on one metre plus, the wearing of face coverings and other measures may be lifted. The <abbr title="Association of Directors of Public Health">ADPH</abbr> has recently published <a rel="external" href="https://www.adph.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Living-Safely-with-Covid-ADPH-Guidance.pdf" class="govuk-link">guidance for living safely with COVID</a>  its own guidance for a sustainable exit from the pandemic.</p>

<p>The ‘stay at home’ rule will end no earlier than 29 March 2021 and, as restrictions ease, demand for transport will rise. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should support the message that people should continue to work from home where they can and minimise the number of journeys they make where possible, avoiding travel at the busiest times and on the busiest routes. This will also help reduce the exposure of transport workers to the risk of infection and ensure travel for purposes such as vaccination is safer. Actions to support those who need to continue to travel to work to do so safely should be prioritised.</p>

<p>Employers will need to be supported to take steps to protect their staff and customers by making workplaces COVID-secure, including through updating risk assessments as required by Health and Safety law . The government will update COVID-secure guidance to provide further advice to employers, and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> may want to reinforce this with locally tailored, sector-specific communications reinforcing the need to be COVID-secure. NHS Test and Trace and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> will also work with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) on further help and advice to employers that includes highlighting their enforcement powers.</p>

<h3>Compliance and Enforcement</h3>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> also have an important role in ensuring businesses and public places are COVID-safe – improving knowledge of infection prevention and control, ensuring spaces are well ventilated, that social distancing is maintained where possible and promoting regular asymptomatic testing.</p>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and HSE are responsible for ensuring businesses comply with measures outlined in COVID-19 regulations and guidance and for taking enforcement action where a business is not complying with the regulations. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are also responsible for making sure that public spaces such as parks, beaches and green spaces are COVID-secure. Increasing compliance will help reduce the risk of transmission as sectors reopen.</p>

<p>Over the past year <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have deployed their resources according to a strategy that has focused on engaging, educating and building relationships with local and business communities to encourage compliance. Where businesses have not been complying with the regulations, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have been able to use enforcement powers to take decisive action, having regard to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulators-code">Regulators’ Code</a> when carrying out their responsibilities. District authorities have responsibility for environmental health, so have a leading role on compliance and enforcement.</p>

<p>The continued deployment of COVID-19 secure marshals, wardens, stewards and ambassadors to support business and community compliance activity is also encouraged. Such roles have been successfully rolled out by many <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to help businesses and communities follow the latest guidelines. Examples of the roles marshals have undertaken and their value to compliance and enforcement can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/local-authority-covid-19-compliance-and-enforcement-good-practice-framework-january-2021" rel="external">good practice framework</a> and in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-local-authority-compliance-and-enforcement-grant/guidance-to-support-local-authority-compliance-and-enforcement-activity-including-covid-19-secure-marshals-or-equivalents" class="govuk-link">guidance</a> issued to support <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> compliance and enforcement activity.</p>

<h3>Communications and engagement</h3>

<p>While the government will determine the overall national communications strategy, which will continue to evolve according to risk, it will be critical that these messages are tailored appropriately to local communities to ensure that the public are advised to go about their daily business safely. <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> communications should equally focus on building community resilience, providing the knowledge and resources to enable individuals to care for themselves and others, and focusing on enhancing the day-to-day health and wellbeing of communities to reduce the negative impacts of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Locally elected politicians, local MPs and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> chief executives and <abbr title="Directors of Public Health">DsPH</abbr>, among others in the local system, also have an important role in community engagement to reinforce national messaging, encourage compliance, and understand the barriers to adherence to different NPIs. They also have a valuable role to play in encouraging vaccine uptake.</p>

<h2>Support for local authorities</h2>

<p>It is vitally important that the local teams keep their capacity and capabilities under active review, for instance as <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> resume their full services alongside the COVID response.</p>

<p>In particular, local teams must have resources available to support them in the event of an outbreak that exceeds available capacity. In addition to facilitating mutual aid, we are implementing a call off contract that will allow us to support <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with additional surge capacity at less than 24 hours’ notice. This ranges from high level incident management team (<abbr title="incident management team">IMT</abbr>) support at regional level, to increased resources on the ground to support initiatives such as door-to-door knocking.</p>

<p>The surge rapid response team (<abbr title="surge rapid response team">SRRT</abbr>) is an existing multidisciplinary team, trained and equipped to be rapidly deployed to a public health emergency, in line with the national COVID-19 response centre (<abbr title="national COVID-19 response centre">NCRC</abbr>) response framework. It exists to provide surge team capacity to rapidly respond to outbreaks, providing practical emergency response support to local teams to enable a safe and effective wrap- around. The deployment of the <abbr title="surge rapid response team">SRRT</abbr> will be initiated by a request received via the existing RPT channels to <abbr title="national COVID-19 response centre">NCRC</abbr> operations. <abbr title="national COVID-19 response centre">NCRC</abbr> operations will have oversight of the national demand and will prioritise requests for <abbr title="surge rapid response team">SRRT</abbr> and deploy them accordingly.</p>

<p>For specialist support <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s rapid investigation team, staffed by skilled health protection professionals, can be called upon to assist with investigations into <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr> or difficult or unusual outbreak circumstances.</p>

<p>The response to new variants has shown the value of dedicated skilled contact tracing cells in the national contact tracing centres that can be deployed to supplement local resources. Pilots are beginning in some local areas to provide additional training to local contact tracers to enable them to undertake this more specialist work. We have also recently doubled our fleet of mobile testing units from 250 to 500 to support with flexible, rapid deployment. LFD testing is also available.</p>

<p>Further work is underway to ensure local and regional teams can access NHS Test and Trace and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> surge support via a single point of contact.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>The government has allocated over £8 billion directly to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> since the start of the pandemic. Following the Spending Review, the Chancellor announced that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will receive over £3 billion of additional support for COVID-19 in 2021 to 2022. This includes an additional £1.55 billion of grant funding to meet additional service pressures, £670 million of new grant funding to enable them to continue reducing council tax bills for more than 4 million vulnerable households, and an estimated £800 million to compensate <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> for 75% of irrecoverable loss of council tax and business rates revenues this year. This takes the total support committed to councils in England to tackle the impacts of COVID-19 to over £11 billion.</p>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have been, and remain, at the forefront of managing COVID-19. New funding strands announced in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021/covid-19-response-spring-2021-summary">COVID-19 Response: Spring 2021</a> include significantly expanded discretionary funding available to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to provide financial support to those self-isolating under the test and trace support payment scheme (<abbr title="test and trace support payment scheme">TTSP</abbr>), an expansion of eligibility for the <abbr title="test and trace support payment scheme">TTSP</abbr> to parents and guardians who need to care for children who are self-isolating, and increased funding for practical and non-financial support (including medicine delivery).</p>

<p>Funding of £12.9 million a month to ensure a more consistent minimum standard of practical support for self-isolation is available to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> across England, until the end of June 2021. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> receive funding from NHST&amp;T to run the <abbr title="test and trace support payment scheme">TTSP</abbr>. The government covers their costs for £500 payments made to people on low incomes who need to self-isolate, as well as providing £20 million per month for discretionary payments to people who fall outside the main scope of the scheme. This discretionary payment should be made via the most appropriate delivery model as determined by each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. The government also provides a monthly allocation to each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to cover the costs of administering the scheme. Individuals who require support to self-isolate will either identify themselves to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> directly or via a support flag that will be raised by NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>By the end of the Financial Year 2020 to 2021, the government will have provided <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with over £1.6 billion as part of the contain outbreak management fund (<abbr title="contain outbreak management fund">COMF</abbr>). This fund will make one additional payment in March for the rest of the financial year 2020 to 2021 at the rate of £4 per head of population per 28 days. A further £400 million has been allocated for the 2021 to 2022 financial year. The funding is available to support public health activities directly related to the COVID-19 response, such as testing, non-financial support for self-isolation, support to particular groups (CEV individuals, rough sleepers), communications and engagement, and compliance and enforcement. There will not be a separate ringfenced grant for compliance and enforcement in 2021to 2022.</p>

<p>The funding formula and scope of the <abbr title="contain outbreak management fund">COMF</abbr> has developed in response to the changing nature of the pandemic. For the 2021 to 2022 financial year, the <abbr title="contain outbreak management fund">COMF</abbr> will be allocated using MHCLG’s COVID-19 relative needs formula, which is weighted according to population and deprivation, and maps well against areas of enduring transmission. The 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="contain outbreak management fund">COMF</abbr> will be distributed to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> as a single payment to support their continued public health response work, particularly as <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> work to ensure a smooth de-escalation of national restrictions through summer 2021.</p>

<p>In two-tier areas, a proportion of the funding will be directly allocated to the lower tier. This reflects the fact that district councils share the responsibility for delivery of a number of the <abbr title="contain outbreak management fund">COMF</abbr> priorities, including having a lead role on compliance and enforcement activity. County councils are encouraged to allocate a greater share of the funding to district authorities if local plans indicate this is needed.</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace is committed to achieving value for money, publishing our expenditure in line with current requirements, and delivering the greatest impact on virus transmission that we can, through all the actions we take. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>’ response should be guided by the same principles.</p>

<h2>Further developments</h2>

<p>This framework will be reviewed regularly and updated as necessary, taking into account developments and lessons in the response to COVID-19.
