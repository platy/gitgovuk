<h3>Publication</h3>

<p>Below is information on when this version of the guidance was published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>version 3.0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>published for Home Office staff on 3 August 2021</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We have updated the guidance to explain when you send a referral to UK Visa and Immigration to ask them if a customer is settled, you must check the details you put on the referral are correct (page 13).</p>

<h2>British overseas citizens</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office operational staff about the nationality status British overseas citizen (BOC) and how we must deal with passport applications from BOC customers.</p>

<p>Before 1 January 1983, British nationals born in the United Kingdom (UK) or a British colony, held the nationality status ‘British subject citizen of the UK and colonies’ (BSUKC). They may also have held BSUKC status if they were born elsewhere but their father was born in the UK (or a British colony) and their birth was regarded as legitimate.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/contents" rel="external">British Nationality Act 1981</a> came into force on 1 January 1983 and created 3 new types of nationality status.</p>

<p>British citizenship was gained by customers who held BSUKC status and Right of Abode in the UK.</p>

<p>British dependent territories citizenship (renamed British overseas territories citizenship) was gained by customers who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>had BSUKC status through a connection to a British dependent territory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>did not have Right of Abode in the UK British overseas citizenship (BOC) was gained:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>automatically by some customers (on 1 January 1983)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by children who registered as BOCs (on or after 1 January 1983)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by women who registered as BOCs if they were married to someone who became a BOC (on or after 1 January 1983)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by people who are otherwise stateless, if they were born in:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the UK (on or after 1 January 1983) and had a parent who held BOC, BDTC, BOTC or British subject status</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a British overseas territory (on or after 1 January 1983) and had a parent who was a BOC, British citizen or British subject</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>automatically (on 1 July 1997) for customers connected to Hong Kong who would become otherwise stateless when sovereignty of Hong Kong returned to China under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/948/made" rel="external">Hong Kong (British Nationality Order) 1986</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by people who are otherwise stateless, if they were born:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>in Hong Kong (on or after 1 July 1997) and had a parent who was a BOC or a British national (overseas) citizen</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>outside a British overseas territory (on or after 1 July 1997) and had a parent who held ‘other than by descent’ BDTC status (on 30 June 1997) from a connection to Hong Kong</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>BOC status: gained automatically on 1 January 1983</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/contents" rel="external">Section 26 of the British Nationality Act 1981</a> says a person automatically became a British overseas citizen on 1 January 1983, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>before that date they were a British subject citizen of the UK and colonies (BSUKC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>did not on that date become:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a British citizen under section 11 of the British Nationality Act 1981 (because they did not hold Right of Abode in the UK)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a British citizen under section 1(1) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/6/contents" rel="external">British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a British dependent territories citizen under section <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/contents" rel="external">23 of the British Nationality Act 1981</a> (because their BSUKC status was not gained through a connection to a British dependent territory).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>BOC status: registered as BOC on or after 1 January 1983</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/contents" rel="external">Section 27 of the British Nationality Act 1981</a> allows for the registration of children as British overseas citizens (BOCs) on or after 1 January 1983:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>at the discretion of the Secretary of State (under section 27(1) of the act)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the application to register a child (under section 27(2) of the act) was made:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>within 5 years of the act coming into force (before 1 January 1988)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>within 12 months of the child’s date of birth</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The ability to register under section 27(2) of the British Nationality Act 1981 was removed on 7 November 2002 when the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/contents" rel="external">Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a> came in to force.</p>

<h3>BOC status: women registered as BOCs through marriage</h3>

<p>Section 28 of the British Nationality Act 1981 allowed women to register as British overseas citizens (BOCs) (on or after 1 January 1983), if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they were married to someone with BSUKC status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they were previously able to register as a BSUKC under section 6(2) British Nationality Act 1948 because of that marriage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their husband became a BOC on that date</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The ability to register under section 28 of the British Nationality Act 1981 was removed on 7 November 2002 when the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/contents" rel="external">Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a> came in to force.</p>

<h3>BOC status: stateless under British Nationality Act 1981</h3>

<p>The British Nationality Act 1981 allowed customers, who are otherwise stateless, to get British overseas citizen (BOC) status automatically, if they were born on or after 1 January 1983 in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the UK to a parent who was a BOC, British dependent territories citizen (renamed British overseas territories citizen) or British subject (schedule 2, paragraph 1, British Nationality Act 1981)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a British overseas territory to a parent who was a British citizen, BOC or British subject (schedule 2, paragraph 2, British Nationality Act 1981)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Schedules 1 and 2 of the British Nationality Act 1981 (BNA’81), were amended from 1 July 2006 when the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/contents" rel="external">Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a> (Commencement No. 11) Order 2006 came into force.</p>

<h3>BOC status: stateless customers from Hong Kong</h3>

<p>The introduction of the Hong Kong (British Nationality Order) 1986 allowed British overseas citizens (BOC) status to be given automatically to customers who would otherwise become stateless. This applied to customers born:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>before 1 July 1997, who:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>held British dependent territories citizen (BDTC) status through a connection with Hong Kong</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>lost their BDTC status on 1 July 1997 when sovereignty of Hong Kong returned to China</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>would become otherwise stateless (for example, they did not have another nationality)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in Hong Kong on or after 1 July 1997, who:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>had a parent who held BOC or British national (overseas) citizen status</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>would become otherwise stateless (does not have another nationality)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Hong Kong (British Nationality Order) 1986 also allowed customers to register as a British overseas citizen (BOC), if they were born:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>outside a British overseas territory on or after 1 July 1997 who:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>had a parent who held ‘other than by descent’ BDTC status on 30 June 1997 from a connection to Hong Kong</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rights of British overseas citizens</h3>

<p>British overseas citizens (BOCs) can hold a British passport and get consular help and protection from UK diplomatic posts. Unless the BOC is a dual British citizen, they are subject to immigration controls and do not have the automatic right to live or work in the UK.</p>

<p>BOCs can hold dual British nationality if, for example, they have also registered as a British citizen or British overseas territory citizen after 1 January 1983. If a BOC registers as a British citizen or British overseas territory citizen, they do not lose their entitlement to BOC status and can hold both passports at the same time.</p>

<h2>How to deal with British overseas citizen cases</h2>

<p>This page tells HM Passport Office operational staff how to deal with an application for a British overseas citizen (BOC) passport. Only correctly trained examiners must deal with BOC cases.</p>

<p>Since 2013 HM Passport Office assess all applications for British overseas citizen (BOC) passports as if they were first time applications (including renewal and replacement applications). We do this to make sure the customer’s identity and entitlement to a British passport is correctly established.</p>

<p>You, the examiner must contact the customer and ask for the relevant documents and evidence needed to confirm a first time claim in the UK or overseas if the customer has not already provided it. See, overseas risk based examination.</p>

<p>You do not need to deal with a renewal or replacement application as a first time application if the customer’s passport record on Main Index shows we have already reassessed their claim (as a first time application) since 2013. But you must reassess the customer’s claim if you have any concerns about their nationality or identity.</p>

<h3>BOC applications: what the customer must send us</h3>

<p>You may need to write to BOC customers to ask for the following documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>passport photo</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the correct fee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the standard documents they need for their application service type (for example, identity documents, birth certificates and change of name documents)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any passport they hold or a colour copy of the personal details page if they need to keep their passport for travel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any related documents that confirm they did not become a British citizen or a British dependent territories citizen on 1 January 1983 (for example, a grandparent’s birth or adoption certificate)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence they are <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark19">stateless</a> (without another citizenship or nationality) if their claim to BOC status relies on it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other documents we need in line with existing guidance</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>If the customer cannot send the documents we need</h4>

<p>If a customer cannot send us the documents we need, you must ask them why.</p>

<p>If they do not have a document or a duplicate, you must ask for other documents or evidence.</p>

<p>If the customer cannot give us the evidence we need and all avenues have been exhausted, we must consider the application using a balance of probabilities (see: Supporting documents not available guidance).</p>

<h3>Examining a BOC passport application: first time application</h3>

<p>You, the examiner, must deal with the application using existing first time passport application guidance (which may also include an interview) if the customer appears to be a British overseas citizens (BOC) and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>has never held a British passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is renewing or replacing an Old Blue (hardback style) passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is renewing or replacing a red passport (machine readable style passport):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>that you cannot find on Main Index or through a Genie search</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>issued before 1 January 2013 and we need their documents again (to check their nationality and identity)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the application is for a first BOC passport, you must:</p>

<p>1. Decide if you need to do extra checks on the BOC application.</p>

<p>2. Make sure the customer still holds BOC status, for example, if on 31 December 1982 they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>held British subject citizen of the UK and colonies status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>did not have Right of abode in the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. Check if we are dealing with the customer, in line with Windrush guidance.</p>

<p>4. Be satisfied the customer has given us enough evidence to confirm their nationality and identity.</p>

<p>5. Seek advice from your Quality and Examination Support Team (QuESt) if the customer does not have a claim to BOC citizenship (QuESt will decide if we must refuse the application, in line with the Refusal and withdrawal of passport facilities guidance).</p>

<p>6. Add a case note to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer’s correct nationality status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the details of the checks you have done and the outcomes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>7. Check the nationality status is correct on the Prepare passport tab on the system.</p>

<p>8. Add the correct <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">immigration observations</a> to the system.</p>

<p>9. Send the customer for interview (in line with current guidance). If not, issue a BOC passport.</p>

<p>You must not complete the application, send the customer for interview or issue a passport if there are other entitlement reasons why we cannot deal with the passport application. You must refer the application to the Counter Fraud team if, for example there are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fraud concerns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>risk indicators</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>court orders</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Renewing or replacing a BOC passport</h3>

<p>Most customers with British overseas citizens (BOC) status will already hold or have held a BOC passport. A record of their passport will usually exist on Main Index (MI), G-search or the X drive.</p>

<p>Since 1 January 2013, customer’s renewing or replacing their BOC passport must send us the documents and evidence as if they are applying for a first time passport. You must check the case notes on the customer’s previous passport record to see if they gave us their first time documents. If the case note shows, they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>sent their documents you do not need to see them again, unless you have concerns with the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have not sent their documents you must ask the customer to send their documents again</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must select the correct service type on the system. For example, you must change the service type to renewal or replacement, on the Application Management System (AMS) if the online service selects a first time service type and we already have a record of the customer’s machine readable passport.</p>

<h4>How to renew a BOC passport</h4>

<p>To renew a customer’s British overseas citizens (BOC) passport, you must:</p>

<p>1. Decide if you need to do extra checks on the BOC application.</p>

<p>2. Make sure they still hold BOC status (in line with nationality legislation and this guidance).</p>

<p>3. Check if we must deal with them, in line with Windrush guidance.</p>

<p>4. Be satisfied they have given us enough evidence to confirm their nationality and identity.</p>

<p>5. Check the documents and evidence to make sure you have no concerns with the application.</p>

<p>6. Confirm their identity and compare their personal details (and photo if possible) on Main Index, G-search and the T drive, against the current application and supporting documents. If the details do not match, you must confirm the customer’s identity and ask them to resolve the difference (see: confirming identity guidance).</p>

<p>7. Add the correct case note to the application, depending on if you have found the record, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>‘[Main Index, G:search, X drive] check record not held’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘[Main Index, G:search, X drive] check record confirms previous passport [insert number] shows BOC with the relevant observations’’</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>8. Check the nationality status shows British overseas citizen on the Prepare passport tab on the system.</p>

<p>9. Add the correct <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">immigration observations</a> to the system.</p>

<p>10. Case note the application, confirming the checks you’ve done.</p>

<p>11. Issue a BOC passport.</p>

<p>You must refer the application to the Counter Fraud team if there are other entitlement reasons why we cannot deal with the passport application. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fraud concerns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>risk indicators</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>court orders</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to replace a lost or stolen BOC passport</h4>

<p>If a customer applies to replace a lost or stolen BOC passport, you must deal with the application, using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>lost, stolen and recovered guidance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark16">renewing a BOC passport</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>BOC case: if a customer’s claim relies on statelessness</h3>

<p>When dealing with an application where the customer is stateless, you must make sure they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have no entitlement to another nationality before you issue a British overseas citizens (BOC) passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send us documentary evidence that they are stateless</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Stateless customers: Hong Kong</h4>

<p>Customers who did not register as a British national overseas (BN(O)) citizen, stopped holding British dependent territories (BDTC) citizenship on 1 July 1997 and became Chinese citizens (if they were entitled to it).</p>

<p>If a customer became a citizen of China, they will have no claim to a British passport. You must tell them to contact the Chinese authorities at the nearest Chinese consulate so they can apply for a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport.</p>

<p>If the customer did not become a citizen of China, they may be stateless. You must ask the customer to send evidence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to show they or their parent:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>was a BDTC with a connection to Hong Kong</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>held no other nationality on 1 July 1997</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>from the Chinese authorities to confirm they are not Chinese citizens</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>from authorities in any other country they are connected to by birth or descent, confirming they did not have that country’s nationality on 1 July 1997</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements also apply to children born on or after 1 July 1997 to a parent who was previously a BDTC from a connection with Hong Kong. You must refer the application to your operational team leader (OTL). They will contact the customer, if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>stateless and not entitled to BOC status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have not registered as a BN(O), is not stateless and have no claim to British nationality</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The OTL will then confirm if you can refuse the customer’s application.</p>

<h3>Observations for BOC passports</h3>

<p>When dealing with BOC applications, you must check which UK immigration observation you must add to the passport in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">British overseas citizens UK immigration observations</a> guidance.</p>

<h2>British overseas citizens UK immigration observations</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office operational staff what United Kingdom immigration observations they must add to a British overseas citizen passport.</p>

<p>When we issue a customer with a British overseas citizens (BOC) passport, we must add the correct United Kingdom (UK) immigration observation. This will either be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>subject to immigration control (STC) observation code OBTB, that says:</li>
</ul>

<p>THE HOLDER IS SUBJECT TO CONTROL UNDER THE IMMIGRATION ACT 1971</p>

<ul>
  <li>re-admission to the UK (RUK) observation code OBTE, that says:</li>
</ul>

<p>THE HOLDER IS ENTITLED TO RE-ADMISSION TO THE UNITED KINGDOM</p>

<p>If we do not use the correct UK immigration observation, especially for customers in the UK, it may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>mean if they leave the UK, they may have difficulty trying to re-enter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>create similar issues seen with Windrush customers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The UK immigration observation we use in a BOC passport, depends on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if a customer is in the UK or overseas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how long a customer has been in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what UK immigration observations are in a customer’s previous passports</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any immigration documents a customer has from UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>First BOC passport: customer is in the UK</h3>

<p>If a UK customer applies for their first British overseas citizens (BOC) passport, you must check if, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>documents they sent with their application show they are settled in the UK (for example, they have indefinite leave to remain (ILR), indefinite leave to enter (ILE) or no time limit (NTL))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UKVI systems show the customer is settled (if they did not send any documents with their application that show they are settled)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the customer’s documents or the UKVI system shows the customer is settled, you must refer <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark26">to first BOC passport: customer is settled</a>.</p>

<p>If the customer’s documents and the UKVI systems do not show if they are settled, you must:</p>

<p>1. Send the customer Application Management System (AMS) letter 137. The letter asks for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence that shows their immigration status in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the document they used to enter to the UK (if they cannot give us evidence that shows their immigration status in the UK)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a signed letter that explains when they travelled to the UK and what document they used (if they cannot give us the document, they used to enter the UK)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. Add a case note to explain the actions and decisions you made.</p>

<p>3. Store the application while you wait for a response.</p>

<p>4. Refer to</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark26">first BOC passport: customer is settled</a> (if the customer provides evidence to show they are settled)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark25">first BOC passport: asking UKVI if a customer is settled</a> (if the customer cannot provide evidence to show they are settled)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>First BOC passport: asking UKVI if a customer is settled</h4>

<p>If the British overseas citizens (BOC) customer cannot give us evidence to show they are settled in the UK, you must:</p>

<p>1. Fill in the UKVI referral – customer’s immigration status form. Check the customer’s details you out on the referral are correct and matches their details on the passport application.</p>

<p>2. Create an email and put ‘HMPO request – customer’s settlement status’ in the subject field. Attach the referral form to the email and send it to UKVI from your team’s mailbox, to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ask them to check their records to see if the customer is settled and to let you know if they are</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell them to contact the customer, if their records do not show the customer is settled, to explain what the customer will need to do about their immigration status in the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. Allow 10 working days for UKVI to respond (although you must allow 10 working days, UKVI will respond as quickly as possible).</p>

<h4>First BOC passport: customer is settled</h4>

<p>If the British overseas citizens (BOC) customer provides evidence to show they are settled, you must:</p>

<p>1. Check it against the UKVI systems (including the Warehouse section of the Case Information Database).</p>

<p>3. Refer the application to Enhanced Application Checking, if you suspect the customer’s evidence of settlement is not genuine.</p>

<p>If you are satisfied the customer’s settlement evidence is genuine, the UKVI systems show they are settled or UKVI confirmed they are settled, you must:</p>

<p>1. Add the UK immigration observation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">STC immigration observation</a></li>
