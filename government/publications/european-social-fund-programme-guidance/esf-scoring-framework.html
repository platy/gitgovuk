<p>2014-2020 European Social Fund Scoring Framework – minimum requirements and score rationale</p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This document sets out the scoring framework for use on all Full Applications received by the Managing Authority. The numerical scoring approaches described in this document apply to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Full Applications received in response to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open calls published prior to 29th October 2018 under the previous two-stage application process;</li>
  <li>Open calls published before or after 29th October 2018 under the single-stage application process.</li>
</ul>

<p>The exceptions to this is where a Full Application is non-competitive, these include applications relating to Co-Financing activity, Technical Assistance and Community Led Local Development (CLLD). In these cases, the applicant is still required to meet the same minimum standards presented in this document to progress but no individual score or overall score will apply.</p>

<p>This version of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Scoring Framework reflects that the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme in England moved to a single-stage Full Application process across the whole programme from 29th October 2018 and that all prior outline applications/assessments are now complete.</p>

<p>The scoring for dual-stage applications received by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority in response to calls published prior to 29th October 2018 can be found in Versions 6 &amp; 7 of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Scoring Framework document.</p>

<p>Copies of previous versions of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Scoring Framework can be requested from the Managing Authority by sending an email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ESF2014-2020@dwp.gov.uk">ESF2014-2020@dwp.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Devolved Intermediate Bodies</h2>
<p>In some Core Cities and other administrative areas within England, the Managing Authority has agreed to designate specific appraisal responsibilities to a small number of ‘Devolved Intermediate Bodies’.</p>

<p>Where an agreed Devolved Intermediate Body is in place, in line with the standard Devolved Intermediate Body Memorandum of Understanding, they will be responsible for appraising each <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project Application against 2 specific elements of the Strategic Fit Core Selection Criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed operation contributes to the needs/opportunities identified in the Call for Proposals to which it is responding;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed operation is aligned to the local growth needs set out in the local <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Funds">ESIF</abbr> Strategy and contributes to the specific objectives, outputs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In carrying out their delegated role in appraising an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> application against these specific Core Selection Criteria, the Devolved Intermediate Body will apply the relevant numerical scoring approach set out in this <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Scoring Framework and decide whether they wish to Approve, Approve with Conditions or Reject these aspects of each relevant application. The Devolved Intermediate Body will also be responsible for seeking advice from the local <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> Area <abbr title="European Structural and Investment Funds">ESIF</abbr> Sub-Committee to inform their appraisal.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority retains the responsibility for appraising and applying the relevant numerical scoring approach set out in this <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Scoring Framework against all other aspects of the Core Selection Criteria.</p>

<p>In order to proceed to Funding Agreement, two decisions then need to be made:</p>

<p>A) The Devolved Intermediate Body needs to approve the application based on their appraisal of the 2 specific elements of the Strategic Fit Core Selection Criteria within their remit; and</p>

<p>B) The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority needs to approve the application based on their appraisal of all of the other Core Selection Criteria (with the exception of the 2 specific elements covered by the Devolved Intermediate Body).</p>

<p>If either Decision A or Decision B is negative – the application will not proceed to the Funding Agreement stage.</p>

<h2>Full Application</h2>
<p>Where an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> open call requires the applicant to submit a Full Application, the following scoring methodology will apply.</p>

<p>Where a Full Application has been submitted to the Managing Authority under the single-stage application process, either before or after 29th October 2018, the appraisal will first be subject to a Gateway Assessment.</p>

<p>The Gateway Assessment questions are not scored but if a Full Application fails to meet the Gateway Assessment requirements, the application will not go any further in the appraisal process.</p>

<h2>Minimum scores</h2>
<p>Applications must achieve a minimum score of 3 for each criteria by the end of the Full Application process to be successful. All criteria are deemed to be critical and a minimum overall score of 57 (42.8% of the total available) needs to be met. Failure to achieve this by the end of the full application process will result in the application being rejected. Where an application is successful and a Funding Agreement is issued, this will be conditional where the final score for any criteria remains at 3.</p>

<h2>Score rationale</h2>
<p>Where a call indicates that scoring will be used, the framework in this document will apply; all applications will be scored in line with the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> scoring criteria. The methodology for scoring is described below with the key indicators. At Full Application stage, a maximum score of 133 is possible using the scale below.</p>

<h2>Score where criteria is not applicable</h2>
<p>Where a criterion is shown as not applicable in the call (questions 5.1 and 5.2) then a score of ‘5’ will be awarded. This is required to ensure no applicant is either advantaged or disadvantaged where a particular criterion does not apply.  Awarding ‘5’ indicates that the requirement is met, thereby not disadvantaging the applicant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2014-2020 </span> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Full Application Scoring Scale</h2>

<h3>Score = 7	Meets the requirement with additional assurance</h3>
<p>The evidence provided is comprehensive, demonstrating that they completely meet the requirement. They have supplied clear and detailed information. Additional assurance is also provided that the service offered significantly exceeds the minimum service requirement.</p>

<h3>Score = 5	Meets the requirement</h3>
<p>The evidence provided is comprehensive, demonstrating that they completely meet the requirement. They have supplied clear and detailed information.</p>

<h3>Score = 3	Mostly meets the requirement with minor weaknesses in certain areas</h3>
<p>The evidence provided demonstrates reasonable ability, mostly meeting the requirement with minor weaknesses in certain areas. The evidence is fairly clear and convincing with only minor reservations.</p>

<h3>Score = 1	Mostly fails the requirement with major weaknesses in certain areas</h3>
<p>The evidence provided is unclear and, unconvincing and mostly fails to meet the requirement.   Some risk to the delivery of service is identified or insufficient information is provided to give assurance that the minimum requirement will be met.</p>

<h3>Score = 0 Fails to meet the requirement</h3>
<p>The evidence provided fails to satisfy the stated requirement.</p>
