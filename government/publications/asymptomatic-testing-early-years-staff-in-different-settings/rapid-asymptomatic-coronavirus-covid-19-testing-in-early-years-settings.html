<p>Asymptomatic testing is available to early years staff.</p>

<h2>Nurseries</h2>

<p>Nursery staff are eligible for regular asymptomatic testing as part of education testing programme and are receiving lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) kits for twice weekly testing at home. Those in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-asymptomatic-testing-for-staff-in-primary-schools-and-nurseries/rapid-asymptomatic-coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-staff-in-primary-schools-school-based-nurseries-and-maintained-nursery-schools" class="govuk-link">schools-based nurseries and maintained nursery schools</a> have been receiving testing since 18 January 2021 alongside primary schools.</p>

<p>From 22 March 2021, the asymptomatic testing programme in education expanded to all staff in private, voluntary and independent (<abbr title="private, voluntary and independent">PVI</abbr>) nurseries.</p>

<h2>Childminders and wraparound childcare providers</h2>

<p>Childminders and staff in wraparound childcare providers can access asymptomatic twice-weekly testing from 22 March by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>going to a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/find-covid-19-lateral-flow-test-site">lateral flow test site</a>
</li>
  <li>collecting <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://find-covid-19-rapid-test-sites.maps.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/">home test kits from a collection site</a>
</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests">ordering a home test kit online</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Participation</h2>

<p>Regular, rapid testing is already in place for millions of people across the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, care homes and schools. The government has also confirmed twice-weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rapid-lateral-flow-testing-for-households-and-bubbles-of-school-pupils-and-staff" class="govuk-link">testing using LFDs for free for households, childcare and support bubbles of early years children, nursery children, primary and secondary-age pupils and college students</a>. Those in households, childcare or support bubbles of anyone who works in an occupation related to an childcare provider, school, nursery or college can also access twice weekly testing.</p>

<p>We encourage everyone that is eligible for testing to participate. About 1 in 3 people with coronavirus do not have symptoms but can still pass it on to others. Regular testing of people without symptoms is important to help stop the virus spreading and protect your loved ones.  Regular testing for those without symptoms is a critical tool to safeguard the population and stop the spread of the virus as sections of society are opened up.</p>

<h2>Carrying out the tests</h2>

<p>Nursery staff are being supplied with lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test kits to self-swab. Staff are asked to take their test kits home and carry out the test twice a week.</p>

<p>The tests should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taken before going to the workplace to minimise the risk of introducing infection</li>
  <li>evenly spaced through the week</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff returning to work after a period of leave should take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test before coming into work.</p>

<p>Part time workers should still broadly space their 2 tests through the week.</p>

<h2>Reporting results</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test will give a result in around 30 minutes. Staff must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">report their result (whether positive, negative or void) to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace</a> as soon as the test is completed either online or by telephone as per the instructions in the home test kit. Staff should also share their result with their nursery (whether positive, negative or void) to help with contact tracing.</p>

<p>Testing is not mandatory for staff and staff do not need to provide proof of a negative test result to attend nursery in person, although participation in testing is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h2>Staff with positive results</h2>

<p>Staff with a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>self-isolate in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay-at-home guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>arrange a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test to confirm the result</li>
</ul>

<h2>Negative results</h2>

<p>Staff with a negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result can continue to attend school or nursery and support the implementation of the routine system of controls already in place in educational settings.</p>

<h2>Role of the asymptomatic testing programme</h2>

<p>The testing programme is an important addition to supporting leaders to maintain the continuity of education through the pandemic. It remains imperative that the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#infection-prevention-and-response-system-of-controls" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a> continues to be rigorously applied to enable the safest possible environment. Even if you test negative, you should continue to follow national and local rules and guidelines including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular handwashing</li>
  <li>social distancing</li>
  <li>wearing a face covering where required</li>
</ul>

<p>The asymptomaticâ¯testing programmeâ¯does not replace the current testing policy for those with symptoms. Anyone with symptoms (even if they recently had a negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result), should still follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">government guidance to self-isolate</a> immediately.</p>
