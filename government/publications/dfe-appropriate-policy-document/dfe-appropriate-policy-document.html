<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Scope</h2>

<p>As part of the Department for Education’s (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s) statutory and departmental functions, we process special category data and criminal offence data (collectively referred to as ‘sensitive data’) in accordance with the requirements of Article 9 and 10 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018).</p>

<p>This policy covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>substantial public interest processing for <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> statutory and departmental functions</li>
  <li>employment, as it affects the provision of or participation in training or education and processing for human resources (<abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr>) purposes</li>
  <li>processing for archiving, research and statistical purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>This appropriate policy document demonstrates that the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> processing of special category and criminal offence data based on these specific Schedule 1 conditions is compliant with the requirements of the UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Article 5 principles.</p>

<p>Any processing will only be conducted once a data protection impact assessment has been completed and that the Office of the Data Protection Office is content that the request:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is lawful</li>
  <li>meets the data protection principles set out in UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>meets the additional policy requirements set out in this document</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Definition of special category, sensitive and criminal offence data</h2>

<p>Special category data (defined by Article 9 of the UK&nbsp;<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and sensitive data (defined by section 35 of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>&nbsp;2018) is personal data which reveals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>racial or ethnic origin</li>
  <li>political opinions</li>
  <li>religious or philosophical beliefs</li>
  <li>trade union membership</li>
  <li>genetic data</li>
  <li>biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person</li>
  <li>data concerning health</li>
  <li>data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation</li>
</ul>

<p>Article 10 of the UK&nbsp;<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>&nbsp;applies to the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures.</p>

<p>Section 11(2) of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>&nbsp;2018 provides that criminal offence data includes data which relates to the alleged commission of offences and related proceedings and sentencing. Information about victims and witnesses of crime is also included in the scope of data relating to criminal convictions and offences.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Conditions for processing special category data and criminal convictions</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> processes special category data under the following paragraphs of Article 9 of the UK&nbsp;<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(a) explicit consent</li>
  <li>(b) employment, social security and social protection (if authorised by law)</li>
  <li>(c) vital interests</li>
  <li>(d) not-for-profit bodies</li>
  <li>(e) made public by the data subject</li>
  <li>(f) legal claims or judicial acts</li>
  <li>(g) reasons of substantial public interest (with a basis in law)</li>
  <li>(h) health or social care (with a basis in law)</li>
  <li>(i) public health (with a basis in law)</li>
  <li>(j) archiving, research and statistics (with a basis in law)</li>
</ul>

<p>Article 10 of the UK&nbsp;<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>&nbsp;permits processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences under the control of official authority. It follows that <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>  may process criminal offence data under Article 10 of the UK&nbsp;<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>&nbsp;when it is exercising official authority that enables it to do so. When processing is for <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> statutory functions within the meaning set out in section 8 of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>&nbsp;2018, including departmental functions, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> must meet one of the conditions in Schedule 1 of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>&nbsp;2018. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may process criminal offence data under any of the Schedule 1 conditions listed in this document with the exception of paragraph 8 (information in section 5 of this document), which is only applicable to special category data. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may further process criminal offence data when the additional processing conditions relating to criminal offence data are met under&nbsp;<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>&nbsp;2018, Part 3 of Schedule 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paragraph 32 (personal data in the public domain)</li>
  <li>paragraph 33 (legal claims)</li>
  <li>paragraph 36 (substantial public interest)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above does not apply to law enforcement processing which is covered by section 8 of this policy.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Explicit consent</h2>

<p>Explicit consent will only be used where there is not an imbalance of power, for example, for research purposes. It will only be used where the department can demonstrate that the data subject has a genuine choice and will not be chased or suffer any detriment if they choose not to provide the data. The data subject will not be asked for a reason why they have chosen not to provide the data and there will be a choice provided to demonstrate they have chosen not to provide the data.</p>

<p>Processing of the data collected will be the minimum required for the stated purpose and processing will be limited to its original purpose only and deleted after the original use has been concluded. The rights to object and to erasure will be absolute.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>&nbsp;Employment, social security and social protection law</h2>

<p>Section 10(2) of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>&nbsp;2018 sets out that in order for processing of special categories of personal data to be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> or of the data subject in the field of employment, social security and social protection law under Article 9(2)(b) of the UK&nbsp;<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, that processing must meet one of the conditions set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> processes special category data for <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> purposes when the condition set out in paragraph 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the&nbsp;<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>&nbsp;2018 is met. This condition may apply to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> assessing policy in relation to social security or employment as it affects the provision of or participation in training or education and to processing for <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> purposes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will consider each request for processing (including information sharing) on a case-by-case basis. The Office of the Data Protection Officer will confirm the lawful basis for a request to process the data, including that the business area can clearly demonstrate that this relates to the provision of, or participation in, training or education as part of departmental function or, for employees, that the processing is necessary to fulfil <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s obligations as an employer. Only data that is necessary for the stated processing activity will be collected.</p>

<p>Further requests for reuse for other purposes will be considered under Articles 9(2)(b) (employment, social security and social protection law), (2)(c) (vital interests) and (2)(f) (legal claims and judicial acts), and the limitation principle will be further considered. Requests to object to processing and erasing data will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Information will be deleted once obligations under relevant legislative requirements cease. It is to be noted that these obligations may last longer than the period of employment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Vital interest</h2>

<p>The Office of the Data Protection Officer has cleared all <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> staff including contractors and third-party staff who are in a position to access personal data in the vital interests of the data subject to process and share personal data in cases of emergency. This will usually be a senior member of staff with a direct working relationship with the data subject or a local qualified first aider. The data subject will be informed that the data was shared at the earliest opportunity where they are able to understand what has happened. This may include drawing the attention of medical staff to personal data the data subject has made manifestly public by wearing a medical alert bracelet or other piece of jewellery.</p>

<p>In some cases, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may provide personal data about the next of kin to emergency services so that they can provide the necessary information.</p>

<p>The data subject has the right to discuss the processing with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> data protection officer.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Not for profit bodies</h2>

<p>While <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> is not a body defined under this section, it should be noted that personal data may be shared with such bodies where <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has established that such data sharing complies with its obligations under the data protection legislation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Made public by the data subject</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will consider each request for processing (including data sharing) on a case-by-case basis and only where we have first confirmed that it is the data subject that has placed their personal data in the public domain and not a third party such as the press. This may include, in cases of emergency, drawing the attention of medical staff to personal data the data subject has made manifestly public by wearing a medical alert bracelet or other piece of jewellery.</p>

<p>If the department cannot confirm that the personal data was released by the data subject, then this personal data cannot be processed under this basis.</p>

<p>Requests to object to processing and erasing data will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Legal claims or judicial acts</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will confirm that an organisation or other third party making a legal claim or request under a judicial act has the authority to request personal data and where they are acting on behalf of the data subject, they will need to confirm who the data subject is and that they have the authority to act.</p>

<p>The department will consider each request for processing (including data sharing) on a case-by-case basis and ensure all incidents are recorded in the departmental records.</p>

<p>The Office of the Data Protection Officer will confirm whether it is a lawful request and will conduct a data protection impact assessment. Where there is a legislative requirement for us to collect the personal data, this will be documented in the relevant records. Only personal data that is necessary for the stated processing activity will be collected.</p>

<p>Rights to object and erasure will be considered on a case-by-case basis depending on basis for collection.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Substantial public interest</h2>

<p>Section 10(3) of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>&nbsp;2018 sets out that in order for processing of special categories of personal data and criminal offence data to be necessary for reasons of substantial public interest under Article 9(2)(g) of the UK&nbsp;<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, that processing must meet one of the conditions set out in Part 2 of Schedule 1.</p>
