<p>National professional qualifications (<abbr title="National Professional Qualifications">NPQs</abbr>) are designed to support the professional development of teachers and leaders.</p>

<p>A reformed suite of <abbr title="National Professional Qualifications">NPQs</abbr> is now available which have been developed in collaboration with the sector and are informed by the best available research and evidence. <abbr title="National Professional Qualifications">NPQs</abbr> are designed to provide training and support for teachers and school leaders at all levels and deliver improved outcomes for young people.</p>

<h2>National professional qualifications</h2>

<p><abbr title="National Professional Qualifications">NPQs</abbr> are available for teachers and leaders who want to develop their knowledge and skills in specialist areas of teaching practice. There are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>4 leadership <abbr title="National Professional Qualifications">NPQs</abbr> in senior leadership, headship, executive leadership and early years leadership</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4 <abbr title="National Professional Qualifications">NPQs</abbr> for teachers and leaders who want to develop their expertise in specialist areas of teaching practice</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What’s involved</h2>

<p>The specialist and leadership <abbr title="National Professional Qualifications">NPQs</abbr> provide training and support for teachers and school leaders at all levels. This includes those who want to develop expertise in high-quality teaching practices, such as behaviour management, and those leading multiple schools across trusts.</p>

<p>They are part of a wider set of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reforms-to-teacher-development">teacher development reforms</a> which together will create a ‘golden thread’ of high-quality evidence underpinning the support, training and development available through a teacher’s entire career.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Professional Qualifications">NPQs</abbr> have been designed with teachers and leaders in mind using the latest evidence and can be completed flexibly around existing commitments.</p>

<p>Study can last between 12 and 18 months, depending on your chosen <abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>. Your provider will determine the course structure, content and method of delivery.</p>

<p>During this period of study you will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>learn from the evidence-based curriculum of your chosen qualification, drawing on effective pedagogy, current research and international best practice – this will equip you with the knowledge and skills to either improve in your current role, or take the next step in your career</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take part in a mixture of face-to-face sessions, webinars, and self-directed study</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>answer a short, assessed case study question (the summative assessment)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>

<p>Each&nbsp;<abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>&nbsp;is underpinned by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-frameworks-from-september-2021">new content framework</a>. These frameworks set out what participants should know and be able to do after completing an <abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>. Providers have used these to design their courses.</p>

<p>As well as the reformed <abbr title="National Professional Qualifications">NPQs</abbr>, we have introduced an early headship coaching offer for new headteachers. This is a package of structured support and networking opportunities for teachers early on in their headship role.</p>

<h2>Early headship coaching offer</h2>

<p>You are eligible for this package of structured support and networking opportunities if you meet all of these criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you are in your first 5 years of headship</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you are employed in England in a state-funded school or state-funded 16 to 19 organisation on starting the training</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have either completed an <abbr title="National Professional Qualification for Headship">NPQH</abbr> before taking up your first headship post or are currently taking one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have not withdrawn from the additional support programme previously</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The offer provides structured unassessed support based on the best available evidence about what makes an effective headteacher. While the exact content of this support will depend on the provider chosen, activities could include a combination of group coaching, one-to-one support discussions and peer network support.</p>

<p>You can contact your local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teaching-school-hubs">teaching school hub</a>, lead provider or other delivery partner to find out more.</p>

  <li>
    <p>headteachers of school-based or maintained nurseries</p>

  <li>
    <p>as a childminder and registered on the Ofsted Early Years Register, or with a registered Childminder Agency</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional eligibility criteria</h3>

<p>Participants will only be eligible for funding for each&nbsp;<abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>&nbsp;once.</p>

<p>Participants who receive scholarship funding for a reformed&nbsp;<abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>&nbsp;available from November 2021 and who then subsequently withdraw from, or fail, their programme will not be eligible for scholarship funding for the same&nbsp;<abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>&nbsp;in the future. If a participant is unable to continue with their&nbsp;<abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>, providers are expected to support them to defer their programme and restart at a later date if appropriate.</p>

<p>Participants who received scholarship funding for a legacy&nbsp;<abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>&nbsp;(prior to November 2021) and who withdraw from their programme will be eligible for scholarship funding for the new reformed&nbsp;<abbr title="National Professional Qualifications">NPQs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Access to funding remains conditional on successful validation of participants’ registration information against Teaching Regulation Agency records, so you must ensure that the information supplied to your&nbsp;<abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>&nbsp;provider matches your teacher record. You can check and update your record via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/SelfService/Login" rel="external">Teaching Regulation Agency’ teacher self-service portal</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not eligible for scholarship funding, you can still undertake an&nbsp;<abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>&nbsp;and should contact your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teaching-school-hubs#find-a-teaching-school-hub">local teaching school hub</a>, lead provider or other delivery partners directly for more information.</p>

<h2>Targeted support funding</h2>

<p>From autumn 2022, state-funded schools and state-funded 16 to 19 educational settings with 1 to 600 pupils will be paid £200 for each teacher or leader they employ who takes an <abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr>.</p>

<p>This is to help teachers and leaders in smaller settings who may find it harder to engage with professional development.</p>

<p>This funding will apply to state-funded schools and 16 to 19 educational settings in England that have between 1 and 600 pupils. It will be paid for each <abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr> participant in these eligible settings.</p>

<p>Funding is not available for participants taking the early headship coaching offer unless they are also taking another <abbr title="National Professional Qualification">NPQ</abbr> course.</p>

<p>If you work in a school you can search the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Search?SelectedTab=Establishments" rel="external">Get Information About Schools (<abbr title="Get Information About Schools">GIAS</abbr>) database</a> to check how many pupils are recorded for your school.</p>
