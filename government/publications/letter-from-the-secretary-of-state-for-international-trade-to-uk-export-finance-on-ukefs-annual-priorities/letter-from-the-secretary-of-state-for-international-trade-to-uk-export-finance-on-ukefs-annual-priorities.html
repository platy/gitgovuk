<br>UK Export Finance

<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Dear Louis,</p>

<p>Thank you for your leadership of UK Export Finance (<abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>) over the past year to deliver 
against the outcomes set out in the 2021 letter. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> helps to fuel exports and has been 
central to the Government’s pandemic response, with a record £12.3 billion of new business 
supported in 2020-21 and sustained high demand in this financial year. This has helped to 
keep credit flowing when private sector risk appetite and capacity has been constrained so 
that businesses can trade out of the crisis and take advantage of international opportunities, 
including those created by the UK’s free trade agreements, the new Export Strategy, and 
the global shift towards clean growth.</p>

<p>As Secretary of State for International Trade with responsibility for <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>, I have set out my 
priorities for the department for the coming year below, which should complement existing 
business objectives detailed in <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s Business and Operational Plans. Given the
increasingly complex and volatile global environment, it will be important for <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to remain 
agile and innovative so that the department is well placed to respond to new challenges and 
opportunities. It should also continue strengthening ties across Whitehall to support the 
delivery of cross-government economic, trade and development priorities, and deepening
links with the Department for International Trade (DIT) including to deliver on the 
commitments outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-department-for-international-trade-and-uk-export-finance/memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-department-for-international-trade-and-uk-export-finance">Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two
departments</a>. I especially want to see a focus on delivering more joined-up support for UK 
exporters, utilising platforms such as the Export Support Service to leverage each 
department’s expertise in supporting UK businesses at all stages of their export journey.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Export Strategy: Made in the UK, Sold to the World</h2>
<p>Since reclaiming the UK’s status as an independent trading nation, we have secured 
agreements with trading partners around the world and continue to take ambitious strides to 
capitalise on new trading opportunities for British businesses. To help build back better from 
the pandemic, it is vital that businesses, small and large, take advantage of these 
opportunities, with support from the government to leverage our access and expertise.
We are currently the world’s sixth largest exporter, but I want to see an exporting revolution 
to reach £1 trillion exports per year even sooner than the mid-2030s, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/export-strategy-made-in-the-uk-sold-to-the-world/made-in-the-uk-sold-to-the-world-web-version">Export 
Strategy</a>. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s offer will be crucial to our success, helping to sustain jobs and increase 
productivity across the UK.</p>

<p>This year, I want to see <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> extend its reach to help us meet our target. With significant 
product enhancements that will help to attract investment into the UK, support clean growth
and make our support more accessible for SMEs, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> is in a strong position to do so. It 
will be important for <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to work closely with the Office for Investment (<abbr title="Office for Investment">OfI</abbr>), the UK 
Infrastructure Bank (<abbr title="UK Infrastructure Bank">UKIB</abbr>), Innovate UK and the British Business Bank (<abbr title="British Business Bank">BBB</abbr>) to develop an 
innovation to export pathway that supports businesses to commercialise quicker. Further, 
we need a continuation of efforts to raise awareness of <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s product offering and ensure
a joined-up and coherent cross-government proposition that meets the financing needs of 
British businesses.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Maritime, life sciences and clean growth sectors</h2>
<p>The UK is committed to building export capability in critical sectors to help realise our 
ambitions as a science and technology superpower and transition to a net zero economy by 
2050. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/build-back-better-our-plan-for-growth">Plan for Growth</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/936567/10_POINT_PLAN_BOOKLET.pdf" rel="external">10 Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution</a> set out the
UK’s comparative advantage across a number of technologies, and underscore the 
importance of collaboration between industry and government. In the year ahead, I want to 
see <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> increase its focus on maritime and life sciences sectors – in situations where 
there is a financing need that cannot be met by the private sector – so that the UK can better 
support those growing industries to export around the globe.</p>

<p>I also ask <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to continue to expand its support for clean growth sectors to help build the 
UK supply chain in those sectors, spread their innovative clean technologies around the 
world and thereby accelerate the global green transition. As the first export credit agency 
(<abbr title="Export credit agency">ECA</abbr>) in the world to end support for overseas fossil fuels projects, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> should continue 
to demonstrate leadership among other ECAs by increasing its clean growth portfolio and 
reducing emissions. This includes setting interim portfolio decarbonisation targets and 
delivering more robust climate-related financial disclosures, in line with commitments made 
in <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1019141/UKEF_Climate_Change_Strategy_2021.pdf" rel="external">Climate Change Strategy</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-finance-strategy">HMG’s Green Finance Strategy</a> in relation to the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (<abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>). Whilst it will take time to 
transition the portfolio, especially given the nascency of many clean technologies, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> 
should continue working closely with DIT, BEIS and others to support plans for the growth 
of net zero technologies and creation of trading opportunities for the UK supply chain that 
can be realised in the years to come.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Global Britain</h2>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy">Integrated Review</a> outlines the Government’s vision for the UK in 2030, and points to a
Global Britain that knows its strengths; that is open; that champions commerce and trade; 
and that is determined to seek multilateral solutions to complex challenges. Now a full 
Participant to the OECD Arrangement, as well as the UK’s only bilateral sovereign financing 
instrument, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> is an important part of the UK’s voice abroad. The department should 
build on early successes, for example, as a key influencer in the ‘coalition of the willing’ to 
strengthen the Coal-Fired Power Understanding, to continue pushing the reform agenda so 
that the OECD Arrangement and Sector Understandings are fit for 21st century challenges 
and help preserve a level playing field for British businesses abroad.</p>

<p>Through <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s commercial support for the defence sector, the UK can help strengthen 
bilateral ties and global security. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> should continue working with the Ministry of Defence, 
DIT, HMT and the FCDO to actively support and help increase defence sector exports over 
the coming year, seeking to build relationships with new customers and tailor the defence 
product offering accordingly.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s expanding overseas network of International Export Finance Executives (<abbr title="International Export Finance Executives">IEFEs</abbr>) in 
high potential markets also helps to support this agenda, and further expansion across 
Morocco, Turkey, Europe and beyond will complement the government’s strategic aims. I’m 
pleased that collaboration is already strong between <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>, DIT and FCDO at Post and I 
know that the IEFE’s expertise as a voice of UK business is valuable – I want this joint 
working to continue to deepen with the growth of the network. In the year ahead, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> 
should also play a prominent role supporting the UK’s improved Government-to-Government partnerships offer and collaborating with strategic partners in third countries, 
ensuring that my departments are jointly at the forefront of this work. This, in turn, will help
to open business opportunities in new priority markets.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Levelling Up</h2>
<p>As the export credit agency for the whole of the UK, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> is helping to spread opportunity 
and prosperity across all nations and regions, with 70% of <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s support consistently 
going to UK companies outside of London and the South East. Increasing access to finance 
for SMEs, and encouraging them to export, is a vital part of this agenda. The impact of the 
pandemic has been particularly difficult for small businesses, with 6 in 10 SMEs reporting a 
decline in growth and profitability in 2020-21. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s recent product innovations – including 
the launch of the General Export Facility (<abbr title="General Export Facility">GEF</abbr>) and the temporary expansion of the Export 
Insurance Policy to cover high-income markets (which saw applications double) – has 
helped to close the financing gap and keep smaller companies trading through the crisis. 
Next year, I want to see <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> expand its delivery partners and widen the availability of <abbr title="General Export Facility">GEF</abbr> 
so that <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> continues to reach more small businesses across the UK, with wider benefits 
for the UK supply chain.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> should continue to consider what more it can do to reach SMEs, particularly those in 
the sub-£10 million turnover category which are less well served by private markets. This
may require further product innovation and new engagement strategies. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s wellestablished network of Export Finance Managers (<abbr title="Export Finance Managers">EFMs</abbr>), based in every part of the UK, 
should continue to raise awareness of <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s trade finance and credit insurance offerings 
to the small and mid-size business market and share insights to help drive business strategy. 
The digitisation of the customer journey should also continue to be a core focus for the year 
ahead, helping to improve <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s fintech offering and drive efficiencies for applicants.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Trade for good</h2>
<p>At the Carbis Bay Summit in June 2021, the UK committed to an ambitious agenda with its 
G7 partners to narrow the infrastructure investment gap in developing countries and help 
progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (<abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr>). I am pleased that <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> has 
already been helping to shape part of the UK’s contribution to the G7 agenda – the ‘Clean 
and Green Initiative’ (<abbr title="Clean and Green Initiative">CGI</abbr>) – and I want this to remain a top priority for the department for 
the year ahead, helping to catalyse public and private investment in sustainable 
infrastructure around the globe.</p>

<p>Working closely with DIT, BEIS and FCDO, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> has the potential to further increase its 
support for sustainable projects – which doubled in 2020 to £2.4 billion – to support the 
<abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr>, whilst capturing the secondary benefits of ODA programmes where relevant too. I 
also want <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to further strengthen its collaboration with British International Investment 
(<abbr title="British International Investment">BII</abbr>) to leverage HMG’s debt and equity financing offers in developing countries and work 
alongside DIT and the FCDO to promote the developmental benefits of trade through the 
International Development Strategy.</p>

<p>Last year, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> published its first Modern Slavery Statement which set out the steps <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> 
has taken, together with DIT, to identify, mitigate and prevent modern slavery in its own 
supply chain. Next year, I want to see <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> enhance its approach in an appropriate and 
proportionate way, culminating in a renewed modern slavery statement which will report on 
progress achieved. Lastly, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> should continue to champion high standards in managing
environmental, social, governance (<abbr title="environmental, social, governance">ESG</abbr>) and climate-related risk in its support and increase 
its resource next financial year to do so.</p>

<p>I look forward to working with you and your department to realise the ambitions set out in 
this letter and thank you in advance for your hard work to make the next financial year as 
successful as the last.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>THE RT HON ANNE-MARIE TREVELYAN MP</p>

<p>Secretary of State for International Trade &amp; President of the Board of Trade</p>
