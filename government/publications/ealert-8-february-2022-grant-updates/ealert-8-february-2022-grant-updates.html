<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Woods into Management and Tree Production Innovation Funds to re-open in 2022</h2>
<p>The Forestry Commission will re-open two major grant schemes in early 2022, the Woods into Management (<abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr>) Forestry Innovation Funds and Tree Production Innovation Fund (<abbr title="Tree Production Innovation Fund">TPIF</abbr>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>About the Woods into Management Forestry Innovation Funds</h3>
<p>A series of grants designed to stimulate the development and testing of new ideas that can help improve the ecological condition of woodlands, and their resilience to climate change, via increased demand for wood and increased levels of woodland management. New to the 2022 offer is the Timber in Construction Innovation Fund, which aims to increase and facilitate the use of sustainable English wood and wood fibre in construction.</p>

<p>The following Woods Into Management Forestry Innovation Funds grants are scheduled to open for applications in 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Timber in Construction Innovation Fund</li>
  <li>Routes to market for ash timber Innovation Fund</li>
  <li>Temporary infrastructure Innovation Fund</li>
  <li>Regional woodland restoration Innovation Funds</li>
</ul>

<p>Further details on each of the Innovation Funds can be found on our website.</p>

<p>Applicants will be invited to submit multi-year proposals spanning up to three financial years (ending March 2025), with individual projects valued at up to Â£100K per year.</p>

<p>An overview of the 2021/22 <abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr> Forestry Innovation Funds offer can be found on our website: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/woods-into-management-forestry-innovation-funds"><abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr> Forestry Innovation Funds 2021/22 Overview</a>.

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>About the Tree Production Innovation Fund</h3>
<p>A grant designed to encourage the development and adoption of new technologies and ways of working that will enhance the quantity,â¯quality,â¯and diversity of planting stock available for tree planting in England.â¯New to the 2022 offer, applicantsâ¯willâ¯be invited to submit multi-year proposals spanning up to three financial years (ending March 2025). Projects can be valued at up to Â£300K per year and mustâ¯address one or more of the following challenges identified through stakeholder engagement as barriers to tree production:â¯â¯</p>

<ul>
  <li>Challenge 1:â¯How can we make better use of available seed and vegetative planting material to maximise the quantity, quality and diversity of trees produced?â¯â¯</li>
  <li>Challenge 2:â¯How can we develop growing systems to enhance their efficiency and resilience to change, whilst delivering improved quality and diversity of product?â¯This challenge can include activities to promote biosecurity.</li>
  <li>Challenge 3: How can innovative environmentally sustainable weed control solutions be used to reduce reliance on herbicides?â¯</li>
</ul>

(b) restore streams and rivers, improve water quality and biodiversity, and adapt to climate change.</p>

<p>Applications will be scored. Successful applications will receive funding for up to 2 years to support project development and prepare for delivery.</p>

<p>Projects focused on theme (a) will be administered by Natural England. Projects focused on theme (b) will be administered by the Environment Agency. Whilst the Forestry Commission is not administering projects as part of the first round, we will be involved in a regulatory and advisory capacity.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Want to plant trees but not sure how it works alongside Basic Payment Scheme and Environmental Stewardship payments?</h2>
<p>The England Woodland Creation Offer (EWCO) is compatible with the Basic Payment Scheme, which means you can continue to claim on eligible land.</p>

You may be able to transfer land in an existing Environmental Stewardship grant agreement into the England Woodland Creation Offer without penalty, subject to conditions.</p>

<p>The conditions are:</p>

<p>a. the transfer of land into EWCO will result in a net improvement in environmental management on that land, compared to management under the existing ES agreement
b. the ES agreement remains viable after transfer of the land and removal from the ES agreement</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Update on Phytophthora pluvialis plant health requirements</h2>
<p>Since late 2021 the Forestry Commission and Forest Research have been investigating a new tree disease to the UK known as Phytophthora pluvialis, a fungus-like pathogen. This disease can affect western hemlock, Douglas-fir, pine, and tanoak trees. The Forestry Commission in England has introduced demarcated zones through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/phytophthora-pluvialis">Notices</a> where P. pluvialis has been found within Cornwall, Devon, and Cumbria (zone boundaries are subject to change as targeted monitoring is still ongoing) to restrict the movement of susceptible material.</p>

<p>The Notices also require pre-notification of felling of susceptible material within the demarcated area. Landowners should notify the Forestry Commission via a <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ppluvialis.authorisation@forestrycommission.gov.uk">dedicated mailbox</a> 2 weeks prior to any felling operations that involve the relevant species.  Felling may only commence once authorisation has been provided by the Forestry Commission after a tree health inspection has taken place.  These measures are to reduce the spread of P. pluvialis to other areas and stands of trees.</p>

<p>More information, including maps of the demarcated zones, is available on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/phytophthora-pluvialis">P. pluvialis guidance page</a>. You can also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission/about/access-and-opening">contact your local Forestry Commission Woodland Officer</a>.</p>

<span class="number">8. </span>See our updated Agent Authority Form and guidance</h2>
<p>If you need to give your agent permission to submit or manage an agreement on your behalf you need to provide an Agent Authority Form</p>

<p>Weâve updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forestry-commission-agent-authority-form">Forestry Commission Agent Authority Form</a>. This is the form you can use to grant an agent permission to submit an application or manage an agreement on your behalf. A full list of applications the form can be used for and guidance on how to complete the form is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forestry-commission-agent-authority-form">available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>We have made changes to the form to help us provide a better service for all applications where agent permissions are needed you can now select whether the authority relates to past applications, future applications, or both. We are also now able to accept a mixture of both electronic and wet signatures on the form.</p>

<p>You donât need to complete a new form if youâve previously submitted one to us, as long as all the details are the same and it grants the correct permissions. If you are applying for the England Woodland Creation Offer your Agent authority forms (AAFs) must be on version 3 (2019) or later.</p>
