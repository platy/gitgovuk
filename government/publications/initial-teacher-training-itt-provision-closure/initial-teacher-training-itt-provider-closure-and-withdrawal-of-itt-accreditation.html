<h2>Summary</h2>

<h3>Who this publication is for</h3>

<p>This guidance is intended to help accredited providers of initial teacher training (<abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>) and their partnerships who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are voluntarily ceasing to offer <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provision</li>
  <li>have their accreditation withdrawn by the Secretary of State (<abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>) in one of the circumstances listed below</li>
  <li>have decided not to apply for <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> accreditation from the academic year 2024 to 2025</li>
</ul>

<p>Accredited <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers who are unsuccessful following the recent <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> accreditation process (launched 1 December 2021) will be issued with guidance as part of the outcome notification stage.</p>

<h3>Closure arrangements</h3>

<p>This document sets out closure arrangements including the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>requirements Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) expects the <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider to meet during the closure process</li>
  <li>process for <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to follow when a provider ceases to offer <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provision</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accreditation withdrawal</h3>

<p>This document sets out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the circumstances in which the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> may withdraw accreditation</li>
  <li>the provision for review of a decision to withdraw accreditation</li>
  <li>the expiry or review date</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance will be reviewed before July 2024.</p>

<h2>Voluntary closure</h2>

<p>Accredited <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers intending to voluntarily cease to offer <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provision, whether permanently or temporarily, must inform <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Accredited providers choosing not to apply for accreditation for the academic year 2024 to 2025 will be treated as voluntarily closing and will have to withdraw from delivering <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> leading to Qualified Teacher Status (<abbr title="Qualified Teacher Status">QTS</abbr>) during the academic year of 2023 to 2024. Requests for temporary pause in provision or closure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must be agreed by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>would typically be for a maximum of 12 months (after which time the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> reserves the right to withdraw accreditation if the provider fails to resume its <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provision)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing provider actions and responsibilities</h3>

<h3>Alternative arrangements</h3>

<p>Providers should ensure that the alternative provider’s arrangements for completing the programme are comparable to their own. This particularly applies to the location and appropriateness of any school placements. Undergraduate trainees should be able to complete their degree after the closure is confirmed either with the closing provider or with an alternative academic awarding body.</p>

<p>Any partner lead school should be informed of the decision to close as soon as possible after the decision to close has been made.</p>

<p>Lead schools may either change their ratifying <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider, or withdraw from delivery.</p>

<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>Any applicants holding offers on the Apply for teacher training service for the academic year after closure should be informed of the decision to close and provided with the option of a place at an alternative provider. Alternative arrangements must be approved by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Providers must continue to supply information on trainee data to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> throughout the closure process and ensure that trainee information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Register trainee teacher service</a> is up to date by closure.</p>

<p>Before the final closure of provision, an alternative provider must ensure any deferred trainees are listed with their trainees on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Register trainee teacher service</a>.</p>

<p>The provider must confirm to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk">becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk</a> the arrangements that have been agreed with partner schools and other providers before submitting any requests to make changes to their courses, including permission to recruit and allocations.</p>

<h3>Notification of decision to cease to offer provision for <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The accounting officer must notify <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> of the provider’s intention to cease to offer <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provision, by emailing  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:itt.accreditation@education.gov.uk">itt.accreditation@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The notification should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirmation that the closure decision has been ratified in accordance with the provider’s governance arrangements</li>
  <li>reasons for the decision</li>
  <li>an anticipated date when training programmes will cease</li>
  <li>details of the designated point of contact who will co-ordinate the closure process (closure manager)</li>
  <li>in the case of temporary closure, the anticipated dates that training programmes will cease and recommence</li>
</ul>

<h3>Receipt of closure notification</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will acknowledge receipt of the closure notification and assign a named point of contact to provide guidance through the process.</p>

<p>On receipt of this notification, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will assign a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> associate to meet and discuss with the <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider the optimum date for closure. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> associate will act as a key contact for the provider during the closure.</p>

<h3>The <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider closure document</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider closure document template (<abbr title="ITT provider closure documentation">ITTPCD</abbr>) will be developed and must be completed and returned ahead of formal closure.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <abbr title="ITT provider closure documentation">ITTPCD</abbr> is to ensure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compliance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-criteria/initial-teacher-training-itt-criteria-and-supporting-advice"><abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criteria and supporting advice</a>
</li>
  <li>the interests of trainees are protected</li>
  <li>any financial obligations are met</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="ITT provider closure documentation">ITTPCD</abbr> requires the provision of information relating to current and deferred trainees, financial arrangements and closure plans.</p>

<p>All affected trainees should be detailed within the <abbr title="ITT provider closure documentation">ITTPCD</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Closure</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will agree a final date of closure with the provider. Confirmation will be sent to the designated point of contact identified on the <abbr title="ITT provider closure documentation">ITTPCD</abbr>. This should be acknowledged within 2 working days from the date of receipt.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will issue confirmation of the withdrawal of accreditation by email at least 2 weeks prior to the agreed closure date.</p>

<h3>Finance and Funding</h3>

<p>Once a closure date is agreed between the <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, and following cessation of <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provision, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will require an annual accounts return to be completed in the <abbr title="ITT provider closure documentation">ITTPCD</abbr>.</p>

<p>The annual accounts return is the same accounts return that <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers complete on an annual basis. It contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>audit grant return (AGR)</li>
  <li>income and expenditure</li>
  <li>balance sheet</li>
</ul>

<p>All sections within this return need to be completed, signed by the accounting officer, and independently audited. An audited copy must be submitted to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:itt.accreditation@education.gov.uk">itt.accreditation@education.gov.uk</a> by 31 December following the last academic year of operation.</p>

<p>If there is any unspent <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funding recorded on the balance sheet that hasn’t been committed as part of the closure and is due to be recovered from the closing provider, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will action the recovery by raising an invoice for the required amount.</p>

<p>Any unpaid bursaries for deferred trainees will be recorded on the AGR as part of any unspent balance owing to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and will be passed onto the alternative provider once the trainee resumes their training.</p>

<p>Any deferred funding will be made available to the new provider (where applicable) upon receipt of confirmation that the continuing trainees are on the relevant course and remain eligible to receive the funding. This will be recovered by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> if the trainee subsequently withdraws from the course.</p>

<h2>Withdrawal of accreditation</h2>

<p>This section sets out circumstances that may lead to the withdrawal of accreditation, and the requirements of <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers during this process.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may withdraw accreditation, where the provider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>demonstrates impropriety or inadequate controls in its financial management, or does not comply with relevant financial reporting or governance requirements</li>
  <li>fails to comply with <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> data and reporting requirements</li>
  <li>fails to adhere to any <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance relating to <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>fails to regulate their volume of trainees in accordance with the current <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> allocation methodology</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Qualified Teacher Status">QTS</abbr> provision is repeatedly of ‘requires improvement’ or lower quality, as judged by Ofsted’s ITE inspection framework</li>
  <li>provision is non-compliant with one or more of the specified <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criteria</li>
  <li>ceases to offer provision</li>
</ul>

<p>In all but the most serious cases, cases in which provision is repeatedly of ‘requires improvement’ or lower quality, and cases in which the provider has ceased to offer provision, the provider will be afforded reasonable opportunity to rectify the problem, preventing consequent consideration of withdrawal of accreditation.</p>

<h3>Ofsted complaint outcome</h3>

<p>Where a provider has submitted a complaint to Ofsted regarding a second judgement received of ‘requires improvement’ or lower, for any one phase of its <abbr title="Qualified Teacher Status">QTS</abbr> provision, withdrawal of accreditation will not commence until any complaint about the judgement has been heard and resolved by Ofsted.</p>

<p>Consecutive less than ‘good’ Ofsted judgements of early years initial teacher training (EYITT) will lead to the removal of allocations for the route.</p>

<h3>Procedures for withdrawal</h3>

<p>Where <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> intends to withdraw accreditation in one of the circumstances above, the provider will be given notice of the proposed withdrawal of accreditation setting out <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s concerns and afforded an opportunity to respond.</p>

<p>Within 10 working days of <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s decision to withdraw accreditation, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will email the provider concerned to inform it of the decision. The provider should acknowledge receipt of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> email within 5 working days.</p>

<p>If the provider intends to request a review, it should follow the procedures set out below.</p>

<p>Where the provider does not request review, the request for review is refused, or the decision is upheld on review, they will be required to submit an <abbr title="ITT provider closure documentation">ITTPCD</abbr> to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to include arrangements for mitigating risks to current trainees within 10 working days of notification of withdrawal of accreditation.</p>

<p>The provider must continue to adhere to their responsibilities set out in the voluntary closure guidance above until their provision has closed.</p>

<h3>Review of a decision to withdraw accreditation</h3>

<p>Where <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> withdraws accreditation in one of the circumstances listed above, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will review a decision to withdraw accreditation on request.</p>

<p>To request a review of decision to withdraw, the provider should send an email containing the reasons for the request. The email should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have the heading ‘Withdrawal of accreditation – Request for review’</li>
  <li>be sent to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> before the end of the 20th working day starting with the working day after the day of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s email notifying withdrawal of accreditation</li>
  <li>be sent to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> <abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ITT.accreditation@education.gov.uk"><abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>.accreditation@education.gov.uk</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Any queries about this process should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ITT.accreditation@education.gov.uk"><abbr title="Initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>.accreditation@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
