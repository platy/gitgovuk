<h2>Summary: testing for day care centre workers</h2>

<h3>About the service</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Weekly PCR testing of all individuals working at open day care centres across England providing essential care</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Day care centre managers should register their centres online (‘self-referral portal’) and applications will be reviewed for eligibility by local authorities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If approved, day care centre managers should order tests every 28 days for workers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tests are delivered for each day care centre worker to the centre, for a 28-day testing cycle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each day care centre worker should be given 4 test kits every 28 days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every 7 days, between Thursday and Sunday, a day care centre worker should take a test, register it online, and return it by post same day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Day care centre workers will receive their results in 2 to 4 days by email and text message (SMS)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Who is eligible</h3>

<p>Day care centres that are run by paid day care staff and deemed critical to be open during lockdown by local authorities. Services must be for adults over 18 and provided within non-residential care settings that support the health and wellbeing of adults. This includes settings such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>purpose-built day centres</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>day centres attached to or part of a care home or supported living</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other buildings in communities specifically used for regular adult day care</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>identifies anyone working in the day care centre who currently has COVID-19 so they are able to self-isolate if their result is positive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>protects those attending services from infection passed to them by day care centre workers who are confirmed positive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How you’re involved</h3>

<h4>Day care centre managers</h4>

<p>You’re a ‘day care centre manager’ if you’re the manager of a day care centre, responsible for a team of day care centre workers or you have been delegated responsibility for testing by your organisation.</p>

<p>Your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>attend a webinar to understand the process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>register your centre on the Self Referral portal and obtain your centre’s unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>order test kits for day care centre workers for every 28-day testing cycle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>communicate your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> to day care centre workers so they can register kits online</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>distribute test kits to day care centre workers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>encourage and support your day care centre workers to complete weekly testing – this must happen between Thursdays and Sundays</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Day care centre workers</h4>

<p>You’re a ‘day care centre worker’ if you’re a worker within a day care centre and you work with adults with vulnerabilities. Workers include full-time, part-time, volunteers, specialists and transport drivers.</p>

<p>Your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>conduct tests weekly between Thursdays and Sundays</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as soon as you have completed your test, register the test kit online through the ‘organisation’ registration route using your day care centre’s <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>return your test kits at a Royal Mail priority post box on the same day that you take the test, at least one hour before collection time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you test positive: self-isolate immediately for 10 days – NHS Test and Trace will be in touch for contact tracing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regardless of your result, continue following all infection prevention and control measures such as wearing personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>), washing your hands and socially distancing where possible</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</h3>

<h4>What a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> is</h4>

<p>NHS Test and Trace assigns all participating organisations a single <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>. Day care centre managers will need to use the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ordering test kits using the <a href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">online order portal</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contacting the national coronavirus contact centre for support by dialling 119</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Day care centre workers will need to use the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for registering completed test kits to make sure they will receive their results using the <a rel="external" href="https://gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" class="govuk-link">organisation registration portal</a>.</p>

<h4>How to receive a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Day care centre managers will need to register their day care centre on the <a rel="external" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">self-referral portal</a> to receive a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for their centre.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>The referral <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> to gain access to the portal is 99915258. Please note this is a referral code that can only be used once. This is not the code used to order your test kits.</p>
</div>

<p>Your application will be reviewed to ensure eligibility. Once accepted on our system, day care centre managers will receive their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> via the email address they enter into the self-referral portal. Please make sure that the person who receives these emails understands the importance of this message and knows who to contact.</p>

<p>Organisations which run multiple day care centres at various locations will need to register each centre separately and receive multiple <abbr title="unique organisation numbers">UONs</abbr>, even if the contact details for each of these are the same.</p>

<h2>End-to-end process: day care centre managers</h2>

<h3>Register centre on the self-referral portal</h3>

<p>The day care centre manager is responsible for registering the day care centre on the GOV.UK <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">self-referral portal</a>.</p>

<p>To sign up, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>enter referral <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> (99915258)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>select ‘adult day care centre’</p>
  </li>
  <li>enter your organisation details including the local authority of the centre:
    <ul>
      <li>number of staff: include all workers (full and part-time staff, volunteers, specialists, transport drivers)</li>
      <li>number of non-staff: enter the estimated number of people who attend your centre monthly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter primary contact details</p>
  </li>
  <li>enter applicant details (this is the person who will receive a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your application is now submitted. Please wait 7 to 10 working days for your request to be reviewed. You will receive an email containing your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> once accepted.</p>

<h3>Ordering test kits</h3>

<p>The day care manager is responsible for ordering test kits for the day care centre workers in the team. Each day care manager must order test kits using the online order portal.</p>

<p>In order to apply you will need your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> and the total number of day care centre workers for testing.</p>

<p>When ordering you will be asked to enter the number of non-staff. Enter the estimated number of people who attend your centre monthly. This will not impact the number of test kits you are sent as we are only sending kits to your staff, but this information is useful for our records.</p>

<h3>After test kits have been ordered</h3>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmatory email from organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk.</p>

<p>Test kits will be delivered in boxes of 40 to the registered address of your day care centre. The day care manager is responsible for taking delivery of the test kits.</p>

<p>The day care manager must then order kits every 28 days for their day care centre workers. If you have any issues ordering test kits, please call 119.</p>

<h3>Communicating to your day care centre workers</h3>

<p>The day care centre manager is responsible for communicating key information that day care centre workers will need to successfully conduct testing. We encourage day care centre managers to use existing communication channels that are best suited to your team.</p>

<p>The activities which need to take place are:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Communication</th>
      <th scope="col">When to do this</th>
      <th scope="col">Recommended form of communication</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Share your location’s <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> with day care centre workers in the team</td>
      <td>Before test kits are delivered, day care centre workers will need the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> to register their kits</td>
      <td>Send an email to all day care centre workers including the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Make the team aware of the process</td>
      <td>Before the test kits are delivered</td>
      <td>Email relevant links to the team</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Share all relevant support materials</td>
      <td>Before testing begins</td>
      <td>Email relevant links to the team</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Inform the team that the kits have arrived, and distribute them or arrange collections</td>
      <td>As soon as the kits are delivered</td>
      <td>Most appropriate channel for your team (for example, Microsoft Teams channel)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Distributing test kits</h3>

<p>Once the kits are delivered to the registered address, it is the day care manager’s responsibility to distribute them to day care centre workers.</p>

<p>The day care manager should inform their team that the kits have arrived. They can either distribute the kits, or advise carers to collect 4 test kits each as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You will know best how to handle the distribution process for your team but below are some suggestions used by other organisations who receive test kits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>day care centre workers can pick up kits during their shifts or at the same time they pick up other materials (for example, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>day care managers or supervisors can hand out the kits to the group at daily or weekly meetings</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ensure each day care centre worker receives 4 kits every 28 days so that weekly testing can continue without interruption.</p>

<p>Each test kit should include a pink individual Royal Mail return label. Please check that there is one in each bag provided.</p>

<h3>Encouraging participation</h3>

<p>In order to protect your day care centre workers and the people they support, it is important that day care centre workers are encouraged to complete the end-to-end weekly process of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>completing the test between a Thursday and Sunday of each week</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>registering the test online</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>returning the test through a priority post box</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Below are some ideas that we have seen work well to encourage participation for day care centre workers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>digital tracker (for example, Microsoft Teams) so day care centre workers can confirm they have tested each week</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a physical tracker (for example, a matrix on a team notice board with stickers for completed tests)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>text or WhatsApp group message reminders to test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sending Microsoft Outlook invite placeholders to remind team members to test</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>End-to-end process: day care centre workers</h2>

<h3>Collecting or receiving test kits</h3>

<p>The day care centre manager will inform day care centre workers when test kits arrive and how they can be collected or distributed.</p>

<p>Each day care centre worker should take 4 test kits: one for each of the 4 weekly testing cycles. Please ensure you have postage labels for each test.</p>

<h4>Prepare for testing by reviewing available guidance</h4>

<p>Before testing be sure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>read this guidance (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-day-care-centre-workers" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing for adult day care centre workers</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>watch our <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1427241&amp;tp_key=a845a50900">webinars that review the end-to-end testing process</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>read the instructions included in your test kit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>watch the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-taking-swab-samples/how-to-use-the-self-swabbing-kit-for-a-combined-throat-and-nose-swab-video" class="govuk-link">instructional video for self-swabbing</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a day care centre worker becomes symptomatic and has a kit available at home, they should test themselves in addition to the normal weekly cycle.</p>

<h3>Using the test kits</h3>

<h4>Checking the test kit contents</h4>

<p>The test kits that day care centre workers will receive are standard organisation test kits. Please check for the following contents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>swab, inside sealed wrapper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>plastic tube, containing a small amount of liquid</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>white absorbent pad</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leak-proof bag</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>security seal, for the return box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>return box with pre-paid Royal Mail return label</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to take the test</h4>

<p>You will conduct a combined throat and nose self-swab for the test.</p>

<p>Each test kit comes with step-by-step instructions on how to complete the swab on yourself, along with videos for support.</p>

<h4>When to take the test</h4>

<p>You should only conduct your test between Thursdays and Sundays. Our labs are quieter on these days so results come back on average 30% faster.</p>

<p>Always leave 7 days between tests where possible.</p>

<p>If possible please continue testing while on holiday or off work due to illness which is not related to coronavirus.</p>

<h3>Registering test kits</h3>

<p>You need to register your test every time that you complete one. Follow the <a href="#step-by-step-guidance" class="govuk-link">step-by-step instructions in your test kit</a> below to register your test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>navigate to the <a href="http://www.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" class="govuk-link">organisation registration portal</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> of your day care centre, provided from your day care centre manager</p>
  </li>
  <li>enter your personal details
    <ul>
      <li>name</li>
      <li>service user or staff member (enter ‘staff’)</li>
      <li>whether you have symptoms or not</li>
      <li>gender</li>
      <li>date of birth</li>
      <li>email address (for results)</li>
      <li>phone number (for results)</li>
      <li>home postcode</li>
      <li>NHS number (optional, but important for updating your NHS records)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter the test kit barcode – please enter carefully and do not copy and paste</p>
  </li>
  <li>once you complete the form, you will receive an email confirmation of registration</li>
</ul>

<h3>Returning test kits</h3>

<p>Each test kit contains a pink pre-paid return label. Please attach this to the outside of the delivery packaging next to the security seal. If there is no label in the kit please check in the box that the kits were delivered in. If additional support is needed please call 119.</p>

<p>The test kit should be returned via a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.royalmail.com/priority-postboxes">Royal Mail priority box</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you#/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Find your nearest priority post box and its collection times</a></p>

<p>Only use a Royal Mail priority post box. It will be labelled with the ‘priority box’ sign and one of the regional NHS logos. Please do not enter any Post Office with the kit.</p>

<h3>Key points for returning test kits correctly:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>post the kits in the priority mail box at least one hour before the last collection time to ensure that it is not missed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>locate your nearest priority post box and collection times in before taking the test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tests should be posted on the same day as they are taken</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some post boxes do not collect post on Sundays – check if there is a collection available before testing on Sunday</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Receiving results</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Day care centre workers should inform the centre manage of a positive result immediately so that they can protect other individuals that the day care centre worker may have come into contact with at work.</p>
</div>

<p>The person tested will receive their results via:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>email</p>

<p>The results will also include guidance on next steps for the person tested.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/what-your-test-result-means/">See guidance from the NHS about what to do when you get your results</a></p>

<h3>What to do if a test comes back positive or negative</h3>

<h4>Positive result</h4>

<p>Anyone with a positive result needs to inform their manager of a positive result and self-isolate for 10 days from the first day of symptoms. Workers with symptoms should not come into the day care centre and workers without symptoms can return to work on day 11.</p>

<p>If you have one or more positive cases in your centre, please contact your local health protection team immediately who will provide further advice going forward</p>

<p>You must have written consent from the individual if you plan to have results returned to a different person.</p>

<p>If a worker has tested positive, they do not need to test again for 90 days unless they develop symptoms.</p>

<p>Workers who are symptomatic should be off work and should be tested through the home testing channel. They will be able to return to work after isolating when well and test through this programme.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to inform your GP and local public health authority of a positive result.</p>

<h4>Negative result</h4>

<p>Anyone with a negative result can continue working. If symptoms develop, retesting may be appropriate using the surplus test kits you have been provided with.</p>

<h3>Weekly retesting</h3>

<p>After you have completed your first round of testing, day care centre workers should continue to test on the same day each week between Thursday and Sunday. If you have tested positive, you do not need to retest for 90 days.</p>
