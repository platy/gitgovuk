<h2>Summary: testing for day care centre workers</h2>

<p>Regular testing is available for all individuals attending or working at adult day care centres that are open across England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff should test daily using rapid lateral flow testing (<abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>) on the days that they are working, before their shift begins</li>
  <li>service users that are able to test, should test twice-weekly with <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> 3 to 4 days apart – if a service user is only visiting once a week, they only need to test on that day (testing can be completed at-home or on-site)</li>
  <li>centres must be signed up via <a rel="external" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">self-referral portal</a> to gain access to testing</li>
  <li>once centres are approved on the UKHSA system, managers can order test kits every 21 days for their workers and service users</li>
  <li>adult day care centres can use a multiple-registrations spreadsheet (bulk upload). The spreadsheet will let you register multiple <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> at the same time</li>
  <li>read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users">guidance and download the multiple registration spreadsheet</a> to record the details of people you’ve tested for COVID-19 on that day</li>
  <li>this is an additional option and organisations can still upload their testing data using the self-registration/reporting route</li>
</ul>

<h3>Which adult day care centres are eligible</h3>

<p>Testing is recommended for  all open day care centres that are run by paid care staff. Services must be for adults over 18 and are provided within non-residential care settings that support the health and wellbeing of adults. This includes settings such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>purpose-built day centres</li>
  <li>day centres attached to or part of a care home or supported living</li>
  <li>other buildings in communities specifically used for regular adult day care</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why testing and reporting is important</h3>

<p>Testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifies anyone working at or attending the day care centre who currently has COVID-19 so they are able to self-isolate if their result is positive</li>
  <li>reduces the risk of individuals contracting the virus from those who provide care and support</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing within 90 days of a positive result</h2>

<p>If an individual has  tested positive with a <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, the testing they undertake in the following 90 days may be different. Full guidance on what testing an individual should do within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result can be found in the management of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">exposed healthcare workers and residents guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>How you are involved</h3>

<h4>Adult day care centre managers</h4>

<p>You are an ‘adult day care centre manager’ if you’re the manager of a day care centre or you have been delegated responsibility for testing by your organisation.</p>

<p>Your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you haven’t already, register your centre for testing via the <a href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">self-referral portal</a> and obtain your centre’s unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</li>
  <li>once accepted on our system, order test kits for your day care centre workers and service users every 21 days</li>
  <li>communicate your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> to all individuals who will test so they can register kits online</li>
  <li>distribute or arrange the collection of test kits to day care centre workers and service users</li>
  <li>ensure all staff and visitors report their results – they can do this themselves online or by organisations who can use the multiple registrations spread sheet (bulk upload)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adult day care centre workers</h4>

<p>You are an ‘adult day care centre worker’ if you’re a worker within a day care centre. Workers include full-time, part-time, volunteers, specialists, and transport drivers.</p>

<p>Your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collect kits and conduct daily <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> when you are working and before the start of your shift</li>
  <li>report test results the same day, using your day care centre’s unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</li>
  <li>if you test positive: self-isolate immediately and inform your manager</li>
  <li>regardless of your result, continue following all <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures such as wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, washing your hands, and socially distancing where possible</li>
</ul>

<h4>Service users</h4>

<p>Service users are people who attend the adult day care centre.</p>

<p>For service users who are able to test,  it is recommended to test twice each week, with 3 to 4 days in between, using a rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> either at home or on-site, at the discretion of the day care centre managers.</p>

<p>If the service user is only attending once or twice a week, they only need to test on the day of their visits.</p>

<p>If testing at home, take rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits home and conduct and register tests up to twice weekly at home.</p>

<p>Service users should ideally test before attending the centre if travelling by shared or public transport.</p>

<p>If testing on-site, service users do not need to take any test kits home with them as they will be tested on arrival.</p>

<p>Testing should not be mandatory for service users and they should not be prevented from attending. However, if someone tests positive, they should self-isolate immediately and not attend.</p>

<h4>Carers or parents</h4>

<p>Carers or parents of service users who are supporting testing should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the testing service and process for service users by reading this guidance and detailed instructions provided with the test kits, and watching the training videos</li>
  <li>assist in testing the service user with rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits</li>
  <li>assist with registering the result online on behalf of the service user</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</h3>

<h4>What is a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</h4>

<p>NHS Test and Trace assigns all participating organisations a single <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>. Day care centre managers will need to use the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ordering test kits using the <a href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">online order portal</a>
</li>
  <li>contacting the national COVID-19 contact centre for support by dialling 119</li>
</ul>

<p>Day care centre workers and service users will need to use the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for reporting <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results.</p>

<h4>How to get a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Day care centre managers will need to register their day care centre on the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">self-referral portal</a> to receive a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for their centre.</p>

<p>The referral <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> to gain access to the portal is 99915258. This referral code that can only be used once. This is not the code used to order test kits.</p>

<p>Your application will be reviewed to ensure eligibility. Once accepted on the system, day care centre managers will receive their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> via the email address they enter into the <a rel="external" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">self-referral portal</a>. Please make sure that the person who receives these emails understands the importance of this message and knows who to contact.</p>

<p>Organisations which run multiple day care centres at various locations will need to register each centre separately and receive multiple <abbr title="unique organisation numbers">UONs</abbr>, even if the contact details for each of these are the same.</p>

<h2>Step-by-step guide: day care centre managers</h2>

<h3>Register centre on the self-referral portal</h3>

<p>The day care centre manager is responsible for registering the day care centre on the GOV.UK <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">self-referral portal</a>.</p>

<p>To sign up, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>enter referral <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> (99915258)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>select ‘adult day care centre’</p>
  </li>
  <li>enter your organisation details including the local authority of the centre:
    <ul>
      <li>number of staff: include all workers (such as full and part-time staff, volunteers, specialists, transport drivers)</li>
      <li>number of non-staff: the number of people who attend your centre (service users)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>enter primary contact details</li>
  <li>enter applicant details (this is the person who will receive a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your application will then be submitted. Please wait 7 to 10 working days for your request to be reviewed. You will receive an email containing your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> once accepted.</p>

<h3>Order test kits</h3>

<p>The day care manager is responsible for ordering test kits for the day care centre workers and the service users. Each day care manager must order test kits using the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">online order portal</a>.</p>

<p>To order, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enter your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> (not the referral <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</li>
  <li>enter total number of staff for testing (such as full-time, part-time, volunteers, specialists, private transport drivers)</li>
  <li>enter total number of non-staff for testing (service users)</li>
</ul>

<h4>After test kits have been ordered</h4>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmatory email from <a href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You will receive another confirmation email when kits have been dispatched, including a delivery date.</p>

<p>The day care centre manager should then order kits every 21 days for their day care centre workers and service users. If you have any issues ordering test kits, please call 119.</p>

<h3>Receiving kits and preparing to test</h3>

<p>Once test kits are delivered, managers should inform staff, service users and carers or parents that kits have arrived and either arrange for them to be distributed or collected.</p>

<p>We recommend storing them as detailed in the information leaflet, in a single location where all individuals can pick them up.</p>

<p>Make sure that each individual testing at home picks up a month’s worth of tests:</p>

<p>It is the day care centre manager’s responsibility to maintain records of the kits that are distributed outside of the centre, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the LOT number, which is on the box of  <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the name and details of each worker or service user receiving the box</li>
  <li>date or receipt they picked up the box</li>
  <li>name of the testing coordinator distributing the home test kits</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-step guide: day care centre workers and service users</h2>

<h3>Collecting or receiving test kits</h3>

<p>The day care centre manager will inform day care centre workers, service users and carers or parents when test kits arrive and how they can be collected or distributed. Each person should take a month’s worth of tests.</p>

<h3>Prepare for testing by reviewing available guidance</h3>

<p>Before testing be sure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the guidance documents on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) testing for adult social care settings</a> page</li>
  <li>read the instructions included in your test kit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the test kits</h3>

<h4>Checking the test kit contents</h4>

<p>Every 21 days, managers can order <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>, each of which should contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>swab, inside sealed wrapper</li>
  <li>test strip (lateral flow device)</li>
  <li>tube holder</li>
  <li>extraction tube</li>
  <li>sachet of extraction solution</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to take a rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> (staff and service users)</h3>

<p>Service users that are able to test, should test with rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> twice a week. Staff should test daily before every shift they work. Testing should ideally occur at home before coming to the centre. As self-testing at home may not be suitable for service users, we will provide more details to follow on assisted testing and options for testing on-site.</p>

<p>Each test kit comes with step-by-step instructions on how to complete the swab on yourself, along with videos for support.</p>

<p>Unlike <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, you will process and analyse the sample within 30 minutes. Once the result is ready, you must report your result online then dispose of the kit as detailed in the information leaflet.</p>

<p>Please note there are different types of <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> with differing instructions, further guidance, can be found here and please <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-self-test-help" class="govuk-link">read the instructions that come with the test carefully</a>.</p>

<h4>Key differences between assisted-testing and self-testing</h4>

<p>Self-testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individual completes their own swab and processes their own test</li>
  <li>individual also interprets their own result so they are the first to know result</li>
  <li>individual reports their result online using the centre’s <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>, and to the centre</li>
  <li>this method ensures someone will test before getting on transport and arriving at the centre</li>
</ul>

<p>Assisted testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can be performed by carer, parent, or staff member</li>
  <li>the person assisting with the test needs consent to conduct a test on another individual</li>
  <li>assisting person swabs, processes test and interprets result</li>
  <li>assisting person reports result on behalf of the individual. The result must be reported online using the centre’s <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>, as well as to the centre if performed at home</li>
  <li>this method can be performed at home and must be performed if testing is done on-site</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting test kit results</h3>

<h4>Reporting multiple results at once</h4>

<p>You can use the record-keeping multiple registration spreadsheet. This will let you register both <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits and rapid lateral flow tests at the same time.</p>

<p>Ensure you only use the most recent version of the multiple upload spreadsheet to register COVID-19 test results for your organisation.</p>

<p>You can register up to 100 tests on the spreadsheet. You’ll need to complete separate spreadsheets for staff and non-staff.</p>

<p>You will need to read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users">guidance and download the multiple registration spreadsheet</a> to record the details of people you’ve tested for  COVID-19 on that day.</p>

<p>Staff and visitors can continue to report their results themselves online should they wish to.</p>

<p>All results must be reported.</p>

<p>Providers do not need to retain records of proof of registrations.</p>

<h4>For rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> registration</h4>

<p>Every test result needs to be reported online for NHS Test and Trace tracking purposes (positive, negative, and invalid or void):</p>

<ul>
  <li>navigate to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result registration</a> website</li>
  <li>select that you are testing for a ‘social care service’</li>
  <li>enter the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> of your day care centre</li>
  <li>enter personal details</li>
  <li>enter or scan your test strip ID number and the test result</li>
</ul>

<p>If workers or service users report their own results online:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they will need to select that they are testing for a ‘social care service’</li>
  <li>they will need to enter the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> of the centre</li>
</ul>

<h4>Digital Reader</h4>

<p>You can now use the Digital Reader for reading <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results via the self-report journey. For detailed information, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://khub.net/documents/135939561/338928724/COVID-19+%E2%80%93+Digital+reader+guide.pdf/0ea2af24-3600-0224-af23-8b5bf719a7ea?t=1642782196189">visit this link to download the Digital Reader guidebook</a>.</p>

<p>If individuals cannot report their own result online:</p>

<ul>
  <li>results can be registered on the individual’s behalf</li>
  <li>the person registering on behalf of the individual will need all test results and test strip ID numbers so that they can report results on their behalf</li>
  <li>make sure that you delete or destroy any forms containing the tested person’s personal details as soon as you complete the online registration</li>
</ul>

<h4>Users without digital access</h4>

<p>If any individual cannot complete the online form, they can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>call 119 and select option 1</li>
  <li>have you or someone else register on their behalf</li>
</ul>

<h3>Receiving results</h3>

<h4>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results</h4>

<p>You will receive <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results immediately, within 30 minutes after the sample is processed.</p>

<p>After the result is complete, report the result online (including negative and void results). Results should also be shared with the day care centre manager.</p>

<p>Result lines may appear smudged or faint, but they are still valid results and must be reported.</p>

<p>Once your test is complete, put all of the used test kit contents in your general household waste if testing at home.</p>

<h3>Positive results</h3>

<p>If any worker or service user tests positive, they should not come into the centre. They should also inform the day care centre manager.</p>

<p>If you have tested positive with an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, the testing you undertake in the following 90 days may be different. Full guidance on what testing you should do within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">management of staff guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you have one or more positive cases in your centre, please contact your local health protection team immediately who will provide further advice for the future.</p>

<p>You must have consent from the individual if you plan to have results returned to a different person.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to inform your local health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>) of a positive result.</p>

<h4>If a service user tests positive on-site</h4>

<p>They should wear a mask if possible and should return home immediately. Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">self-isolation is available</a>.</p>

<p>If possible, the service user should return home using private transport. Please follow your usual process for arranging transport if a service user becomes symptomatic on site.</p>

<h3>Negative results</h3>

<p>Staff members who receive a negative result and remain without symptoms can continue working.</p>

<p>Service users who receive a negative result and remain without symptoms can attend the centre.</p>

<p>A symptomatic individual who tests negative for COVID-19 may have another infectious illness like flu. Therefore, action may still be needed to limit transmission including using appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> when working with symptomatic people receiving care and isolation while the individual is unwell.</p>

<p>If you believe 2 or more symptomatic cases may be linked, accompanied by negative COVID-19 tests, you should contact your local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>. They will advise whether any further action or additional testing (including flu testing) is needed.</p>

<h3>Void or invalid results</h3>

<p>The worker or service user will need to re-test using another kit to receive a conclusive result. If that is also void, they can keep attending the centre and take an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> the following day (or the next time they arrive at the centre).</p>

<h2>Service users testing process: further information</h2>

<p>Based on your centre’s workforce capacity, the needs of your service users, and a risk assessment by your team that considers factors like shared transport, you have the flexibility to implement either testing model at your discretion, on a case by case basis.</p>

<h3>Support needed for testing at home</h3>

<h4>Managers should:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>communicate the at-home testing process to service users, carers, or parents before they collect test kits</li>
  <li>distribute kits for service users, carers, or parents to safely take them home</li>
  <li>share additional guidance with service users, carers, or parents such as online videos and this webinar pack</li>
  <li>ensure parents or carers have consent to test, interpret, and report results</li>
  <li>work out how results will be reported from home testers (either providing the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> to carers or obtaining each test result and test strip ID number from them)</li>
</ul>

<p>One option could be to create a results tracking spreadsheet to keep track of all test results, test strip ID numbers and personal details to record each result online.</p>

<h4>Service users, carers, or parents</h4>

<p>Prepare for testing by reading guidance and the detailed printed instructions in the kit and watch instructional videos.</p>

<p>If able to test the service user should be tested up to twice weekly, 3 to 4 days apart. The service user can self-test or receive assisted swabbing.</p>

<p>If they are attending only once a week, they should test on the day they attend. If attending twice a week, test on the 2 days of attendance.</p>

<p>All results should be reported online. Results can be reported by the service user or the carer or parent on behalf of the service user. Alternatively, the test strip ID and result can be shared with the manager to report on behalf of the service user.</p>

<h3>Support needed for testing on site</h3>

<h4>Testing area requirements</h4>

<p>A designated area where users can test while socially distancing from others and await results while adhering to infection control measures</p>

<p>Ideally, the area has a separate entrance from the rest of the centre and hard, non-porous flooring</p>

<p>Area should have a mirror, timer, hand sanitiser, cleaning equipment and waste bins.</p>

<p>Staff can keep a record of which device matches which individual’s result.</p>

<h4>Other key considerations</h4>

<ul>
  <li>consent – obtaining consent from all service users to be tested in line with your normal policies and procedures. You can modify any current consent forms you already have</li>
  <li>staff training – make sure that all staff who will assist with swabbing are briefed on the process for testing on-site</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> – please ensure that you have enough <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for staff to wear while they are conducting testing (face mask, gloves, apron). To order more <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, please contact your local authority</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional guidance for managers</h2>

<h3>Share your unique <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> with your centre</h3>

<p><abbr title="unique organisation numbers">UONs</abbr> are needed to  report lateral flow results and order more test kits. Make sure you share your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> with all staff and service users, carers and parents that will test.</p>

<h3>Tracking test kit LOT numbers and distribution</h3>

<p>Please ensure to maintain records of the kits that are distributed outside of the centre, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the LOT number, which can be located on the box of 7 rapid <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the name and details of each staff member or service user receiving the box</li>
  <li>date or receipt they picked up the box</li>
  <li>name of the testing coordinator distributing the home test kits</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data privacy notice</h4>

<p>Managers should download our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings/cornavirus-covid-19-self-test-for-staff-service-users-and-visitors-in-adult-social-care-settings-privacy-notice">data privacy notice</a> and make this available on display in your centre.</p>

<p>Please edit the details in this document to include your organisation name and make this available to read by staff and service users in your centre.</p>

<h3>Preparing staff</h3>

<p>We recommend that managers read through all guidance then practice a first use with staff (either virtually or on site) with both test kits to ensure proper use.</p>

<p>If staff will test service users on site, we recommend that managers conduct an additional risk assessment and review our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings/on-site-testing-for-adult-social-care-services-rapid-lateral-flow-test-guide">on-site testing guidance</a> with staff to prepare for testing in your centre.</p>

<h3>Preparing service users, carers, and parents</h3>

<p>We recommend managers write and share a letter with service users, carers and parents overviewing this testing process and asking for written consent for testing (in line with your existing consent processes).</p>

<h3>Tracking results</h3>

<p>You will not automatically receive a copy of test results conducted at home. In order to receive positive results, you must request this information from staff and service users, carers, or parents directly. We recommend trialling out a system to share results with you. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a shared Gmail account</li>
  <li>a shared google docs spreadsheet</li>
  <li>WhatsApp group</li>
  <li>nominated contact of your team</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have set up a system for results to be shared, make sure all individuals are aware of the expectations for sharing their results before they begin testing.</p>

<h3>Ordering <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and consulting the Infection Control Fund (<abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Please contact your local authority to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>order more <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>secure infection control funding to mitigate the additional costs of lateral flow testing (including staff training time, supporting materials, testing and site equipment, and so on)</li>
</ul>
