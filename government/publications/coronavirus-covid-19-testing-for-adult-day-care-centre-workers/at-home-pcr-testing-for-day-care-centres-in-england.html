<h2>Summary: testing for day care centre workers</h2>

<h3>About the service</h3>

<p>Regular testing is available for all individuals attending or working at adult day care centres that are open across England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff should test using polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) testing once per week and rapid lateral flow testing (<abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>) 3 times a week</li>
  <li>service users that are able to test, should test twice-weekly with <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> 3 to 4 days apart – if a service user is only visiting once a week, they only need to test on that day (testing can be completed at-home or on-site)</li>
  <li>centres must be signed up via <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">self-referral portal</a> to gain access to testing</li>
  <li>
    <p>once centres are approved on the UKHSA system, managers can order test kits every 10 days for their workers and service users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>from 1 July adult day care centres can use a multiple-registrations spreadsheet (bulk upload). The spreadsheet will let you register both <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits and rapid lateral flow tests at the same time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users" class="govuk-link">guidance and download the multiple registration spreadsheet</a> to record the details of people you’ve tested for coronavirus on that day</p>
  </li>
  <li>this is an additional option and organisations can still upload their testing data using the self-registration / reporting route</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who is eligible</h3>

<p>Testing is available to all open day care centres that are run by paid care staff. Services must be for adults over 18 and are provided within non-residential care settings that support the health and wellbeing of adults. This includes settings such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>purpose-built day centres</li>
  <li>day centres attached to or part of a care home or supported living</li>
  <li>other buildings in communities specifically used for regular adult day care</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifies anyone working at or attending the day care centre who currently has COVID-19 so they are able to self-isolate if their result is positive</li>
  <li>provides reassurance and enables continued working and attendance for those who test negative</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing within 90 days of a positive result</h2>

<p>If you have tested positive with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, the testing you undertake in the following 90 days may be different. Full guidance on what testing you should do within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result can be found in the management of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">exposed healthcare workers and residents guidance</a>.</p>

<p>This 90 day period is from the initial onset of symptoms or, if asymptomatic when tested, their positive test result. Individuals should use evidence of their positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test to show they are currently exempt from asymptomatic testing.</p>

<h3>How you’re involved</h3>

<h4>Adult day care centre managers</h4>

<p>You’re an ‘adult day care centre manager’ if you’re the manager of a day care centre or you have been delegated responsibility for testing by your organisation.</p>

<p>Your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attend a webinar to understand the process and prepare all individuals for testing</li>
  <li>if you haven’t already, register your centre for testing via the <a href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">self-referral portal</a> and obtain your centre’s unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</li>
  <li>once accepted on our system, order test kits for your day care centre workers and service users every 21 days</li>
  <li>communicate your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> to all individuals who will test so they can register kits online</li>
  <li>
    <p>distribute or arrange the collection of test kits to day care centre workers and service users</p>
  </li>
  <li>ensure all staff and visitors report their results – they can do this themselves online or by organisations who can use the multiple registrations spread sheet (bulk upload)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adult day care centre workers</h4>

<p>You’re an ‘adult day care centre worker’ if you’re a worker within a day care centre. Workers include full-time, part-time, volunteers, specialists and transport drivers.</p>

<p>Your key responsibilities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collect kits and conduct weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests and rapid <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> 3 times a week
    <ul>
      <li>one rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> should be completed on the same day as the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
      <li>and additional <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> every 2 to 3 days after</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>register tests the same day, using your day care centre’s unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</li>
  <li>return <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits only by post</li>
  <li>if you test positive: self-isolate immediately and inform your manager</li>
  <li>if your positive result was from a rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>, take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test immediately – NHS Test and Trace will be in touch for contact tracing, if appropriate</li>
  <li>regardless of your result, continue following all <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures such as wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, washing your hands and socially distancing where possible</li>
</ul>

<h4>Service users</h4>

<p>Service users are people who attend the adult day care centre.</p>

<p>For service users who are able to test, we recommend testing twice each week, with 3 to 4 days in between, using a rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> either at home or on-site, at the discretion of the day care centre managers.</p>

<p>If the service user is only attending once or twice a week, they only need to test on the day of their visits.</p>

<p>If testing at home, take rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits home and conduct and register tests up to twice weekly at home.</p>

<p>Service users should ideally test before attending the centre if travelling by shared or public transport.</p>

<p>If testing on-site, service users do not need to take any test kits home with them as they will be tested on arrival.</p>

<p>Testing should not be mandatory for service users and they should not be prevented from attending. However, if someone tests positive, they should self-isolate immediately and not attend.</p>

<h4>Carers or parents</h4>

<p>Carers or parents of service users who are supporting testing should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the testing service and process for service users by reading our online guidance and detailed instructions provided with the test kits, and watching our videos</li>
  <li>assist in testing the service user with rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits</li>
  <li>assist with registering the result online on behalf of the service user</li>
</ul>

<h2>How the service works</h2>

<p>This section provides an overview of the testing journey. Further detail about each step is provided in the sections below.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Day care centre manager identifies the number of day care centre workers and service users for testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Day care centre manager registers the eligible centre on the <a rel="external" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">self-referral portal</a> for local authority (LA) approval</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once accepted, day care centre manager receives <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> via email</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Day care centre manager shares <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> with all individuals who will take tests</p>

<h3>Differences between <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>should be completed and registered 3 times each week by staff and twice a week by service users</li>
  <li>regular test kits that are sent to a lab that staff have been using for regular testing over the past couple of months</li>
  <li>results are returned to you within 2 to 3 days after registering and returning</li>
  <li>all tests must be <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.uk/register-organisation-tests">registered online</a> in order to receive a result</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rapid Antigen LFD test kits:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>should be completed and registered 3 times each week by staff and service users</li>
  <li>give rapid results and assurance within 30 minutes</li>
  <li>test samples do not need to be sent to a lab to be processed</li>
  <li>all <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results must be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">registered online</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90z38CxYHgk" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Watch a video on the benefits of rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr></a></p>

<h3>Lateral flow testing regime</h3>

<h4>For staff</h4>

<p>We advise that workers take 3 rapid <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> and one <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test each week, ideally before starting their work shift:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> on the same day as the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test (Thursday to Sunday)</li>
  <li>and additional <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> every 2 to 3 days after</li>
</ul>

<h4>For service users</h4>

<p>Service users can still visit the centres if they have not tested. Testing is not mandatory.</p>

<p>We recommend for service users who are able to test, to test twice each week with 3 to 4 days in between using rapid LFD only.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if they are attending twice a week, test on the days of attendance. If they are attending once a week, they only need to test once in the week. These should ideally be on the day prior to attending the centre</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>testing can be completed either at home or on-site at the discretion of the day care centre manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>service users can also self-test or receive assisted swabbing</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone tests positive, they will need to undertake a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and then self-isolate at home immediately until they receive their result.</p>

<h3>Unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</h3>

<h4>What a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> is</h4>

<p>NHS Test and Trace assigns all participating organisations a single <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>. Day care centre managers will need to use the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ordering test kits using the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">online order portal</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contacting the national coronavirus contact centre for support by dialling 119</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Day care centre workers and service users will need to use the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for registering completed test kits to make sure they will receive their results.</p>

<h4>How to receive a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Day care centre managers will need to register their day care centre on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">self-referral portal</a> to receive a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> for their centre.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>The referral UON to gain access to the portal is 99915258. Please note this is a referral code that can only be used once. This is not the code used to order your test kits.</p>
</div>

<p>Your application will be reviewed to ensure eligibility. Once accepted on our system, day care centre managers will receive their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> via the email address they enter into the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">self-referral portal</a>. Please make sure that the person who receives these emails understands the importance of this message and knows who to contact.</p>

<p>Organisations which run multiple day care centres at various locations will need to register each centre separately and receive multiple <abbr title="unique organisation numbers">UONs</abbr>, even if the contact details for each of these are the same.</p>

<h2>End-to-end process: day care centre managers</h2>

<h3>Register centre on the self-referral portal</h3>

<p>The day care centre manager is responsible for registering the day care centre on the GOV.UK <a href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">self-referral portal</a>.</p>

<p>To sign up, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>enter referral <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> (99915258)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>select ‘adult day care centre’</p>
  </li>
  <li>enter your organisation details including the local authority of the centre:
    <ul>
      <li>number of staff: include all workers (such as full and part-time staff, volunteers, specialists, transport drivers)</li>
      <li>number of non-staff: the number of people who attend your centre (service users)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter primary contact details</p>
  </li>
  <li>enter applicant details (this is the person who will receive a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your application will then be submitted. Please wait 7 to 10 working days for your request to be reviewed. You will receive an email containing your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> once accepted.</p>

<h3>Order test kits</h3>

<p>The day care manager is responsible for ordering test kits for the day care centre workers and the service users. Each day care manager must order test kits using the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">online order portal</a>.</p>

<p>To order, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>enter your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> (not the referral <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>select the test kit option you want to order – <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or rapid lateral flow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter total number of staff for testing (such as full-time, part-time, volunteers, specialists, private transport drivers)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter total number of non-staff for testing (service users)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>After test kits have been ordered</h4>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmatory email from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You will receive another confirmation email when kits have been dispatched, including a delivery date.</p>

<p>The day care centre manager should then order kits every 10 days for their day care centre workers and service users. If you have any issues ordering test kits, please call 119.</p>

<h3>Receiving kits and preparing to test</h3>

<p>Once test kits are delivered, managers should inform staff, service users and carers or parents that kits have arrived and either arrange for them to be distributed or collected.</p>

<p>We recommend storing them in a single location where all individuals can pick them up.</p>

<p>Make sure that each individual testing at home picks up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 boxes of 7 rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits and one confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kit (if available)</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure every member of staff also picks up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests (one test each week to last a month)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is the day care centre manager’s responsibility to maintain records of the kits that are distributed outside of the centre, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the LOT number, which is on the box of 7 rapid lateral flow tests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the name and details of each worker or service user receiving the box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>date or receipt they picked up the box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>name of the testing coordinator distributing the home test kits</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>End-to-end process: day care centre workers and service users</h2>

<h3>Collecting or receiving test kits</h3>

<p>The day care centre manager will inform day care centre workers, service users and carers or parents when test kits arrive and how they can be collected or distributed.</p>

<p>Each day care centre worker should take:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits: one for each of the 4 weekly testing cycles. Please ensure you have postage labels for each test</li>
  <li>2 boxes of 7 rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits and one confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kit (if available)</li>
</ul>

<p>If service users are testing at home, the manager should coordinate getting kits to the service users and carers or parents. Service users should take:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 boxes of 7 rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits and one confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kit (if available)</li>
</ul>

<p>Postage labels are only needed for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests.</p>

<h3>Prepare for testing by reviewing available guidance</h3>

<p>Before testing be sure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>read the guidance documents on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) testing for adult social care settings</a> page</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the test kits</h3>

<h4>Checking the test kit contents</h4>

<p>Every 10 days, managers can order both lateral flow tests and standard organisation tests. Please check for the following contents.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits should contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>swab, inside sealed wrapper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>plastic tube, containing a small amount of liquid</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>white absorbent pad</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leak-proof bag</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>security seal, for the return box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>return box with pre-paid Royal Mail return label</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> test kits should contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>swab, inside sealed wrapper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>test strip (lateral flow device)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tube holder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extraction tube</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sachet of extraction solution</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits</h4>

<p>Each delivery of rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits will also come with a box of confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits, for use in case of a positive lateral flow test result. You can also use any spare <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits in your centre for this purpose.</p>

<p>Where possible, please provide everyone testing at home with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit to be used to confirm a positive <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result. If this is not possible, or you do not have enough <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits, please advise individuals to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">get a free <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> online.</p>

<p>All confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests include a Royal Mail return label that should be returned via a Royal Mail priority post box (in the same way as staff return weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests).</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you" class="govuk-link">Find your nearest Royal Mail priority post box</a></p>

<p>Confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits should be registered via the <a href="https://organisations.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" rel="external" class="govuk-link">organisation registration portal</a>, using your centre’s <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>.</p>

<h3>How to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test (weekly staff testing)</h3>

<p>You will conduct a combined throat and nose self-swab for the test.</p>

<p>Each test kit comes with step-by-step instructions on how to complete the swab on yourself, along with videos for support.</p>

<h4>When to take the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</h4>

<p>Staff should only conduct your weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test between Thursdays and Sundays. Our labs are quieter on these days so results come back on average 30% faster.</p>

<p>Always leave 7 days between tests where possible.</p>

<p>If possible, please continue testing while on holiday or off work due to illness which is not related to coronavirus.</p>

<p>The swab should not cause you to gag and you should stop going up the nose when you feel resistance.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCqo7MhQT6U">How to complete a coronavirus self-test swab</a></p>

<h3>How to take a rapid lateral flow test (staff and service users)</h3>

<p>Service users that are able to test, should test with rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> twice a week. Staff should test three times a week. Testing should ideally occur at home before coming to the centre. As self-testing at home may not be suitable for service users, we will provide more details to follow on assisted testing and options for testing on-site.</p>

<p>Each test kit comes with step-by-step instructions on how to complete the swab on yourself, along with videos for support.</p>

<p>Unlike <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, you will process and analyse the sample  within 30 minutes. Once the result is ready, you must report your result online then dispose of the kit in household waste (more details will follow).</p>

<p>Please note there are different types of <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> with differing instructions, further guidance, can be found here and please <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-self-test-help" class="govuk-link">read the instructions that come with the test carefully</a>.</p>

<h4>Key differences between assisted-testing and self-testing</h4>

<p>Self-testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individual completes their own swab and processes their own test</li>
  <li>individual also interprets their own result so they are the first to know result</li>
  <li>individual reports their result online and to the centre</li>
  <li>this method ensures someone will test before getting on transport and arriving at the centre</li>
</ul>

<p>Assisted testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can be performed by carer, parent or staff member</li>
  <li>the person assisting with the test needs consent to conduct a test on another individual</li>
  <li>assisting person swabs, processes test and interprets result</li>
  <li>assisting person reports result on behalf of the individual. The result must be reported online as well as to the centre if performed at home</li>
  <li>this method can be performed at home and must be performed if testing is done on-site</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registering test kits</h3>

<h4>Registering multiple tests at once</h4>

<p>From 1 July, you can use the new version of the record-keeping multiple registration spreadsheet. The updated spreadsheet will let you register both <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits and rapid lateral flow tests at the same time.</p>

<p>Ensure you only use the most recent version of the multiple upload spreadsheet to register coronavirus tests for your organisation.</p>

<p>You can register up to 100 tests on the spreadsheet. You’ll need to complete separate spreadsheets for staff and non-staff.</p>

<p>You will need to read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users">guidance and download the multiple registration spreadsheet</a> to record the details of people you’ve tested for coronavirus on that day.</p>

<p>Staff and visitors can continue to report their results themselves online should they wish to.</p>

<h4>Self-registration route</h4>

<p>You need to register your test every time that you complete one – for both rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>. Follow the step-by-step instructions in your test kit to register your test.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits must be registered online in order to receive a result. This includes confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> registration</h4>

<ul>
  <li>navigate to the <a href="http://www.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" class="govuk-link">Organisation Registration Portal</a>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>enter the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> of your day care centre, provided from your day care centre manager</p>
  </li>
  <li>enter personal details:
    <ul>
      <li>name</li>
      <li>service user or staff member</li>
      <li>whether you have symptoms or not</li>
      <li>gender</li>
      <li>date of birth</li>

  </li>
  <li>once you complete the form, you will receive an email confirmation of registration and will receive your result in 2 to 3 days</li>
</ul>

<h4>For rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> registration</h4>

<p>Every test result needs to be reported online for NHS Test and Trace tracking purposes (positive, negative and invalid or void):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>navigate to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result"><abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result registration</a> website</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>select that you are testing for a ‘social care service’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> of your day care centre</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter personal details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter or scan your test strip ID number and the test result</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If workers or service users can report their own results online:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they will need to select that they are testing for a ‘social care service’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they will need to enter the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> of the centre</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If individuals cannot report their own result online:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>results can be registered on the individual’s behalf</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the person registering on behalf of the individual will need all test results and test strip ID numbers so that they can report results on their behalf</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure that you delete or destroy any forms containing the tested person’s personal details as soon as you complete the online registration</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Users without digital access</h4>

<p>If any individual cannot complete the online form, they can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>call 119 and select option 1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have you or someone else register on their behalf</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Returning test kits (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests only)</h3>

<p>Each test kit contains a pink pre-paid return label. Please attach this to the outside of the delivery packaging next to the security seal. If there is no label in the kit please check in the box that the kits were delivered in. If additional support is needed please call 119.</p>

<p>The test kit should be returned via a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.royalmail.com/priority-postboxes">Royal Mail priority box</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you#/" class="govuk-link">Find your nearest priority post box and its collection times</a></p>

<p>Only use a Royal Mail priority post box. It will be labelled with the ‘priority box’ sign and one of the regional NHS logos. Please do not enter any Post Office with the kit.</p>

<h4>Key points for returning <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits correctly</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Post the kits in the priority mailbox at least one hour before the last collection time to ensure that it is not missed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Locate your nearest priority post box and collection times before taking the test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tests should be posted on the same day that they are taken</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some post boxes do not collect post on Sundays – check if there is a collection available before testing on a Sunday</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Receiving results</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> results</h4>

<p>You will receive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> results 2 to 3 days after the kit is posted.</p>

<p>You will receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>email</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>text message (if a mobile number was provided at registration)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The results will also include guidance on next steps for the person tested.</p>

<p>If you do not receive your results, please call 119 and select option 1.</p>

<h4>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results</h4>

<p>You will receive rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results immediately, within 30 minutes after the sample is processed.</p>

<p>After the result is complete, please report your result online (including negative and void results). Results should also be shared with the day care centre manager.</p>

<p>Results may not be as clear-cut as the examples shown here. Result lines may appear smudged or faint, but they are still valid results and must be reported.</p>

<p>Once your test is complete, put all of the used test kit contents in your general household waste if testing at home.</p>

<h3>Positive results</h3>

<p>If any worker or service user tests positive, they should not come into the centre and will need to immediately undertake a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and self-isolate until they receive their result. They should also inform the day care centre manager.</p>

<p>If the confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> comes back as negative, that person can come back to the centre as long as they do not have symptoms</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> comes back as positive, they should continue self-isolating for 10 days in line with government guidance and do not need to re-test with rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> for 90 days (unless they develop new COVID symptoms or have met some of the conditions set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: management of staff and exposed patients or residents in health and social care settings</a>).</p>

<p>If you have one or more positive cases in your centre, please contact your local health protection team immediately who will provide further advice for the future.</p>

<p>You must have consent from the individual if you plan to have results returned to a different person.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to inform your local public health authority of a positive result.</p>

<h4>If a service user tests positive on-site</h4>

<p>They should wear a mask if possible and should return home immediately.</p>

<p>If possible, the service user should return home using private transport. Please follow your usual process for arranging transport if a service user becomes symptomatic on site.</p>

<p>They should take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test upon return and self-isolate until the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is returned.</p>

<h3>Negative results</h3>

<p>Staff members who receive a negative result and remain without symptoms can continue working.</p>

<p>Service users who receive a negative result and remain without symptoms can attend the centre.</p>

<p>A symptomatic individual who tests negative for COVID-19 may have another infectious illness like flu. Therefore, action may still be needed to limit transmission including using appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> when working with symptomatic people receiving care and isolation while the individual is unwell.</p>

<p>If you believe two or more symptomatic  cases may be linked and that you may have an outbreak within your service, you should contact your local health protection team (HPT), which will  advise whether any further action or additional testing (including flu testing) is needed.</p>

<h3>Void or invalid results</h3>

<p>The worker or service user will need to re-test using another kit to receive a conclusive result. If that is also void, they can keep attending the centre and take a rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> the following day (or the next time they arrive at the centre).</p>

<h2>Service users testing process: further information</h2>

<p>Based on your centre’s workforce capacity, the needs of your service users, and a risk assessment by your team that considers factors like shared transport, you have the flexibility to implement either testing model at your discretion, on a case by case basis.</p>

<h3>Support needed for testing at home</h3>

<h4>Managers should:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>communicate the at-home testing process to service users, carers or parents before they collect test kits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>distribute kits for service users, carers or parents to safely take them home (2 boxes of 7 rapid <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> and one confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>share additional guidance with service users, carers or parents such as online videos and this webinar pack</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure parents or carers have consent to test, interpret result, and report results</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work out how results will be reported from home testers (either providing the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> to carers or obtaining each test result and test strip ID number from them)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>One option could be to create a results tracking spreadsheet to keep track of all test results, test strip ID numbers and personal details to record each result online.</p>

<h4>Service users, carers or parents</h4>

<p>Prepare for testing by reading guidance and the detailed printed instructions in the kit and watch instructional videos.</p>

<p>If able to test, we recommend the service user should be tested up to twice weekly, 3 to 4 days apart. The service user can self-test or receive assisted swabbing.</p>

<p>If they are attending only once a week, they should test on the day they attend. If attending twice a week, test on the 2 days of attendance.</p>

<p>All results should be reported online. Results can be reported by the service user or the carer or parent on behalf of the service user. Alternatively, the test strip ID and result can be shared with the manager to report on behalf of the service user.</p>

<h3>Support needed for testing on site</h3>

<h4>Testing area requirements</h4>

<p>A designated area where users can test while socially distancing from others and await results while adhering to infection control measures</p>

<p>Ideally, the area has a separate entrance from the rest of the centre and hard, non-porous flooring</p>

<p>Area should have a mirror, timer, hand sanitiser, cleaning equipment and waste bins.</p>

<p>Staff can keep a record of which device matches which individual’s result.</p>

<h4>Other key considerations</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>consent – obtaining consent from all service users to be tested in line with your normal policies and procedures. You can modify any current consent forms you already have</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff training – make sure that all staff who will assist with swabbing are briefed on the process for testing on-site</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> – please ensure that you have enough <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for staff to wear while they are conducting testing (face mask, gloves, apron). To order more <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, please contact your local authority</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional guidance for managers</h2>

<h3>Share your unique <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> with your centre</h3>

<p><abbr title="unique organisation numbers">UONs</abbr> are needed to register <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, report lateral flow results, and order more test kits. Make sure you share your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> with all staff and service users, carers and parents that will test.</p>

<h3>Kit distribution</h3>

<h4>For staff</h4>

<p>Please ensure that each individual receives 2 boxes of 7 rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits, one confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test (if available) and 4 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits per month.</p>

<h4>For service users</h4>

<p>If service users test at home, ensure that 2 boxes of 7 rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits and one confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test (if available) is taken home. If you are testing on site, store the kits at your centre.</p>

<h3>Tracking test kit LOT numbers and distribution (rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> only)</h3>

<p>Please ensure to maintain records of the kits that are distributed outside of the centre, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the LOT number, which can be located on the box of 7 rapid lateral flow tests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the name and details of each staff member or service user receiving the box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>date or receipt they picked up the box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>name of the testing coordinator distributing the home test kits</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Data privacy notice</h4>

<p>Managers should download our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings/cornavirus-covid-19-self-test-for-staff-service-users-and-visitors-in-adult-social-care-settings-privacy-notice" class="govuk-link">data privacy notice</a> and make this available on display in your centre.</p>

<p>Please edit the details in this document to include your organisation name and make this available to read by staff and service users in your centre.</p>

<h3>Preparing staff</h3>

<p>We recommend that managers read through all guidance then practice a first use with staff (either virtually or on site) with both test kits to ensure proper use.</p>

<p>If staff will test service users on site, we recommend that managers conduct an additional risk assessment and review our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings/on-site-testing-for-adult-social-care-services-rapid-lateral-flow-test-guide" class="govuk-link">on-site testing guidance</a> with staff to prepare for testing in your centre.</p>

<h3>Preparing service users, carers and parents</h3>

<p>We recommend managers write and share a letter with service users, carers and parents overviewing this testing process and asking for written consent for testing (in line with your existing consent processes).</p>

<h3>Tracking results</h3>

<p>You will not automatically receive a copy of test results conducted at home. In order to receive positive results, you must request this information from staff and service users, carers or parents directly. We recommend trialling out a system to share results with you. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a shared Gmail account</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a shared google docs spreadsheet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WhatsApp group</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>nominated contact of your team</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have set up a system for results to be shared, make sure all individuals are aware of the expectations for sharing their results before they begin testing.</p>

<h3>Ordering <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and consulting the Infection Control Fund (ICF)</h3>

<p>Please contact your local authority to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>order more <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>secure infection control funding to mitigate the additional costs of lateral flow testing (including staff training time, supporting materials, testing and site equipment, and so on)</li>
</ul>
