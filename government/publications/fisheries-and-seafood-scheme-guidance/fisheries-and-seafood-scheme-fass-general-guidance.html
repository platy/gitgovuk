</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Non-cash assets</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>In kind costs</h3>

<p>Items or services which are provided ‘in kind’ – i.e. where no actual costs are incurred, such as volunteering – cannot be used as match funding. However, these may be an important part of delivering a project. ‘In kind’ costs should not exceed 10% of the total budget for a project.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>How to apply</h2>

<p>You can apply for funding online using the FaSS E-system. You may need to complete more than one application if your project has different elements within it. You should read the associated guidance for each part of your application.</p>

<p>If your application is successful, you will need to be able to pay for your entire project up front - you can then claim the costs back from the MMO.</p>

<p>You may be able to claim back up to 10% of the total eligible project for costs incurred before acknowledgement has been received from the MMO. These costs must be for activities directly related to professional services that assisted the application, for example architects plans. We will decide if you are eligible to reclaim these costs and our decision is final.</p>

<p>If you start work before receiving your acknowledgement email, your project may be ineligible for funding.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Documents you will need to submit</h3>

<p>The information required to process an application will depend on the value of the project and what is being funded.</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is the only provider who has the necessary skills or equipment to undertake the work,</li>
  <li>the provider owns the exclusive rights required to deliver the goods or service.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is the case, then a Single Tender Action (or equivalent) must be supplied, along with a completed Pre-Procurement Approval Form (or equivalent), which evidences the supporting justification for a Single Tender Action, which has been approved by the business area and the Head of Procurement (or equivalent).</p>

<p>These MUST be provided prior to the purchase of any goods or services.</p>

<p>If your organisation does not follow formalised processes as set out above, then you must provide evidence of project objectives, a breakdown of the costs, an outline of any value for money considerations, reasons for not procuring in the usual way and any relevant supporting documentation.</p>

<p>If the goods and services are being supplied to the project internally, you must provide a rationale for using internal staff/services, and evidence that the project has satisfied a value for money assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Costs</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Calculating staff costs</h3>

<p>A member of staff working directly on your project can be included in your project costs. However, staff time can only be reimbursed where the work on the project is not part of an employee’s regular job role. Staff costs for capital or revenue projects are considered running costs and therefore are not eligible.</p>

<p>If your project includes staff costs you must provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a staff hourly rates calculator,</li>
  <li>a job description of the staff member,</li>
  <li>pay slip or proof of salary,</li>
  <li>information on contracted hours in current job role, and</li>
  <li>the role in the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>Claims for staff costs must only be for hours spent exclusively on the project and must be accompanied by signed timesheets and evidence of payment. If you anticipate there being any pay rises within the lifetime of the project, you will need to provide a detailed rationale for these. If this applies to you, you should speak to MMO Grants Team before applying.</p>

<p>Eligible staff salary costs cover gross salary, NI and employers pension contributions only. All other insurances, memberships, salary sacrifices etc. are not eligible for funding.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Leasing of items or equipment</h3>

<p>Leasing items may be included in your project costs, but only if you can provide a rationale with your application explaining why the use of leased items is better value for money than purchase. If you want to lease land or buildings, they must have a lease remaining of at least 10 years from the time you apply in order to be eligible for funding.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Simplified costs</h3>

<p>Simplified costs can be used for projects where evidencing the actual costs incurred is excessively time consuming or difficult, for example costs for utilities, postage, overheads or where there are many small items with little impact on the project. Simplified costs cannot be used for capital purchases.</p>

<p>If you choose to use simplified costs you will need to demonstrate that the costs are reasonable and based on a sound calculation/evidence methodology over the duration of the proposed project.</p>

<p>In advance of issuing any offer letter the simplified cost rate will be calculated by MMO. This will be based on a percentage of eligible salary costs and will be fixed before the funding offer is made. The method for calculating simplified costs can be found in Annex A.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>Project management</h3>

<p>Project Management costs should not exceed 10% of the total project costs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Targets and benefits</h2>

<p>Your application must provide information on the benefits that can be achieved directly by the project (termed a ‘result indicator’). This information will be used to assess applications and set targets which successful applicants will be expected to achieve as a result of public investment. Further details can be found in the individual guidance notes.</p>

<p>If you do not fully meet the targets and benefits originally agreed and set out in the offer letter, then we will consider to what extent they were achieved. We will work with you to address the issues identified wherever possible, however public funding must be protected and we may recover funding paid to you, or withhold any outstanding funding, if necessary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Result indicator:</h3>

<p>A measure of success assessed as part of the approval process, used to set project specific targets which beneficiaries are expected to achieve as a result of public investment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Next steps</h2>

<p>We will contact you within 5 working days to confirm receipt of your application. After this you can begin work on the project entirely at your own risk. The item, supplier and cost must be the same as in your application: any deviation will make the costs ineligible.</p>

<p>We will assess your application within 8 weeks of its receipt and notify you if any further information is required. Once we have all the required information to make a decision, we will contact you to tell you if your application has been successful or not.</p>

<p>If approved, you must update us on the progress of your project when you make a claim for payment.</p>

<p>When applying for funding for changes onboard a vessel you must engage with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to ensure works meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintenance-and-modification-standards-for-fishing-vessels">standards for fishing vessel modifications,</a>  including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/min-593-f-amendment-1-vessel-modifications-pre-approval-by-mca">MIN593 (F)pre-approval by MCA.</a> pre-approval by MCA.</p>

<p>Details of local surveyors and offices can be obtained from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/maritime-and-coastguard-agency/about/access-and-opening">MCA website.</a></p>

<p>You must include MCA in the process as work is undertaken, particularly where there may be an impact on stability.</p>

<p>We will send details of submitted applications to MCA as soon as they are received for review, but recommend that you discuss the project proposal with MCA before submitting to MMO. <br>
  
All work undertaken by the owner/skipper of the vessel must meet MCA safety and stability requirements, whether funded by FaSS or otherwise. Responsibility for any work undertaken which renders a vessel unstable or unsafe remains entirely with the owner/skipper of the vessel.</p>

<p>For projects that have the potential to impact vessel stability we require you to supply evidence at the claims stage to demonstrate that you have fully engaged with MCA throughout the project and all works undertaken meet MCA safety and stability requirements. No funds will be paid out unless we receive this confirmation which will be verified with MCA.</p>
