<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Funding in this area in this area will support high standards of health and wellbeing, safety, hygiene, and working conditions across the catching, processing and aquaculture sectors</p>

<p>Funding can be applied for under the following measures:</p>

<p>*M3 Enhancing the quality and/or the adding of value of aquaculture products 
*M23 Improving Health and Safety on board vessels 
*M34 Processing of fisheries and aquaculture products</p>

<p>Please note this information is for guidance only and is not exhaustive or binding. If you are unsure whether an item is eligible, please check the General Guidance and if you are still unsure contact the MMO.</p>

<p>When applying for funding for changes onboard a vessel you must engage with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to ensure works meet the standards for fishing vessel modifications, including MIN593 (F) pre-approval by MCA.</p>

<p>Details of local surveyors and offices can be obtained from the MCA website.</p>

<p>You must include MCA in the process as work is undertaken, particularly where there may be an impact on stability.</p>

<p>We will send details of submitted applications to MCA as soon as they are received for review but recommend that you discuss the project proposal with MCA before submitting to MMO. </p>

<p>All work undertaken by the owner/skipper of the vessel must meet MCA safety and stability requirements, whether funded by FaSS or otherwise. Responsibility for any work undertaken which renders a vessel unstable or unsafe remains entirely with the owner/skipper of the vessel.</p>

<p>For projects that have the potential to impact vessel stability we require you to supply evidence at the claims stage to demonstrate that you have fully engaged with MCA throughout the project and all works undertaken meet MCA safety and stability requirements. No funds will be paid out unless we receive this confirmation which will be verified with MCA.</p>
