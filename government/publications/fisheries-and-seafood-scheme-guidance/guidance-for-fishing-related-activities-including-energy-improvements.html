<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Funding in this area will support a sustainable sector through limiting the environmental impact of fishing and increasing the value and the quality of catch.</p>

<p>Funding can be applied for under the following measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>M2 Improving energy efficiency of fishing and mitigating climate change</li>
  <li>M16 Improving the value and quality of fisheries products</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note this information is for guidance only and is not exhaustive or binding. If you are unsure whether an item is eligible, please check the General Guidance and if you are still unsure contact the MMO.</p>

<p>Support shall not be granted more than once during the programming period for the same type of equipment on the same English registered fishing vessel.</p>

<p>When applying for funding for changes onboard a vessel you must engage with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to ensure works meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintenance-and-modification-standards-for-fishing-vessels">standards for fishing vessel modifications,</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/min-593-f-amendment-1-vessel-modifications-pre-approval-by-mca">including MIN593 (F) pre-approval by MCA.</a></p>

<p>Details of local surveyors and offices can be obtained from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/maritime-and-coastguard-agency/about/access-and-opening">MCA website </a></p>

<p>You must include MCA in the process as work is undertaken, particularly where there may be an impact on stability.</p>

<p>We will send details of submitted applications to MCA as soon as they are received for review but recommend that you discuss the project proposal with MCA before submitting to MMO. </p>

<p>All work undertaken by the owner/skipper of the vessel must meet MCA safety and stability requirements, whether funded by FaSS or otherwise. Responsibility for any work undertaken which renders a vessel unstable or unsafe remains entirely with the owner/skipper of the vessel.</p>

<p>For projects that have the potential to impact vessel stability we require you to supply evidence at the claims stage to demonstrate that you have fully engaged with MCA throughout the project and all works undertaken meet MCA safety and stability requirements. No funds will be paid out unless we receive this confirmation which will be verified with MCA.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Projects you can apply for</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>M2 Improving energy efficiency of fishing and mitigating climate change</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Projects can include:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Studies to assess the contribution of alternative propulsion systems and hull designs to the energy efficiency of fishing vessels.</li>
  <li>Energy efficiency audits and schemes and business advice to mitigate climate change.</li>
  <li>Investments to improve the hydrodynamics of the hulls of vessels, for example: 
<br> <br>Investments in stability mechanisms such as bilge keels and bulbous bows that contribute to improved hydrodynamics.<br>Costs related to the use of non-toxic antifouling such as copper coating in order to reduce friction.<br>Tank testing in order to provide a basis for improving hydrodynamics.<br>Energy efficient propellers including drive shafts. 
<br><br>
</li>
  <li>Investments to improve the propulsion system of the vessel, costs related to the purchase and, if necessary, the installation of the following items: 
<br><br>Catalysers <br>Energy efficient generators such as those using hydrogen or natural gas. <br>Bow thrusters. <br>Conversion of engines to run on biofuels.<br> Econometers, fuel management systems and monitoring systems. 
<br><br>
</li>
  <li>Investments that are aimed at the reduction of electricity or thermal energy consumption. 
<br><br> Investments to encourage the re-cycling of heat within the vessel involving the heat being recovered and re-used for other auxiliary purposes within the vessel. 
<br><br>
</li>
  <li>Investments that help businesses diversify into products that mitigate climate change or reduce emissions</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Funding will not be provided for</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Engine replacements including auxiliary engines, engine refits, overhauls and substantial renovations.</li>
  <li>Costs relating to basic hull maintenance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Result indicators</h3>

<p>FaSS result indicators have been designed to measure the benefits delivered by a project. Result indicators are specific to the type of project you are applying for. For projects under M2, Improving energy efficiency of fishing and mitigating climate change, the following indicators are applicable:</p>

      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Not all FaSS result indicators will be applicable to your project. You will be asked to choose the most suitable indictor to demonstrate the benefits of your project.</p>

<p>Once the project is complete you will be required to provide evidence as part of post project monitoring to show the actual benefits achieved by your project.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span>M16 Improving the value and quality of fisheries products</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Projects can include:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Investments that add value to fishery products.</li>
  <li>Investments that increase the quality, control and traceability of products.</li>
  <li>Improvements to fish holds including lining and refrigeration where there is no increase in their capacity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Funding will not be provided for</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Investments not on-board vessels; these might be eligible under the category of support to improve the resilience and sustainability of shore-based facilities.</li>
  <li>Projects that are unable to clearly demonstrate the improved quality or value added to fisheries products.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Result indicators</h3>

<p>FaSS result indicators have been designed to measure the benefits to be delivered by a project. Result indicators are specific to the type of project you are applying for. For projects under M16, Improving the value and quality of fisheries products, the following indicators are applicable:</p>
