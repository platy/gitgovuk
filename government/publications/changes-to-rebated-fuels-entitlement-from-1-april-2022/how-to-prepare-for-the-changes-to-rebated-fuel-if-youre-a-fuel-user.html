<p>From 1 April 2022 you must not put rebated fuel into the tank of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-rebated-fuels-entitlement-from-1-april-2022/check-when-rebated-fuel-can-be-used">vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance that is not allowed to use it</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re no longer able to use rebated fuel, you should plan to run down the fuel you have to as close to nil as reasonably practicable before 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>You may only use up rebated fuel after 1 April 2022, if the fuel was lawfully put into your vehicle, vessel or machine before 1 April 2022. This includes where special provision has been made as outlined in sections 3 and 4 of this guide.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Rebated fuel in storage tanks</h2>

<p>If you only use fuel for non-accepted uses from 1 April 2022 as a result of these changes, you should plan to use up stocks of fuel held in storage tanks by this date.</p>

<p>You will not be expected to flush out any residue of rebated fuel from your storage tanks once it has been used up.</p>

<p>You may need to check how much rebated fuel you use, to determine how much you are likely to need until 31 March 2022, and plan how to manage any surplus stock.</p>

<p>If you order supplies of rebated fuel between now and 1 April 2022, you should only order the amount you expect to use by that date.</p>

<p>You should use diesel or biofuels which have had full duty paid when putting fuel into your vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance after the rules change on 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>Find more information about rebated fuel held in storage tanks and used for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-rebated-fuels-entitlement-from-1-april-2022/how-to-prepare-for-the-changes-to-rebated-fuel-if-youre-a-fuel-user#electricitygeneration">stand-by electricity generation and critical equipment used in commercial premises</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any surplus rebated fuel in your storage tanks after 31 March 2022, that you are not able to use for an accepted use, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sell or give it to someone who is allowed to use it</li>
  <li>sell or give it to any Registered Dealer in Controlled Oil (<abbr title="Registered Dealer in Controlled Oil">RDCO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>dispose of it using an approved waste oil recycling or disposal company</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to keep records to show how and when the fuel was disposed of or sold.</p>

<p>You can sell or dispose of the surplus fuel without needing to be approved by HMRC as an <abbr title="Registered Dealer in Controlled Oil">RDCO</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should make sure that you dispose of surplus rebated fuel correctly and safely through an approved waste oil recycling or disposal company.</p>

<p>If you have a large volume of rebated diesel already in reserve and are concerned that you will not be able to use or dispose of it before 1 April 2022, you should contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:oils.policymail@hmrc.gov.uk">oils.policymail@hmrc.gov.uk</a>, as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Vehicles, machines or appliances used for both accepted and non-accepted uses</h2>

<p>If you use vehicles, machines or appliances for both accepted and non-accepted purposes, you should consider using some for accepted and others for non-accepted purposes. This will mean you’ll not need to drain and flush the tank when you change the use of the vehicle from an accepted to non-accepted purpose.</p>

<p>If this is not practical or you do not wish to do this (for example, because the change of use is infrequent), you must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use full duty paid diesel or biofuels for all uses</li>
  <li>drain and flush the tank of rebated fuel before the vehicle, machine or appliance is put to a non-accepted use</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Transitional arrangements for stand-by electricity generation and critical equipment</h2>

<p>From 1 April 2022 you can only use rebated fuel in a machine used for generating power where the premises are not used for commercial purposes. You can also use rebated fuel for power generation for the accepted uses for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agriculture, horticulture, fish farming and forestry</li>
  <li>community amateur sports clubs that are registered with HMRC</li>
  <li>golf courses and driving ranges</li>
  <li>travelling fairs and circuses</li>
</ul>

<p>After the rules change, you can use up any rebated fuel you obtained before 11 June 2021, for either of the following uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stand-by electricity generation in premises used for commercial purposes</li>
  <li>critical equipment used for commercial purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>If on 1 April 2022, you are likely to have any rebated fuel which was obtained for either of these uses on or after 11 June 2021, you should contact us as soon as possible by sending an email to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:oils.policymail@hmrc.gov.uk">oils.policymail@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We will consider whether a licence may be granted which would let you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay the difference in duty between the rebated and non-rebated rates</li>
  <li>use up rebated fuel on hand at 1 April 2022 for a non-accepted use</li>
</ul>

<p>A licence will not allow you to continue buying rebated diesel to use. You will only be able to use rebated fuel that you have until 1 April 2022 and then it will be withdrawn. After 1 April 2022 you should only order, and take supply of diesel where full duty has been paid.</p>

<p>You will not be expected to flush out rebated fuel from the storage or running tanks used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stand-by generators</li>
  <li>critical equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>Stand-by electricity generation means using generators when necessary to make sure there is continuity of power. This does not include generators used as the main source of everyday electricity.</p>

<p>Stand-by electricity generation can also be used for commercial electricity generators. The generators can be used to manage pressures to the national grid and where a volume of back-up fuel needs to be held in reserve for security and regulatory purposes to maintain essential electricity supply.</p>

<p>Equipment is critical if it is needed to make sure continuous use or availability of an essential or critical service including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>protecting national security</li>
  <li>emergency services and law enforcement</li>
  <li>health services, for example, medical and life support equipment</li>
  <li>the supply of water, fuel and power</li>
  <li>protecting the welfare of livestock and other animals</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Use of rebated fuel in exceptional circumstances from 1 April 2022</h2>

<p>You may be granted a licence to continue using rebated fuel after 1 April 2022, if you can show that there are exceptional circumstances why you cannot use full duty paid diesel.</p>

<p>Examples of exceptional circumstances may include the need to use rebated fuel for technical or safety reasons because using full duty paid diesel fuel is not compatible with your vehicles, vessels, machines or appliances.</p>

<p>You must apply to HMRC, and if we approve the licence, you will need to pay the difference in duty between the rebated and non-rebated fuels before using the rebated fuel.</p>

<p>A licence will not allow you to use rebated fuel indefinitely and will be reviewed. If you want to apply to HMRC for a licence, you will need to email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:oils.policymail@hmrc.gov.uk">oils.policymail@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to start using full duty paid fuel because your use is not approved, but you believe you cannot do so for technical or safety reasons, you should email HMRC with details of why you cannot change from using rebated  to full duty paid diesel.</p>

<p>If it is for a technical reason, you need to explain why your vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance cannot use non-rebated fuel. If there is a safety reason, you should outline why full duty paid fuel is a greater risk than rebated fuel.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Refilling the tank of a vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance with marked fuel outside the UK</h2>

<p>In some jurisdictions or countries, using marked fuel will still be legal in some of the vehicles, vessels, machines or appliances that will no longer be allowed to use rebated (marked) fuel in the UK from 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>Examples of these jurisdictions or countries include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Channel Islands</li>
  <li>other European countries</li>
</ul>

<p>If you refuel and use your vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance in a jurisdiction or country where using marked fuel is allowed, you can use up the remaining fuel in the vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance when you return to the UK.</p>

<p>You will need to keep receipts or other documents to show that you have not refilled your vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance unlawfully in the UK. You will not need to flush the tank of your vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance on your return to the UK.</p>

<p>The same changes to rebated diesel and biofuels being made in the UK will also be applied in the Isle of Man from 1 April 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Complying with the new rules</h2>

<p>In vehicles, vessels, machines and appliances which are not allowed to use rebated fuel from 1 April 2022, it is likely there will be a period between the rules changing and the rebated fuel in the internal tank or engine being used up.</p>

<p>How long this will take will depend on the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type of vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance</li>
  <li>size of its fuel tank</li>
  <li>rate of fuel consumption</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC acknowledge that due to the requirement to maintain minimum fuel stock levels for safety reasons and operational requirements, fuel which has had full duty paid may be put into and mixed with existing stocks of rebated fuel in the tank. This may mean there may be a red indicator in the tank beyond 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>As part of the transition to the new rules, we are committed to working with you and your business to make sure you understand the impact of the changes.</p>

<p>We will consider the steps you’ve taken to change to using diesel or biofuels fuel which have had full duty paid (where needed). We will target users who deliberately or knowingly use rebated fuel unlawfully by checking receipts and invoice records.</p>

<p>We may carry out checks to confirm the correct fuel is being used in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles</li>
  <li>vessels</li>
  <li>machines</li>
  <li>appliances</li>
  <li>storage tanks</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be able to show that you have been refilling with the correct fuel since the rules changed by keeping invoices or receipts showing that you’ve purchased diesel or biofuels which have had full duty paid.</p>

<p>If after 1 April 2022, we find traces of fuel markers in the fuel supply of a vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance which is not allowed to use it, we will try to establish from our testing and your records whether the quantities are consistent with rebated fuel put into the tank before the rules changed. You may be asked to give evidence to show that any rebated fuel was put in before the rules changed and is still being used up. Where we find this to be the case we may arrange follow up checks to make sure that any quantities of rebated fuel are reducing.</p>

<p>If you put a vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance to both accepted and non-accepted uses after the rules change, you must keep records which demonstrate when you’ve flushed the tank and you have used full duty paid fuel for non-accepted uses.</p>

<p>For example, if you hire a vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance in which rebated fuel is acceptable for specific uses, you will need to keep evidence to confirm the correct fuel has been put into the fuel tank.</p>

<p>HMRC will consider what purpose the vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance was being used for at the time of inspection and whether this was an accepted use.</p>

<p>Vehicles, vessels, machines or appliances found running on rebated fuel that HMRC establishes was put into the tank after 1 April 2022, will be liable to be seized unless a licence has been granted and the duty paid.</p>

<p>HMRC will have the discretion not to seize if the user can demonstrate, using invoices and receipts, that they did not put rebated fuel into the fuel tanks after the rules changed.</p>

<p>If we have evidence or reason to believe you have put rebated fuel into your vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance intentionally or recklessly after the rules changed, you may be subject to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/fuels-for-use-in-vehicles-excise-notice-75#hmrc-response-to-illegal-fuel-use">civil or criminal sanctions</a>.</p>
