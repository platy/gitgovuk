<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Registered dealers in controlled oil (<abbr title="registered dealers in controlled oil">RDCO</abbr>)</h2>

<p>From 1 April 2022, customers currently eligible to use rebated fuel will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-rebated-fuels-entitlement-from-1-april-2022/check-when-rebated-fuel-can-be-used">check when rebated fuel can be used</a>.</p>

<p>Although the use of rebated fuel will be restricted from 1 April 2022, your responsibility as an <abbr title="registered dealers in controlled oil">RDCO</abbr> is not changing.</p>

<p>You will still need to take all necessary precautions to make sure that you supply rebated fuel only to people who will use it as permitted. You need to look at the changes to check which of your customers will be affected.</p>

<p>You should not supply customers affected by the changes more rebated fuel than they may realistically use before the rules change.</p>

<p>Affected users will need to run down their stocks of rebated fuel in the months leading up to the changes and after the rules change not put any more rebated fuel into their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles</li>
  <li>vessels</li>
  <li>machines</li>
  <li>appliances</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to make sure your customers understand the changes to the rules and help them to prepare by discussing their needs between now and 1 April 2022. This will help your customers reduce their supplies so that they are not left with unused rebated fuel in their storage tanks on 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>If a customer who will no longer be allowed to use rebated fuel after 1 April 2022 suggests stockpiling rebated fuel or begins to purchase more fuel than normal, you should discuss this with them and direct them to this guidance.</p>

<p>You will need to be able to demonstrate you have taken reasonable care to supply rebated fuel only to customers still allowed to use it.</p>

<p>If you supply rebated fuel before 1 April 2022, and you know or have reason to believe it will be put to a non-accepted use after these changes take effect, you will not have met your obligations as an <abbr title="registered dealers in controlled oil">RDCO</abbr>.</p>

<p>This includes where, based on normal supply rates, a customer is unlikely to use the volume of fuel they order in the remaining time before 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>Due to the change in demand from rebated fuel to diesel or biofuels which have had full duty paid, you may need to reassign your storage tanks. If you do, the old tanks will need to be flushed out. You should keep a record of doing this and keep receipts or invoices if you employ someone to do it.</p>

<p>As there may be increased demand for these services in the run up to April 2022, you should consider organising this in advance of April.</p>

<p>If you will no longer be supplying rebated fuel as a result of these changes, you will need to remove your registration from the <abbr title="registered dealers in controlled oil">RDCO</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>Find more information about how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fuel-duty-deregister-from-the-dealers-in-controlled-oil-scheme-ho83">remove your registration</a>.</p>

<p>You will also need to tell us how you plan to dispose of any stocks of rebated fuel and keep the relevant records to show how you disposed of it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>New biodiesel requirements for producers of biofuels</h2>

<p>From 1 April 2022, if you produce 2,500 litres or more of biodiesel as fuel, you will have to mark any biodiesel which you intend to put to any accepted use in vehicles, vessels, machines or appliances and pay the rebated rate of fuel duty.</p>

<p>This includes machines used for heating premises that are used for non-commercial purposes, as heating will be a chargeable use for biodiesel from 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>If you set aside biodiesel for commercial heating, you must pay fuel duty at the full rate for diesel.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2022, if you intend to supply rebated biodiesel, you must be approved to deal in controlled oils.</p>

<p>Find out how to apply to be a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/registered-dealers-in-controlled-oil-excise-notice-192">registered dealer in controlled Oil</a>.</p>

<p>You must make sure rebated biodiesel contains the chemical marker and dye as required by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1773/made" rel="external">Hydrocarbon Oil (Marking) Regulations 2002</a>.</p>

<p>These regulations require that the same markers used for rebated diesel must also be present in rebated biodiesel from 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>Only biodiesel which contains the prescribed markers can be used as rebated fuel in certain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles</li>
  <li>vessels</li>
  <li>machines</li>
  <li>appliances</li>
</ul>

<p>There is already a requirement for rebated bioblend to contain a chemical marker and dye to qualify for a rebate.</p>

<p>After April 2022, use of rebated bioblend be restricted in the same way as rebated diesel.</p>
