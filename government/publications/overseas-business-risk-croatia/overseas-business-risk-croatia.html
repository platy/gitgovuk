<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>General overview</h2>

<p>Croatia is located at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe on the Adriatic Sea. It is a European Union (not Schengen) and NATO member. It has an educated labour force, English is widely spoken and the political environment is stable. However, doing business in Croatia can be a challenge with an economy leaning towards the tourism sector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Political</h2>

<p>Croatia gained its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and joined the European Union in July 2013. Its membership of the EU is perceived by many as the most significant foreign policy achievement since its independence. Croatia’s EU membership has been beneficial to country’s economic stability and has diversified economy. It has also provided new business opportunities which are yet to be  fully capitalised. IT is Croatia’s fastest growing sector. Croatia offers businesses a complex market which plays an important role in the economic and political stability of Southeast Europe.</p>

<p>Croatia’s legal framework is based on a continental European model and its constitution guarantees free transfer of capital and free profit repatriation to investors. Croatian laws guarantee equal rights for domestic and foreign private and legal entities. Since July 2020, the centrist coalition Croatian Government has been led by Prime Minister Andrej Plenković.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Economic</h2>

<p>Following the 2008 economic crisis, Croatia’s recovery was slow and protracted. In 2009, its economic output in real terms finally exceeded its pre-crisis level. The real GDP of Croatia is estimated to have risen by 3% in 2019, following a smaller rise by 2.7% in 2018. This growth was attributed by improvements in the labour market, rising wages and increased investment.</p>

<p>According to the World Bank, the impact of COVID-19 saw the Croatian economy contract by 8.7% in 2020. However the Croatian economy strongly bounced back, and in 2021, had one of the highest GDP growths in the EU. Economic output is expected to reach normal levels in 2022. Despite diversification, the Croatian economy continues to be heavily dependent on tourism which contributes to c. 20% of GDP. Structural imbalances persist and continue to hinder economic growth.  Major reforms remain overdue.</p>

<p>Croatia’s main trading partners are its immediate neighbours, Austria, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and the former Yugoslavian republics. Around 65% of Croatia’s trade is with the Eurozone Countries (source of 75% of Foreign Direct Investment in Croatia). UK goods and services account for approximately 1.7% of Croatia’s total imports. Croatia was the UK’s 87th largest trading partner in the three quarters to the end of Q3 2021 accounting for 0.1% of total UK trade.</p>

<p>The Croatian National Bank (CNB) operates a fixed exchange rate regime pegged to the euro; the local currency is stable. Inflationary pressures, chiefly due to rising energy costs, are worsening. In December 2021 Croatia recorded inflation of 5.4%.  Croatia entered ERM-2 in 2020 and the Croatian Government continue to work towards  Euro adoption for the 1st of January 2023. The European Commission is expected to make a final decision on Croatia’s admission to the Eurozone shortly.  Croatia’s banking sector is stable and well capitalised.</p>

<p>In January 2022 Croatia became an OECD candidate country and has responded positively to the OECD’s invitation to join.</p>

<p>The World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index ranked Croatia at 51st in the world in 2020, the same position it enjoyed a year earlier. Croatia has made starting a business easier by abolishing the requirements to reserve the company name and obtain director signatures for company registration, and by reducing the paid-in minimum capital requirements. Croatia also made dealing with construction permits less costly by reducing the water contribution for warehouse construction. Croatia made it easier to transfer property by decreasing the real estate transfer tax and by reducing the time needed to register property title transfers. Croatia made accessing credit information more difficult by ending the distribution of individual credit data. In the period 2021-2027, Croatia will receive a total of 22 billion euros from the combined MMF and EU Next Generation Fund. Meanwhile, from the Recovery and Resilience Fund Croatia will receive grants to the tune of 5.9 million euros.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Business and human rights</h2>

<p>Human Rights in Croatia are protected by the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and International treaties where they are signatories. Ongoing challenges include securing LGBT rights and the treatment of minorities and illegal migrants.</p>

<p>Croatian employees have the right to join trade unions of their choice without prior authorisation and union representatives are protected against anti-union discrimination. The right to strike is recognised by law.</p>

<p>The gender balance within leading economic and political positions continues to improved and institutional mechanisms for gender equality are being enhanced. The number of women at executive positions remains steady at 18%. With 59.2 out of 100 points, Croatia ranks 19th in the EU on the Gender Equality Index. Its score is 8.8 points below the EU average. Since 2010, Croatia’s score has increased by 6.9 points and its ranking has improved by five places. In the period since 2018, the country’s  score has increased slightly by 1.3 points, but maintained the same ranking. The increase has mainly been driven by improvements in the domains of “power” and “money” whilst the number of women in political spheres is declining. Minority representation in public administration remains below 5%. There has been some positive steps to improve Roma access to education and the labour market reflects government efforts to improve Roma integration.</p>

<p>Despite the legal framework, tax evasion remains a challenge. Successive Croatian Governments have attempted to tackle the issue by deploying “naming and shaming” campaigns and publicly disclosing businesses that are not administrating salaries (or not declaring them according to the law). These efforts have had limited impact.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anyone anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>A commercial organisation carrying on business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Although foreign investors are legally entitled to national treatment, Croatia’s ineffective legal system and a lack of transparency within both the private and public sectors have presented the greatest challenges to investors. 
Transparency in developing legislation and regulations is often hampered by an inefficient public administration and a lack of intra-governmental coordination. The significant backlog of cases has made dispute resolution through courts an undesirable option for companies. Due to long timeframes involved in obtaining judgments in court, companies often try to resolve disputes without seeking judicial remedies.</p>

<p>According to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2018" rel="external">Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index 2018 (CPI)</a> Croatia is ranked 60 out of 180 countries.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Terrorism threat</h2>

<p>There is a low threat from terrorism. Croatian security and intelligence agencies continue to monitor regional security developments.</p>

<p>Read the information provided <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">on the terrorism page of the FCDO Travel Advice</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Protective security advice</h2>

<p>Croatia has a low crime rate compared to average EU levels. Violent crime is rare. In 2019, the Croatian Intelligence Agency Annual Report identified three main security challenges; corruption of organised crime groups, migration and cybercrime.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>Intellectual Property Rights are territorial and only give protection in the Countries where they are granted or registered. If you are thinking about trading internationally, you should consider registering your IP rights in your export markets.</p>

<p>For information on registering your trademark or patent in Croatia you should contact the State Intellectual Property Office of the Republic of Croatia (DZIV). Their <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.dziv.hr/" rel="external">web page</a> has an English language version.</p>

<p>Read the information provided on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/intellectual-property-an-overview">Intellectual Property</a> page.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Organised crime</h2>

<p>Organised criminals in Croatia have strong links to wider Eastern European criminal groups and are involved in cigarettes, drug smuggling and people smuggling. In 2019, Croatian Police records reported 1,993 cases of organised crimes. The COVID-19 pandemic enhanced threats from cyber-attacks.</p>

<p>Businesses and individuals unconnected with organised criminal groups have not been targeted by serious organised crime. Businesses should carefully check the background of any potential partners in advance.</p>
