<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: have you seen the new strategy, ‘school resource management: building a stronger system’?</h2>

<p>On 10 June, we published a new school resource management (SRM) strategy setting out our approach to supporting and empowering schools and academy trusts get the best value from all their resources. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The new strategy and growing suite of SRM tools and services has been developed in partnership with the sector and in response to feedback and user research. It recognises the excellent practice that already exists in many schools and academy trusts and sets out our plans to continue embedding this across the whole system.</p>

<p>On Wednesday 15 June we are holding the first ever SRM Summit, a full-day event showcasing all aspects of the SRM offer with speeches from Minister Walker and the interim CEO of the ESFA. You can access recordings of these sessions by registering <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publicsectorconnect.sym-online.com/registrationforms/schoolsrm/" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about the tools, then check out our new collection of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/schools-financial-efficiency-case-studies">SRM case studies</a> which illustrate how the SRM offer has been used in practice by particular schools and academy trusts.</p>

<p>You can access the full SRM offer, including the new SRM strategy, at the school resource management page.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: advice for schools in preparation for planned RMT Industrial Strike Action</h2>

<p>Face to Face learning to continue during Rail Union RMT Industrial Strike Action OR Advice for schools in preparation for planned RMT Industrial Strike Action: 21, 23 and 25 June.</p>

<p>On 7 June 2022, Rail union <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rmt.org.uk/news/rmt-launch-3-days-of-national-train-strike-action/" rel="external">RMT announced 3 days of national strike action</a> across the railway network, which is planned to take place on 21, 23 and 25 June. The London Underground will strike on 21 June as part of a separate mandate.</p>

<p>Only a small proportion of children and young people across the country travel to school by train, but those that do may be understandably concerned about the impact the industrial action planned for next week - particularly if they are due to take exams that week.</p>

<p>We are extremely grateful for the work that education settings are putting in to ensure children and young people continue to receive high quality, face to face education and care. One of the biggest lessons we have learned from the pandemic is that the classroom is the best place for children and young people. Schools should deliver face-to-face learning where possible during the planned strike action, rather than default back to online learning. Children have been incredibly resilient these last few years and are bouncing back with the help of their teachers.</p>

<p>We know that schools and colleges will make every effort to ensure that examinations for all pupils go ahead as usual and, will draw on their existing contingency arrangements in place to manage any possible disruption, including late arrival of staff or students. If this might be difficult, schools and colleges should consult awarding organisations at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>Schools and colleges may wish to revisit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Guidance-for-centres-managing-exams_June22_FINAL.pdf" rel="external">JCQ additional guidance</a>.) for centres managing exams this summer, outlining existing flexibilities as well as changes to the normal rules for conducting examinations to support centres experiencing disruption. The guidance includes additional flexibility around invigilation numbers and published start times, which could be used if an invigilator is delayed by transport disruption.</p>

<p>Where students arrive late, exam centres should consult awarding organisations guidance on what to do. In most cases, centres should allow students to take the paper, and exam boards will determine whether that paper can be accepted.</p>

<p>For VTQs, centres should consult the guidance from their specific awarding organisation.</p>
