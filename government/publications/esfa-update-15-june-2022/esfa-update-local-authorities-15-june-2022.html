<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: have you seen the new strategy, ‘school resource management: building a stronger system’?</h2>

<p>On 10 June, we published a new school resource management (SRM) strategy setting out our approach to supporting and empowering schools, academy trusts, local authorities (LA) and LA-maintained schools to get the best value from all their resources.</p>

<p>The new strategy and growing suite of SRM tools and services has been developed in partnership with the sector and in response to feedback and user research. It recognises the excellent practice that already exists in many schools and sets out our plans to continue embedding this across the whole system.</p>

<p>On Wednesday 15 June we are holding the first ever SRM summit, a full-day event showcasing all aspects of the SRM offer with speeches from Minister Walker and the interim CEO of the ESFA. You can access recordings of these sessions by registering <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publicsectorconnect.sym-online.com/registrationforms/schoolsrm/" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about the tools, then check out our new collection of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/schools-financial-efficiency-case-studies">SRM case studies</a> which illustrate how the SRM offer has been used in practice by particular schools and academy trusts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Information: 16 to 19 Bursary Fund</h2>

<p>We have made an update to the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund rules about the annual checking of household income. This follows discussions with providers and recognises the administrative burden of handling large numbers of bursary applications in a short space of time, and our desire to maximise retention of students facing financial disadvantage.</p>

<p>We have also added some further clarification about use of the bursary fund in individual cases of severe hardship relating to food support.</p>

<p>Both changes are set out in more detail in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2022-to-2023-academic-year">Bursary fund guide for the 2022 to 2023 academic year</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Information: advice for schools in preparation for planned RMT Industrial Strike Action</h2>

<p>Face to Face learning to continue during Rail Union RMT Industrial Strike Action OR Advice for schools in preparation for planned RMT Industrial Strike Action: 21, 23 and 25 June.</p>

<p>On 7 June 2022, Rail union <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rmt.org.uk/news/rmt-launch-3-days-of-national-train-strike-action/" rel="external">RMT announced 3 days of national strike action</a> across the railway network, which is planned to take place on 21, 23 and 25 June. The London Underground will strike on 21 June as part of a separate mandate.</p>

<p>Only a small proportion of children and young people across the country travel to school by train, but those that do may be understandably concerned about the impact the industrial action planned for next week - particularly if they are due to take exams that week.</p>

<p>We are extremely grateful for the work that education settings are putting in to ensure children and young people continue to receive high quality, face to face education and care. One of the biggest lessons we have learned from the pandemic is that the classroom is the best place for children and young people. Schools should deliver face-to-face learning where possible during the planned strike action, rather than default back to online learning. Children have been incredibly resilient these last few years and are bouncing back with the help of their teachers.</p>

<p>We know that schools and colleges will make every effort to ensure that examinations for all pupils go ahead as usual and, will draw on their existing contingency arrangements in place to manage any possible disruption, including late arrival of staff or students. If this might be difficult, schools and colleges should consult awarding organisations at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>Schools and colleges may wish to revisit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Guidance-for-centres-managing-exams_June22_FINAL.pdf" rel="external">JCQ additional guidance</a>.) for centres managing exams this summer, outlining existing flexibilities as well as changes to the normal rules for conducting examinations to support centres experiencing disruption. The guidance includes additional flexibility around invigilation numbers and published start times, which could be used if an invigilator is delayed by transport disruption.</p>

<p>Where students arrive late, exam centres should consult awarding organisations guidance on what to do. In most cases, centres should allow students to take the paper, and exam boards will determine whether that paper can be accepted.</p>

<p>For VTQs, centres should consult the guidance from their specific awarding organisation.</p>

<span class="number">11. </span>Your feedback: user survey for the post-16 monitoring reports dashboard</h2>

<p>All post-16 providers and MCAs/GLA can give feedback on the post-16 monitoring reports dashboard or from the dashboard landing page until the 24 June 2022 so take a moment to tell us what’s working and suggest changes that may make your dashboard experience even better.</p>

<p>Following last year’s feedback, we added the category ‘Employer provider’ to the VYED sign in page, simplified graphical and tabular displays, and incorporated the Known Issues log.</p>

<p>This is your opportunity to tell us how you find your way around the funding monitoring reports and guidance, manage to download and filter data, and how useful the graphs and tables are.</p>

<p>So far, we’ve received wide ranging feedback and would like to encourage providers to perhaps consult their colleagues, view the dashboard together, consider their answers carefully and submit a team reply.</p>
