<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This note considers why “baseline” measures are likely to be needed beyond the end of the current Roadmap process, and what these measures might be. Ultimately, in determining what measures to retain, a choice must be made in terms of the epidemiological risks and the societal and economic impacts of measures. There will also be a trade-off to be considered between the stringency of measures in place and the likelihood of having to
reverse parts of the Roadmap.</p>

<p>The table provided in Annex A (Table 1 <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr> to support sustained transmission mitigation) considers a range of measures in terms of their theoretical potential effectiveness, current effectiveness as applied at the moment, and actions that could improve effectiveness. However, there are some important caveats.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Measures do not generally have a simple additive effect as they interact. Also, since measures are not introduced in isolation and form part of a package, it is difficult to estimate the impact of individual <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr>. Therefore, it is important to consider packages of measures.</li>
  <li>A complex web of factors will influence the impact of <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr>, including how well people adhere to them. The level of adherence may be heterogeneous and hard to quantify. Low levels of adherence to interventions will erode their effectiveness. Past levels are not necessarily an accurate guide to the levels of adherence to measures that
might be expected now and into the future.</li>
  <li>Each estimate of effectiveness is underpinned by a degree of uncertainty.</li>
  <li>The table does not provide an exhaustive list and there are some important measures out of scope of this paper.</li>
  <li>The table includes suggested measures that are likely to improve effectiveness, but it should not be assumed that these actions will be sufficient to optimise the impact. In some cases, trials for these suggested measures are required to test and improve their effectiveness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The need for ongoing measures</h2>

<p><strong>As current measures are lifted, transmission will almost certainly increase</strong>. Though vaccines are expected to have some population level impact on transmission, this will be limited until those groups which have more contacts (for example younger adults) have been vaccinated. Even beyond the point when all adults have been offered the vaccine, keeping some level of measures in place both through summer and beyond would significantly decrease ongoing transmission. It is notable that countries (for example New Zealand) that have near-zero <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> have decided to retain some baseline measures (for example wearing of masks on public transport) to reduce the impact of occasional outbreaks.</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr> modelling shows it is highly likely that there will be a resurgence in infections with a peak at some point after steps 3 and 4 have been taken</strong> because not everyone will have been vaccinated, vaccines are not 100 percent effective, and the virus will continue to circulate <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. The size and timing of a wave depends on what happens between now and then (vaccine rollout, waning immunity if any, behavioural response to the release of measures, new variants), as well as on the baseline measures in place.</p>

<p><strong>Another wave would be expected to occur even if the assumed baseline measures reduce transmission by 25 percent</strong>; however, it would be much higher without these <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. Sensitivity analysis from one model considered by <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr> shows that if the reduction achieved by baseline measures is only modest (rather than the 25 percent central scenario), hospital occupancy could reach levels comparable to previous peaks <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>It is highly likely that transmission will increase in autumn and winter.</strong> This may mean that the effectiveness of baseline measures may vary through the year, and they will have to be augmented to have the same impact. This increase in transmission is likely to be a mix of behavioural factors (for example moving indoors and closing windows in colder weather) and seasonal activities (for example education term holidays breaking contact networks; foreign holidays driving introductions). Seasonal or temperature effects on viral survival may also be a factor, although this is likely to be very minor in comparison. The healthcare burden of other infections through the year is also an important consideration. This may mean stronger measures may be desirable for autumn and winter all other things being equal.</p>

<p><strong>Lifting restrictions may recreate the conditions for superspreader events</strong>, both person-driven (one highly infectious but possibly asymptomatic person going to multiple places) and setting-driven (nightclubs, religious events where crowding is experienced, low ventilation, loud activities). Restrictions over the past year have significantly limited the number of settings where these events are possible. As greater numbers of people mix together, the probability of superspreader events (infector being present) and their size (number of people
who are available to be infected) will increase. Any changes to <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr> should consider both individual and population level risks.</p>

<p>Other measures are also likely to be needed, which are not considered here as ‘baseline’ measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Vaccination:</strong> The scenarios discussed assumed vaccination rates are maintained as are efforts to overcome hesitancy, especially among those who are at higher risk of infection and more vulnerable to hospitalisation and death.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Border controls:</strong> These are also not considered in detail in this note but are important to reduce the rate of reseeding or introduction of variants of concern (<abbr title="Variants of Concern">VOCs</abbr>).</li>
  <li>
<strong>Responses to <abbr title="Variants of Concern">VOCs</abbr>:</strong> Baseline measures are not designed to respond to the widespread transmission of one or more <abbr title="Variants of Concern">VOCs</abbr> that are able to escape immunity from vaccination or infection: if this occurs the response is likely to need significantly more than baseline measures.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Hotspots and outbreaks:</strong> As transmission increases, there will be continued heterogeneity across the country. Areas with higher levels of deprivation and/or lower levels of vaccine uptake, which are likely to be disproportionately impacted, are an enduring concern. Some degree of local reactive measures will be needed in all scenarios, alongside baseline measures. This may particularly be the case in response to <abbr title="Variants of Concern">VOCs</abbr>, which is a key risk. Previous <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> advice has reflected that the more rapidly such interventions are put in place, and the more stringent they are, the faster the reduction in incidence and prevalence, and that measures should not be
applied in too specific a geographical area <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. Previous waves have also shown that high levels of transmission can occur in institutional settings including hospitals, care homes, prisons, and homeless shelters with infection seeded back into the community. Appropriate controls will need to be maintained and or enhanced in these
settings.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Antiviral treatments:</strong> A new Antivirals Taskforce was announced on 20 April, which will seek to accelerate the development and deployment of two antiviral treatments this year. Antivirals could be another tool that the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> can use against further resurgences of the virus, as these drugs could have the ability to limit disease progression early on in the course of infection. Antivirals can in theory be given to anyone who is infected and it may also be possible to use them prophylactically in the event of outbreaks. Home use of prophylactic antivirals has the potential to reduce the need for self-isolation and motivate better uptake of testing, although this needs further examination (by mixed methods research) While this may be a future measure, the timescales for when they may be available and their effectiveness are not yet clear.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importance of maintaining low prevalence</h2>

<p>Although vaccination of most vulnerable groups will have reduced the proportion of community infections that lead to hospitalisation and death, there remain many advantages from an epidemiological perspective in maintaining both low prevalence and <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> less than 1. It makes it easier to prevent a return to rapid growth in the epidemic which could lead to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> being overwhelmed (for example because it gives more time to react to increases when starting from a low baseline, it is easier to spot outbreaks in advance of them growing large, and Test Trace and Isolate (<abbr title="Test Trace and Isolate">TTI</abbr>) can be more effective at lower prevalence). This has been shown in some countries that have very low or near-zero <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, since occasional outbreaks can then be dealt with quickly, including rapid sequencing of all cases to search for new variants. Lower transmission also reduces the in-country risk of the emergence of variants of concern as well as slowing spread of any <abbr title="Variants of Concern">VOCs</abbr> (including imported <abbr title="Variants of Concern">VOCs</abbr>). Lower infection rates will also reduce impact of post-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr> syndromes and allow more <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> capacity to be used for routine care. Since groups from a lower socioeconomic position and minority ethnic backgrounds have higher risk of infection and lower vaccination rates then any increase in prevalence is also likely to increase health inequalities in <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-related illness and death.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link">[footnote 6]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>There is significant risk in allowing prevalence to rise, even if hospitalisations and deaths are kept low by vaccination. If it were necessary to reduce prevalence to low levels again (for example <abbr title="Variant of concern">VOC</abbr> become more pathogenic for others previously less affected), then restrictive measures would be required for much longer.</p>

<h2>Objectives for baseline measures</h2>

<p>Baseline measures should aim to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reduce the likelihood that people who are infectious are mixing with others in the population.</li>
  <li>For those potentially infectious people who are not isolated, reduce the likelihood that they enter higher risk settings or situations.</li>
  <li>Decrease the transmission risk from an infectious person in any given environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>This prioritisation is consistent with the hierarchy of control which is a system for risk reduction. If some measures are reduced it is critical that actions are taken to ensure that baseline measures work as effectively as possible. A number of measures suggested as baseline are currently not very effective and will need further communications, changes in approach and investment to enable them to provide the level of mitigation needed to maintain sufficiently low transmission. This is summarised in Table 1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1: </span> Reducing the likelihood that people who are infectious are mixing with others in the population.</h3>

<p>Identifying and isolating infectious people can have a significant impact on transmission by eliminating many of the opportunities for transmission (elimination is the first level in the hierarchy of controls). If successful, this may reduce the need for the measures outlined under 2 and 3.</p>

<p><strong>Test Trace and Isolate (<abbr title="Test Trace and Isolate">TTI</abbr>) systems are key to this</strong>, and can include all forms of testing (symptomatic and asymptomatic, including contact testing, school and workplace testing, pre and post-travel testing) as well as other surveillance (for example wastewater monitoring). Operational effectiveness of these systems is important and improvement in uptake essential in populations at high risk of and from infection.</p>

<p><strong>Self-isolation is critical</strong>. It needs to become routine and normative that people with symptoms do all they can to self-isolate. Engagement with testing is also needed, but only isolation prevents transmission. If all individuals were able to fully isolate upon symptom onset (so that they caused no further onward transmission) <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> could be reduced by around 50% <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. Some transmission would remain due to asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic
transmission. This drops to 39% with a one-day delay before isolation and 25% with a two day <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> delay. This highlights the importance of enabling isolation from the onset of symptoms, not just from the receipt of a positive test result. It should be noted that such full isolation would require no onward transmission even within the household and that there are major disincentives preventing many people from isolating this way.
While rates of self-reported isolation among people who have already received a positive test result are high <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>, among the wider population many people with a cough, fever, or loss of sense of taste or smell, report neither requesting a test nor self-isolating <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:11" class="govuk-link">[footnote 11]</a></sup> . The majority of those self-isolating after a test report being unable to keep themselves completely separate from other household members, particularly those with dependent children <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12">[footnote 12]</a></sup> , which may also reduce effectiveness. Data on adherence is limited, with much based on self-reporting, and options to improve this data should be considered <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:13">[footnote 13]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Quarantine after international travel</strong> is also an important measure to reduce the likelihood of people who are infectious mixing with others in the population when rates of infection or of <abbr title="Variants of Concern">VOCs</abbr> are higher in other countries than the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. As prevalence drops, the relative importance of this measure to prevent new seeding of transmission chains increases.</p>

<p><strong>Intervention studies including <abbr title="randomised controlled trials">RCTs</abbr>, case-control studies, cohort studies and ethnographic research would be a valuable way of collecting evidence on effectiveness of some interventions.</strong> Studies will need the appropriate design and expertise to provide clear evidence on effectiveness and acceptability. Ethnographic research in specific at-risk settings and communities would also enable specific barriers and enablers to be identified.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2: </span> For those potentially infectious people who are not isolated, reducing the likelihood that they enter settings or situations.</h3>

<p>These approaches make it possible to eliminate or substitute some of the higher risk situations where transmission may occur – elimination and substitution are the first two levels in the hierarchy of controls.</p>

<p><strong>One approach to this is certification</strong> (based on negative testing, vaccination, or proof of prior infection) that there is a lower probability that an individual is infectious, or that an individual will suffer severe symptoms if the virus is transmitted to them. This can in some cases be achieved via certification <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:16" class="govuk-link">[footnote 16]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup> , though there are a number of practical and ethical <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18">[footnote 18]</a></sup> issues to be considered, including whether any form of certification is equally accessible across the population and whether the certification is reliable.</p>

<p><strong>Minimising frequency and duration of exposure is also important</strong>. It is possible to reduce chance of an infected person being present by reducing the overall number of occasions when people enter settings where there is higher risk of exposure and/or the duration they spend in a setting, for example:</p>

<p>i. Encouraging substitution of indoor contacts with outdoor ones</p>

<p>ii. Replacing physical contact with teleconferencing (for example work or worship at home)</p>

<p>iii. Discouraging multiple indoor interactions with different groups of people (for example using cohorts in workplaces)</p>

<p>iv. Reducing the number, size, and duration of interactions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3: </span> Decreasing the transmission risk from an infectious person in any given environment.</h3>

<p>These approaches use engineering, administrative controls and <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> to reduce risk (these are lower in the hierarchy of control than elimination or substitution, but still make an important contribution to risk reduction). The mitigation measures need to consider all transmission routes (airborne, close range aerosols and droplets, and fomites), and could include:</p>

<p>a. <strong>Physical distancing</strong> (to reduce risk from droplets and short-range aerosols) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:19">[footnote 19]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:20" class="govuk-link">[footnote 20]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 21]</a></sup></p>

<p>b. <strong>Ventilation</strong> (to reduce risk from long range aerosols) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22">[footnote 22]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23">[footnote 23]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup></p>

<p>c. <strong>Face coverings</strong> (to reduce emission of virus and exposure to droplets and larger aerosols) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup>. Other forms of barriers (for example Perspex screens) may provide some protection from droplets in some circumstances though consideration needs to be given to airflows, as in some cases they may increase risk of aerosol transmission.</p>

<p>d. <strong>Hand hygiene and surface cleaning</strong> (to reduce risk from fomites).</p>

<p><strong>Risk assessments which use the hierarchy of control approach are important in all settings</strong> for determining the most effective and practical approaches, but particularly in settings which are higher risk either due to the environment and activities <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:26">[footnote 26]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup> (for example nightclubs) and/or the vulnerability of people within the setting (for example care homes, hospitals, prisons, homeless shelters). The duration of time that people spend in a setting is an important factor when assessing the risk.</p>

<h2>Impacts of measures on individual and collective risks</h2>

<p>The optimum package of measures will depend on the policy objective(s) and will need to consider social and economic factors as well as the epidemiological impact on transmission. It will therefore be important for policymakers to specify objectives over the short, medium and long term in order to design packages of measures that could be expected to achieve each of them.</p>

<p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to pre-determine which set of <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr> or behaviour changes would result in the levels of transmission previously modelled to occur after the Roadmap by <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 29]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup> . This is because the impact of different measures results from a complex interaction between physical, biological and behavioural factors, and there are multiple aspects where understanding of transmission is very uncertain. Some measures will have
much greater epidemiological impact than others, with the impact of each depending on the context in which it is implemented, how it is implemented, and interactions between sets of interventions. As such, measures cannot be considered in isolation.</p>

<p>Trials can and should be used to gather evidence of the effectiveness of individual measures or packages of measures and to test alternative versions of measures, combinations, different approaches to communications and messaging.</p>

<p>Survey and other data on contacts and case transmission (for example <abbr title="a behavioural survey launched on 24 March 2020">CoMix</abbr> and <abbr title="Contact Tracing and Advisory Service">CTAS</abbr>) may also provide data on effectiveness after implementation. Given the uncertainty around the impacts of packages of <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr>, including the unknowns around vaccine coverage and effectiveness at reducing transmission, and the role of new <abbr title="Variants of Concern">VOCs</abbr>, it will be essential to embed mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation and research within frameworks that allow for
adaptation in response to developing knowledge.</p>

<p>There are some additional considerations for policymakers when assessing the risk associated with the package of baseline measures. The effectiveness of baseline measures is conditional on engagement with the relevant behaviours. Evidence suggests that sustained behaviour change requires sustained interventions acting on multiple levels, as outlined in the accompanying <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr> paper <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>a. There are some measures where there appears to be scope to have significantly more impact on transmission than is currently being achieved. This includes improving adherence to isolation (including a culture change so that people are less likely to attend workplaces when unwell), improved ventilation, and continued working from home where possible.</p>

<p>b. There is a need to consider both individual risk and collective risk. This is also important for communicating why controls are needed, and why a person facing low personal risk still needs to adhere. Perception of risk, both personal and collective, is likely to change significantly as a result of vaccine rollout and from the fact that
measures have been lifted (for example if certain rules no longer apply then people may assume the same is true of others).</p>

<p>c. There is an aggregate effect of small changes in risk across large numbers of people, which may be much greater than for a large change in risk for small number of people, so things which make a small difference to individual risk can make a large difference to collective risk if applied across the population. This so-called ‘prevention paradox’ may create challenges in terms of risk communication, as marginal differences in risk between two options may be very low at individual level but appreciable at population level, especially because any increases in transmission are multiplicative rather than additive.</p>

<p>d. Some risk factors concentrate among relatively few people. Over multiple chains of transmission, that small subset of the population with large relative risk (substantial exposure and onward transmission risks) has significant contributions to the overall infection rates as risk factors among the relatively few can sustain even generalised epidemics in the community. Therefore, interventions also need to consider the overall number of downstream infections averted based on differential impacts in different communities.</p>

<p>e. ‘<abbr title="Acceptability, Practicability, Effectiveness, Affordability, Sideeffects, and Equity">APEASE</abbr>’ criteria - Acceptability, Practicability, Effectiveness, Affordability, Sideeffects, and Equity - provides a useful framework for evaluating existing and proposed interventions.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32">[footnote 32]</a></sup></p>

<p>f. Given this, more intensive support for adherence could be considered for the specific settings and population sectors at highest risk. Developing feasible and effective guidance, communication and support for target communities, including those with different cultural backgrounds, can benefit from participatory co-design (such as in collaboration with target communities).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:33" class="govuk-link">[footnote 33]</a></sup></p>
