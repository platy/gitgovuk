<p>If you do not qualify for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact?contact_groups%5B%5D=campaigns">current HMRC campaign</a>, you can still use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-revenue-and-customs-disclosure-service">Digital Disclosure Service (<abbr title="Digital Disclosure Service">DDS</abbr>)</a> to tell us that you’ve not declared the right amount of one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income Tax</li>
  <li>Capital Gains Tax</li>
  <li>National Insurance contributions</li>
  <li>Corporation Tax</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>HMRC believes that its customers want to pay the right amount of tax and wants to help those that are not paying the right amount to put that right.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Digital Disclosure Service">DDS</abbr> gives individuals and companies a chance to bring their affairs up to date in a simple, straightforward way.</p>

<p>If you owe tax on your income you must tell us about any unpaid tax now. You’ll then have 90 days to calculate and pay what you owe. This guide explains how you can do that.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>If you need help</h3>

<p>If there’s anything about your health or personal circumstances that may make it difficult for you to deal with this matter you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-your-guide-to-making-a-disclosure/your-guide-to-making-a-disclosure#helpline">call our helpline</a>. We’ll help you in whatever way we can.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>The scope of the <abbr title="Digital Disclosure Service">DDS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Digital Disclosure Service">DDS</abbr> can be used by individuals and companies who have a disclosure to make about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income Tax</li>
  <li>Capital Gains Tax</li>
  <li>National Insurance contributions</li>
  <li>Corporation Tax</li>
  <li>Annual Tax for Enveloped Dwellings (ATED)</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples include a business that has not declared all of its income or a business that’s trading and has not registered with HMRC for one or more taxes.</p>

<p>If you qualify for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact?contact_groups%5B%5D=campaigns">current HMRC campaign</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/worldwide-disclosure-facility-make-a-disclosure">Worldwide Disclosure Facility</a>, (for disclosures which involve either assets, income or gains (or any of these) outside the UK), you should follow their guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Other disclosures</h3>

<p>If you have a disclosure to make about the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, you should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pay-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-grants-back">CJRS voluntary disclosure</a> guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Contractual Disclosure Facility</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/admitting-tax-fraud-the-contractual-disclosure-facility-cdf#owning-up-to-tax-fraud-voluntarily">Contractual Disclosure Facility</a> is specifically for when you have deliberate behaviour to disclose. You can ask to enter the facility if your deliberate behaviour has brought about a loss in any of the taxes, duties or payments administered by HMRC, including the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/fraud-civil-investigation/fcim201020">taxes, duties and payments that are listed</a>.</p>

<p>The Contractual Disclosure Facility is a contract that gives you the assurance that HMRC will not carry out a criminal investigation into the deliberate behaviour you disclose. You do not have to wait for HMRC to offer you the facility. You can ask for it by filling in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/voluntary-disclosure-contractual-disclosure-facility-cdf1">contractual disclosure form CDF1</a>.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the Contractual Disclosure Facility, you will make a complete, open, accurate and honest disclosure of all deliberate behaviour and irregularities in your tax affairs and in return HMRC will not to carry out a criminal investigation into your disclosure. Providing a full disclosure is the only way to guarantee this.</p>

<p>HMRC does not have to offer you the facility contract and may not be able to do so if you’re already involved in a criminal investigation by HMRC, or another law enforcement agency (such as the police).</p>

<p>The Contractual Disclosure Facility is not suitable if you only have careless errors or mistakes to disclose.</p>

<p>More information on the Contractual Disclosure Facility can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-9-where-hm-revenue-and-customs-suspect-fraud-cop-9-2012">HMRC’s Code of Practice 9</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>How to make a disclosure</h3>

<p>To make a disclosure you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell HMRC that you want to make a disclosure (notify)</li>
  <li>tell us about all income, gains, tax and duties you’ve not told us about before (disclose)</li>
  <li>make a formal offer</li>
  <li>pay what you owe</li>
  <li>help us as much as you can if we ask you for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>Why you should disclose</h3>

<p>It does not matter why your tax affairs are wrong, it’s better to come to HMRC and admit any failures or inaccuracies rather than wait until we contact you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span>If you have undisclosed liabilities and choose not to disclose</h3>

<p>HMRC is targeting tax evasion and we’ll use information we hold to identify customers who have not declared all their income.</p>

<p>If you owe additional taxes we’ll usually charge higher penalties than those we charge if you come forward. The penalties could be up to 100% of the unpaid liabilities, or up to 200% for offshore related income.</p>

<p>In serious cases we may consider starting a criminal investigation, in line with our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-investigation/hmrc-criminal-investigation-policy">criminal investigation policy</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How to notify and disclose to HMRC</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Notify</h3>

<p>You must tell HMRC that you intend to make a disclosure. You need to do this as soon as you know that you owe tax.</p>

<p>At this stage, you only need to tell us that you’ll be making a disclosure. You do not need to give any details of the undisclosed income or the tax you believe you owe.</p>

<p>You can tell us about a disclosure you’ll be making:</p>

<ul>
  <li>about your own tax affairs or your company’s tax affairs (if you’re a director, or company secretary)</li>
  <li>on behalf of someone else (for example, if you’re a tax adviser or personal representative)</li>
  <li>about a trust or estate</li>
  <li>about a limited liability partnership</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot include details for more than one person or company on a disclosure. For example, if a husband and wife have undisclosed income they must fill in separate disclosures, showing the share of the income they need to disclose. We need a separate notification for each person. If we need a disclosure for a company and for a director, this should be on 2 separate disclosures.</p>

<h4>Individuals and companies</h4>

<p>Individuals and companies can notify by completing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-revenue-and-customs-disclosure-service"><abbr title="Digital Disclosure Service">DDS</abbr> form</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll write to you to tell you your unique Disclosure Reference Number (<abbr title="Disclosure Reference Number">DRN</abbr>). Use this whenever you contact us about your disclosure.</p>

<p>You’ll also be given a Payment Reference Number (<abbr title="Payment Reference Number">PRN</abbr>) to use when paying what you owe.</p>

<h4>Agents</h4>

<p>You should use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-revenue-and-customs-disclosure-service"><abbr title="Digital Disclosure Service">DDS</abbr></a> to notify us of your client’s disclosure. We’ll then send you a <abbr title="Disclosure Reference Number">DRN</abbr> and a <abbr title="Payment Reference Number">PRN</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your client can use form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/authorise-hmrc-to-temporarily-deal-with-your-tax-adviser-comp1a">COMP1a</a> to allow us to deal directly with you about a disclosure made using the <abbr title="Digital Disclosure Service">DDS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you’ve notified and realise you no longer need to make a disclosure you must tell us by <a class="govuk-link" href="#helpline">calling the helpline</a>. If you do not, we’ll take follow up action to secure a disclosure from you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Disclose</h3>

<p>You can do this as soon as you have your <abbr title="Disclosure Reference Number">DRN</abbr>. But you must disclose within 90 days of the date that HMRC acknowledges your notification.</p>

<p>You can make a disclosure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-revenue-and-customs-disclosure-service">about your own tax affairs or your company’s tax affairs</a> if you’re a director, or company secretary</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-disclose-income-or-gains">on behalf of someone else</a> (for example, if you’re a tax adviser)</li>
  <li>about a trust or estate</li>
  <li>about a limited liability partnership</li>
</ul>

<p>When you submit your disclosure you must pay what you owe using the <abbr title="Payment Reference Number">PRN</abbr>.</p>

<p>Make sure that we get your disclosure and payment within 90 days of the date we issue the notification acknowledgement. If you cannot pay what you owe by the deadline we give you, you must have made payment arrangements with us by that date.</p>

<p>You must do this before you submit your disclosure.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Prepare your disclosure</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>How to calculate what you owe</h3>

<p>Depending on your circumstances this could be simple or complicated. You may want to get independent professional advice. Although you’ve 90 days from the date of the notification acknowledgement to make your disclosure, start gathering together your information and records as early as possible.</p>

<p>You’ll need to work out the additional liabilities for each year that’s wrong. You do not need to include any income in your disclosure that you’ve already declared. This is because tax should already have been paid on this income.</p>

<p>If you’ve already had <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> income or told HMRC about some other income and you’re now disclosing additional income for any year, make sure that you take this into account in your calculations.</p>

<p>Once you’ve calculated the income you need to disclose, work out how much tax you owe on that income. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-income-tax">rates of Income Tax</a> you’ll pay depend on how much income you earn above your Personal Allowance (the annual amount of tax-free income).</p>

<p>For those who make <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/understand-self-assessment-bill/payments-on-account">payments on account</a>, you should consider these when making your calculation.</p>

<p>You may be able to use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/calculate-tax-interest-and-penalties-for-the-tax-years-ended-5-april-1998-to-5-april-2018">the calculator</a> to work out interest and penalties that are due on tax liability for up to the previous 20 years. You’ll need to calculate the tax liability due for each year manually prior to using this tool.</p>

<p>If you or your partner are getting tax credits, or you’ve recently made a claim, you should still make a disclosure but tick the appropriate box on your disclosure form. The information will be passed to the tax credit office to consider. You’ll be notified separately of any changes we may need to make to the amount of tax credits you get for the relevant years. If you’ve made a joint claim for tax credits you should tell your partner that the award may be adjusted as a result of your disclosure.</p>

<p>Companies and other organisations (including clubs, societies, associations and other unincorporated bodies) need to determine the amount of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/corporation-tax">Corporation Tax</a> to disclose on the understated profit arising from this undeclared income. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-corporation-tax">rate of Corporation Tax</a> you’ll need to pay will depend on circumstances. You’ll have to consider notifying <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/prepare-file-annual-accounts-for-limited-company">Companies House if you’ve submitted accounts that need amending</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>If you do not have all the business records you need to make your disclosure</h3>

<p>If your records are incomplete you should estimate the undisclosed income and gains and use this to make your disclosure. We may ask you to explain how you’ve worked out any estimates you’ve used, so keep your calculations.</p>

<p>You’ll need your bank statements for the period of your disclosure. If you do not have them, contact your bank as soon as possible to get copies. If you cannot get copy statements, work out your income by using more recent statements as a guide to your income and expenditure. We may ask you to explain why you could not get copy statements.</p>

<p>If you have not kept proper business records you should start to immediately. This is your chance to put things right from now on. If we find in the future that you’ve failed to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/keeping-your-pay-tax-records">keep appropriate records</a>, we can penalise you up to £3,000.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Income to include in your disclosure</h3>

<p>Include all of the income you’ve not told HMRC about before in your disclosure.</p>

<h4>Income earned in either the current tax year or the year before the current tax year</h4>

<p>Any income you’ve had in the current tax year should not be included in your disclosure. If you’re not registered for Self Assessment you’ll need to register now either for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment">Income Tax</a> or in the case of companies, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation/set-up-your-company-for-corporation-tax">Corporation Tax</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll send you a tax return or notice to file a tax return shortly after the end of the current tax year. Report this income on that tax return by the deadline. There are different deadlines for individuals and companies.</p>

<p>Include the income you had in the year before the current tax year on a tax return rather than in your disclosure. If you’ve submitted the previous year’s tax return you can make an amendment within 12 months of the statutory filing date.</p>

<h4>Income Tax returns</h4>

<p>Income Tax returns usually need to be submitted following the end of the tax year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>31 October for paper returns</li>
  <li>31 January for online returns</li>
</ul>

<p>So it’s likely that, for the current and prior year, you’ll still have time to submit an accurate tax return including this income.</p>

<p>You can make a disclosure for all tax years up to and including 2019 to 2020.  But if we’ve sent you a tax return for that year or any year from 2017 to 2018 onwards that’s still outstanding, you must complete each return and do not include these tax years on this disclosure form.</p>

<h4>Company Tax Returns</h4>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/company-tax-returns">Company’s Tax Returns</a> should be submitted within 12 months from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/corporation-tax-accounting-period">accounting period end date</a>.</p>

<p>If your Company Tax Returns are outstanding, you should file all outstanding tax returns that are within 4 years from the end of the accounting period. Include income for earlier years in your disclosure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>How many years to include in your disclosure</h3>

<p>The number of years that you need to disclose depends on your understanding of when you should have told HMRC about getting this income or gain.</p>

<p>If you’re making a voluntary disclosure, you’ll know why you have not told us about your income or paid the right amount of tax before. You must decide whether you made an error:</p>

<ul>
  <li>despite taking reasonable care</li>
  <li>because you were careless</li>
  <li>because it was something you did deliberately</li>
  <li>where the lost tax involves an offshore matter or transfer which makes the loss of tax significantly harder for HMRC to identify</li>
</ul>

<p>How much you pay will depend on the answers to those questions.</p>

<h4>If you failed to notify HMRC that you’d started in business</h4>

<p>If you’re an individual (including an individual within a partnership), the latest you should tell us that you started in business is 5 October in your business’s second tax year.</p>

<p>If, for example, you’ve tax to pay on income in the tax year ended 5 April 2021, you need to let HMRC know by 5 October 2021.</p>

<p>We send a newly formed limited company, a form CT41G (Corporation Tax — Information for new companies) within a few days of the company registering with Companies House. This form is usually sent by post to your company’s registered office. If you do not get this form you must still tell us within 3 months of your company becoming active. For example, by starting business activity or starting to trade. The best way to do this is to use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/new-business-register-for-tax">HMRC’s Online Service</a>.</p>

<p>If you did not register for a Self Assessment tax return by the appropriate deadline you’ll have to pay us what you owe up to a maximum of 20 years.</p>

<h4>If you’ve taken reasonable care</h4>

<p>You’ll only have to pay us what you owe for a maximum of 4 years if you registered for a Self Assessment tax return by the appropriate deadline, and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>took care to make sure your tax affairs were right</li>
  <li>still did not pay enough</li>
</ul>

<p>This means you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure that your tax affairs for the current and later tax years are accurately reported on tax returns by the appropriate deadlines</li>
  <li>make sure that your tax affairs for the year before the current tax year are reported on the tax return that we issued to you for that year by the appropriate deadline</li>
  <li>fill in the disclosure form and pay us what you owe for the 3 years before this</li>
</ul>

<h4>If you were careless</h4>

<p>If you registered for a Self Assessment tax return by the appropriate deadline, but did not paid enough because you were careless, you must pay HMRC what you owe for a maximum of 6 years. This means you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure that your tax affairs for the current and later tax years are accurately reported on tax returns by the appropriate deadlines</li>
  <li>make sure that your tax affairs for the year prior to the current tax year are reported on the tax return that was issued to you for that year by the appropriate deadline</li>
  <li>fill in the disclosure form and pay us what you owe for the 5 years prior to this</li>
</ul>

<h4>If you deliberately misled HMRC about this income</h4>

<p>If you’ve deliberately not paid enough tax you’ll have to pay us what you owe for a maximum of 20 years. 
Deliberately means that you knew you owed tax but chose not to tell us or that you knew the figures on your tax return were wrong when you submitted it.</p>

<h4>If the lost tax involves an offshore matter or offshore transfer which make the loss of tax significantly harder for HMRC to identify</h4>

<p>An offshore matter or offshore transfer can apply in the case of Income Tax (including <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>), Capital Gains Tax or Inheritance Tax.</p>

<p>The number of years you need to disclose depends on your understanding of the income that resulted in the inaccuracy. Where the inaccuracy involved an offshore matter, you will have to pay us what you owe for a maximum of 12 years from the end of the relevant period. The earliest year this applies to is the tax year 2015 to 2016 so you do not need to disclose any inaccuracies of this nature prior to this year where reasonable care has been taken.</p>

<p>Where the inaccuracy is due to careless behaviour the earliest year this applies to is the tax year 2013 to 2014.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Other liabilities you should include in your disclosure</h3>

<h4>Other income liabilities including non-business income</h4>

<p>You must include all income and gains in your disclosure where you’ve not paid enough tax. This may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>investment income not taxed before you get it, for example, interest</li>
  <li>taxed income where additional tax is owed</li>
  <li>income from property or land rental, less the expenses relating to that income</li>
</ul>

<p>But if your only undeclared income is from residential letting use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/let-property-campaign">Let Property Campaign</a> to disclose this.</p>

<h4>Loans to directors: Corporation Tax Act 2010, Section 455</h4>

<p>If you’re a company director and take money out of your company that’s not a salary or a dividend, over and above any money you’ve put in, you’re classed as having had the benefit of a director’s loan. If this applies, the company may have tax to pay.</p>

<p>When you pay off a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/directors-loans">director’s loan</a> that your company has paid Corporation Tax on, your company may be able to reclaim that amount of Corporation Tax paid, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="#helpline">call the helpline</a>.</p>

<h4>Capital gains</h4>

<p>You must disclose all <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax">capital gains</a> that you’ve not declared before. For example, capital gains made on the disposal of investments, such as land, property, shares, stocks, bonds and goodwill.</p>

<p>A company will include its chargeable gains on its Company Tax Return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>Other potential liabilities you can tell us about in your disclosure</h3>

<p>You cannot give details of the liabilities listed below on your disclosure form, but tick the relevant box in the ‘Other potential liability’ section of the form and follow the guidance in the disclosure form and below. The campaigns team will liaise with the relevant department to confirm you successfully resolved any issues with these liabilities.</p>

<h4>Employer liabilities</h4>

<p>If you employed anyone, you may have to pay some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/paye"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> tax and National Insurance contributions</a> on what you paid to your employees. You need to notify HMRC that you have employment liabilities to settle.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> issues</h4>

<p>If you want to make a disclosure of a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> matter because you’ve exceeded the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold and need to register, then you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration">register online</a> or if you cannot, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-application-for-registration-vat1">register by post</a>.</p>

<p>Most applications for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registration can be done online but there are some circumstances where HMRC needs you to make a postal application. For all standard registration applications, send your form to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

VAT Registration Service
<br>Crown House
<br>Birch Street
<br>Wolverhampton
<br>WV1 4JX

<p>If you’ve made an error on a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return you’ve submitted then you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-corrections">put certain errors right</a>, subject to conditions, by adjusting your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return.</p>

<p>If you do not meet the conditions for adjusting the return then you must make the adjustment in writing. You can notify any error in writing including those where you could make the adjustment on a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return.

<h4>Class 2 National Insurance contributions</h4>

<p>If you’re self-employed you normally have to pay Class 2 National Insurance contributions. If you have not yet registered to pay <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates">Class 2 National Insurance contributions</a> do so immediately so you do not lose out on future benefits. Low earners can apply for a Certificate of Small Earnings Exception and not pay Class 2 National Insurance contributions. You might decide to carry on paying them voluntarily to keep your entitlement to the State Pension and other benefits.</p>

<h4>Inheritance Tax and tax during administration periods</h4>

<p>Tick the correct box on the disclosure form if you need to tell us about Inheritance Tax. Inheritance Tax is paid if a person’s estate (their property, money and possessions) is worth more than £325,000 when they die. This is called the ‘Inheritance Tax threshold’. We’ll pass your details on to the appropriate department and they’ll contact you if any changes are needed.</p>

<h4>Tax credits</h4>

<p>If you or your partner are getting tax credits or made a claim, you should still make a disclosure but also tick the appropriate box on the disclosure form. The information will be passed to the tax credit office to consider. You’ll be notified separately of any changes that may be required to the amount of tax credits you get or have had for the relevant years.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span>Interest</h3>

<p>HMRC charges interest from the date tax is due until the date it’s paid. Interest is calculated on a daily basis. Any additional tax that’s included in your disclosure will be late and will attract an interest charge. If you do not include the right interest, we’ll reject your disclosure as it’ll be incomplete.</p>

<p>To help individuals there’s a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/calculate-tax-interest-and-penalties-for-the-tax-years-ended-5-april-1998-to-5-april-2018">calculator</a> available to help you calculate the right amount of interest due. Only use this if your tax affairs are straightforward and you’re only entitled to basic personal allowances.</p>

<p>Companies can refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-hmrc-interest-rates-for-late-and-early-payments/rates-and-allowances-hmrc-interest-rates">HMRC interest rates</a> to work out the amount of interest to pay.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span>Penalties</h3>

<p>HMRC charges penalties on any additional tax you owe if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sent us an incorrect tax return</li>
  <li>did not tell us that you’re liable to tax</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not charge interest on these penalties unless you pay them late.</p>

<p>In specific circumstances it may not be appropriate to allow you the full reductions for disclosure. For example, if you’ve taken a significant period to correct your non-compliance, you cannot expect us to agree a full reduction for disclosure. In such cases it’s unlikely that we’ll reduce your penalty by more than 10 percentage points above the minimum of the statutory range. For this purpose we would normally consider a ‘significant period’ to be over 3 years, or less where the overall disclosure covers a longer period.</p>

<p>The factsheets on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compliance-checks-penalties-for-inaccuracies-in-returns-or-documents-ccfs7a">penalties for inaccuracies in returns</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compliance-checks-penalties-for-failure-to-notify-ccfs11">penalties for failure to notify</a> have more information on the statutory range for penalties and how they can be reduced. If you think you might not be entitled to the full reduction, you should read these factsheets which provide more detail about calculating any reduction.</p>

<p>As you’re making a disclosure, it’s you (rather than a compliance officer), who must consider and calculate any penalties in the way the factsheets describe.</p>

<p>The penalty is a percentage of the additional amount you owe. We can charge penalties of up to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100% of the tax liability if the income or gain arose in the UK</li>
  <li>200% for an offshore liability</li>
</ul>

<p>Penalties that apply to offshore income and gains depend on the category that the offshore territory falls into. This includes your disclosure.</p>

<p>Although the rate of the penalties will vary depending on your circumstances, they’ll usually be lower if you make a voluntary disclosure.</p>

<p>If you’ve taken reasonable care with your tax affairs, but you’ve not declared the right amount of tax you owe, you’ll not pay any penalties at all. We do not expect many people’s circumstances to fall within this category.</p>

<p>If you’ve not paid enough tax even though you’ve taken reasonable care with your affairs or there’s anything else you think we should consider concerning the penalties you have to pay, <a class="govuk-link" href="#helpline">call the helpline</a> before making your disclosure.</p>

<p>If we think that you’ve not included the right penalty in your disclosure, we may reject it.</p>

<h4>Your rights when considering penalties</h4>

<p>When you consider whether you need to pay a penalty in connection with your disclosure, Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights gives you certain rights.</p>

<p>You have the right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to seek help from a professional adviser</li>
  <li>to have the matter of penalties dealt with without unreasonable delay</li>
  <li>not to incriminate yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>If you decide that a penalty is due as part of this disclosure opportunity, by making the disclosure about penalties, you’ll be giving up your right to silence under Article 6. This means we can use anything you decide to tell us when considering your liability to penalties.</p>

<p>The extent to which you co-operate with us and answer our questions about penalties will still be a matter for you to decide.</p>

<h4>Other penalties</h4>

<p>Depending on your circumstances, HMRC may charge other penalties. These include late payment penalties arising because you failed to register at the right time or on tax paid late as a result of understating the tax due on your return.</p>

<h4>Calculator</h4>

<p>Individuals can use the HMRC calculator to help you calculate the interest and penalties due on the income you’re including in your disclosure.</p>

<p>If you’re making a multiple year disclosure, include all years in a single calculation, do not calculate each year on a separate basis.</p>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/calculate-tax-interest-and-penalties-for-the-tax-years-ended-5-april-1998-to-5-april-2018">penalties and interest calculator</a> if you need to include more years in your disclosure. This will help you to calculate the interest and penalties you owe for the last 20 years. This calculator is for interest and penalty calculations only and will not help you calculate the Income Tax due.</p>

<p>Companies can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-corporation-tax">Corporation Tax rates</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-hmrc-interest-rates-for-late-and-early-payments/rates-and-allowances-hmrc-interest-rates">HMRC interest rates</a> to work out the amount of tax and interest due. Calculate penalties using the tax amount understated and apply the appropriate penalty percentage shown in the factsheets on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compliance-checks-penalties-for-inaccuracies-in-returns-or-documents-ccfs7a">penalties for inaccuracies in returns</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compliance-checks-penalties-for-failure-to-notify-ccfs11">penalties for failure to notify</a>.</p>

<p>To calculate the amount to be included in the disclosure follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Calculate additional Corporation Tax liability.</li>
  <li>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-hmrc-interest-rates-for-late-and-early-payments/rates-and-allowances-hmrc-interest-rates#hmrc-interest-rates">interest table</a>.</li>
  <li>Apply the right interest to liability calculated in step 1.</li>
  <li>Apply appropriate penalty to liability calculated in step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>When we check your disclosure we’ll consider whether the penalty you’ve applied is fair. There’s a space on the disclosure form where you can give an explanation to help us reach our decision. We may need to contact you to check the fairness of the penalty if you do not give an explanation. If we think the penalty you’ve applied is too low we may carry out a further check of your tax affairs. For example, we may not accept that someone in business for many years, earning significant amounts without telling us, has not done this deliberately.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span>The declaration</h3>

<p>This is a very important part of your disclosure. You should only fill in the declaration once you’re sure that the disclosure is right and complete, and that you understand why we’ve asked you to include penalties in your disclosure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span>The offer</h3>

<p>As part of your disclosure, you’ll make an offer to pay your outstanding liabilities. The offer, together with HMRC’s acceptance letter to you will create a legally binding contract between you and us. There’s a letter of offer at the end of your disclosure submission.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Pay HMRC</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>When to pay</h3>

<p>When you pay, you’ll need a <abbr title="Payment Reference Number">PRN</abbr>. You’ll get the <abbr title="Payment Reference Number">PRN</abbr> when you notify HMRC that you intend to make a disclosure.</p>

<p>Unless you’ve contacted us to agree additional time to pay, you should send your payment at the same time as you send your disclosure. We should receive it no later than the 90 day deadline given on your notification acknowledgement letter.</p>

<p>If you do not pay your outstanding liabilities, we’ll take steps to recover the money.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Payment methods</h3>

<p>Use the <abbr title="Payment Reference Number">PRN</abbr> we’ve sent you to make a full payment of your outstanding liabilities. We accept payment by a range of methods but it’s best to make your payment electronically, it’s the most secure method.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>If you cannot pay the full amount</h3>

<p>HMRC expects you to pay what you owe when you make your disclosure.</p>

<p>If you cannot pay the full amount, let us know as soon as possible and before you send in your disclosure by <a class="govuk-link" href="#helpline">calling the helpline</a>.</p>

<p>When you phone, we’ll want to talk to you about your current financial position so we can tell you what we think you should pay and when. To help us decide, you’ll need to tell us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <abbr title="Disclosure Reference Number">DRN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>how and when you intend to pay what you owe</li>
  <li>what your current weekly or monthly income and outgoings are</li>
  <li>what you own, including your home, other property or land, vehicles, investments, money in the bank</li>
  <li>what you owe, including mortgages, loans and credit cards</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot pay the full amount do not submit your disclosure or payment until you’ve spoken to us.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>After HMRC gets your disclosure</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Accepting your disclosure</h3>

<p>HMRC expects to accept most disclosures. If, after checks, we’re satisfied that you’ve made a full disclosure, we’ll accept it as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Acknowledging your disclosure</h3>

<p>When HMRC gets your disclosure, we’ll send you an acknowledgement as soon as possible. If you’ve not had an acknowledgement within 2 weeks, <a class="govuk-link" href="#helpline">call the helpline</a>.</p>

<p>We expect most disclosures to be self-explanatory but we may need to contact you or your tax adviser to clarify any points. We might also ask you to give evidence of your circumstances to satisfy us that your disclosure is complete. Your full co-operation is one of the conditions of using this opportunity. Failure to co-operate may result in us not accepting your offer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Considering your disclosure</h3>

<p>HMRC will review all disclosures. If after those checks are done we decide to accept your disclosure, we’ll send you a letter accepting your offer. If we cannot accept the disclosure we’ll contact you.</p>

<p>If following our checks, we find that a disclosure is largely wrong we’ll seek much higher penalties. It’s also possible that in exceptional circumstances, an incomplete disclosure, we may consider it under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-investigation/hmrc-criminal-investigation-policy">HMRC’s Criminal Investigation Policy</a>. In such cases we may use the material in the disclosure as evidence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Disclosures that we’re unlikely to accept</h3>

<p>HMRC will not accept disclosures that are found to be largely wrong or incomplete when we check them.</p>

<p>It’s also unlikely that we’ll accept disclosures from customers where we’ve opened an enquiry or compliance check before you’ve notified your intention to submit a disclosure under the campaign. Those who want to disclose liabilities under these circumstances should tell the HMRC person conducting the enquiry.</p>

<p>A full and early disclosure will influence the amount of penalty we seek in the ongoing enquiry or investigation.</p>

<p>We’ll not accept disclosures where we believe the money that’s the subject of the disclosure is the proceeds of serious organised crime. Examples of this include <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> fraud, <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> bogus registration fraud, organised tax credit fraud and instances where there’s wider criminality such as an ongoing police investigation.</p>

<p>An important factor for us when we decide if we’ll carry out civil or criminal investigations into cases of fiscal fraud, is whether the taxpayer has made a full and unprompted disclosure of any amounts evaded or improperly reclaimed. Whilst we’d consider each case on its merits, a full and unprompted disclosure would suggest that a civil, rather than criminal, investigation was appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>If you leave something important out of your disclosure</h3>

<p>If after submitting your disclosure you realise you’ve missed something out, you should immediately contact HMRC to make an amendment. You can do this by <a class="govuk-link" href="#helpline">calling the helpline</a>, or writing to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

ISBC, Campaigns and Projects
<br>HM Revenue and Customs
<br>BX9 1QZ
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>If we get information indicating that your disclosure was wrong, we’ve the right to look at your tax affairs again. We may write to you about the information we’ve got and if necessary, we’ll send you assessments to collect any extra tax due. These penalties are likely to be higher than those in your disclosure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Information we get after we accept your disclosure</h3>

<p>HMRC will continue to get new information that may indicate someone has additional liabilities to tax. We’ll use this to identify customers where a disclosure could have been made or where the disclosure made is not what was expected based on the information we hold. If we discover that a customer has an additional liability, the time limits for using this information are determined by the person’s behaviour.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Publishing your details</h3>

<p>In certain circumstances HMRC can publish the details of those penalised for deliberately failing in their tax obligations. If you come forward voluntarily you’ll earn the maximum reduction of any relevant penalties for the quality of disclosure, and we’ll not publish your details as long as you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify us that you’re going to make a disclosure</li>
  <li>make a full disclosure including full payment of tax you owe which proves to be both accurate and complete before the deadline we give you</li>
  <li>cooperate fully with us if we ask you for any further information</li>
</ul>

<p>We may include you in a list of deliberate defaulters if you do not follow these steps.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>Who’s liable for a company’s penalties</h3>

<p>A company officer or officers may be liable to pay part, or all of a company’s penalty for a deliberate inaccuracy, failure to notify or wrongdoing, but only where the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inaccuracy, failure or wrongdoing was attributable to the officer</li>
  <li>officer gained or attempted to gain personally from the offence</li>
  <li>company is, or is likely to become, insolvent</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Getting things right for the future</h2>

<p>Once you’ve submitted your disclosure, HMRC expects you to keep your tax affairs in order in the future. This means that you should continue to accurately declare your income and gains for those years that fall after the latest year you include in your disclosure. You should make sure any tax returns that are issued to you are returned with accurate information by the appropriate deadlines.</p>
