<h2>Support for Jobs</h2>

<p>On 8 July the Chancellor for the Exchequer announced the government’s Support for Jobs plan which will
protect existing jobs and help create more. This is on top of the support package rolled out from March helping
those who need it most during the pandemic. Read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/rishis-plan-for-jobs-will-help-britain-bounce-back">Support for Jobs plan</a>.</p>

<h2>Ethnic minority groups disproportionately affected by Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>

<p>This factsheet, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bitc.org.uk/fact-sheet/covid-19-ethnicity-and-economic-impact/" rel="external">COVID-19: ethnicity and economic impact</a>, examines the impact of the pandemic on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic people in the workplace. Looking at the pandemic through a race lens, the factsheet looks back at previous economic downturns, the current situation and shares guidance on the actions employers can take to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the ethnic minority workforce.</p>

<h2>Sign the race at work charter</h2>

<p><abbr title="Business in the Community">BITC</abbr>’s Race at Work Charter provides a framework for employers to tackle barriers faced by people from ethnic minority backgrounds in recruitment and progression. It asks employers to publicly commit to 5 calls to action to ensure that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic employees are represented at all levels and that their organisations are representative of British society today.</p>

<p>Sign today to join a network of almost <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bitc.org.uk/race-at-work-charter-signatories/" rel="external">300 employers</a>. <abbr title="Business in the Community">BITC</abbr> supports signatories with a wealth of free resources and materials including toolkits and factsheets, access to events and the opportunity to broaden your D&amp;I network.

<h2>DWP launches Labour Market Resilience campaign - Employer Help</h2>

<p>A new Jobcentre Plus site has launched to offer you helpful advice about how to fill your critical vacancies, using the Find a Job service. There are also useful tips on how to ensure you do not diminish the response to your job ads by being too specific and help to make sure you recognise transferable skills. Find a Job can help you reach more than 1.8 million registered users and is free to use. Due to coronavirus (COVID-190, many of them have recent experience and skills from other sectors that could really benefit your business. It’s easy to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/advertise-job">register, post and manage your vacancies online</a>.</p>

<h2>Government unlocks £150 million from dormant accounts for coronavirus response</h2>

<p>Of the £150 million, £10 million will be brought forward for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://youthfuturesfoundation.org/" rel="external">Youth Futures Foundation</a> to help organisations who support unemployed, disadvantaged young people across the country into jobs. They have launched an Emergency Levelling Up Youth Fund to support young people from hardest hit communities and will expand their development and impact grants programme to rapidly increase youth employment provisions. Applications for the funding are open but close on 31 July, with awards being made in September.</p>
