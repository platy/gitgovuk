<p>Welcome to our May bulletin, intended to provide <abbr title="Local Employment Partnerships">LEPs</abbr> with up to date information, articles, research, case studies, as well as strategic and practical advice about all things ethnic minority employment.</p>

<p>Please share with us any information on activities you are doing, case studies, or initiatives, around increasing ethnic minority employment. We would really like to hear about the great work you are doing. Get in touch at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:racedisparity.auditcorrespondence@dwp.gov.uk">racedisparity.auditcorrespondence@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Labour market statistics show record figures for ethnic minority employment</h2>

<p>On 14 May the Office of National Statistics published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/labourmarketstatusbyethnicgroupa09" rel="external">latest employment figures</a> showing a record high employment rate for people from ethnic minority backgrounds. This latest quarter of data shows continued progress since the target to increase ethnic minority employment by 20% by 2020 was set in 2015. 603,000 more people from ethnic minority backgrounds are in employment – that’s an 18% increase in the number of ethnic minority people employed and 91% towards the target.</p>

<h2>Ethnicity and race business toolkit</h2>

<p>The Maturity Matrix was launched in the House of Commons as part of the work of the All Parliamentary Group for Governance and Inclusive Leadership.</p>

<p>This toolkit is designed to start honest conversations about the race and ethnicity agenda within your workforce. Download the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.investinginethnicity.com/matrix.html" rel="external">Maturity Matrix toolkit</a>.</p>

<h2>Dormant account funds announcement</h2>

<p>In March a new, independent youth organisation set up using dormant bank accounts funding – the ‘Youth Futures Foundation’ – was launched and announced their founding Chair, Joe Montgomery. The Youth Futures Foundation will focus on removing barriers for those furthest from the labour market and to help address the ethnic disparities in youth unemployment revealed in the government’s Race Disparity Audit, using £90 million from dormant assets.</p>

<p>It is expected the new organisation will start making allocations from the fund towards the end of this year. The work will also be supported by the National Lottery Community Fund. Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fenews.co.uk/press-releases/212-executive-appointments/27933-youth-futures-foundation-announces-joe-montgomery-as-its-founding-chair" rel="external">the Youth Futures Foundation</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Employment Related Services Association">ERSA</abbr> Employability Day</h2>

<p>The fourth UK Employability Day will take place on 28 June 2019. Thousands of organisations across the country will join the celebration for those supporting people into work. Local stakeholders will be hosting jobs fairs and activity days showing the country the importance of employment support at the frontline.</p>

<p>This year’s theme is ‘closing the gaps’. Organisations will be demonstrating how they help close employment disparities between groups by supporting disadvantaged people to enter, sustain and progress in employment.</p>

<p>It’s a great opportunity to host an event or visit a local centre. We would love to hear from you if you get involved. Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ersa.org.uk/empday19" rel="external">how to get involved with Employability Day 2019</a>.</p>

<h2>Tapping Potential: Guidelines for UK businesses to employ refugees</h2>

<p>On 2 May the Tapping Potential toolkit was launched by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in Canary Wharf to inform and educate businesses on how they can employ refugees.</p>

<p>The guidelines were drawn up by UNHCR, Business in the Community, the International Organisation of Migration, the Home Office and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. As well as offering tips to foster employment and prepare companies to hire refugees, they provide guidance to employers on the rules and regulations covering employing refugees, and their right to work. The toolkit provides links to private partnerships and non-profit organisations working in the area as well as an annex on immigration status and work entitlements. It references a 10-point action plan to inspire collaboration across governments and employers and also provides  case studies from employers that have initiated programmes to clear the path for refugees into employment.</p>

<p>Waitrose &amp; Partners, IKEA and Grant Thornton are among the organisations working to provide opportunities for refugees to gain employment.
