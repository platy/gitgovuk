<p>Welcome to the June Local Employment Partnership (<abbr title="Local Employment Partnership">LEP</abbr>) Bulletin. This edition focuses on youth ethnic minority employment. The Covid-19 pandemic disproportionately affected young ethnic minorities employment and the Government is committed to maximising employment in the economic recovery and improving opportunities for all through work.</p>

<p>This Bulletin covers current <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> programmes and highlights information on best practices in recruitment of young ethnic minorities. Please send your feedback and any ideas you may have for future editions to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Robert.Cooper1@dwp.gov.uk">Robert.Cooper1@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Supporting young ethnic minorities</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> works in partnership with organisations supporting young ethnic minorities into employment. For example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthemployment.org.uk/" rel="external">Youth Employment UK</a> brigade exemplar employers and offer the ‘Youth Friendly Employer Badge’ linking young people to opportunities. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://makingtheleap.org.uk/" rel="external">Making the Leap</a> has a membership of employers that promote diversity and inclusion within the workplace. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.foundervine.com/" rel="external">Foundervine</a> offers support to young Black men going into self-employment, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/internship-experience-uk/" rel="external">Bright Network</a> offers internships for Black students and recent graduates.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> are keen to engage with employers and can provide a named employer adviser to work with you to fill your vacancies. If interested, please complete our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/contact-employer-services/contact-form" rel="external">online enquiry form</a> or call 0800 169 0178.</p>

<h2>New <abbr title="Chartered Institute of Personnel Development">CIPD</abbr> guidance to help employers recruit and retain marginalised young people</h2>

<p>The Chartered Institute of Personnel Development (<abbr title="Chartered Institute of Personnel Development">CIPD</abbr>) have developed a series of guidance for employers in partnership with Youth Futures Foundation to help recruit and retain marginalised young people into good work, as part of their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cipd.co.uk/news-views/campaigns/one-million-chances#gref" rel="external">One Million Chances Campaign</a>.</p>

<p>The guidance is informed by evidence on ‘what works’ and provides practical recommendations accompanied by tools and techniques employers can use in their recruitment process.</p>

<p>Recommendations to improve recruitment include: invest in understanding specific cohorts of young people, tailoring approaches to reach them where they are (which might be different for different communities); provide clear structure for interviews and guidance for interviewers; use cognitive ability tests that compensate for potential sub-group differences, and; track data to detect bias in recruitment processes.</p>

<p>Recommendations to retain marginalised young people include: focus on key factors that drive employee turnover, gathering evidence through targeted surveys and discussions; use structured processes in assessment for promotion and progression; support managers to foster inclusion through training and raising awareness; provide diversity training aimed at fostering genuine change in the organisation.</p>

<h2>Article by Youth Employment UK: building more diverse organisations</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthemployment.org.uk/" rel="external">Youth Employment UK</a> work with over 700 employers committed to developing best youth employment practice through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthemployment.org.uk/the-good-youth-employment-charter/" rel="external">Good Youth Employment Charter</a>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthemployment.org.uk/recognising-talent-good-youth-employment-charter/" rel="external">Recognising Talent</a> is a key principle encouraging employers to open-up opportunities to young people who face barriers.</p>

<p>Youth-friendly employers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check job and person specifications ensuring they are clear, use inclusive language and only essential asks are listed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Talk to young people, using insight from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthemployment.org.uk/dev/wp-content/themes/yeuk/files/youth-voice-census-report-2021.pdf" rel="external">Youth Voice Census</a> and apply this knowledge to attraction and recruitment processes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use blind recruitment, and tools such as BeApplied.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Find out more about the Good Youth Employment Charter for support and information via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthemployment.org.uk/" rel="external">YEUK website</a> or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:info@youthemployment.org.uk">info@youthemployment.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Become a mentor and make a difference</h2>

<p>Some young people do not have access to social capital, role models or inspiring employer mentors. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Mentoring Circles bridge this gap bringing together employers and young people aged 16-24 to share experiences and provide advice.</p>

<p>Employers can build understanding of barriers faced by young people, gain insight into their attraction and recruitment processes, and access a diverse talent pool of jobseekers.</p>

<p>Employers and young people who have participated in Mentoring Circles have had positive experiences with many young people moving into work and employers feeling they had made a real difference.</p>

<p>Employers interested in mentoring are asked to commit to around six hours over three weeks. To find out how to get involved, please contact your local Employment Advisor using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-your-nearest-jobcentre.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Job Centre Plus local office search</a>.</p>
