<p>Welcome to our March Local Employment Partnership (<abbr title="Local Employment Partnership">LEP</abbr>) Bulletin, intended to provide <abbr title="Local Employment Partnerships">LEPs</abbr> with up to date information, articles, research, case studies, as well as strategic and practical advice about Ethnic Minority Employment.</p>

<h2>Inclusive Britain: government response to the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities</h2>

<p>On 17 March 2022, the Government published “Inclusive Britain” its response to the March 2021 report by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities. “Inclusive Britain” sets out over 70 actions in response to the Commission’s recommendations, grouped under 3 main themes: trust and fairness, opportunity and agency, and inclusion. Together, these actions set out an inclusion strategy for Britain. The Department for Work and Pensions are taking forward action on progression out of low pay and working with the Department for Education to open up access to apprenticeships.

<h2>New jobs mission to get 500,000 into work</h2>

<p>A new target to move half a million people into jobs by the end of June launched 27 January under ambitious government plans to turbo-charge our national recovery from COVID-19.</p>

<p>As we move out of the pandemic, with restrictions lifted and life returning to normal, the ‘Way to Work’ campaign will focus on getting job-ready people off Universal Credit and into work, rapidly filling vacancies which are at a record high.

<h2>
<span class="number">150 new </span> jobcentres and Youth Hubs now open</h2>

<p>From February 2022, thousands more jobseekers can now access tailored face-to-face job support and meet local employers as 150 new jobcentres are opened, levelling up opportunities across the country.</p>

<p>These will be at the heart of the government’s Way to Work Campaign to encourage more people across Great Britain into jobs. Towns and cities from Falkirk to Torquay are now home to over 150 new temporary jobcentres and over 150 Youth Hubs, with more to follow, as the government pledges to get 500,000 people a job by the end of June.

<h2>Nearly half of <abbr title="Financial Times Stock Exchange">FTSE</abbr> 350 firms now have <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> directors</h2>

<p>123 of the largest listed companies have appointed a director of colour on their boards, up from 59 last year</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="Financial Times Stock Exchange">FTSE</abbr> 350 companies with a director of colour has jumped 108% over the past year, as companies face greater pressure to increase diversity across top leadership roles.
