<p>Welcome to our December Local Employment Partnership (<abbr title="Local Employment Partnership">LEP</abbr>) Bulletin, intended  to provide <abbr title="Local Employment Partnerships">LEPs</abbr> with up to date information, articles, research, case studies, as well  as strategic and practical advice about Ethnic Minority Employment.</p>

<h2>Google Career Certificates Webinar</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) has partnered with Google to provide  9,000 jobseekers across the UK with scholarships to gain a Google Career Certificate. Google Career Certificate was launched in May 2021 and it has been a  great success to date with nearly 6000 referrals made by Jobcentres. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would now like to open the ability to refer to the programme to key partners such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local Authorities</li>
  <li>Mayoral Combined Authorities</li>
  <li><abbr title="Local Employment Partnership">LEP</abbr></li>
</ul>

<p>Find out more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dwp-and-google-join-forces-to-grow-jobseekers-digital-skills">Career Certificate</a>.</p>

<h2>Levelling Up Across the UK</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State for Levelling Up recently launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/200-million-boost-to-help-level-up-communities-across-the-uk">£200 million boost to help level up communities across the UK</a>, saying “There is incredible talent spread right across our great country and this investment will unlock the opportunities to match.”</p>

<p>The Government is backing 477 locally led, innovative projects that will help breathe new life into towns, villages, and coastal communities across the UK as the government delivers on its mission to level up the nation and commitment to net zero.</p>

<h2>Apprenticeships</h2>

<p>Research from the government sponsored Social Mobility Commission has shown  that apprenticeships need to do more to meet their promise for social mobility. So they have launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/toolkit-apprenticeships-that-work-for-all">new tool kit to design apprenticeship programmes</a>. It is designed to provide employers, training providers and apprenticeship practitioners  with tailored guidance on developing inclusive apprenticeship programmes that fulfil  their potential as tools of social mobility.</p>

<p>The apprenticeship funding bands which sets out the funding bands that will apply for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-funding-bands">existing apprenticeship frameworks and apprenticeship standards has been updated</a>.</p>

<h2>Workforce Integration Network</h2>

<p>In London the Jobcentres in Brent and Newham are partnering with the Moving On Up (<abbr title="Moving On Up">MOU</abbr>) initiative led by Trust For London and the Black Training Enterprise Group. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/communities/workforce-integration-network-win" rel="external"><abbr title="Moving On Up">MOU</abbr> have now joined with the Mayor for London’s Workforce Integration Network (<abbr title="Workforce Integration Network">WIN</abbr>) programme</a> which is supporting young black men aged 16 to 24 years into living wage employment in London. It is currently focusing on the construction and digital sectors and will engage other sectors and groups over time.</p>

<h2>Ethnicity Pay Gaps</h2>

<p>The government has reiterated its belief that to build a fair economy, firms must reflect the nation’s diversity. This followed from several newspapers covering new analysis of the FTSE 100 which suggests only <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/15/just-13-out-ftse-100-employers-reveal-ethnicity-pay-gaps" rel="external">13% of the largest UK companies have revealed their ethnicity pay gaps</a> amid calls for the government to make this mandatory.</p>
