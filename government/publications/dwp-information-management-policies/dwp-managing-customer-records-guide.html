<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) is legally required to manage its customer records to ensure it complies with data protection legislation, including the Data Protection Act (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>) 2018 and General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>). The legislation requires that any personal data must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner</li>
  <li>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</li>
  <li>adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary</li>
  <li>accurate and kept up to date</li>
  <li>kept for no longer than is necessary</li>
  <li>processed securely</li>
</ul>

<p>Customer records are defined as any piece of information that relates to our claimants or customers regardless of its content and format.</p>

<p>Compliance with these instructions is the responsibility of all staff.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Retention of customer records</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Classification of records</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has 2 classifications of customer records:</p>

<ol>
  <li>‘supporting’</li>
  <li>‘non-supporting/ephemeral’</li>
</ol>

<p>The definitions are as follows.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Supporting records</h3>

<p>Supporting records are documents or data that support a benefit or child maintenance outcome decision, and contains information on which that decision is based.  It is generally information that would be supplied in the event of an appeal or fraud investigation, or that affects the amount of benefit paid or maintenance assessment. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">section 3</a> for general guidance on retention of customer documents.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Non-supporting/ephemeral records</h3>

<p>Non-supporting/ephemeral records are documents or data that do not fit into the definition of supporting documents. These are of a general nature and do not affect the claim in any way. For example, general enquiries, internal templates, front cover sheets.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> How long do I keep records?</h3>

<h3>Telephone call recording</h3>

<p>Specific retention periods apply for telephone calls recorded in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> operations. These are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting calls: 14 months from date of call and then deleted</li>
  <li>non-supporting or ephemeral calls: 4 weeks from date of call and then deleted</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a service line receives both supporting and non-supporting / ephemeral calls, the retention period will align with supporting calls.</p>

<p>All directorates must comply with the above guidelines. There can be exceptions where there is a departmental interest. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-4">section 4 for further details of those exceptions</a>.</p>

<p>Where an interest applies the relevant call(s) can be retained for longer that the standard telephone retention period. An exception cannot be applied indefinitely and the retention reason should be reviewed to ensure continued compliance.</p>

<h3>Non-telephone records</h3>

<p>The following retention policy is applied to all non-telephone records in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>supporting records: generally records classified as supporting are retained for 14 months after <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s live interest in the claim has ended. As with telephone records, exceptions can apply to this. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-4">section 4 for further details of those exceptions</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>non-supporting or ephemeral records: These should be retained locally for 4 weeks and then paper records must be destroyed via confidential waste.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The retention period is ‘triggered’ when a case is closed or the end of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> interest.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Destruction of benefit records</h3>

<p>When destroying benefit documents/data, we are applying <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> information management policy and not the Data Protection Act (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>). The <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> does not specify retention periods.</p>

<p>The following standard responses must be used when members of the public make enquiries about the destruction of records:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>when documents/data have been destroyed in line with the information management policy, use standard letter 1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when documents/data have not been destroyed in line with the information management policy, including any that may have been destroyed in error (either partially or fully), use standard letter 2</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If benefit records are held by an external organisation, a contractor’s declaration must be completed and sent to the Departmental Records Officer when the records are destroyed.</p>

<h4>Destruction embargoes</h4>

<p>Destruction embargoes may be applied to our records from time to time based on business need. This can be applied to records irrespective of format. Please contact the Information and Records Management team for details of any such embargoes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> General retention principles</h2>

<p>Users must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>only retain information required to support a claim by applying the principles of what is ‘supporting’ and what is ‘ephemeral’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>apply retention periods to all claim documents or data whether the claim is successful or not</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>destroy all paper documents that are scanned into electronic systems within 4 weeks of being scanned</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>retain clerical benefits, including Armed Forces Independence Payment locally, apart from Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB) claims which should be sent to remote stores</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>photocopy documents identified as valuable. The original should be returned to the claimant and the photocopy sent to remote stores</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>save customer information in the right place for the right length of time</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Users must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>print any documents relating to a benefit that are uploaded onto the Document Repository System (<abbr title="Document Repository System">DRS</abbr>) unless they are required to support an appeal or prosecution where access to <abbr title="Document Repository System">DRS</abbr> is not available</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>print information stored on electronic systems, including Universal Credit live service or Universal Credit full service and CMS2012, unless it is required to support an appeal or prosecution, and access to these systems is not available</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>retain duplicate information under any circumstances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>retain customer records ‘just in case’ they may be needed at some point in the future</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>retain supporting records locally for longer than 4 weeks after they have been uploaded to the <abbr title="Document Repository System">DRS</abbr>. Once a supporting document has been uploaded to <abbr title="Document Repository System">DRS</abbr> it can be destroyed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send ephemeral records to remote stores under any circumstances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send non-associated post to remote stores if it does not have a parent file (a live original claim) there already</p>
  </li>
</ul>
