<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) is legally required to manage its customer records to ensure it complies with data protection legislation, including the Data Protection Act (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>) 2018 and General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>). The legislation requires that any personal data must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner</li>
  <li>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</li>
  <li>adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary</li>
  <li>accurate and kept up to date</li>
  <li>kept for no longer than is necessary</li>
  <li>processed securely</li>
</ul>

<p>a. Customer records are defined as any piece of information that relates to our claimants or customers regardless of its content and format, for example, the retention policy is ‘format neutral’.</p>

<p>What is a record?</p>

<span class="number">2.1 </span> Classification of records</h3>

<p>2.1.1. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has 2 classifications of customer records: Supporting or Non-supporting/Ephemeral.</p>

<p>The definitions are as follows.</p>

<p>2.1.2. Supporting records: documents or data that support a benefit or child maintenance outcome decision, and contains information on how that decision was made.  It is generally information that would be supplied in the event of an appeal or fraud investigation, or that affects the amount of benefit paid or child maintenance assessment. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3-1-1">Section 3.1.1</a> for the standard retention of customer documents.</p>

<p>2.1.3. Non-supporting or Ephemeral records: documents or data that do not fit into the definition of supporting documents. These are of a general nature and do not affect the claim in any way. For example, general enquiries, internal templates, front cover sheets.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How long do I keep records?</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1. </span> Supporting Records</h3>

<p>3.1.1. Supporting records: Standard retention is 14 months, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6">section 6</a> supporting records are retained for 14 months after <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s live interest in the claim has ended see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-2">5.2</a>.</p>
