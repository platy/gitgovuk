<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This is version 6.1 of the Information Management Policy and is effective from 27 April 2022.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> takes its responsibility seriously and ensures that the right levels of security and protection are applied to our information. This means ensuring that we all understand our own responsibilities and help to manage information in the right way. Effective information management safeguards both our customers and our key corporate information, maintaining <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP’s</abbr> reputation and protecting the public purse.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1. This policy is for anyone who creates, handles or stores <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> information, including all <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> employees, agents, contractors, business partners, third parties and suppliers. It includes all paper documents, electronic records, videos, DVDs, emails, social media posts, databases, websites and Intranet sites, etc.</p>

<p>2. Through effective information management, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will comply with the following obligations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/public-records-act1958.rtf" rel="external">Public Records Act</a>
</li>
  <li>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents" rel="external">Data Protection Act</a> (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>) 2018</li>
  <li>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/contents" rel="external">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code">Civil Service code</a>: (states you must keep accurate official records and handle information as openly as possible within the legal framework).</li>
</ul>

<p>3/. This policy must be read and implemented in conjunction with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Acceptable Use Policy (<abbr title="Acceptable Use Policy">AUP</abbr>) and the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Information Security Policy.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Information Management Principles</h2>

<h3>Creating information</h3>

<p>When creating information, it is important to ensure that:</p>

<p>4. There is a specific business need or legal requirement for information to be created.</p>

<p>5. There must be clear ownership of all information created.</p>

<p>6. Information is only retained as long as instructed in the retention guidance.</p>

<p>7. Information is recorded under the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Corporate records – these include all documents and data created by you in day-to-day business. See Managing Corporate Records Guidance for more details.</li>
  <li>Customer records – these include all claimant or customer-related documents and data. See Managing Customer Records Guidance for more details.</li>
  <li>HR records – these include all HR or staff related documents and data. See Managing HR Records guidance for more details.</li>
  <li>Finance and Procurement records – these include day-to-day purchases as well as customer-related provision and large contracts. See Managing Finance and Procurement Records for more details.</li>
  <li>Intranet content – some information published on the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Intranet is so vital to the understanding of how <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is administered that it must be saved and stored in a specific way. See Managing Intranet Content for more details.</li>
</ul>

<p>8. Customer and corporate information is classified in line with the Government Security Classifications Scheme.</p>

<p>9. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> file naming and version control conventions are applied.</p>

<p>10. Only the minimum amount of personal information is used for the business purpose.</p>

<p>11. Customer information is retained for no longer than is necessary. Personal information must be removed or anonymised, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/storage-limitation/" rel="external">Guide to the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, Principle (e): Storage limitation</a>.</p>

<p>12. Documents, data and records created and retained by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> meet the Legal admissibility and evidential weight standards.</p>

<h2>When is a document ‘held’ or ‘not held’?</h2>

<p>13. Documents and information are classed as ‘held’ or ‘not held’ if they meet the following criteria.</p>

<h3>Held</h3>

<p>Registered files, Corporate Record Boxes and benefit records (for Rights of Access Requests) are classed as ‘held’ until the files are marked as ‘destroyed’ on the remote stores IT system (RS Web).</p>

<p>Paper or hard copy documents are classed as ‘held’ until the document is physically transferred to waste recycling or confidential waste bin.</p>

<p>Electronic documents are classed as ‘held’ if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are on the current version of Shared Drives, SharePoint Online, or can be retrieved from the ‘recycle bin’</li>
  <li>are in the current version of OneDrive or My Documents or can be retrieved from the ‘recycle bin’ for My Documents (personal storage)</li>
  <li>can be retrieved from the Deleted Items folder or using the ‘recover deleted items’ facility in Outlook</li>
</ul>

<p>Electronic datasets are classed as ‘held’ until the data is deleted from the database and recycle bin.</p>

<h3>Not held</h3>

<p>Documents held solely on backup tape/drives are classed as ‘not held’.</p>

<h2>Storing information</h2>

<p>When storing information ensure that.</p>

<p>14. You follow the guidelines for access (including access to Shared Folders and SharePoint Online) to the information. This access should be reviewed periodically to minimise the risk.</p>

<p>15. You are aware of and follow the retention and destruction dates.</p>

<p>16. Storage of the information follows <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> file naming and version control standards.</p>

<p>17. OneDrive within the electronic desktop should be used to store employee personal information related to activities as an employee of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, as a member of a team, and any charitable activity authorised by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (documents including your flexi sheets, People Performance, <abbr title="Health and Social Security Recreation Association">HASSRA</abbr>, Community 10,000 etc). Where there are clear and agreed business reasons for holding HR records containing personal information in SharePoint (see para 10 Managing HR Records, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Intranet), they must be stored securely with appropriate permissions (SharePoint) please contact your Team Site Owner (<abbr title="Team Site Owner">TSO</abbr>) if necessary to support with this request. See the Managing Customer Records Guidance and HR Document Retention Schedule.</p>

<p>18. Shared email inboxes are not used as an archive or store for non-active team emails or employee personal information.</p>

<p>19. Shared email inboxes are regularly cleansed and information moved to the appropriate storage dependant on the classification.</p>

<p>20. All data is permanently deleted securely once there is no business reason to keep it.</p>

<p>21. Any cloud storage systems used to help manage the sharing of information with Other Government Departments, third parties or suppliers are managed in line with this policy.</p>

<p>22. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> registered paper files and customer paper records are sent to the Remote Stores.</p>

<p>23. Electronic registered files and electronic corporate record boxes are sent to the Information and Records Management Team.</p>

<p>24. Information classified above OFFICIAL (i.e. SECRET or TOP SECRET) must only be stored in those systems authorised and approved to hold it.</p>

<h2>Using and sharing information</h2>

<p>When using and sharing information ensure that:</p>

<p>25. Freedom of Information (<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FoI</abbr>) and Rights of Access Request (<abbr title="Rights of Access Request">RAR</abbr>) are responded to within the set time limits.</p>

<p>26. Good security practices to protect <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> property and information assets are outlined in Physical Security Standards.</p>

<p>27. When outside of the office no one is able to read your papers or screen over your shoulder, or listen to your work conversations. For more guidance please read the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Acceptable Use Policy (<abbr title="Acceptable Use Policy">AUP</abbr>).</p>

<p>28. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> information must only be shared on a need-to-know basis with authorised colleagues. Use the guidelines when sharing sensitive information.</p>

<p>29.Security incidents and breaches must be reported as quickly as possible to the Security Incident Response Team (<abbr title="Security Incident Response Team">SIRT</abbr>) immediately.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Failure to report a security incident, potential or otherwise, could result in disciplinary action.</p>
</div>

<p>30. If possible, information is shared with colleagues using links rather than email attachments.</p>

<p>31. Do not give access to shared folders just to share one document. Remember staff can see all files within a shared folder.</p>

<p>32. Information assets created are added to an Information Asset Inventory (<abbr title="Information Asset Inventory">IAI</abbr>) in accordance with the <abbr title="Information Asset Inventory">IAI</abbr> Guidance.</p>

<h2>Disposing of information</h2>

<p>When disposing of information ensure that:</p>

<p>33. All information that has no business value or is beyond its retention period is deleted and disposed of securely.</p>

<p>34. You are aware of the retention and destruction dates for your data. The Retention of Specific Information Guidance  will tell you how long to keep certain information.</p>

<p>35. You apply any required special disposal methods for sensitive information, such as shredding or placing paper documents in a confidential waste bin.</p>

<h2>Compliance</h2>
<p>36. Compliance with this policy is the responsibility of all <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff, contractors, third parties and suppliers working on the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> estate. If for any reason users are unable to comply with this policy this should be discussed with their line manager in the first instance and then the Information and Records Management team.</p>

<p>37. Line managers are responsible for ensuring that all <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff, contractors, third parties and suppliers working on the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> estate understand their responsibilities as defined in this policy and that they continue to meet its requirements for the duration of their employment within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. It is a line manager’s responsibility to take appropriate action if individuals fail to comply with this policy. Breaching this policy may result in a breach of Section 3 of the Acceptable Use Policy which could lead to disciplinary procedures.</p>

<p>38. The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Security and Data Protection Team will regularly assess compliance with this Policy and may inspect technology systems, paper holdings, design, processes, people and physical locations to facilitate this. All staff, contractors, third parties and suppliers, who create, handle or store information on the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> estate are required to facilitate, support, and when necessary participate in these inspection requests.</p>

<p>39. Employees are responsible for ensuring that they understand their responsibilities as defined in this policy and the Acceptable Use Policy.</p>

<p>40. Once this document has been read and understood by a member of staff, they should record the information on their Security Code of Conduct.</p>
