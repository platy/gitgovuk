<h3>The universal human papillomavirus (<abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>) immunisation programme</h3>

<h4>Protecting against <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection to help reduce your risk of cancer</h4>

<p>More than 280 million doses of the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine have been given worldwide, including 120 million doses in the US and over 10 million in the UK. The <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine has been offered to all girls in school year 8 since September 2008. From September 2019 the vaccine has also been offered to year 8 boys.</p>

<p>This is because the evidence is clear that the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine helps protect both boys and girls from <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-related cancers.</p>

<h4>The <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine helps protect you from being infected by the human papillomavirus</h4>

<p>This virus increases the risk of developing some cancers later in life, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cervical cancer</li>
  <li>some mouth and throat cancers</li>
  <li>some cancers of the anus and genital areas</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> and how it spreads</h2>

<p><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection is very common. More than 70% of unvaccinated people will get it.</p>

<p><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> lives on the skin in and around the whole genital area, so using condoms does not provide complete protection from <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>.</p>

<p>There are many different types of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>.</p>

<p>Most <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infections do not cause any symptoms and get better on their own.</p>

<p>Some do not clear up and can lead to cancer whilst others cause genital warts.</p>

<h3>The difference the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine has made so&nbsp;far</h3>

<p>Over 80 million people have received the vaccine worldwide.</p>

<p>In the time it is expected that the vaccine will save hundreds of lives every year in the UK. A&nbsp;recent Scottish study has already shown a 71% reduction in pre-cancerous cervical disease in young women.</p>

<p>Ten years since the start of the vaccination programme in the UK, there has been a big decline in <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infections and in the number of young people with genital warts.</p>

<h2>Having the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine</h2>

<p>The vaccine is given in your arm and you need 2 doses to be fully protected.</p>

<p>The first injection is given in year 8 and the second one is usually 6 to 12 months later. You will be informed
when you are due the second dose.</p>

<p>To give you the best protection, the vaccine should be given before you become sexually active. If you are sexually active you should still have the vaccine.</p>

<h3>The <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/19033" rel="external">Gardasil</a> has been the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine used in the NHS vaccination schedule since 2012.</p>

<p>Sometime during the 2021 to 2022 academic year, the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine used in the programme will switch to Gardasil 9.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/32241#:~:text=Gardasil%209%20is%20a%20vaccine%20for%20children%20and,16%2C%2018%2C%2031%2C%2033%2C%2045%2C%2052%20and%2058." rel="external">Gardasil 9</a> can be given for the first and second dose or to complete a course that was previously started with Gardasil.</p>

<h4>Missed <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccinations</h4>

<p>If you missed either of your vaccinations at school, you should try and catch-up as soon as possible. Contact your school nurse, school immunisation team or GP practice to arrange an appointment.</p>

<p>You remain eligible to receive the vaccine up until your 25th birthday.</p>

<h4>Women who have had the vaccine will still need to go for cervical screening</h4>

<p>All women aged 25 and over in England are offered cervical screening tests.</p>

<p>The vaccines will prevent up to 90% of cervical cancer cases, but women should still attend for cervical screening when invited to do so.</p>

<h3>Other cancers</h3>
<p>There are currently no screening programmes for other <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-related cancers. If you are worried about any symptoms speak to your GP practice.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Remember to get your :</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 doses of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine at least 6 months apart</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine now, to protect yourself against a number of cancers in the future</li>
</ul>

<p>In time, it is expected that the vaccine will save hundreds of lives every year in the UK.</p>
