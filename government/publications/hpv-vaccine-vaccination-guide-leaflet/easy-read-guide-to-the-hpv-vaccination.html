<p>This guide is to give you information about how the human papilloma virus (<abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr>) vaccine can help people stop getting cancer.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> virus</h2>

<p>Human papilloma virus is also known as <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr>. <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> is a common virus lots of people get.</p>

<p>There is a vaccine that young people can get to help stop them getting <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr>.</p>

<p>There are different types of <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> infections that can cause different symptoms like warts on your genitals or cancer.</p>

<p>Some types of <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> do not cause any symptoms and it can go away by itself but sometimes it doesn’t.</p>

<p>A lot of people that have not had the vaccine will get <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> so it is very important to have it.</p>

<p>Having <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> means you are more likely to get some types of cancers like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cervical cancer (this is a cancer in the lower part of the womb)</li>
  <li>some mouth and throat cancers</li>
  <li>some cancers in the bum and genital areas</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> vaccine helps to stop you getting the <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> virus.</p>

<h2>How people get <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> infection</h2>

<p><abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> is on the skin in and around the whole genital area, this is where your penis or vagina are.</p>

<p>Using condoms when having sex will not always stop you from getting <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr>.</p>

<p>But using condoms does still protect you from other infections so you should still use one when having sex.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> infections can get better on their own.</p>

<p>But other <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> infections do not clear up and can lead to cancer and others can cause warts on your genitals.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> vaccine</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> vaccine has been given to children all over the world to help stop this virus from spreading and causing cancers and genital warts.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> vaccine has been offered to all girls in school who are in year 8 which means they are around 13 years old.</p>

<p>The vaccine has also started being offered to boys who are in year 8 which is around 13 years old.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> vaccine helps protect both boys and girls from cancers that <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> makes you more likely to get.</p>

<p>But the <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> vaccine does not stop you getting other infections which you can get when you have sex. So it is still important to have safe sex.</p>

<h3>The difference the <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> vaccine has made so far</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> vaccine has saved lots of lives in the UK so far by stopping people getting some types of cancer.</p>

<p>It has also meant that a lot less young people get genital warts.</p>

<p>You need 2 doses of vaccine for the best protection.</p>

<p>You will be given a record card after your first dose of vaccine. Keep it in a safe place.</p>

<p>Remember you need to have your second dose</p>

<h2>Having the <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> vaccine</h2>

<p>The vaccine is given in your arm.</p>

<p>The first one is given to people who are 13 years old (in year 8) and the second one usually 6 to 12 months later (which is the same as half a year to a year later).</p>

<p>You will be told when you need the second vaccine by your school vaccination team.</p>

<p>If you have not been told when your second vaccine will be within 12 months you should contact your doctor.</p>

<p>The vaccine should be given before you start having sex with others to give you the best protection.</p>

<p>But even if you are already having sex you should still have the vaccine to help stop you getting <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr>.</p>

<h3>The different types of vaccine</h3>

<p>The name of the vaccine that most people will get now is called Gardasil 9.</p>

<h3>If you missed your vaccine, you can still have it</h3>

<p>If you missed either of your vaccines at school, you should try and have them as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Contact your school nurse, the people at your school who give vaccines (sometimes they are called an immunisation team) or your doctor (<abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>) practice to get an appointment.</p>

<p>You can have the vaccine up until you are 25 years old.</p>

<p>Being up to date with your routine vaccinations is important.</p>

<h2>Cervical screening</h2>

<p>All people with a cervix aged 25 and over in England are offered cervical screening tests. This checks for <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> and types of cancer that are in the lower part of your womb.</p>

<p>The vaccines will stop most people from getting cervical cancer so it is very important.</p>

<p>There is a small chance you can still get cervical cancer so going to your screening check when you are invited to is still very important.</p>

<h2>Other cancers</h2>

<p>If you have <abbr title="human papilloma virus">HPV</abbr> it means you may be more likely to get other types of cancers too but there are not any screening tests for these.</p>

<p>If you or your parents or carers are worried about any symptoms, speak to your doctor (<abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>Speak to your doctor or a health professional.</p>
