<span class="number">1. </span>Information: admission of summer-born children</h2>

<p>Baroness Barran, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the School System, has recently issued a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/summer-born-children-school-admission/statement-for-local-authorities-schools-and-admission-authorities-on-the-admission-of-summer-born-children-to-school-from-baroness-barran-parliamen">statement on the admission of summer-born children to school</a> to all local authorities and own admission authority schools.</p>

<p>The statement thanks admission authorities for their co-operation in ensuring that decisions on the admission of summer-born children continue to be taken in the best interests of children. It sets out that data suggests the system is now working well and she does not intend to continue to pursue legislation on this issue at this time, but will keep this position under review if the situation changes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: financial assurance - monitoring post-16 funding for 2021 to 2022 amendment</h2>

<p>We’ve published an amendment to the financial assurance monitoring post-16 funding for 2021 to 2022 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-assurance-monitoring-post-16-funding/financial-assurance-monitoring-post-16-funding-for-2021-to-2022">guidance</a>.</p>

<p>We will make 2 previously internal reports into external reports from R12 (17 August 2022) through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/welcome" rel="external">dashboard</a>, these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>FRM43</strong> – 16 to 19 study programme learners with no planned learning hours, who are not identified as requiring additional learning support through either an education, health and care (EHC) plan or self-identified LLDD and health problems</li>
  <li>
<strong>FRM69</strong> – Proportion of planned EEP hours is greater than or equal to 50% of the total planned hours and learner is not recorded with high needs</li>
</ul>

<p>To help you submit accurate data you will be able to review these reports and if required, correct your data, in time for the R14 hard close.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: financial assurance - monitoring post-16 funding for 2022 to 2023 publication</h2>

<p>We’ve published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-assurance-monitoring-post-16-funding">2022 to 2023 financial assurance monitoring post-16 funding plan</a>, setting out the areas we will be focussing on. There are 4 new reports, available through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/welcome" rel="external">dashboard</a>, from R04:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>FRM38</strong> – Learners undertaking English and/or maths within AEB when they have already achieved their legal entitlement</li>
  <li>
<strong>FRM49</strong> – T Level programmes not recorded against an approved T Level funding band</li>
  <li>
<strong>FRM50</strong> – T Level programmes with a planned duration of less than the minimum of 2 years (653 days)</li>
  <li>
<strong>FRM65</strong> – Total work experience hours for the T Level industry placement are below the minimum for the specialism</li>
</ul>

<p>We will no longer publish the following external reports, but will continue to review this data internally, contacting providers where we have concerns relating to a higher volume of learners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>FRM02</strong> – Duplicate learning aims being delivered at 2 or more providers</li>
  <li>
<strong>FRM03</strong> – 16 to 19 funded learners who are also funded elsewhere</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: adult education budget (AEB) funding rules 2022 to 2023 HGV offer</h2>

<p>In version 1 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2022-to-2023">AEB funding rules for 2022 to 2023</a> we said that the HGV offer was under review and that we would communicate the outcome before the start of the academic year.</p>

<p>We can now confirm that this offer has been extended for the 2022 to 2023 academic year. This means that where eligible learners are undertaking one of the approved level 2 qualifications that prepare them for HGV licence acquisition, we will pay for the costs of the learners’ medicals and HGV licences.</p>

<p>We have updated the 2022 to 2023 AEB funding rules to reflect these changes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: unregistered VAT126 customers</h2>

<p>HMRC have updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-vat-refund-as-an-organisation-not-registered-for-vat">VAT126 form</a>. You will notice several changes that will help you submit a correct claim. These changes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a link to the most up to date guidance</li>
  <li>clearer selection of entity options</li>
  <li>asking for an excel spreadsheet for invoices claimed together with a detailed description of the amount claimed</li>
  <li>a declaration that the claim is accurate to the best of your knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note the VAT126 form cannot be used to claim back VAT on purchases for business supplies or any related administration costs, for example cycle to work and child-care vouchers.</p>

<p>Should your turnover exceed the VAT threshold (currently £85,000) you need to consider if you should be registered for VAT. More information can be found on GOV.UK on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-7001-should-i-be-registered-for-vat">registering for VAT</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities can use this online service <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-vat-refund-as-an-organisation-not-registered-for-vat">VAT126</a> to claim back VAT for your non-business.</p>
