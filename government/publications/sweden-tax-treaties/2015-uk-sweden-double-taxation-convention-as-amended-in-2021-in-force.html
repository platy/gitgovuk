<h2>Convention between the United Kingdom and the Sweden for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital gains</h2>

<p>The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden;</p>

<p>Desiring to conclude a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital gains,</p>

<p>Intending to eliminate double taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital gains without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in this Convention for the indirect benefit of residents of third States),</p>

<p>Have agreed as follows:</p>

<h2>Article 1 — persons covered</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>This Convention shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of this Convention, income, profit or gain derived by or through an entity or arrangement that is treated as wholly or partly fiscally transparent under the tax law of either Contracting State shall be considered to be income, profit or gain of a resident of a Contracting State but only to the extent that the income, profit or gain is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income, profit or gain of a resident of that State. In no case shall the provisions of this paragraph be construed so as to restrict in any way a Contracting State’s right to tax the income, profit or gain of the residents of that State.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Article 2 — taxes covered</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>This Convention shall apply to taxes on income and on capital gains imposed on behalf of a Contracting State or of its political subdivisions or local authorities, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There shall be regarded as taxes on income and on capital gains all taxes imposed on total income or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property, as well as taxes on capital appreciation.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The taxes to which the Convention shall apply are:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) in Sweden:</p>

<p>(i) the national income tax (den statliga inkomstskatten); <br><br>
(ii) the withholding tax on dividends (kupongskatten);<br><br>
(iii) the income tax on non-residents (den särskilda inkomstskatten för utomlands bosatta);<br><br>
(iv) the income tax on non-resident artistes and athletes (den särskilda inkomstskatten för utomlands bosatta artister m.fl.); and<br><br>
(v) the municipal income tax (den kommunala inkomstskatten); 
(hereinafter referred to as “Swedish tax”);</p>

<p>b) in the United Kingdom:</p>

<p>(i) the income tax;<br><br>
(ii) the corporation tax; and<br><br>
(iii) the capital gains tax;
(hereinafter referred to as “United Kingdom tax”).</p>

<p>4. The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, the taxes referred to in paragraph 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws.</p>

    <p>For the purposes of this Article and Article 21, the profits that are attributable in each Contracting State to the permanent establishment referred to in paragraph 1 are the profits it might be expected to make, in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where, in accordance with paragraph 2, a Contracting State adjusts the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and taxes accordingly profits of the enterprise that have been charged to tax in the other State, that other State shall, to the extent necessary to eliminate double taxation on these profits, make an appropriate adjustment if it agrees with the adjustment made by the first-mentioned State; if the other Contracting State does not so agree, the Contracting States shall endeavour to eliminate any double taxation resulting therefrom by mutual agreement.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where profits include items of income or capital gains which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p>

<p>and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p>

<p>2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State — and taxes accordingly — profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.</p>

In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.<br></p>

<p>5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that other State.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment.

    <p>The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 4 or 5 of Article 11, paragraph 4 or 5 of Article 12, or paragraph 4 or 5 of Article 20 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. <br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either Contracting State to grant to individuals not resident in that State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident or to its nationals.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Article 23 — mutual agreement procedure</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those Contracting States, present the case to the competent authority of either Contracting State. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where,</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and <br><br>
b) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within three years from the presentation of the case to the competent authority of the other Contracting State,</p>

<p>any unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph.</p>

<p>6. a) The provisions of paragraph 5 shall not apply to cases falling within paragraph 3 of Article 4<br><br>
b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, a case shall not be submitted to arbitration if the competent authorities of both Contracting States have agreed that the case is not suitable for resolution through arbitration.</p>

<h2>Article 24 — exchange of information</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;<br><br>
b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;<br><br>
c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).</p>

<p>4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.<br></p>

<p>5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.</p>

<h2>Article 25 — members of diplomatic missions and consular posts</h2>

<p>Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.</p>

<h2>Article 26 — miscellaneous provisions relating to offshore activities</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Article shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of this Convention where activities (in this Article “relevant activities”) are carried on offshore in connection with the exploration or exploitation of the sea-bed and subsoil and their natural resources situated in a Contracting State. <br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An enterprise of a Contracting State which carries on relevant activities in the other Contracting State shall, subject to paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, be deemed to be carrying on business in that other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relevant activities which are carried on by an enterprise of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 30 days in any 12 month period shall not constitute the carrying on of business through a permanent establishment situated therein. For the purposes of this paragraph:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) where an enterprise of a Contracting State carrying on relevant activities in the other Contracting State is associated with another enterprise carrying on substantially similar relevant activities there, the former enterprise shall be deemed to be carrying on all such activities of the latter enterprise, except to the extent that those activities are carried on at the same time as its own activities;<br><br>
b) an enterprise shall be regarded as associated with another enterprise if one participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of the other or if the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of both enterprises.</p>

<p>4. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the transportation of supplies or personnel by a ship or aircraft to a location where relevant activities are being carried on, or from the operation of tugboats or anchor handling vessels in connection with such activities, shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.<br></p>

<p>5. a) Subject to subparagraph b) of this paragraph, salaries, wages and similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment connected with relevant activities in the other Contracting State may, to the extent that the duties are performed offshore in that other Contracting State, be taxed in that other Contracting State.<br><br>
b) Salaries, wages and similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft engaged in the transportation of supplies or personnel to a location where relevant activities are being carried on in a Contracting State, or in respect of any employment exercised aboard a tugboat or anchor handling vessel in connection with such activities, shall be taxable only in the State of which the individual is a resident.</p>

<p>6. Gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State that operates:</p>

<p>a) ships or aircraft for the transportation of supplies or personnel to a location where relevant activities are being carried on in a Contracting State, or<br><br>
b) tugboats or anchor handling vessels operated in connection with such activities from the alienation of such ships, aircraft, tugboats or anchor-handling vessels shall be taxable only in that Contracting State.</p>

<p>7. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of rights to assets to be produced by the exploration or exploitation of the sea-bed and subsoil and their natural resources situated in the other Contracting State, including rights to interests in or to the benefit of such assets, or from the alienation of shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from such rights, may be taxed in that other Contracting State.</p>

<h2>Article 27 — preferential regimes</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Convention, where</p>

<p>a) a company that is a resident of a Contracting State derives its income primarily from other states</p>

<p>(i) from shipping and financial activities, or<br><br>
(ii) from being the headquarters or co-ordination centre for, or from being an entity providing administrative services or other support to, a group of companies which carry on business primarily in other states; and</p>

<p>b) under a preferential regime, such income bears a significantly lower tax than income from similar activities carried out within that State or than income from being the headquarters, co-ordination centre or similar entity providing administrative services or other support to a group of companies which carry on business in that State, as the case may be,</p>

<p>any provisions of this Convention conferring an exemption or a reduction of tax shall not apply to the income of such company and paragraph 2 of Article 10 and Article 21 shall not apply to the dividends paid by such company.</p>

<h2>Article 27A — entitlement to benefits</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a benefit under this Convention shall not be granted in respect of an item of income or capital gains if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Convention.</p>

<h2>Article 28 — miscellaneous</h2>

<p>Where under any provision of this Convention, income or capital gains are relieved from tax in a Contracting State and, under the laws in force in the other Contracting State, an individual, in respect of that income or that capital gain is subject to tax by reference to the amount thereof which is remitted to or received in that other Contracting State and not by reference to the full amount thereof, then the relief to be allowed under the Convention in the first-mentioned Contracting State shall apply only to so much of the income or capital gain as is taxed in that other Contracting State.</p>

<h2>Article  29 — entry into force</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Each of the Contracting States shall notify the other in writing, through diplomatic channels, of the completion of the procedures required by its law for the entry into force of this Convention.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Convention shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the receipt of the later of these notifications and shall thereupon have effect</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) in Sweden:</p>

<p>(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited on or after 1st January of the year next following the date on which the Convention enters into force;<br><br>

(iii) in respect of corporation tax, for any financial year beginning on or after 1st April next following the date on which this Convention enters into force.</p>

<p>3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, the provisions of Article 23 (Mutual agreement procedure) and Article 24 (Exchange of information) shall have effect from the date of entry into force of this Convention, without regard to the taxable period to which the matter relates. However, no case may be submitted for arbitration under the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 23 (Mutual agreement procedure) earlier than three years after the date on which the Convention enters into force. <br></p>

<p>4. The Convention between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains, signed at Stockholm on 30th August 1983 (“the prior Convention”), shall cease to have effect in respect of any tax with effect from the date upon which this Convention has effect in respect of that tax in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article and shall terminate on the last such date.<br></p>

<p>5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 4 and the provisions of Article 17, where, immediately before the entry into force of this Convention, an individual was in receipt of payments falling within Article 18 or paragraph 2 of Article 19 of the prior Convention, that individual may make an election that the provisions of those Articles, and not the provisions of Article 17 of this Convention, shall continue to apply to those payments. That election shall have effect for the year in which it is made and for subsequent years unless revoked by the individual. Where an election has been so revoked, no further election under this paragraph may be made.</p>

<p>(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited on or after 1st January of the year next following the end of the six month period;<br><br>	
(ii) in respect of other taxes on income, for taxes chargeable for any tax year beginning on or after the first day of January of the year next following the end of the six month period; and</p>

<p>b) in the United Kingdom:</p>
