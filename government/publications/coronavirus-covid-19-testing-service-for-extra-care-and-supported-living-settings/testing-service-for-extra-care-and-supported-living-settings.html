<h4>Changes in this publication</h4>

<p>Updated to reflect that there is no longer a legal requirement for people with coronavirus (COVID-19) infection to self-isolate, however the public health advice for people with any of the main symptoms of COVID-19 or a positive test result is to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Due to the higher risk nature of health and social care settings, the advice for staff member working in these settings has not changed.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is for managers to set out the testing guidance for extra care and supported living services (<abbr title="extra care and supported living">ECSL</abbr>). It is part of a suite of measures to prevent outbreaks and save lives.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to asymptomatic individuals – anyone that is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">symptomatic can get a test</a>.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-living-services-during-coronavirus-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-supported-living">further infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) guidance for extra care and supported living settings</a>.</p>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing is important because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifies if you are likely to have COVID-19 so you can stay at home and avoid contact with other people if positive</li>
  <li>reduces the risk of those receiving care contracting the virus from those who care for them</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary of testing programmes for extra care and supported living settings</h3>

<p>There are 2 different national testing programmes available for <abbr title="extra care and supported living">ECSL</abbr> settings. We refer to them in this guidance as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘high risk settings’</li>
  <li>‘wider settings’</li>
</ul>

<p>The testing programme for a setting will be determined by the following eligibility criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the setting is a closed community with substantial facilities shared between multiple people</li>
  <li>it is a setting where the majority of residents (more than 50%) receive the kind of personal care that is <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-regulated (rather than help with cooking, cleaning and shopping)</li>
</ul>

<p>If your setting meets both criteria above, you are classified as a high risk setting.</p>

<p>If your setting meets one of the criteria above you are classified as a wider setting.</p>

<p>If you do not currently have access to testing, but meet a definition above, you should use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">self-referral portal</a> to request an extra care or supported living testing account. To do this, the manager should complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the portal, enter ‘DHSC Referrer Unique Organisation Number’, which is 99874802. You will only need to use this code once and it cannot be used to order test kits.</li>
  <li>Complete the eligibility questions.</li>
  <li>Enter the information for your setting, including delivery address and contact details.</li>
  <li>Submit referral.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once your referral is submitted, the following happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the referral is sent to the local authority for approval</li>
  <li>the local authority assesses if the setting meets the eligibility criteria, and approves or denies the referral request</li>
  <li>if eligible, the setting is on-boarded onto the system and will be eligible to place an order for test kits</li>
  <li>a confirmation email will be sent to the email address registered on the self-referral portal once your setting has been onboarded – and will include a unique organisation number (<abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr>) you will be able to use to order test kits</li>
</ul>

<h4>Summary of testing regime for high-risk <abbr title="extra care and supported living">ECSL</abbr> settings:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>all staff should conduct daily rapid lateral flow tests (<abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>) on the days they are working before their shift begins</li>
  <li>all residents should conduct one <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test every month</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> are also available for visitors – see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-living-services-during-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance on supported living</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary of testing process in <abbr title="extra care and supported living">ECSL</abbr> settings</h3>

<h4>Step 1</h4>

<p>Testing coordinator receives <abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr> and orders test kits every 21 days.</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<p>Testing coordinator ensures setting is prepared for testing, it carried out on site.</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<p>Testing coordinator takes delivery and distributes the test kits and books a courier if testing 9 or more people by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> on the same day.</p>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<p>In all settings: staff complete daily rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> every day they are working before their shift begins.</p>

<p>In ‘high risk’ settings: residents complete monthly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="extra care and supported living">ECSL</abbr> settings can distribute <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> to visitors, and the tests can be undertaken on-site or at home. <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> can also be used for people being supported in line with government testing guidance.</p>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<p>All <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results must be registered online. If for any reason you are unable to register using the online portal; you can contact 119 where they will be able to register the result on your behalf. This includes resident, staff, and visitor tests results.</p>

<h4>Step 6:</h4>

<p>All resident <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits must be packed ready for courier collection or postal returns correctly by following the instructions included with the kit.</p>

<p>If you have 9 or more <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests: courier collects completed <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits.</p>

<p>If you have 8 or fewer <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, these can be returned via your nearest priority post-box.</p>

<p>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> can be disposed of as detailed in the instruction leaflet contained within the kit pack and do not need to be returned.</p>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

<p>Results are received via email and text message (SMS).</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Follow the testing schedule each week.</p>
</div>

<p>In the event of a negative result, remember to report your result and continue to follow all relevant <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance.</p>

<h2>If you have an outbreak</h2>

<p>All <abbr title="extra care and supported living">ECSL</abbr> settings must alert their local health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>) immediately if a confirmed (or clinically suspected) case of COVID-19 is identified in the setting.</p>

<p>Once alerted, your local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will conduct a risk assessment and may conduct outbreak testing on all staff and residents.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Staff with symptoms should not be in work and should not come into work for testing. They should order PCR tests online via the government website to conduct at home.</p>

</div>

<h2>Testing within 90 days of a positive result</h2>

<p>If an individual has tested positive with a <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, the testing they undertake in the following 90 days may be different. Full guidance on what testing an individual should do within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff guidance and exposed patients guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Unique organisation number</h2>

<p>To use all testing services, organisations are assigned an 8-digit unique organisation number (<abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr>).</p>

<p>Each setting has been assigned their own <abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr> so that test kit orders, courier bookings and test kit registrations can all be tracked back to an individual setting.</p>

<p>Through the use of <abbr title="Unique organisation numbers">UONs</abbr>, our IT systems can uniquely identify each setting.</p>

<p>Better data helps us to better understand the risk posed by the virus. All testing we do supports an array of scientific research, which needs up-to-date and robust data. This is why it is important to register all results.</p>

<h4>How to find out your <abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Once onboarded, an email will be sent to an organisation informing them of their new <abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr> number. The email will come from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>The email will have the subject title: COVID-19: Your new unique organisation number (<abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr>).</p>

<p>Eligible settings will only receive a <abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr> once your local authority has approved your request.</p>

<p>If your setting is eligible and has been onboarded, but you have not received your <abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr>, call 119.</p>

<h2>Ordering test kits</h2>

<p>The testing coordinator is the person responsible for ordering and distributing test kits for all staff, including both housing staff and care staff, in the setting. If applicable, they should also order tests for all residents, including those without care packages.</p>

<p>To place an order, you’ll need the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the total number of staff (including agency staff) and residents to be tested</li>
  <li>contact details</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you’ll receive a confirmatory email from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Preparing your setting</h2>

<p>Once you have placed your order for test kits, you should prepare for testing if it is being carried out on site.</p>

<h3>Make sure your facility is fully prepared</h3>

<p>Communicate with your staff and residents: ensure all staff and residents are aware of your testing plans and what the tests are for.</p>

<p>Obtain consent: before testing you must obtain consent from all staff and residents to be tested in line with your normal policies and procedures.</p>

<h3>Delivery and storage</h3>

<p>Once you have placed your order for test kits, you should prepare for delivery and storage.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow guidance in the delivery confirmation email and printed instructions with your test kits</li>
  <li>store test kits as detailed within the instruction leaflet</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>store test kits in the fridge</li>
  <li>mix test kits with test kits from your local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, as this may lead to complications with the registration</li>
  <li>share test kits, as this may lead to issues with test kit registration, courier collection and also contact tracing</li>
  <li>allow staff to come into work if they are symptomatic (they can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">get a test for people with symptoms</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing in high risk settings</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must have a courier booked if you plan to test 9 or more people.</p>
</div>

<h3>Your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit</h3>
<p>The test kit contains the following items (one of each) when delivered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rapisac bag (that the individual test kit arrives packaged in)</li>
  <li>swab, inside a sealed wrapper</li>
  <li>plastic vial, containing a small amount of clear or coloured liquid</li>
  <li>absorbent pad</li>
  <li>biohazard bag with a silver seal</li>
  <li>return box</li>
  <li>security seal</li>
  <li>pre-paid Royal Mail return label (pre-attached to the return box)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that test kits will arrive in boxes of 40 along with printed guidance booklets.</p>

<h3>Taking the test</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You will conduct a combined throat and nose self-swab for the test.</p>
</div>

<p>Follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-taking-swab-samples/how-to-use-the-self-swabbing-kit-for-a-combined-throat-and-nose-swab-video">instructional video on how to do a throat and nasal swab</a>.</p>

<p>Where a combined nose and throat swab is not possible, a nose swab from both nostrils should be taken if this is feasible. The swab does not need to be pushed far into the nostril. Extra care is needed when interpreting the results from a nasal swab compared with a full throat and nose swab. If the result is negative but the resident has persistent symptoms, a clinical assessment should be made to determine whether a repeat test is required. Staying at home or isolation from others should continue until symptoms reside.</p>

<p>The link to your test kit guidance document will be in your delivery confirmation email.</p>

<p>You will also receive printed instructions with your test kits.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>You must register each test kit after completing the test using the link given to you in your delivery confirmation email.</p>
</div>

<h3>Register a single kit online</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">

<h3>Making multiple registrations online</h3>

<p>You can also use the record-keeping multiple registration spreadsheet to register up to 100 tests.</p>

<p>Ensure you only use the most recent version of the multiple upload spreadsheet to register COVID-19 tests for your organisation.</p>

<p>Organisations can still upload their testing data using the self-registration route. This is an additional option and does not replace the self-reporting routes.</p>

<p>You will need to read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users">guidance and download the multiple registration spreadsheet</a> to record the details of people you have tested for coronavirus on that day.</p>

<p>To make multiple registrations:</p>

  <li>the excel document cannot be scanned into the computer – it must be a digital copy</li>

<h3>Return box tracking</h3>

<p>In order to return tests by courier, you must package test kits inside the larger outer return boxes provided by NHS Test and Trace. You can order these separately on the online portal. You should place an order for outer return boxes before booking a courier collection.</p>

<p>By using return boxes NHS Test and Trace can track your samples from when they are collected and leave your premises – it also means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS Test and Trace can better manage test kit volumes across the network of laboratories</li>
  <li>less cardboard waste</li>
  <li>fewer missing tests</li>
</ul>

<p>Key changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new outer return boxes with attached barcode, for packing up to 50 individual test kits</li>
  <li>no need to use individual test kit boxes – test kits can go directly into outer boxes</li>
  <li>registration portal single journey update, linking test kit box to outer return box</li>
</ul>

<h3>Returning your kits via courier</h3>

<p>If you have 9 or more test kits to be collected, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://test-kit-collection.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">you can book a courier</a>.</p>

<p>If you no longer require a booked courier, cancel by ringing 119.</p>

<p>To book you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</li>
  <li>your postcode</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have finished testing an hour before the time your slot is booked for.</p>

<p>Try to register the kits the same day they are being collected if possible.</p>

<p>It is important to only book a courier when you plan to test – you can book up until 7pm the night before and there will always be enough slots available.</p>

<p>You are now able to book one of 3 courier collection slots throughout the day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9am to 1pm</li>
  <li>2pm to 6pm</li>
  <li>4pm to 9pm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Returning your kits via priority post box</h3>

<p>If you have 8 or fewer <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits to return, follow the instructions:</p>

<p>Each test kit contains a pink pre-paid return label. Attach this to the outside of the delivery packaging next to the security seal. If there is no label in the kit check in the box that the kits were delivered in. If you need additional support, call 119.</p>

<p>The test kit should be returned via a Royal Mail priority box. Check your <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you" rel="external">nearest priority post box and collection times</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Only use a Royal Mail priority post box – it will be labelled with the priority box sign and one of the regional NHS logos. Do not enter any Post Office with the kit.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results</h3>

<p>Any staff member who tests positive for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>.</p>

<p>You should also consider whether individuals may be eligible for COVID-19 treatments including antivirals or monoclonal antibodies (through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.panoramictrial.org/" rel="external">PANORAMIC national study</a> or through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/treatments-for-coronavirus/" rel="external">direct access</a> for those at highest risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19).</p>

<p>A symptomatic individual who tests negative for COVID-19 may have another infectious illness like flu. Therefore, action may still be needed to limit transmission including using appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> when working with symptomatic people receiving care and those who are unwell keep away from others.</p>

<p>If you believe two or more symptomatic cases may be linked and that you may have an outbreak within your service, you should contact your local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, who will advise whether any further action or additional testing (including flu testing) is needed.</p>

<h2>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> process</h2>

<h3>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> technology</h3>

<p>The rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> detects a COVID-19 antigen that is produced when a person is infectious with COVID-19. If this antigen is present, then a coloured strip on the <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> will appear to show a positive result within 15 to 30 minutes, however, please read the leaflet enclosed with the testing pack to confirm how to undertake the test.</p>

<p>There are several rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> products available, and all help reduce the risk on top of the other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures, as part of an overall approach to managing the spread of transmission.</p>

<h4>Tests can be used for self-test at home or on site</h4>

<p>Extra care and supported living (<abbr title="extra care and supported living">ECSL</abbr>) staff and visitors are able to self-test at home prior to entry to the setting.</p>

<p>Staff should collect a month’s worth of boxes of <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kits to keep at home for testing.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="extra care and supported living">ECSL</abbr> settings, it is the testing coordinator’s responsibility to maintain records of the kits that are distributed, including the LOT number, which can be located on the box of rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> tests.</p>

<p>For visitors, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-living-services-during-coronavirus-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-supported-living">guidance for supported living</a>.</p>

<h3>Registering a rapid lateral flow test result</h3>

<p>Once staff have completed their tests, the <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> device will show a result within 30 minutes.</p>

<p>It is important that they register their result. To register an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> test result, staff will need the <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> number on the test strip and the agency <abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">online form</a> to register a result. The online form links the Rapid lateral flow <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> number and test result to the individual and your organisation.</li>
  <li>The form will ask for <abbr title="Unique organisation number">UON</abbr>, personal details, <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> number of the rapid lateral flow test cartridge, and whether the result was positive, negative, or void.</li>
  <li>When using the online form, there is the option to create a user account. When creating a user account, an individual’s email address is linked to their personal details.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether a user account is created or not when ordering tests, notifications of results will be sent to via SMS or e-mail.</p>

<p>As an agency manager you may ask to see SMS or e-mail results as part of your tracking system.</p>

<p>Providers do not need to retain records of proof of registrations.</p>

<p>Any individual who tests positive for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Once they have completed their test and registered their result, they can dispose of the <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> device as detailed in the instruction leaflet contained with the kit.</p>

<h3>Digital Reader</h3>

<p>You can now use the Digital Reader for reading <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results via the self-report journey.
