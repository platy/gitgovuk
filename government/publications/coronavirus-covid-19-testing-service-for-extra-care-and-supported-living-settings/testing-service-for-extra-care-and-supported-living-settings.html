<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is for setting managers to set out the testing policy for extra care and supported living. It is part of a suite of measures to prevent outbreaks and save lives.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-living-services-during-coronavirus-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-supported-living" class="govuk-link">further infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) guidance for extra care and supported living settings</a>.</p>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing is important because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it identifies staff and residents who currently have coronavirus (COVID-19) so they are able to self-isolate if their result is positive</li>
  <li>protects those receiving care from infection passed to them by staff who are confirmed positive</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary of testing programmes for extra care and supported living settings</h3>

<p>There are 2 different national testing programmes available for extra care and supported living settings. We refer to them in this guidance as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘high risk settings’</li>
  <li>‘wider settings’</li>
</ul>

<p>The testing programme for a setting will be determined by the following eligibility criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the setting is a closed community with substantial facilities shared between multiple people</li>
  <li>it is a setting where the majority of residents (more than 50%) receive the kind of personal care that is <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-regulated (rather than help with cooking, cleaning and shopping)</li>
</ul>

<p>If your setting meets both criteria above you are classified as a ‘high risk’ setting.</p>

<p>If your setting meets one of the criteria above you are classified as a ‘wider’ setting.</p>

<p>All settings should use the <a href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">self-referral portal</a> to request an extra care or supported living testing account. To do this, the provider should complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the portal, enter the ‘DHSC Referrer Unique Organisation Number’ which is 99874802. You will only need to use this code once. This <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> cannot be used to order test kits.</li>
  <li>Complete the eligibility questions.</li>
  <li>Enter the information for your setting, including delivery address and contact details.</li>
  <li>Submit referral.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once your referral is submitted, the following happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the referral is sent to the local authority for approval</li>
  <li>the local authority assesses if the setting meets the eligibility criteria, and confirms or denies the referral request</li>
  <li>if eligible, the setting is on-boarded onto the system and will be eligible to place an order for test kits</li>
</ul>

<h4>High risk settings</h4>

<p>If you’re classified as a high risk setting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all staff should conduct 1 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test per week</li>
  <li>all staff should conduct 3 rapid lateral flow tests (<abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>) every week, ideally before their shift begins:
    <ul>
      <li>one on the same day as their weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>
</li>
      <li>and additional <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> every 2 to 3 days after</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>all residents should conduct one <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test every month</li>
  <li>in the event of a positive test result all staff should use rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> for 7 days</li>
  <li>rapid lateral flow testing is also available for visitors – see our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-living-services-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance on supported living</a> for more information</li>
</ul>

<p>See end-to-end guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="#LFD-testing">rapid lateral flow testing</a> and <a href="#PCR-testing" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing</a>.</p>

<h4>Wider settings</h4>

<p>If you’re classified as a wider setting, all staff should conduct one <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test every week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>rapid lateral flow testing is also available for visitors – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-living-services-during-coronavirus-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-supported-living">our guidance</a> for more information</li>
</ul>

<p>See end-to-end <a class="govuk-link" href="#PCR-testing">guidance on <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing</a>.</p>

<h3>Summary of testing process in extra care and supported living settings</h3>

<h4>Step 1</h4>

<p>Testing coordinator receives unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>) and orders test kits every 10 days.</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<p>Testing coordinator ensures setting is prepared for testing.</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<p>Testing coordinator takes delivery of the kits and books courier if testing 9 or more people.</p>

<h4>Step 4:</h4>

<p>If ‘wider’ setting: staff complete weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests.</p>

<p>If ‘high risk’ setting: staff complete weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests and 3 rapid lateral flow tests a week.</p>

<p>Residents complete monthly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests.</p>

<p>Both settings (ad hoc): rapid <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> on-site can be used for visitor testing and for the people being supported as and when required.</p>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<p>All completed tests must be registered online.</p>

<h4>Step 6:</h4>

<p>If you have 9 or more <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests: courier collects completed <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits.</p>

<p>If you have 8 or fewer <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, these can be returned via your nearest priority post box.</p>

<p>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> can be disposed of and do not need to be returned.</p>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

<p>Results are received via email and text message (SMS).</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>Follow the testing schedule each week.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you have an outbreak</h2>

<p>All extra care and supported living settings must alert their local health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>) immediately if a confirmed (or clinically suspected) case of coronavirus is identified in the setting.</p>

<p>Once alerted, your local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will conduct a risk assessment and may conduct outbreak testing of all staff and residents.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Staff with symptoms should not be in work and should not come into work for testing. They should be tested via one of the other channels (RTS, home, etc).</p>
</div>

<p>If you are part of the ‘high risk’ testing programme and a positive result is found in the setting, then all staff should conduct daily rapid lateral flow testing every day for 7 days on the days they are working.</p>

</div>

<h2>Testing within 90 days of a positive result</h2>

<p>If you have tested positive with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, the testing you undertake in the following 90 days may be different. Full guidance on what testing you should do within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result can be found in the management of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">exposed healthcare workers and residents guidance</a>.</p>

<p>This 90 day period is from the initial onset of symptoms or, if asymptomatic when tested, their positive test result. Individuals should use evidence of their positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test to show they are currently exempt from asymptomatic testing.</p>

<h2>Unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</h2>

<p>To use all testing services, organisations are assigned an 8-digit unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>).</p>

<p>Each setting has been assigned their own <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> so that test kit orders, courier bookings and test kit registrations can all be tracked back to an individual setting.</p>

<p>Through the use of UONs our systems can uniquely identify each setting.</p>

<p>Better data helps us to better understand the risk posed by the virus. All of the testing we do supports an array of scientific research, which needs up-to-date and robust data.</p>

<h4>How to find out your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Once onboarded, an email will be sent to an organisation informing them of their new <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> number. The email will come from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>The email will come with the subject title ‘COVID-19: Your new unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)’.</p>

<p>Eligible settings will only receive a <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> once your local authority has referred the setting.</p>

<p>If your setting is eligible and has been onboarded, but you have not received your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>, please call 119.</p>

<h2>Ordering test kits for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> tests</h2>

<p>The testing coordinator is the person responsible for ordering and distributing test kits for all staff, including both housing staff and care staff, in the setting. If applicable, they should also order tests for all residents, including those without care packages.</p>

<p><a href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Register for test kits</a></p>

<p>To apply, you’ll need the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the total number of staff (including agency staff) and residents to be tested</li>
  <li>contact details</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve placed an order, you’ll receive a confirmatory email from <a href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Both <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> (if eligible) tests can be ordered from the same website with the same <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Preparing your setting</h2>

<p>Once you’ve placed your order for test kits, you should prepare for testing.</p>

<h3>Make sure your facility is fully prepared</h3>
<p>Plan your schedule for testing: testing can be scheduled over multiple days, taking into account various shift patterns and courier timings. Testing can take place over the weekend too – note that on Sundays you cannot use the Royal Mail postage return option unless your nearest priority post box states it has a Sunday collection. You do not have to test everyone on one day.</p>

<p>Communicate with your staff and residents: ensure all staff and residents are aware of your testing plans and what the tests are for</p>

<p>Obtain consent: before testing you must obtain written consent from all staff and residents to be tested in line with your normal policies and procedures. Consent form templates can be obtained from your local authority if required</p>

<h3>Create a template to record completed tests</h3>
<p>Prepare the record-keeping template for your own records.</p>

<p>From 1 July you can use the new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users" class="govuk-link">multiple registration spreadsheet template</a>/</p>

<p>Make sure you have a clear record of which barcode belongs to each person.</p>

<h3>Delivery and storage</h3>

<p>Once you have placed your order for test kits, you should prepare for delivery and storage.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow guidance in the delivery confirmation email and printed instructions with your test kits</li>
  <li>store test kits in a safe place at room temperature (between 5 and 22 degrees Celsius)</li>
  <li>store spare test kits (if you have any), between 5 and 22 degrees Celsius until their expiry date (which is displayed on the swabs)</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>store test kits in the fridge</li>
  <li>mix test kits with test kits from your local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, as this may lead to complications with the registration</li>
  <li>share test kits, as this may lead to issues with test kit registration, courier collection and also contact tracing</li>
  <li>allow staff to come into work if they are symptomatic (they can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">get a test for people with symptoms</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing in wider and high risk settings</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must have a courier booked if you plan to test 9 or more people.</p>
</div>

<h3>Your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit</h3>
<p>The test kit contains the following items (one of each) when delivered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rapisac bag (that the individual test kit arrives packaged in)</li>
  <li>swab, inside a sealed wrapper</li>
  <li>plastic vial, containing a small amount of clear or coloured liquid</li>
  <li>absorbent pad</li>
  <li>biohazard bag with a silver seal</li>
  <li>return box</li>
  <li>security seal</li>
  <li>pre-paid Royal Mail return label (pre-attached to the return box)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that test kits will arrive in boxes of 40 along with printed guidance booklets.</p>

<h3>Taking the test</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You will conduct a combined throat and nose self-swab for the test.</p>
</div>

<p>Follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-taking-swab-samples/how-to-use-the-self-swabbing-kit-for-a-combined-throat-and-nose-swab-video">instructional video on how to do a throat and nasal swab</a>.</p>

<p>Where a combined nose and throat swab is not possible, a nose swab from both nostrils should be taken, if this is feasible. The swab does not need to be pushed far into the nostril. Extra care is needed when interpreting the results from a nasal swab compared with a full throat and nose swab. If the result is negative but the resident has persistent symptoms, a clinical assessment should be made to determine whether a repeat test is required. Isolation should continue until symptoms reside.</p>

<p>The link to your test kit guidance document will be in your delivery confirmation email.</p>

<p>You will also receive printed instructions with your test kits.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This is a service for asymptomatic individuals – anyone that is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">symptomatic can get a test</a>.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Warning" role="note" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must register each test kit after completing the test using the link given to you in your delivery confirmation email.</p>
</div>

<h3>Register a single kit online</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Make sure you register your test each week after you’ve completed your test.</p>
</div>

<p>1. Go to the <a href="https://organisations.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" class="govuk-link" rel="external">registration site</a> to begin your registration.</p>

<p>2. Enter the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> of your extra care and supported living setting, which you will have received in an email. You will get a confirmatory email from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>3. Enter or scan test kit barcode – enter carefully and do not copy and paste.</p>

<p>4. Enter personal details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>name</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>5. Check your answers.</p>

<p>6. You’ll get confirmation of registration via email.</p>

<p>If there are any problems with registering a test kit, call 119.</p>

<h3>Making multiple registrations online</h3>

<p>From 1 July, you can use the new version of the record-keeping multiple registration spreadsheet (bulk upload). The updated spreadsheet will let you register both polymerase chain reaction test kits and rapid lateral flow tests at the same time.</p>

<p>Ensure you only use the most recent version of the multiple upload spreadsheet to register coronavirus tests for your organisation.</p>

<p>You can register up to 100 tests on the spreadsheet. You’ll need to complete separate spreadsheets for staff and non-staff.</p>

<p>Organisations can still upload their testing data using the self-registration reporting route. This is an additional option and does not replace the self-reporting routes.</p>

<p>To make multiple registrations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>see guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users/unique-organisation-number-uon-and-multiple-registration-guidance">how to make multiple registrations and to use our multiple upload portal</a> – you can also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users">download the new multiple registration spreadsheet</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the excel document should not be altered: barcode, date and time of the swabs should be entered after the spreadsheet is uploaded (should not be digitally entered into the excel spreadsheet)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the excel document cannot be scanned into the computer – it must be a digital copy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grey cells and columns A and B should not be filled in (unless printing a copy and manually filling in for your own records) – cells should only be grey if you do not have to fill in that particular cell</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the bulk upload feature is still not working, please register the test kits individually</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Return box tracking</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://youtu.be/IVOpW3cRJ6U">Watch a video demonstration of return box tracking</a>.</p>

<p>Benefits of using return box tracking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>saves you time as you do not have to make up smaller boxes for returning individual test kits – test kits can be placed directly into the box in sample bags</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NHS Test and Trace can track your samples from when they are collected and leave your premises</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NHS Test and Trace can better manage test kit volumes across the network of laboratories</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reduces cardboard waste</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reduces the number of missing tests</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is not compulsory – however, if you use the bulk upload spreadsheet, only use the latest version from 1 July. The spreadsheet used previously will no longer work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users" class="govuk-link">Download the spreadsheet</a></p>

<p>Key changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>new outer return boxes with attached barcode, for packing up to 50 individual test kits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no need to use individual test kit boxes – test kits can go directly into outer boxes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>registration portal single journey update, linking test kit box to outer return box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new copy of bulk registration spreadsheet – this must be used from 1 July onwards (the previous spreadsheet will not work from 1 July onwards)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>write the number of test kits inside the box onto the outer return box</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Returning your kits via courier</h3>

<p>If you have 9 or more test kits to be collected, <a href="https://test-kit-collection.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">you can book a courier</a>.</p>

<p>If you no longer require a booked courier, cancel by ringing 119.</p>

<p>To book you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your postcode to register</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have finished testing an hour before the time your slot is booked for.</p>

<p>Try to register the kits the same day they are being collected if possible.</p>

<p>It is important to only book a courier when you plan to test – you can book up until 7pm the night before and there will always be enough slots available.</p>

<p>You are now able to book one of 3 courier collection slots throughout the day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>9am to 1pm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2pm to 6pm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4pm to 9pm</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Returning your kits via priority post box</h3>

<p>If you have 8 or fewer <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits to return, follow the instructions:</p>

<p>Each test kit contains a pink pre-paid return label. Attach this to the outside of the delivery packaging next to the security seal. If there is no label in the kit please check in the box that the kits were delivered in. If you need additional support, call 119.</p>

<p>The test kit should be returned via a Royal Mail priority box. Check your <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you" rel="external" class="govuk-link">nearest priority post box and collection times</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice" aria-label="Warning" role="note">
<p>Only use a Royal Mail priority post box – it will be labelled with the priority box sign and one of the regional NHS logos. Do not enter any Post Office with the kit.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results</h3>

<p>The tested person will receive an email and a text message (if a mobile phone number was provided at registration).</p>

<p>The results will also include guidance on next steps for the person tested.</p>

<p>Staff should inform their employer of a positive result immediately so that they can protect others that they may have come into contact with at work.</p>

<p>Find <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/what-your-test-result-means/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">further information on what to do when you get your results</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund">Infection Control Fund (ICF)</a> can be used to pay the wages of staff who have to self-isolate.</p>

<p>There are 3 possible results: Negative, Positive and Unclear.</p>

<h4>Positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th scope="col">Symptomatic</th>
      <th scope="col">Asymptomatic</th>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You must have written consent from the individual if you plan to have results returned to a different person.</p>

<p>Staff who are symptomatic should be off work and should be tested through the home testing channel. They will be able to return to work after isolating when well and test through this programme. Read about the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) on the NHS website</a>.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to inform your local public health authority of a positive result.</p>

<p>Also be aware that some individuals may be eligible for COVID-19 treatments including antivirals or monoclonal antibodies (through the PANORAMIC national study or through direct access for those at highest risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19).</p>

<p>See guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">management of staff, patients and residents who have been exposed to Covid-19</a>.</p>

<h4>Negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result</h4>

<p>You do not need to isolate if there are no symptoms and a negative COVID-19 result.</p>

<p>If someone subsequently develops symptoms, they should isolate and order a test through the NHS symptomatic portal unless advised otherwise by local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>A symptomatic individual who tests negative for COVID-19 may have another infectious illness like flu. Therefore, action may still be needed to limit transmission including using appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> when working with symptomatic people receiving care and isolation while the individual is unwell.</p>

<p>If you believe two or more symptomatic cases may be linked and that you may have an outbreak within your service, you should contact your local Health Protection Team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>), who will advise whether any further action or additional testing (including flu testing) is needed.</p>

<h4>Unclear test result</h4>

<p>If symptomatic, treat tests as positive and isolate the resident or staff member.</p>

<p>Residents should be retested using spare test kits to get a conclusive result. Staff can be retested using spare kits only if they are not displaying any symptoms.</p>

<p>No symptoms and a ‘we could not read your sample’ result means that staff can continue to work but should be retested immediately.</p>

<p>If you do not have enough spare kits, call the coronavirus testing contact centre on 119 (England).</p>

<h2>Rapid lateral flow testing for high risk settings and wider settings</h2>

<p>Eligibility criteria for a high risk setting (both criteria must be met):</p>

<ul>
  <li>the setting has substantial indoor living facilities shared between multiple people (such as lounges, kitchens and bathrooms)</li>
  <li>where the majority of the people living in the setting (more than 50%) receive the kind of personal care that is <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> regulated (rather than help with cooking, cleaning and shopping)</li>
</ul>

<h3>High risk settings</h3>

<p>If your setting meets both of the above criteria it is a ‘high risk’ setting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff are allocated 3 rapid lateral flow tests a week – to either test on site or self-test at home, in addition to one <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Conducting both types of testing combines the rapid results of rapid lateral flow testing with the higher sensitivity of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. This means that rapid lateral flow tests will quickly identify some individuals who are highly infectious, enabling swift action to minimise spread of the virus, while the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test will identify those with a lower viral load, when the results are received</li>
  <li>rapid response testing is available for all staff to test daily for 7 days with <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> if a positive case is found in the setting</li>
  <li>rapid lateral flow testing is also available to support visitation in ‘high risk’ settings, for both visitors and the people living there</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wider settings</h3>

<p>If your setting meets one of the above criteria it is a ‘wider’ setting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rapid lateral flow testing is currently only available to support visitation in ‘wider’ settings, for both visitors and the people living there</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rapid lateral flow testing technology</h3>

<p>The rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> detects a COVID-19 antigen that is produced when a person is infectious with COVID-19. If this antigen is present, then a coloured strip on the <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> will appear to show a positive result within 15 to 30 minutes, however please read the leaflet enclosed with the testing pack to confirm how to undertake the test.</p>

<p>There are several rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> products available, and all help reduce the risk on top of the other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures, as part of an overall approach to managing the spread of transmission.</p>

<h3>General guidance and warnings</h3>

<p>Use a separate test kit for each person. You can only use each item in the test kit once. Do not re-use the items. You'll need to report each person’s result.</p>

<p>If you have problems with your hands or vision, you may need someone to assist you with the swabbing and testing process.</p>

<p>If you have a nose piercing, swab the other nostril. If pierced on both sides, remove the piercing on one side before swabbing.</p>

<p>If you’ve had a nosebleed within the last 24 hours, swab the other nostril or wait 24 hours.</p>

<p>Do not eat or drink for at least 30 minutes before doing the test to reduce the risk of spoiling the test.</p>

<p>These kits are only designed for human use.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions to ensure a reliable result.</p>

<h3>Testing schedule for staff</h3>

<p>For ‘high risk’ extra care and supported living settings, rapid lateral flow tests should be conducted in addition to your regular <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing cycle.</p>

<p>Staff should undertake an additional three <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> per week, ideally at the beginning of their shift as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> on the same day as the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>and additional <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> every 2 to 3 days after</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rapid response daily rapid lateral flow testing for staff</h4>

<p>Where there is 1 positive <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result, all staff should test daily with a rapid lateral flow test for 7 days.</p>

<p>You only need to test the staff working in the setting over those 7 days. You do not need to test those who are off or not working over those 7 days.</p>

<h4>Tests can be used for self-test at home or on site</h4>

<p>High risk extra care and supported living staff are able to self-test at home prior to work. Self-test is only available to staff in these settings and should not be used for anyone else.</p>

<p>This means your staff are now able to complete their 3 weekly rapid lateral flow tests at home, before they arrive at the setting to start work.</p>

<p>Staff should each be allocated a box of kits to keep at home for testing.</p>

<p>It is the testing coordinator's responsibility to maintain records of the kits that are distributed, including the LOT number, which can be located on the box of rapid LF tests.</p>

<p>Visitors are also able to self-test at home – please see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-living-services-during-coronavirus-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-supported-living" class="govuk-link">guidance for supported living</a>.</p>
