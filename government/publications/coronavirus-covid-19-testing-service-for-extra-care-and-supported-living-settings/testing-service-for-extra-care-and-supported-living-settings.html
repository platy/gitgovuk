<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>NHS Test and Trace is making regular COVID-19 testing available to eligible Extra Care and Supported Living settings in England.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for testing, Extra Care and Supported Living settings must meet both of the following criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>a closed community with substantial facilities shared between multiple people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where most residents receive the kind of personal care that is CQC regulated (rather than help with cooking, cleaning and shopping)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These criteria were set in consultation with the sector to identify settings most similar to care homes, and most at risk of an outbreak. As a result, settings meeting these criteria are ones where the risk of transmission and outbreak is high, and the impact on service users may be high given their vulnerability. If settings don’t meet both of the criteria, unfortunately this means they aren’t eligible to access testing through this programme at this time.</p>

<p>Eligible settings that meet both of the criteria outlined above should be put forward for testing by their Local Authority. We plan that all eligible settings can alternatively <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">refer themselves for testing</a> from 11 December. Further guidance on how to do this can be found below.</p>

<h2>Summary: testing in extra care and supported living settings</h2>

<h3>What the service is</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To make regular COVID 19 testing available to Extra Care and Supported Living settings that meet certain criteria</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All staff and residents should be offered tests in these settings, including care staff, housing staff, and all residents, whether they receive personal care or not</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From 9 December, testing co-ordinators should order tests every 28 days for their setting. You can apply for more test kits after 21 days have elapsed from your previous order being processed. You will receive an email with the subject line ‘COVID-19: organisation test kit order – delivery confirmed’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each member of staff should conduct a test each week and each resident should be tested monthly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Completed tests can be sent back via priority post box or collected via a courier</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results will be received within 2 to 4 days by email and text message (SMS)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The testing coordinator is the person that orders tests for the setting and has oversight of preparation to test, conducting testing and has over sight of the whole process</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why testing is important</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Identifies staff and residents who currently have COVID-19 so they are able to self-isolate if their result is positive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protects those receiving care from infection passed to them by staff who are confirmed positive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Join our webinars</h3>

<p>We would like to invite you to our regular Extra Care and Supported Living testing webinars. We welcome Local Authorities and all staff at the Extra Care and Supported Living settings to this webinar series</p>

<p>The webinars will last 1 hour and give detailed information about all aspects of testing, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ordering tests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preparing for testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test kit delivery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The testing process itself</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Registering completed test kits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How to send test kits back to our labs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results and what they mean for your organisation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The content of the webinars will largely be the same for each session, however, will include key updates on testing so is subject to change. We will announce any key updates via this bulletin also</p>

<p>The session will include a Q&amp;A with representatives from the testing team, who will be able to answer your questions and address any concerns in the session</p>

<h3>Settings that are able to access test kits</h3>

<h4>My setting meets the following eligibility criteria:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The setting is a closed community with substantial facilities shared between multiple people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where most residents receive the kind of personal care that is CQC regulated (rather than help with cooking, cleaning and shopping)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your local authority has identified you as eligible for extra care and supported living testing and you will have received an email inviting you to order test kits from the following email address: <a href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>My setting meets the criteria, but I have not been identified by my local authority:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘self referral portal’ can support you from 11 December</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of this portal is to ensure that all eligible settings are able to access testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The portal will allow settings to put themselves forward for testing without having to be referred by local authorities, meaning that the process will be faster for providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next slide walks through the self referral process</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Self-referral portal</h3>

<p>We are planning that from 11 December, all eligible settings (which have not already been set up to apply for test kits (onboarded)) will need to complete the following steps to refer their setting:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Provider navigates to: <a href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provider inputs the ‘DHSC Referrer Unique Organisation Number’, which is 99874802. You will only need to use this code once. The UON cannot be used to order test kits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provider completes eligibility questions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provider inputs the information for the setting, including delivery address and contact details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit referral</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referral is sent to LA for approval</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LA assesses if the setting/s meets the eligibility criteria, and confirms or denies the referral request/s</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If eligible, setting is on-boarded onto our systems and will be eligible to place an order for test kits</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This process can take up to 2 weeks for eligible settings to be onboarded.</p>

<h2>What to do if you have an outbreak</h2>

<p>Outbreak testing may be available through your local Health Protection Team (HPT)</p>

<p>You must alert your HPT immediately if a confirmed case of coronavirus occurs in your setting</p>

<p>Staff with symptoms should not be in work and should not come into work for testing. They should be tested via the home testing portal</p>

<p>To find out which public health team covers your area visit: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team" class="govuk-link">https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team</a></p>

<h3>New or current outbreak</h3>

<p>Report to Health Protection Team (HPT) / Directors of Public Health.</p>

<p>They will undertake an initial risk assessment, provide advice on outbreak management and decide what testing is needed.</p>

<h3>No outbreak</h3>

<p>We are now rolling out the re-testing of staff and residents in Extra Care and Supported Living settings which meet certain risk-based criteria.</p>

<p>Local Directors of Public Health will determine which Extra Care and Supported Living settings meet the criteria.</p>

<h2>The end-to-end testing process</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Testing manager receives Unique Organisation Number (UON) and orders test kits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Testing manager ensures setting is prepared for testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Testing manager takes delivery of the kits and books courier if testing 9 or more people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff tested weekly, residents every 28 days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All completed tests must be registered online</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Courier collects completed test kits or tests can be returned via your nearest priority post box if testing less than 8 people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results received via email and text message (SMS)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow testing schedule each week</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any queries with any of the steps please call the national coronavirus contact centre on 119.</p>

<h3>Re-testing timetable</h3>

<p>From 9 December, Extra Care and Supported Living settings in England should conduct repeat testing over a period of 4 weeks.</p>

<p>All Extra Care and Supported Living homes can <a rel="external" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">apply for regular re-testing</a>.</p>

<p>When we process the order for kits, Extra Care or Supported Living setting will be provided with the following test kits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>4 x all staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 x all residents</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Extra Care and Supported Living settings are advised to follow the following testing timetable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Week one: Test all residents and staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Week two: Test all staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Week three: Test all staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Week four: Test all staff</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Organisation Number</h2>

<p>To use all services, organisations are assigned an 8 digit Unique Organisation Number (UON).</p>

<h3>Why you have been assigned a UON</h3>

<p>Each setting has been assigned their own UON so that test kit orders, courier bookings and test kit registrations can all be tracked back to an individual setting.</p>

<p>Through the use of UONs our systems can uniquely identify each setting.</p>

<p>Better data helps us to better understand the risk posed by the virus – all of the testing we do supports an array of scientific research, which needs up-to-date and robust data.</p>

<h3>How to find out your UON</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Once on-boarded, an email will be sent to organisation informing them of their new UON number from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The email will come with the subject title ‘COVID-19: Your new Unique Organisation Number (UON)’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eligible settings will only receive a UON once your Local Authority is on-boarded</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your setting is eligible and have been on-boarded, but haven’t received your UON, please call 119</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ordering test kits</h3>

<p>The testing manager is responsible for ordering test kits for the setting.</p>

<p>You must <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk">register for test kits</a></p>

<p>In order to apply, you will need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Your Unique Organisation Number (UON)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Total number of residents and whether they are displaying coronavirus symptoms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Total number of staff, including agency staff, and whether they are displaying coronavirus symptoms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their contact details</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmatory email from the following address: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Preparing your setting</h2>

<p>Preparation is key to successful testing. You should start to plan for how you will conduct testing in your setting as soon as you order your test kits.</p>

<p>Make sure your facility is fully prepared.</p>

<p>Schedule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Testing can be scheduled over multiple days, taking into account various shift patterns and courier timings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Testing can take place over the weekend too. Note that on Sundays you cannot use the Royal Mail postage return option unless your nearest priority post box states it has a Sunday collection. You do not have to test everyone on one day</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Communication:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Making all staff and residents aware of testing plans and what the tests are for</li>
</ul>

<p>Consent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Obtaining written consent from all staff and residents to be tested in line with your normal policies and procedures. Consent form templates can be obtained from your local authority if required</li>
</ul>

<p>Create a template to record completed tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare the record keeping template for your own records</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users/unique-organisation-number-uon-and-multiple-registration-guidance">use the template available on our government guidance page</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you have a clear record of which barcode belong to each person</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Delivery and storage</h3>

<p>What to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Accept the test kit delivery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow guidance in delivery confirmation email and printed instructions with your test kits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Store test kits in a safe place at room temperature (between 5 and 22 degrees Celsius)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have any spare test kits, they should be stored between 5 and 22 degrees Celsius until their expiry date, which is displayed on the swabs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What not to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t store test kits in the fridge</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t mix with test kits from your local HPT, as this may lead to complications with test kit registration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sharing test kits between settings may lead to issues with test kit registration, courier collection and also contact tracing</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Conducting a test</h3>

<p>Taking the test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You will conduct a combined throat and nose self-swab for the test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-taking-swab-samples/how-to-use-the-self-swabbing-kit-for-a-combined-throat-and-nose-swab-video">instructional video on how to do a throat and nasal swab</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The link to your test kit guidance document will be in your delivery confirmation email</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will also receive printed instructions with your test kits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a service for asymptomatic individuals, anyone that is symptomatic can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a test</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If someone can’t tolerate a throat swab:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If a throat swab is not possible, a double nasal swab can be done</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For double-nasal swabs it is recommended that you also take into account the individual’s circumstances when interpreting results</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, when looking at a negative result for a double-nasal swab, you also need to take into account if the person was symptomatic, and if so err on the side of caution, isolate and retest. It could be that the swab may not have collected enough virus to be detectable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conversely, if the result is negative and the person seems well, no need to do anything. If you take a double-nasal swab you should note this down and keep this information to refer back to</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Registering completed tests</h2>

<p>You must register each test kit after completing the test using the link given to you in your delivery confirmation email.</p>

<h3>Multiple registration upload: tips for success</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users/unique-organisation-number-uon-and-multiple-registration-guidance">guidance on how to use our multiple upload portal and download the record keeping spreadsheet</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watch our <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1381611&amp;tp_key=6a1298b186">multiple upload portal webinars</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The excel document should not be altered. Barcode, date and time of the swabs should be entered after the spreadsheet is uploaded. Should not be digitally entered into the excel spreadsheet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The excel document cannot be scanned into the computer - it must be a digital copy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grey cells and columns A and B should not be filled in (unless printing a copy and manually filling in for your own records). Cells should only be grey if you do not have to fill in that particular cell</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the bulk upload feature is not working, please register the test kits individually</p>
  </li>
</ul>
