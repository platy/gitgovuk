<h4>Background: Aims of the Digital Skills Partnership</h4>

<p>For the UK to be a world-leading digital economy that works for everyone, it is crucial that everyone has the digital skills they need to fully participate in society. We need to consider skills at all levels: the basic digital skills which support digital inclusion, the general digital skills that are increasingly needed for jobs in almost every sector and to get the most out of the digital economy and the advanced digital skills required for the growing number of specialist digital roles.</p>

<p>The aim is to improve digital skills and capability levels across the skills spectrum, but government cannot do it alone. This is an opportunity for government to play an important role in convening public, private and third sector partners to deliver a more collaborative, coordinated and innovative approach to meeting the digital skills challenge.</p>

<h4>The Digital Skills Partnership will in particular aim to:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>increase the digital capability needed to build thriving local digital economies by sharing and incentivising best practice at a local level and supporting the creation of Local Digital Skills Partnerships; and</li>
  <li>create a more coherent framework that enables people and organisations to identify and access good digital skills training opportunities and enables providers to collaborate to upscale and innovate.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Role of the Digital Skills Partnership Board</h4>

<p>The Digital Skills Partnership Board will provide strategic support and challenge to ensure the desired outcomes of the Digital Skills Partnership are delivered in the best way possible. It will also share experience, knowledge, networks and, where possible, resources to further the work of the Digital Skills Partnership, setting aside corporate agendas.</p>

<h4>Ways of Working</h4>

<p>In order to maximise impact, the Board will focus on a set of clearly defined recommended work-streams with members leading or co-leading delivery groups to drive forward action. Those groups will have representation from a wider range of partners, to ensure maximum diversity of thought, resources and experience.  Digital skills and inclusion policy is devolved to the nations. DCMS will continue to engage with Devolved Administrations to share and promote DSP programmes.</p>

<p>The Digital Skills Partnership Board will be co-chaired by the Minister of State for DIgital, Matt Hancock and  the Chair of the Tech Partnership, Phil Smith. It will meet 3 to 4 times a year unless the co-chairs decide otherwise. The Terms of Reference and membership of the Board will be published on GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>Membership</h4>

<p>Members are selected and invited by the Minister for Digital to represent a diverse range of organisations. If a member leaves their organisation or changes roles within it a new member may be sought to fill their place.</p>

<h4>Secretariat</h4>

<p>The DCMS Digital Skills and Inclusion team will provide the Secretariat. It will manage the agenda, arrange meetings, and commission and quality assure papers.</p>
