<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/firearm-certificates-in-england-and-wales">Statistics on firearm and shotgun certificates in England and Wales</a> release contains a time series of National Statistics on certificates issued by police forces under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/contents" rel="external">Firearms Act 1968 (as amended)</a>. The release presents information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of certificates granted and refused for new and renewal applications</li>
  <li>certificates revoked</li>
  <li>registered firearm dealers</li>
  <li>visitors’ permits</li>
  <li>experimental statistics on lost or stolen firearms and shotguns</li>
</ul>

<p>It also includes statistics on the number of people that hold a firearm and or shotgun certificate, broken down by age and gender, and breakdowns of firearm and shotgun types.</p>

<p>Statistics in the release relate to the number of certificates and permits on issue as at 31 March each year and include the number of applications that were either granted, refused or revoked during this period.</p>

<p>The release reports on licensed firearms only. No official estimate of illegally-held firearms in England and Wales is available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Uses of the statistics</h3>

<p>Uses of the statistics on firearm and shotgun certificates are listed below using the standard categorisation for Official Statistics.</p>

<p><strong>a) Informing the general public’s choices:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>about the state of the economy, society and the environment -</strong> figures on legally-held firearms are used by the media in articles on law and order</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>about the performance of government and public bodies -</strong> figures on levels and trends in firearm and shotgun certification are requested via parliamentary questions (PQs) and freedom of information (FOI) requests to gauge performance in general or in specific areas</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>b) Government policy making and monitoring:</strong></p>

<p>Firearm and shotgun certificate statistics are used to monitor the performance and effectiveness of police forces, to monitor the performance and effectiveness of government policy and to inform policy and operational decisions by ministers.</p>

<p><strong>c) Resource allocation - typically by central and local government:</strong></p>

<p>Policing statistics, including on firearm and shotgun certificates, demonstrate the range, extent and quality of police activities, and contribute to overall cases for police funding.</p>

<p><strong>d) Supporting third sector activity - lobbying:</strong></p>

<p>Lobby groups use firearm and shotgun certificate statistics to protect the rights and civil liberties of citizens and to support the value of legally-held guns in the farming community. For example, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (<abbr title="British Association for Shooting and Conservation">BASC</abbr>) use these statistics to monitor the legal possession of weapons, and to promote and protect sporting shooting in the UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Glossary</h2>

<p><strong>Coterminous certificate</strong> - A coterminous certificate can be issued to allow the certificate holder’s firearm and shotgun certificates to expire on the same day. Only shotgun certificates can have their expiry date changed to be aligned with a firearm certificate. Bringing the certificates into line with one another reduces fees for the certificate holder and reduces the burden on police firearms licensing teams.</p>

<p><strong>Firearms Act 1968 (‘the 1968 Act’)</strong> - It is, with certain statutory exceptions, an offence to possess, purchase, or acquire any firearm, shotgun or ammunition to which section 1 or 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/contents" rel="external">Firearms Act 1968</a> (as amended) applies without holding a certificate. Section 1 of the 1968 Act applies to all firearms except a shotgun, an air gun, or a weapon prohibited under section 5 of the 1968 Act.</p>

<p><strong>Firearm</strong> - According to the 1968 Act, a firearm means a lethal barrelled weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile with a kinetic energy of more than one joule at the muzzle of the weapon can be discharged. It includes any prohibited weapon, any component part of such a weapon and any accessory to such a weapon designed or adapted to diminish the noise or flash caused by the firing of the weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Firearm certificate</strong> - The certificate lists the number, type and serial number of each weapon held and any conditions attached (a standard condition is that weapons and ammunition are held in a secure place when not in use).</p>

<p><strong>Handgun</strong> - Handgun refers to the length of the firearm. Any firearm which either has a barrel less than 30 cm in length or is less than 60 cm in length overall is generally prohibited. The intention is to prohibit particularly dangerous firearms which are easy to conceal. However, the police may issue a firearm certificate enabling the possession of certain handguns of historic interest, muzzle-loading pistols or handguns for the humane killing of animals.</p>

<p><strong>Lost or stolen firearms and shotguns</strong> - Section 34 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 requires holders of a firearm and or shotgun certificate to inform the Chief Officer of Police by whom the certificate was granted as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within 7 days of the theft, loss, deactivation or destruction of any firearms or shotguns, and or the theft or loss of ammunition to which the certificate relates.</p>

<p><strong>Muzzle-loading pistol</strong> - The ammunition is loaded via the muzzle of the firearm, that is, from the open end of the gun’s barrel. They are not quick to load and therefore do not pose the same threat as some other types of guns.</p>

<p><strong>Registered firearms dealer (<abbr title="Registered firearms dealer">RFD</abbr>)</strong> - A dealer is defined in the 1968 Act as a person or a corporate body who, by way of trade or business: manufactures, sells, transfers, repairs, tests or proves firearms or ammunition to which section 1 of this Act applies, or shotguns; or sells or transfers air weapons. Firearms dealers are not authorised to trade in prohibited weapons without the Secretary of State’s authority.</p>

<p><strong>Rifle</strong> - A rifle has the meaning assigned to it under section 57(1) of the 1968 Act. A rifle has spiral grooves in the barrel, uses bullets as ammunition and is typically used for target shooting or for the control of vermin.</p>

<p><strong>Shotgun</strong> - A smooth-bore gun (not being an air gun) which:</p>

<p>(i) has a barrel not less than 24 inches in length and does not have any barrel with a bore exceeding 2 inches in diameter;<br>
(ii) either has no magazine or has a non-detachable magazine incapable of holding more than two cartridges; and<br>
(iii) is not a revolver gun.</p>

<p>Other smooth-bore guns may require a firearm certificate. It is, with certain statutory exceptions, an offence for a person to possess, purchase, or acquire any shotgun without holding a shotgun certificate. A shotgun uses shotgun cartridges containing lead shot as ammunition and is typically used for clay pigeon shooting or for the control of vermin.</p>

<p><strong>Shotgun certificate</strong> - The certificate specifies the description of the shotguns including, if known, the identification number of the guns.</p>

<p><strong>Section 1 shotgun</strong> - Contains a magazine holding more than two rounds. This is held on a firearm certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Section 2 shotgun</strong> - May have a magazine restricted to no more than two rounds. This is held on a shotgun certificate.</p>

<p><strong>Sound moderator</strong> - An accessory to a lethal barrelled weapon or a prohibited weapon designed to diminish the noise or flash caused by firing the weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Visitors’ permit</strong> - The 1968 Act (as amended) allows the sponsor of a visitor to Great Britain to apply for a permit on their behalf enabling the visitor to possess a firearm, shotgun or ammunition without holding a firearm or shotgun certificate. Permits are in force for a period not exceeding 12 months. Visitors’ permits are usually granted enabling the holder to attend organised shoots such as deer stalking or competitive target shooting events. Group applications may be made for up to 20 people (section 17 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/45/section/17" rel="external">Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988)</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Legislation and regulations</h2>

<p>The Home Office <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1042069/Firearms_Guide_17122021.pdf" rel="external">Guide on Firearms Licensing Law</a> provides consolidated guidance on firearms licensing legislation. The guide is not intended to be a definitive statement of the law, but a cohesive explanation of the complex area of firearms licensing. It should be read alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1029859/Statutory_Guidance_for_Firearms_Licensing_-_Final__Nov_2021_.pdf" rel="external">Statutory Guidance for Chief Officers of Police</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Firearm and shotgun licensing</h3>

<p>All persons acquiring or in possession of a firearm or shotgun must have a certificate issued by the chief officer of the police force area in which they reside unless they are otherwise exempt. Chapter 6 in the Home Office <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1042069/Firearms_Guide_17122021.pdf" rel="external">Guide on Firearms Licensing Law</a> explains the exemptions in more detail.</p>

<p>To obtain a firearm or shotgun certificate, the chief officer must be satisfied that:</p>

<p>(i) the applicant has good reason for having a weapon;   <br>
(ii) the applicant is fit to be entrusted with a weapon; and<br>
(iii) the public safety or peace will not be endangered.</p>

<p>Persons convicted of crimes who are sentenced to a term of imprisonment for three years or more are prohibited from possessing firearms, including antique firearms, or ammunition, for life. Those sentenced to a term of imprisonment for three months or more, but less than three years must not possess them until five years have passed since the date of release. Persons with suspended sentences of three months or more must not possess firearms, including antique firearms, or ammunition for a period of five years from the second day after the date on which sentence has been passed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Firearm certificates</h3>

<p>Firearm certificates are issued for weapons covered by section 1 of the 1968 Act (as amended), which includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rifles</li>
  <li>muzzle-loading pistols</li>
  <li>firearms used for the humane killing of animals, flare pistols and vintage pistols held as war trophies or collectors’ items</li>
  <li>section 1 shotguns</li>
</ul>

<p>For information regarding the prohibition of weapons and special exemptions, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/5" rel="external">Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Shotgun certificates</h3>

<p>Shotgun certificates, covered by section 2 of the 1968 Act, permit the holder to possess any number of shotguns. These can include pump-action and self-loading weapons that have a magazine incapable of holding more than two cartridges but excludes large magazine smooth-bore guns.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Age of a firearm and or shotgun certificate holder</h3>

<p>The 1968 Act places restrictions on the purchase, acquisition, possession and use of firearms by, and the transfer thereof to, young people. The subject of minimum age to possess a firearm or shotgun is complicated; therefore, for ease of reference, Appendix 4 in the Home Office <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1042069/Firearms_Guide_17122021.pdf" rel="external">Guide on Firearms Licensing Law</a> provides a breakdown of this topic, including exemptions. It should be noted that the table in Appendix 4 is a legal summary and does not consider issues around issuing firearm or shotgun certificates to those under 18.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Quality and methodology</h2>

<p>The data included in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/firearm-certificates-in-england-and-wales">Firearm and shotgun certificates in England and Wales</a> statistical release are collected as part of the statutory <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/annual-data-requirement-from-police-forces-in-england-and-wales">Annual Data Requirement</a> (ADR) between the Home Office and police forces. The ADR is a list of all mandatory data requests made to police forces in England and Wales under the Home Secretary’s statutory powers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Data coverage</h3>

<p>The main statistics on firearm and shotgun certificates include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>certificates on issue - collected once in 1971 and in every year since 1983</li>
  <li>new and renewal applications - collected every year since 1983</li>
  <li>the number of firearms and shotguns covered by certificates on issue - collected every year since 1995</li>
  <li>the number of people who hold a firearm and or a shotgun - collected every year since 2015</li>
  <li>firearm and shotgun weapon types held on certificates - collected every year since 2015</li>
  <li>lost and stolen firearms and shotguns - collected every year since year ending March 2021</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Data source</h3>

<p>The statistics on firearm and shotgun certificates are extracted from the National Firearms Licensing Management System (<abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr>) each year on 1 April. The <abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr> is used to record the details of people who had applied for, been granted, refused or who had their firearm or shotgun certificate revoked.</p>

<p>Data derived from <abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr> are administrative information, input by individual police forces. As the data are extracted from a live operational database, numbers may change as information on that system is updated.</p>

<p>The data have been extracted from the <abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr> for each year ending 31 March 2008 onwards. Prior to this, data was collected through statistical returns from each force.</p>

<p>Within the release there are breakdowns of the data by gender. The data used to produce the statistics come from the <abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr> and are derived from information supplied by the person applying for a certificate. The person completes a form which asks for ‘gender’ and is based on their sense of self. The data is collected for ‘female’ and ‘male’; missing data is reported as ‘unknown’. Home Office statisticians work with each England and Wales police force to improve the quality of their data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Quality assurance process</h3>

<p>These statistics are compiled by statisticians within the Home Office. Statisticians undertake a wide range of quality assurance checks on the data with each England and Wales police force.</p>

<p>These checks follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/images-settingthestandar_tcm97-44370.pdf" rel="external">QAAD guidance</a> (Quality Assurance of Administrative Data) and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compiling the administrative data to highlight outliers and possible errors</li>
  <li>variance checks, i.e. investigating substantial changes in figures compared with the previous year</li>
  <li>including safeguards within the return to improve data quality</li>
  <li>the data quality and checks are explained to users and what impact these have on the statistics</li>
</ul>

<p>Following reconciliation checks with police forces, data tables are checked by a second statistician against the raw data. The prepared text is also checked against the tables. Statisticians are responsible for checking that the commentary appropriately describes the trends seen in the data and is not biased.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Data quality</h3>

<p>The data quality for the total numbers of firearm and shotgun certificates is considered to be high. In addition to the above, these data undergo a reconciliation process and are scrutinised closely as part of the performance monitoring of the Home Office.</p>

<p>The statistics on lost or stolen firearms and shotguns are currently designated as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics/" rel="external">experimental statistics</a>. They are considered to be of immediate value to users but remain under development. A separate data confirmation exercise for these figures was carried out by Home Office statisticians with the support of each England and Wales police force.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong><em>National Statistics status</em></strong></p>

<p>National Statistics status means that our statistics meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value, and it is our responsibility to maintain compliance with these standards.</p>

<p>The designation of these statistics as National Statistics was confirmed in May 2012 following a compliance check by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/osr/" rel="external">Office for Statistics Regulation</a>. The statistics last underwent a full <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/police-statistics-in-england-and-wales/" rel="external">assessment against the code of practice</a> in 2012.</p>

<p>Since the latest review by the Office for Statistics Regulation, we have continued to comply with the Code of Practice for Statistics and to make improvements.</p>

<p>We have liaised with NFLMS users at the National User Group meeting to enhance our understanding of how the statistics and recording system are used so that they remain relevant and suitable for their purpose.</p>

<p>We have also previously worked with Home Office Digital, Data and Technology to improve the NFLMS. Changes made to the recording system will help to reduce human error at data entry and will prevent the users from leaving fields blank. These changes will help to increase the quality of published data and will therefore allow for a more accurate representation of the people that hold firearm and shotgun certificates in England and Wales.</p>

<p>In addition, following user feedback, in 2021 the team published experimental statistics within the firearm and shotgun certificates statistical publication. The experimental statistics covered lost or stolen firearms and shotguns. Statisticians in the Home Office will work with each England and Wales police force to improve the quality of these statistics as the collection continues.</p>
</div>

<p>Prior to the introduction of the <abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr> in 2006, the variety of police force data collection systems meant some police forces were unable to prevent double counting of weapons shared between two certificate holders. Due to the transition from in-force data collection systems to <abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr> during 2006, robust data for all measures relating to the financial year ending 31 March 2007, and numbers of weapons and persons covered by certificates for the following year, are not available.</p>

<p>Following the transition to the <abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr>, the main types of errors in the data are thought to relate to recording and classification errors. The level of missing data on fields such as gender is very low, with such missing data reported as unknown and therefore no grossing, imputation or other estimation methods are used.</p>

<p>Shotgun certificates recorded as coterminous have been investigated as part of the regular, ongoing quality assurance work on the underlying data. Coterminous certificates have been captured in the figures extracted from the <abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr> this year and in previous years. Therefore, coterminous certificates are captured in our data tables.</p>

<p>We are aware that due to the method of data entry on the <abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr>, in a small number of cases, weapons may have been incorrectly categorised on certificates. We have been working with Home Office Digital, Data and Technology and there are now plans to introduce further data validation to the <abbr title="National Firearms Licensing Management System">NFLMS</abbr> to prevent this error from occurring in the future.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Revisions</h3>

<p>It is standard practice across all Home Office statistical releases to incorporate revisions to previous years’ data in the latest release. Corrections and revisions follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fuploads%2Fsystem%2Fuploads%2Fattachment_data%2Ffile%2F341674%2Fho-compliance-state-aug14.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7CTina.Heath%40homeoffice.gov.uk%7C3ba67ccfce4f4f64e5d508d80bc1c2f9%7Cf24d93ecb2914192a08af182245945c2%7C0%7C0%7C637272274107805252&amp;sdata=2gg9d%2F9hRxmc7Uv5%2B%2FmMWJVFPDwiQwqOvf4GRl5%2BSK0%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">the Home Office’s statement of compliance</a> with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates" rel="external">Population estimates</a> for the reporting year are published by the Office for National Statistics within the same month as the publication release date; therefore, the previous year’s estimated population figures are used to create the figures for ‘number of shotguns and firearms per 100,000 people as at 31 March’. These figures are then revised the following year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Rounding</h3>

<p>Data are mainly provided unrounded in the data tables to promote transparency and allow users to exploit the data further. However, caution should be exercised when comparing small differences between time periods.</p>

<p>Percentages greater than 1% are presented to the nearest percent. All percentages less than 1% are rounded to the nearest significant figure, e.g. 0.43% would be presented as 0.4%.</p>

The figures are considered to be broadly comparable with those for England and Wales, due to the common legislation that governs the certification process.</p>
