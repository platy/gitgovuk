<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In March 2021, the government announced an additional £100 million of funding over 2021 to 2022 to support people living with excess weight and obesity to lose weight and maintain healthier lifestyles.</p>

<p>The adult weight management services grant (number 31/5440) distributes over £30 million of this new funding between all local authorities in England who accepted the grant to support the expansion of adult tier 2 behavioural weight management services commissioned by local authorities. This is part of a place-based whole systems approach to tackling obesity and promoting a healthier weight.</p>

<p>In order to understand the impact of this investment, any local authority in receipt of this grant funding must ensure all commissioned service providers collect data on all participants and their progress and return a minimum data set to the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) (formerly Public Health England). This is a condition of the grant.</p>

<p>This technical guidance and the supporting submission spreadsheet describe the data items required by <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>. This document explains the process for completion and submission of the data set using the spreadsheet provided.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that more data items will be collected locally to facilitate a robust process and impact evaluation of adult tier 2 behavioural weight management services, which is critical for local monitoring and development. It is important that these additional local data collections also meet national standards to ensure that weight management service data is collected consistently between services and aligns with other health and care data sets. Separate guidance on the data required to facilitate a comprehensive local level evaluation is provided in the standard evaluation framework and supporting data collection tool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PHE (2018) Standard evaluation framework for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/weight-management-interventions-standard-evaluation-framework">weight management interventions</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PHE (2017) Capturing data: a tool to collect and record <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-weight-management-services-collect-and-record-data">adult weight management service data</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>For this data collection <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> are using the following definitions published in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-weight-management-key-performance-indicators">Key performance indicators: tier 2 weight management services for adults</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>participant: individual who attended at least one session</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>completer: individual who attended at least 75% of all sessions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>active intervention: the pre-defined weight management service, that doesn’t include follow up</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>follow up: the period after the active intervention, defined as 26 weeks for this data collection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data items for national submission</h2>

<p>Data should be submitted to <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> monthly in arrears for completed activity in the month (see the Process for national submission section below for further information). Data collection is divided into 4 separate ‘time points’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>at referral into the active intervention</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at week 0, as participants start the active intervention</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at the end of the active intervention (usually week 12 but can vary), or at the last week of attendance for participants who do not complete the active intervention</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at week 26, for follow-up</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Use the ‘week 12 or last week of attendance’ time point data collection sheet to submit data for participants at the end of the active intervention or the last recorded weight for any participants who do not complete the active intervention.</p>

<p>For participants who have not completed the active intervention, provide the last weight measurement recorded in the ‘week 12 or last week of attendance sheet’. For example, if a participant’s last weight measurement was in week 5 of the intervention in August, but they did not attend any more sessions and was only declared a non-completer in September, then submit this last measurement from August in your September data return.</p>

<p>Depending upon the number of active intervention cohorts operating at any given time, some or all of these time points will be blank. For example, the first return will not contain data for active intervention completion (usually at week 12 but can vary) or for the follow-up at week 26.</p>

<h3>Services that should be submitted to the minimum data set</h3>

<p>As a condition of the grant, local authorities are required to submit depersonalised demographic, process and outcome data on participants funded through the adult weight management services grant through a minimum data set.</p>

<p>There are different scenarios that may occur, and these are set out below along with the data submission requirements.</p>

<h3>Services funded by the Adult or Children and Family Weight Management Services Grants</h3>

<p>For services funded only by the 2021 to 22 Adult Weight Management Services Grant (No 31/5440) or the Children and Family Weight Management Services Grant (No 31/5627), participant data must be submitted to <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> through the minimum data set (see Question 4).</p>

<h3>Services funded by the Adult Weight Management Services Grant and the Public Health Grant</h3>

<p>If the service is part funded by the Adult Weight Management Services Grant (No 31/5440) and part funded by the Public Health Grant, and it is not possible to distinguish the funding source for each participant, please submit this data for all participants to the <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> minimum data set until the end of the grant period. Thereafter, submit data via the Community Services Data Set.</p>

<p>If the service is part funded by the Adult Weight Management Services Grant (No 31/5440) and part funded by the Public Health Grant, and it is possible to distinguish the funding source for each participant, data for participants funded by the 2021 to 22 Adult Weight Management Grant should be submitted to <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> through the minimum data set and data for participants funded by the Public Health Grant should be submitted via the Community Services Data Set.</p>

<h3>Services only funded by the Public Health Grant</h3>

<p>For services only funded by the Public Health Grant, in the financial year 2022 to 23 and beyond, submit data for tier behavioural 2 weight management services via the Community Services Data Set (CSDS).</p>

<p>Providers of any publicly funded community services (including local authority commissioned weight management services) are expected to comply with the requirement to submit data to the CSDS regarding the services they deliver. The CSDS is the route for which data on Local Authority commissioned weight management services will be submitted to and included in the National Obesity Audit.</p>

<h2>Process for national submission</h2>

<p>The associated minimum data set reporting spreadsheet (excel file) for data submission can be used for data collection, or if a separate system is used, a report or export should be created to get the data into an identical structure and format to paste into the minimum data set reporting spreadsheet. Validation rules in the reporting spreadsheet should enable accurate data item formats, as well as pre-set or realistic values. Note that if you copy and paste into this spreadsheet then the validation rules will be overwritten – you should ensure you have validated your data before submission.</p>

<p>The minimum data set reporting spreadsheet contains 4 data collection sheets for the 4 collection time points, relating to activity in the month:</p>

<ul>
  <li>referrals</li>
  <li>week 0</li>
  <li>week 12 (or end of active intervention or last week of attendance)</li>
  <li>week 26</li>
</ul>

<p>The collection requires one row of data for each participant at referral and/or week 0, and then at the relevant time, a row at week 12 (or end of active intervention or last week of attendance) and a row at week 26. A unique (to the local service provider) participant number must be supplied for each row at referral and in week 0 and will be used to link participants over time.</p>

<p>Each data collection sheet in the spreadsheet file needs to be saved as a separate CSV file and submitted to <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>. CSV files are submitted by uploading each file to a secure SharePoint site. Detailed guidance on how to do this, and the required format of file names for submission, is provided in the data collection Excel spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Once the CSV files has been submitted to <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> the contents will be validated and any file failing validation will be returned to the service provider/local authority for amending and re-submission. If any data that has already been submitted needs correction, submit in a separate CSV file.</p>

<p>From June 2021, data submission to <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> will be on a monthly basis in arrears for completed activity in the month and submitted by the end of the following month. Where a service has been set up and starts mid-month, the first set of data can be submitted the following month. Data collected during April, May and June 2021 can be submitted in July 2021. The table below shows the monthly deadlines for submission of data to <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>, for example, data should be submitted to <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> on 30 September for completed activity in August.</p>

<p>Follow up data collected after March 2022 can continue to be submitted by the end of each of the following months.</p>

<h2>Specification for data collection</h2>

<p>The following information provides specific details on each data item collected in the minimum data set, where possible this data collection is aligned with data items collected in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/community-services-data-set" rel="external">Community Services Data Set</a>. For each data item the format and length of the data field is given, for example ‘an2’ (fixed length) means it is an alphanumeric (an) format so will be a mix of letters and numbers with a 2-character length. Some fields have codes that are letter (a) or numeric (n) format only and are more or less than 2 characters in length.</p>

<p>The time points for collection are given along with a description of the restrictions of each data item. Where applicable a table is included displaying the codes and descriptions for all possible options or responses available to report. Service providers and local authorities are asked to submit data using the codes provided, rather than the text descriptions or other methods, to ensure consistency within the full data set. Submitted CSV files not using the specified codes will fail data validation and be returned to the service provider/local authority for correction and resubmission.</p>

<p>A description of the purpose for collecting each data item is also provided.</p>

<h3>Organisation and referral</h3>

<h4>Service provider code</h4>

<p>Data format and length: an8 (variable length between 3 and 8 characters).</p>

<p>Collection time points: every data submission.</p>

<p>Restrictions: service providers are required to collect the data alongside an official Organisation Data Service code. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/services-provided-by-the-organisation-data-service/organisation-data-service-forms#organisation-code-request" rel="external">Service providers can apply for a code here</a>. Do not leave blank.</p>

<p>Purpose: present measures at service provider level and by service provider type.</p>

<p>*If you encounter a problem obtaining a service provider code or are unsure about what code to use get in touch directly with <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> via this email address: adults-weight-management-data@phe.gov.uk.</p>

<h4>Commissioner code</h4>

<p>Data format and length: an9 (fixed length, letter E followed by 8 numbers).</p>

<p>Purpose: analysis on time from referral to enrolment.</p>

<h3>Participant details</h3>

<p>Service providers and local authorities should use a participant number (which should uniquely identify the individual to the active intervention but should not incorporate any personal or sensitive information) at each point to identify the individual as they move through the different time points. Where participant information is collected and submitted at the referral time point there is no need to duplicate data collection at week 0; leave it blank in week 0, unless you wish to update or correct it.</p>

<p>If a participant drops out of the active intervention before they have attended at least 75% of the active intervention and then re-joins again at week 0 create a new participant number.</p>

<h4>Participant number</h4>

<p>Data format and length: an255 (variable length up to 255 characters).</p>

<p>Collection time points: every data submission.</p>

<p>Restrictions: this must uniquely identify the participant within the service provider but must not constitute personal information. For example, surname would be classified as personal information. The participant number should be assigned at referral and then used to identify the same individual at all other collection time points. Do not leave blank.</p>

<p>Purpose: link participants between contacts.</p>

<h4>Age in years</h4>

<p>Data format and length: n3 (variable length up to 3 characters).</p>

<p>Collection time points: referral or week 0.</p>

<p>Restrictions: derived from date of birth (not part of this minimum data set) and date of referral. Do not leave blank in referral week, if not known at referral use 0 then submit the correct age in week 0.</p>

<p>Purpose: establish whether any active interventions are more effective for specific age groups.</p>

<h4>Lower Layer Super Output Area of residence</h4>

<p>Data format and length: an10 (fixed length, letter E<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> followed by 8 numbers).</p>

<p>Collection time points: referral or week 0.</p>

<p>Restrictions: derived from postcode of residence (not part of this minimum data set) using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/postcodeproducts" rel="external">Office for National Statistics National Statistics Postcode Lookup (<abbr title="National Statistics Postcode Lookup">NSPL</abbr>)</a>. Do not leave blank in referral week, if Lower Layer Super Output Area of residence is not known use X99999999 then submit the correct data at week 0.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Statistics Postcode Lookup">NSPL</abbr> is updated quarterly in February, May, August and November, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?q=national%20statistics%20postcode%20lookup" rel="external">this link is to download the <abbr title="National Statistics Postcode Lookup">NSPL</abbr> file</a>, note the most recent file may not appear at the top of the list.</p>

<h2>Relevant outcome measures</h2>

<p>The following section is for information only. Local authorities and service providers are not required to carry out any evaluation of these measures.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> will calculate and consider relevant service measures nationally, and at local authority commissioner and service provider level. These will be published and shared within Department of Health and Social Care to help evaluate the expansion of adult tier 2 behavioural weight management services.</p>

<p>These measures are based on the list of example <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-weight-management-key-performance-indicators">key performance indicators</a> and associated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-weight-management-services-commission-and-provide">guidance to support practitioners, commissioners and provider</a>.</p>
