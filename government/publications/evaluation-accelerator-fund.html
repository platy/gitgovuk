<p>The EAF provides a total of £15m funding across the 2022/23, 2023/24, and 2024/25 financial years to improve our understanding of ‘what works’.</p>

<p>The key aims of the fund are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accelerate evaluation activity and the creation of actionable evidence in HMG priority areas to inform decision-making at the next spending review</li>
  <li>tackle evidence gaps in HMG priority areas by rapidly building the evidence base where departments and What Works Centres are not currently undertaking activity</li>
  <li>provide robust evidence of financial or efficiency savings from new policies and interventions, or innovative approaches to service delivery</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/evaluation-task-force">The Evaluation Task Force</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office">the Cabinet Office</a> announced the first wave of successful projects on Tuesday 2nd August 2022. The 16 selected programmes will receive a combined £12.2m to deliver top-quality evaluation activity in key policy areas, which supports a key commitment of the Government reform agenda to deliver better for citizens.</p>

<p>Selected projects are led by a range of government departments and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-works-network">What Works Centres</a>. They will help fill evidence gaps across high-priority areas including crime and justice, education, social care, and health.</p>

<p>The first wave of selected projects is listed below. A more detailed table summarising the cost of each bid, including matched funding contributions, is attached above.</p>

<h2>Selected projects</h2>

<h2>Tackling drug misuse in prisons</h2>

<p>Lead organisation(s): <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">The Ministry of Justice</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/her-majestys-prison-and-probation-service">Her Majesty’s Prison &amp; Probation Service</a></p>

<p>This project will fill an important evidence gap in assessing the impact of drug testing in prisons by testing the feasibility of wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) in prisons, before running randomised control trials to assess the most cost-effective method(s) to identify/deter drug misuse and to support prisoners to live a drug-free life.</p>

<h2>Using linked justice system administrative data for quasi-experimental evaluations</h2>

<p>Lead organisation(s): <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">The Ministry of Justice</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/" rel="external">the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)</a></p>

<h2>Cohorts and Experiments Project</h2>

<p>Lead organisation(s): <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.homelessnessimpact.org/" rel="external">The Centre for Homelessness Impact (CHI)</a></p>

<p>This project will work with five <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-works-network">What Works Centres</a> to deliver three studies using cohort study data to explore the impacts of interventions on shared outcomes such as education and employment, engagement with the criminal justice system, homelessness and mental health.</p>

<h2>Developing useful parameters, learning and outcomes</h2>

<p>Lead organisation(s): <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.homelessnessimpact.org/" rel="external">The Centre for Homelessness Impact (CHI)</a></p>

<p>Led by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.homelessnessimpact.org/" rel="external">the Centre for Homelessness Impact (CHI)</a>, this proposal will develop and test infrastructure and building blocks for Departments and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-works-network">What Works Centres</a> to improve the quality and breadth of causal evaluation in priority policy areas. Six cutting-edge evaluations will be delivered as part of the programme in priority policy areas.</p>

<h2>How were the bids selected?</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Evaluation Accelerator Fund Selection Process" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/141387/EAF_selection_process.png"></div></figure>

<p>Bids to the EAF were invited from departments and  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-works-network">What Works Centres</a> in areas aligned with the Prime Minister’s core missions. To encourage the best bids, and maximise the impact of the fund, the ETF undertook extensive engagement with departments. The fund is focused on supporting high-quality evaluation approaches using robust methodologies such as randomised control trials and quasi-experiments.</p>

<p>In total, 46 bids were received: 27 from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">government departments</a> and 19 from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-works-network">What Works Centres</a>. These 46 bids requested £26.6m of funding, with £9.3m matched funding pledged.</p>

<p>All bids were triaged to check for eligibility and then double-scored by the ETF. Consensus meetings were held to discuss discrepancies in scoring, ensure consistency in our assessment practices, and agree on an overall RAG rating for each bid. A long list of potential projects was then shared with colleagues in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury">HM Treasury</a>, and with the ETF Oversight Board for further feedback.</p>

<p>Further updates on the funded projects will be made available on this page.</p>
