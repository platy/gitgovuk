<h2>What is a function?</h2>

<p>A function is a grouping aligned across government to manage functional work such as human resources, commercial, or finance. Functions are embedded in departments and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-bodies-reform#:~:text=Arm's%20length%20bodies%2C%20or%20ALBs,Departments%20('NMDs')">arm’s length bodies</a>.</p>

<p>Functions form a framework for collaboration within organisations and across organisational boundaries, to support efficient and effective delivery of policy, outcomes and services.</p>

<p>Their mandate (or authority) flows from Parliament and ministers through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dao-0521-mandating-functional-standards-from-end-september-2021">Managing Public Money</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/functional-standards">Functional Standards</a></p>

<h2>The purpose of each function</h2>

<p>The purpose of each function is summarised below. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/functional-standards">Functional standards</a> for more detail.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-property-function">Property</a>: to ensure government property is well managed, designed, constructed and operated; is efficient and provides value for money; is safe, secure and sustainable; and meets the needs of those using the property</p>

<h2>Functional standards</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/functional-standards">Functional standards</a> are mandated for use by departments and their arm’s length bodies. They bring together and clarify what needs to be done, and why, for the different types of functional work. They support efficient, coherent and consistent management.</p>

<p>This 2 minute animation gives an introduction to the functional standards:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C04DYMj1hhE" rel="external">How can functional standards help me?</a></p>

<p>Functional standards support normal assurance arrangements. They are used by local teams, functional experts and independent assurance providers to improve the way functional work is done.</p>

<h2>Activities common to each function</h2>

<p>A function sets direction for a particular type of functional work, such as commercial. In addition, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-001-government-functions">Government functional standard GovS 001</a> sets consistent expectations for management of the functions, including the roles and accountabilities needed.</p>

<p>The standard covers the activities that are common to each function, which include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Set cross-government strategies and ensure consistent delivery across government</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set and assure functional standards so that expectations for each type of functional work are clear, coherent and consistent, and there is a stable basis for assurance, risk management and capability building</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop functional capability including leadership, skills, resources and capacity (people, equipment, facilities), working closely with government professions to specify the right professional competences, induction and training</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give expert advice on strategy, business planning, compliance with standards and controls, how to drive up efficiency and effectiveness, and specific topics (such as complex commercial transactions or employment issues)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop and deliver commonly required services and products, either directly or through third parties (note that many internally focused shared services are delivered on behalf of the functions by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://sharedservices.blog.gov.uk/about/" rel="external">Government Business Services</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work across government to drive continuous improvement in the way functional work is done, for example</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>support organisations to assess how well standards are being met, and to make improvements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide authoritative cross-government requirements and guidance so that organisations don’t have to do this individually</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Government professions</h2>

<p>A government profession develops the capability of a group of people with particular skills, knowledge or expertise, and works across government on behalf of organisations and functions. See for example the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/civil-service-government-legal-profession/about">government legal profession</a>.</p>
