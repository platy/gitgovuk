<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Reminder: local authority maintained schools to check the status of their business rates payment process</h2>

<p>From 1 April 2022, ESFA will centrally pay the business rates for those local authority maintained schools whose billing authority is implementing the new national non-domestic rates (NNDR) payment process. This means local authority maintained schools in those areas should not pay the 2022 to 2023 business rates bill to the billing authority.</p>

<p>You can check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-non-domestic-rates-guidance-for-billing-authorities">NNDR payment process your billing authority is implementing</a>. We recommend you check this before making payment to avoid any confusion and duplicate payments.</p>

<p>If your billing authority is continuing with the existing NNDR payment arrangements, local authority maintained schools should continue to pay the rates bill for 2022 to 2023 as per the previous year’s arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: updated 2021 to 2022 dedicated schools grant (DSG) allocations</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: local authority 16 to 19 funds two part return for 2020 to 2021 financial year</h2>

<p>We sent an e-mail to all local authority chief financial officers (CFOs) copied to chief executives on 21 March 2022, highlighting the process for local authorities LAs to submit their 16 to 19 funds two-part return to ESFA for 2020 to 2021 using Document Exchange.</p>

<p>Local authorities must upload a CFO signed grant return (Tab 1) and &amp; 16 to 19 use of funds reconciliation return (Tab 2) to Document Exchange by 30 April 2022. We have added detailed guidance to the commissioning email.
You can access ESFA’s new Document Exchange portal by logging onto <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/document-exchange/start" rel="external">Document Exchange service</a>. You can review documents you’ve sent by selecting ‘documents you’ve sent to ESFA’ from the main Document Exchange page.</p>

<p>You can access the Document Exchange by logging into <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DFE Sign-In</a>. If you don’t have access to Document Exchange but would like it, please speak to one of the super users within your organisation. If you’re unsure who this is, please speak to the head of the organisation.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Information: ESFA adult education budget (AEB) funding and performance management rules 2021 to 2022 – Ukrainian visa schemes</h2>

<p>All Ukrainian adults and their family members supported through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa">Ukraine Family Scheme</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-visa-under-the-ukraine-sponsorship-scheme">Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme</a> are immediately eligible for FE 19+ funding and are exempt from the 3-year residency requirement as per the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2021-to-2022">AEB funding rules</a>.</p>

<p>Individuals applying for these schemes from outside the UK, will receive an official permission letter from Home Office confirming that they can travel to the UK. When they arrive in the UK with the permission letter, the UK Border Force officers will endorse their passport with a 6-month entry stamp. The 6-month entry stamp will be evidence of their right to work, study and claim benefits in the UK. Within 6 months of their arrival in the UK, they will be required to submit their biometrics to extend their stay for up to 3 years and will be issued a biometric residence permit (BRP), as evidence of their immigration status.</p>

<p>Individuals applying for these schemes from inside the UK, will need to book and attend an appointment at the UK Visa and Citizenship Application Services service point where they will need to give their biometric information to get a BRP.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that there may be some delays in the issue of the Home Office BRP. In these cases all individuals will be issued with a document showing proof of Home Office immigration status.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact us using our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">enquiry form</a>.</p>
