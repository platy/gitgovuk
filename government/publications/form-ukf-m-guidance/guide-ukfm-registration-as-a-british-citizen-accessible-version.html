<p>Registration as a British citizen: Persons born on or after 1 July 2006 who did not become British as their mother was married to someone other than their natural father</p>

<p>April 2020</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Becoming a British citizen is a significant life event. It allows you to apply for a 
British citizen passport and gives you the opportunity to participate more fully in the 
life of your local community.</p>

<p>This guide is for parents/guardians completing the form on behalf of a child under 
18. References to ‘you’ refer to the applicant, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>You will need to show that you satisfy a number of requirements set out in British 
nationality law. This guide aims to help you to make a successful application. It will 
also help you to prepare for British citizenship. It tells you what information to put 
into each section of the application form and which documents you need to supply.</p>

<p>Before continuing with your application, you should be aware that under the 
nationality laws of some countries a person will automatically lose their nationality 
if they become a citizen of another country. If you have any questions about this, 
you should ask the authorities of the country of which you are a citizen through 
their Embassy or High Commission before making your application. If the country 
of which you are currently a citizen continues to recognise you as one of its 
citizens, you may continue to be subject to the duties of citizens of that country 
when you are in its territory. This may include obligations to undergo military 
service.</p>

<p>The law covering registration is contained in the British Nationality Act 1981 and 
the regulations made under it. This guide is intended to help you to apply. It is not a 
complete statement of the law or policy. Other information about <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/becoming-a-british-citizen">citizenship and 
immigration</a> is available on our website.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this guide;</p>

<p>United Kingdom means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle 
of Man; and</li>
  <li>the Republic of Ireland at a time when it formed part of the United Kingdom 
(that is to say, before 31 March 1922); and</li>
  <li>(in relation to birth) a ship or aircraft registered in the United Kingdom or an 
unregistered ship or aircraft of the Government of the United Kingdom.</li>
</ul>

<p>Natural father means a man who is your biological parent.</p>

<h3>OISC and Immigration Advice</h3>

<p>You may, if you wish, use the services of an agent such as a solicitor or other 
competent adviser to help you with your application.</p>

<p>Immigration or nationality advisers acting in the course of business (whether paid or 
unpaid) are regulated by the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner 
(OISC), an independent body. The provision of such advice is prohibited unless a 
person works for an organisation registered with, or exempted by, the OISC or is 
authorised to practise (like solicitors and barristers) by a designated professional 
body. Certain categories (for example public health bodies) are exempted from the 
regulatory scheme by Ministerial Order. It is a criminal offence to provide advice or 
services in contravention of the regulatory scheme. Further information about the 
regulatory scheme and a full list of OISC regulated advisers is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-immigration-services-commissioner">OISC website</a>.</p>

<h2>The requirements you have to meet</h2>

<p>If you were born on or after 1 July 2006 you may already be a British citizen through 
your father. However, if your mother was married to someone other than your 
natural father at the time of your birth, that man will be your father for nationality 
purposes.</p>

<p>You can apply for registration if you meet all the requirements below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you would have become a British citizen automatically if your mother had not 
been married to someone other than your natural (biological) father</li>
  <li>you have never been a British citizen</li>
</ul>

<p>To apply under these provisions, you will need to prove your relationship with your 
natural father. To do this you will have to provide evidence of paternity.</p>

<p>If you can provide genuine and reliable documents, we will recognise a man as your 
father in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He is named as your father on a birth certificate issued within one year of your 
birth, or</li>
  <li>A DNA test report shows he is your father, or</li>
  <li>A court has ruled that he is your father, or</li>
  <li>You can provide other evidence that is sufficient to establish paternity.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you meet the requirements for registration set out in this Guide, there is discretion to waive 
the need to pay a fee. If you wish to be considered for a fee-free application tick the box in the 
Declaration section of Form UKF(M).</p>

<p>If your parents married after your birth you may already be a British citizen. This will 
depend on which country’s laws applied to your father at the time of the marriage. 
Some countries’ laws – including the UK - state that where a child’s parents marry 
after the child’s birth, the child will be treated as if the parents had been married at 
the time of the birth. If your parents married after your birth you may wish to seek the 
advice of an <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.oisc.gov.uk/" rel="external">immigration adviser</a>.</p>

<h2>Biometric Enrolment</h2>

<p>As part of your application, all applicants are required to enrol their biometric 
details for the purpose of identity verification.</p>

<p>Children under 18 applying for registration as a British citizen must also enrol their 
biometric details. Children under the age of 6 do not need to provide fingerprints but 
must have a digital photograph taken of their face.</p>

<p>Up to the age of 6 the Home Office only requires a digitised image of the child’s 
face, although the regulation does not prevent fingerprints being recorded from 
children aged less than 6 years. There is no upper age limit for biometric 
information to be taken.</p>

<p>Children under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian 
at their biometric enrolment appointment.</p>

<p>Where you give your biometric information depends on how you’re making your visa 
or immigration application. You’ll be told where to go after you’ve applied.</p>

<p>Your application may be rejected as invalid if you do not enrol your biometrics when 
requested. For more information about enrolling biometrics and the current fee, 
please visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/biometric-residence-permits">biometric residence permits</a> section of our website.</p>

<h2>Documents</h2>

<p>This section tells you the sort of documents you will need to provide to consider 
your application. We cannot consider your application unless we have supporting 
documents. If you do not submit your application with supporting documents and 
the application will be returned to you unprocessed.</p>

<h3>Documentary evidence that (had the law been different) you would have become a British citizen</h3>

<p>You will need to provide the following documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your passport (if held)</li>
  <li>Your full birth certificate and either:
    <ul>
      <li>Your father’s full birth certificate (if your father was born in the UK on or 
after 1 January 1983, we also need to see evidence that one of his 
parents was a British citizen or settled in the UK at that time), or o Your 
father’s certificate of naturalisation or registration as a British citizen or as 
a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (or, before 1 January 1949, 
as a British subject), or o Papers showing your father’s legal adoption, or</li>
      <li>Your father’s citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies or British citizen 
passport showing he had that status before you were born, or</li>
      <li>Evidence that he was settled in the UK at the time of your birth, if you 
were born in the UK.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Proof of Paternity</h3>

<p>If your natural father was named as your father on a birth certificate issued within 12 
months of your birth and you were born before 10 September 2015, this will be 
acceptable evidence of paternity. If not, you must provide other evidence. This 
could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DNA test reports. We will accept test results from a company that is on the 
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-dna-test">government’s accredited list</a>, or</li>
  <li>a court order, or</li>
  <li>other evidence that proves you are related as claimed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please provide any translations if these are applicable.</p>

<p>If the person applying is under 18, the consent of all those with parental 
responsibility should be provided.</p>

<h2>The citizenship you will acquire</h2>

<p>If neither your mother or her husband was a British citizen at the time of your birth, you will 
be a British citizen “otherwise than by descent” following registration under this 
provision. This means that you could pass on British citizenship to any children born abroad 
to you in the future.</p>

<p>If your mother or her husband was a British citizen at the time of your birth, you will be a 
British citizen “by descent” following registration under this provision. This would mean that 
a child born to you in the UK would be a British citizen automatically, but not a child born 
overseas (unless you were in Crown or similar service).</p>

<p>Further information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/becoming-a-british-citizen">requirements for citizenship</a> can be obtained on 
GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Good Character</h2>

<p>To be of good character a person should show respect for the rights and freedoms of 
the United Kingdom, observe its laws and fulfil their rights and duties as a resident of 
the United Kingdom. Checks will be made on children aged 10 years and over to 
ensure that this requirement is met.</p>

<p>If you are not honest about the information you provide and the child is registered on 
the basis of incorrect or fraudulent information they will be liable to have British 
citizenship taken away (deprivation) and you may be prosecuted. It is a criminal 
offence to make a false declaration knowing that it is untrue.</p>

<p>Among the duties and obligations which the child is expected to fulfil are payment of 
income tax and National Insurance contributions, if employed. We may ask H.M. 
Revenue &amp; Customs for confirmation that tax and National Insurance affairs are in 
order.</p>

<p>If a child is liable for income tax but does not pay through PAYE you must 
demonstrate that their obligations towards the H.M. Revenue &amp; Customs have been 
discharged by attaching a Self Assessment Statement of Account.</p>

<p>You must give details of all criminal convictions given to the child both within and 
outside the United Kingdom. These include road traffic offences. Fixed penalty 
notices (such as speeding or parking tickets) must be disclosed, although will not 
normally be taken in to account unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have failed to pay and there were criminal proceedings as a result; or</li>
  <li>they have received numerous fixed penalty notices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drink driving offences must be declared. If the child has any endorsements on their 
driving license you must provide the paper counterpart.</p>

<p>A driving conviction may not yet be disregarded despite any penalty points being 
removed from the driving license.</p>

<p>Criminal record checks will be carried out in all cases on minors 10 years and over.</p>

<p>If the child has a conviction within the relevant sentence based threshold they are 
unlikely to be registered. Similarly if the child has been charged with a criminal 
offence and are awaiting trial or sentencing, you are advised not to make any 
application for the child’s registration until the outcome is known. If the child is 
convicted, you should then consult the table below.</p>

<p><strong>4 Years or more imprisonment</strong></p>

<p>Application will normally be refused, 
regardless of when the conviction 
occurred.</p>

<p><strong>Between 12 months and 4 years imprisonment</strong></p>

<p>Application will normally be refused 
unless 15 years have passed since 
the end of the sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Up to 12 months imprisonment</strong></p>

<p>Application will normally be refused 
unless 10 years have passed since 
the end of the sentence.</p>

<p><strong>A non-custodial offence or other out of court disposal that is recorded on a person’s criminal record</strong></p>

<p>Application will normally be refused if 
the conviction occurred in the last 3 
years.</p>

<h3>Notes regarding types of conviction or caution:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A person who receives a sentence of life imprisonment is included in the ‘4 years 
or more imprisonment’ category.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person who receives a custodial sentence of exactly 4 years is included in the 
‘4 years or more imprisonment’ category.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person who receives a custodial sentence of exactly 12 months or exactly 1 
year is included in the ‘Between 12 months and 4 years imprisonment’ category.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “end of the sentence” means the entire sentence imposed, not just the time 
the person spent in prison. For example, a person sentenced to 3 years’ 
imprisonment on 1st January 2013 will normally be refused citizenship until 1st 
January 2031 – the 15 year ‘bar’ added to the 3 year sentence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A “non-custodial offence or other out of court disposal that is recorded on a 
person’s criminal record” includes Fines, Cautions, Warnings and Reprimands, 
Community Sentences, Civil Orders, Hospital Orders &amp; Restriction Orders and 
Potential Court Orders.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person who is subject of an extant Deportation Order will be refused citizenship 
regardless of when they apply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some extremely short periods of imprisonment may not be included in the ‘up to 
12 months imprisonment’ category. This will depend on whether the person was 
convicted and sentenced or simply committed to prison. The latter is not a 
sentence and the vast majority of those detained for one day– will have been 
committed by the court and not sentenced. The decision maker will instead treat 
this as a “non-custodial offence or other out of court disposal that is recorded on a 
person’s criminal record”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A suspended prison sentence will be treated as a “non-custodial offence or other 
out of court disposal that is recorded on a person’s criminal record”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The exception is where that sentence is subsequently ‘activated’. This means that 
the person re-offended or failed to adhere to/breached the conditions of that 
sentence. Where this happens, the sentence length will be the one originally 
imposed.
    <ul>
      <li>Example 1: a person is sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment, suspended for two 
years. If they ‘activate’ this, the sentence should be 6 months and fall into the ‘up 
to 12 months’ imprisonment’ category above.</li>
      <li>Example 2: a person is sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 
two years. If they ‘activate’ this, the sentence should be 12 months and fall into 
the ‘Between 12 months and 4 years’ imprisonment’ category above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sentences imposed overseas will normally be treated as if they occurred in the 
UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For concurrent sentences, the decision maker will take the longest single 
sentence imposed. For example, a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment served 
concurrently with a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment will be treated the same 
as one 9-month sentence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>For consecutive sentences, the decision maker will add together the total of all 
the sentences imposed. For example, a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment 
served consecutively with a of 6 months’ imprisonment will be treated the same 
as one 15 month sentence.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are also advised to refer to the good character policy guidance which 
caseworkers use to decide your application. This is available on the website.</p>

<p>We may disregard a single non-custodial sentence, providing it did not occur in the 
last 12 months, if there are strong countervailing factors which suggest the child is of 
good character in all other regards and the decision to refuse would be 
disproportionate. Offences involving dishonesty (such as theft), violence or sexual 
offences or drugs would not be disregarded. Drink-driving offences, driving while 
uninsured or disqualified or driving whilst using a mobile phone would not be 
disregarded either.</p>

<p>You must give details of all civil judgments which have resulted in a court order being 
made against you as well as any civil penalties under the UK Immigration Acts. If you 
have been declared bankrupt at any time you should give details of the bankruptcy 
proceedings. (Your application is unlikely to succeed if you are an undischarged 
bankrupt.)</p>

<p>You do not need to give details of family law proceedings such as divorce decrees, 
dissolved civil partnerships, guardianship orders, parental responsibility orders.</p>

<p>You must give details of any cautions (simple or conditional), warnings or reprimands 
you have received in the UK or any other country. Cautions, warnings and 
reprimands are out of court disposals that are recorded on a person’s criminal record 
and are taken in to account when assessing a person’s character.</p>

<p>You must say if your details have been recorded by the police as a result of certain 
sexual offences, or if you are subject to one of the following orders: notification order, 
sexual offences prevention order, foreign travel order, risk of sexual harm order (or 
equivalent order made in a British overseas territory or any other country). If your 
details are recorded on the “sex offenders” register, even if any conviction is spent, 
the Home Secretary is unlikely to be satisfied that you meet the good character 
requirement and so an application for citizenship is unlikely to be successful.</p>

<h3>What if there is no conviction but the child’s character may be in doubt?</h3>

<p>You must say if there is any offence for which the child may go to court or which is 
awaiting hearing in court. This includes having been arrested for an offence and 
waiting to hear if the child will be formally charged. If the child has been arrested and 
not told that charges have been dropped, or that the child will not have to appear in 
court, you may wish to confirm the position with the police. For applicants from 
Scotland any civil penalties must also be declared.</p>

<p>You must tell us if the child is arrested or charged with an offence after you make the 
application and while the application is under consideration. You risk prosecution 
under section 46 of the British Nationality Act 1981 if you do not do so.</p>

<p>You must also say here whether the child has had any involvement in terrorism. If 
you do not regard something as an act of terrorism but you know that others do or 
might, you should mention it. You must also say whether the child has been involved 
in any crimes in the course of armed conflict, including crimes against humanity, war 
crimes or genocide. If you are in any doubt as to whether something should be 
mentioned, you should mention it.</p>

<p>The following information provides guidance on actions which may constitute 
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>

<p>This guidance is not exhaustive. Before you answer these questions you should 
consider the full definitions of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide 
which can be found in Schedule 8 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hmso.GOV.UK/acts/acts2001/20010017.htm" rel="external">International Criminal Court Act 2001</a>. 
Alternatively, copies can be purchased from The Stationery Office, telephone 0333 
202 5070.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to satisfy yourself that you are familiar with the definitions and 
can answer the questions accurately.</p>

<h3>Genocide</h3>

<p>Acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial 
or religious group.</p>

<h3>Crimes against humanity</h3>

<p>Acts committed at any time (not just during armed conflict) as part of a widespread or 
systematic attack, directed against any civilian population with knowledge of the 
attack. This would include offences such as murder, torture, rape, severe deprivation 
of liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law and enforced 
disappearance of persons.</p>

<h3>War Crimes</h3>

<p>Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions committed during an armed conflict. 
This includes an internal armed conflict and an international armed conflict. The 
types of acts that may constitute a war crime include wilful killing, torture, extensive 
destruction of property not justified by military necessity, unlawful deportation, the 
intentional targeting of civilians and the taking of hostages.</p>

<h3>Terrorist Activities</h3>

<p>Any act committed, or the threat of action, designed to influence a government or 
intimidate the public and made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or 
ideological cause and that involves serious violence against a person; that may 
endanger another person’s life; creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the 
public; involves serious damage to property; is designed to seriously disrupt or 
interfere with an electronic system.</p>

<h3>Organisations concerned in terrorism</h3>

<p>An organisation is concerned in terrorism if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commits or participates in acts of terrorism</li>
  <li>prepares for terrorism</li>
  <li>promotes and/or encourages terrorism</li>
  <li>is otherwise concerned in terrorism</li>

<h3>Deception</h3>

<p>If you have practised deception in your dealings with the Home Office or other 
Government Departments (such as by providing false information or fraudulent 
documents) this will be taken into account in considering whether a child meets the 
good character requirement.</p>

<p>An application will be refused if a person has attempted to deceive the Home Office 
within the last 10 years.</p>

<h3>Immigration Related Issues</h3>

<p>Your application will be refused if you have attempted to deceive the Home Office 
within the last 10 years, such as entering the UK illegally, evading immigration 
control, helping someone else abuse the immigration laws, or abuse of the 
Knowledge of Language and Life in the UK requirement. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/naturalisation-as-a-british-citizen-by-discretion-nationality-policy-guidance">Full details of our policy</a> can 
be seen at our website.</p>

<p>You must say whether the child has been involved in anything which might indicate 
that they are not of good character. You must give information about any of these 
activities no matter how long ago it was. Checks will be made in all cases and the 
application may fail if you make an untruthful declaration. If you are in any doubt 
about whether the child has done something or it has been alleged that the child has 
done something which might lead us to think that they are not of good character you 
should say so.</p>

<p>You must tell us if the child has ever practised deception in their dealings with the 
Home Office or other Government Departments (such as by providing false 
information or fraudulent documents). This will be taken in to account in considering 
whether the child meets the good character requirement. If the application is refused, 
and there is clear evidence of the deception, any future application made within 10 
years is unlikely to be successful.</p>

<p>You must also tell us if the child has been convicted of an offence or has received 
a court order (such as an injunction or Criminal Behaviour Order).</p>

<h2>Deprivation</h2>

<p>You may be deprived of your British citizenship if it is found to have been obtained by 
fraud, false representation or the concealment of any material fact. The Home 
Secretary may also deprive you of British citizenship if they are satisfied that 
deprivation is conducive to the public good and you would not be made stateless. 
Following the Immigration Act 2014, the Home Secretary may also deprive 
naturalised persons of their British citizenship if the person has conducted 
themselves in a manner which is seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the 
United Kingdom and the Home Secretary has reasonable grounds for believing the 
person is able, under the law of another country to become a national of that country 
or territory.</p>

<p>A registration may, as a matter of law, be ineffective from the outset if it is obtained 
by means of impersonation.</p>
