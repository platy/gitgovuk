<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Annual Claim deadline for Forestry Commission grants</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>You have until 16 May 2022 to submit your claim.</h3>

<p>If you need to claim your grant from us please submit your claim as soon as possible. We are accepting claims via email and post but encourage you to email your claim or to obtain proof of posting a claim.</p>

<p>If you think you might have problems meeting the deadline please contact your admin hub at the address below. This is also the place to email your claim form to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bucks Horn Oak (this Hub generally covers the east of the country) <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:adminhub.buckshornoak@forestrycommission.gov.uk">adminhub.buckshornoak@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a>

<p>If we receive your claim after 16 May 2022 payments will be reduced in value by 1% for each working day that the claim is received late. Claims received after 10 June 2022 will result in the total loss of that payment for the year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Change to EWCO - NfC Social GIS Targeting and Scoring layer</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Make sure your application is with us before 16 May.</h3>

<p>We recently told you about a change to the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) layer used for targeting woodland creation and scoring applications for the England Woodland Creation Offer (EWCO) for social benefits. This affects the eligibility of applications for the two social Additional Contributions (ACs): close to settlements and public access.</p>

<p>Applications received before 16 May 2022 which were eligible for these ACs before the layer changed will remain eligible for them. From 16 May 2022, only schemes that fall within the published layer will be eligible.</p>

<p>The EWCO - NfC Social layer can be viewed on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forestergis.com/Apps/MapBrowser/" rel="external">Forestry Commission’s Map Browser</a>.</p>

<p>Defra closed the window for questions on this round of Landscape Recovery on 26 April, but there is still time to submit an application. This is to give applicants enough time to digest all the published information and finalise their bids.

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Local Authority Treescapes Fund and Urban Tree Challenge Fund application deadline is coming up</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Submit your applications before 31 May 2022.</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-authority-treescapes-fund">Local Authority Treescapes Fund</a> (LATF) and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/urban-tree-challenge-fund">Urban Tree Challenge Fund</a> (UTCF) both close for applications at 23:59 on 31 May 2022.

<p>There are also case studies available for both funds providing real life examples of the benefits that each grant can deliver. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1066392/FC_Case_Study_Durham.pdf" rel="external">UTCF case study</a> looks at planting carried out by Durham County Council, who have been successful in all three rounds of UTCF held to date.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Bringing BPS payments forward</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Farmers with eligible applications will receive half of their payment from the end of July, and the rest from December.</h3>

<p>The price of agricultural commodities has always been closely correlated to energy prices and as we all know these have been sharply rising.</p>

<p>To help prevent increased pressure on cash flow in the short term, Defra have decided to change the way they make Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) payments.</p>

<p>BPS 2022 payments are going to be made in 2 installments. Farmers with eligible applications will receive half of their payment from the end of July, and the rest from December.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://defrafarming.blog.gov.uk/2022/05/09/bringing-bps-payments-forward/" rel="external">Read more in Defra’s recent blog</a>.</p>
