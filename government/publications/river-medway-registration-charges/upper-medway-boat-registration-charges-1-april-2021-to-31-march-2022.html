  <li>The Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010</li>
  <li>The Environment Act 1995 (S43)</li>
  <li>Southern Water Authority Act 1982 (S42 and S46)</li>
</ul>

<p>This charging scheme sets out the registration charges for all boats, kept, used or let for hire on the Upper Medway Navigation from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 and is made under the powers of the Environment Agency to fix charges in sections 42 and 46 Southern Water Authority Act 1982 and section 43 Environment Act 1995.</p>

<p>All boats kept, used or let for hire on Upper Medway Navigation must be registered with the Environment Agency in accordance with The Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010.</p>

<p>This requirement extends to every part of the Upper Medway Navigation between Allington Lock and the Leigh Barrier at Tonbridge, including backwaters and marinas.</p>

<p>The full registration charge is payable for a boat kept, used or let for hire on Upper Medway Navigation at any time during the registration year (1 April to 31 March), unless it qualifies for the ‘end of season’ discount. When registering the boat, you are responsible to pay the full registration charge.</p>

<p>All annual registrations expire on 31 March regardless of when they start (except for visitors); there are no pro-rata annual registration charges. When registering the vessel, you are responsible to pay the full registration charge. Any boat not displaying a current registration certificate shall be liable to pay the full annual charge.</p>

<p>Words or expressions used herein shall have the same meaning as defined in the Acts and the Order.</p>

<h2>Powered boats</h2>

<p>Definition - ‘powered’ means mechanically propelled. Annual charges are to be calculated as follows:</p>

<h3>Annual registration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>overall length not exceeding 7.6m = £42.76 per metre</li>
  <li>overall length exceeding 7.6m = £42.76 per metre up to 7.6 metres plus £38.35 per metre in excess of 7.6 metres up to 11 metres</li>
  <li>over 11 metres (37ft) in length £461.47</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hire boats</h3>
<p>Powered boat which is used during the hiring period in each year under contract of hire.</p>

<ul>
  <li>overall length not exceeding 7.6m = £73.33 per metre</li>
  <li>overall length exceeding 7.6m = £73.33 per metre up to 7.6 metres plus £65.78 per metre in excess of 7.6 metres and up to 11 metres</li>
  <li>over 11 metres (37ft) in length = £791.31</li>
</ul>

<h3>Passenger boats and tugs</h3>
<p>Passenger boats - powered boats issued with a current certificate by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to carry passengers (not exceeding 199).</p>

<ul>
  <li>overall length not exceeding 7.6m = £55 per metre</li>
  <li>overall length exceeding 7.6m = £55 per metre up to 7.6 metres plus £49.32 per metre in excess of 7.6 metres and up to 11 metres</li>
  <li>over 11 metres (37ft) in length = £593.48</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are examples of charges, calculate the exact charge for your boat size using the charges above.</p>

<h2>Registration discounts</h2>

<h3>Electric engine discounts</h3>
<p>Boats with an electric engine receive a 25% discount on the appropriate registration charge, provided the sole method of propulsion is an electric engine/s and no other propulsion or charging engine is carried.</p>

<h3>Tenders (small boats such as a dinghy, towed or carried by another boat)</h3>
<p>A powered or unpowered tender shall not be subject to charge if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>belongs to a powered boat that has a current registration certificate</li>
  <li>is clearly marked and has been notified to the Environment Agency as a tender to that boat</li>
  <li>is normally attached to that boat and is being used on the navigation for a purpose directly connected with the navigation of the parent boat</li>
</ul>

<h3>End of season discount</h3>
<p>Boats registering for the 3 months from January to March only, can register for the charge of a 1 month visitor registration.</p>

<p>This applies to a boat that has not been kept or used on the Upper Medway Navigation before 1 January in the registration year (1 April to 31 March). It also applies if the applicant is the new owner of the boat.</p>

<h2>Applying discounts</h2>
<p>If more than one discount applies, the value of each one is calculated on the declining net balance.</p>

<p>For example, if the full charge is £100 and the boat is eligible for the electric and late registration discounts, the net payable would be £100 – 25% = £75 – 50% = £37.50.</p>

<h2>Other registration options</h2>

<h3>Gold licence</h3>
<p>You can buy a gold licence which lets you use all Environment Agency and Canal &amp; River Trust waterways. Gold licences are only available to buy through the Canal &amp; River Trust.</p>

<h3>British Canoeing and Canoe Wales</h3>
<p>Members of British Canoeing or Canoe Wales can use our waterways as part of their yearly membership fee. They are required to carry their membership card with them as it acts as a registration too. Affiliated clubs through British Canoeing and Canoe Wales may purchase registrations for club owned boats through British Canoeing and Canoe Wales or can purchase registrations directly from us. Members of the Scottish Canoe Association and the Canoe Association of Northern Ireland must apply for registrations through us.</p>

<h3>British Rowing</h3>
<p>Members of a British Rowing affiliated club should register their boats with British Rowing at a reduced rate. This should be done through their club.</p>

<h2>Other charges</h2>

<h3>Slipway charges</h3>
<p>Use of the Environment Agency’s slipways at Hampstead Lock and Allington Lock –  £7.50 per occasion.</p>

<h3>Lifting Bridge at Yalding</h3>
<p>Owners of boats who wish to operate the Lifting Bridge at Yalding may obtain a key from Allington Lock. £20 per key.</p>
