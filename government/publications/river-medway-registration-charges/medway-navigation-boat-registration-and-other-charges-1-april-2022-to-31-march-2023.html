<p>The Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010.</p>

<p>Southern Water Authority Act 1982 (sections 35, 42 and 46).</p>

<p>The National navigation boat charging scheme 2022 to 2023 sets out the charges for all boats, kept or used on the Medway Navigation from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023. It is made under the powers of the Environment Agency to fix charges in sections 35, 42 and 46 of Southern Water Authority Act 1982 and under article 23 of The Environment Agency (Inland Waterways) Order 2010.</p>

<p>The scheme will increase charges by 4% in 2023 to 2024 and a further 2% in 2024 to 2025. Charges will then continue at the 2024 values each year until the scheme is amended.</p>

<p>This requirement extends to every part of the Medway Navigation between Allington Lock and the Leigh Barrier at Tonbridge, including backwaters and marinas.</p>

<p>All boats have to register and pay the appropriate charge unless they are exempt from charge (go to section 10).</p>

<p>Annual charges are due on 1 April of each year, and they expire on 31 March each year.</p>

<p>If a powered or unpowered enclosed boat is registered for the first time part way through a registration year, then a pro rata (reduced) charge may apply in certain circumstances (go to section 14).</p>

<p>Visitor charges (monthly, weekly and daily) are due when coming onto the waterway and they expire after the defined period of the registration. They are valid from the date and time set when registering for the period. Boats kept on Environment Agency waterways are not eligible for visitor registrations.</p>

<p>Monthly visitor charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for consecutive 31 days.</p>

<p>Weekly visitor charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for 7 consecutive days.</p>

<p>Daily visitor charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for 24 hours. They are valid for 24 hours from the time of issue, or where issued in advance, valid for 24 hours from the date and time requested at application. Where tidal conditions prevent moving off the waterway within the valid time, the valid time shall be extended by 12 hours to allow passage on the next tide. Any extension will be managed by staff at our tidal locks.</p>

<p>Explorer charges allow a boat to be on the waterway for up to 15 non consecutive days in the annual registration period. The ‘explorer’ option is only available for privately owned unpowered open boats.</p>

<p>When registering a boat, the registered owner is responsible to pay the full charge.</p>

<p>Charges for powered boats and unpowered enclosed boats are subject to a minimum charge of £10.80.</p>

<p>Words or expressions used herein shall have the same meaning as defined in the Acts and the Order and the National navigation boat charging schemes from 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Powered boats</h2>

<p>“powered boat” means a boat which is mechanically propelled by a combustion engine, steam engine, or electric motor.</p>

<h3>Annual charges for powered boats</h3>

<h4>How to calculate the charge for powered boats</h4>

<p>Example for a boat 6.5 metres long (not exceeding 7.6 metres long)</p>

<p>Step 1: Multiply the length by the charge per metre. For example 6.5 x £44.47 = £289.06</p>

<p>Example for a boat 10 metres long (exceeding 7.6 metres up to and including 11 metres)</p>

<p>Step 1: Multiply the length by the charge per metre for the first 7.6 metres. For example 7.6 x £44.47 = £337.97</p>

<p>Step 2: Multiply the length over 7.6 metres by charge per metre for remaining length. For example (10-7.6) X 39.88 =           £95.71</p>

<p>Step 3: Add the 2 amounts together for the final charge. For example £337.97 + £95.71 = £433.68</p>

<h3>Annual charges for electrically powered boats</h3>

<p>“Electrically powered” means the power to propel the boat is solely from an electric motor.</p>

<p>Electrically powered boats shall pay 75% of the appropriate annual powered boat charge set out in table 1.</p>

<h4>How to calculate the charge for electric powered boats:</h4>

<p>Step 1: work out the powered boat charge using the steps in ‘Annual charges for powered boats’ above.</p>

<p>Step 2: multiply the result by 0.75</p>

<p>If a powered boat is registered for the first time part way through a registration year, then a pro rata (reduced) charge may apply in certain circumstances. Go to section 14 for more details.</p>

<h3>Visitor charges</h3>

<h4>Visitor charges for powered boats</h4>

<p>Monthly fee to be calculated as 25% of the annual charge as calculated using table 1.</p>

<p>Weekly fee to be calculated as 12.5% of the annual charge as calculated using table 1.</p>

<p>Daily fee for boats up to 7.6 metres in length: £15.80.</p>

<p>Daily fee for boats exceeding 7.6 metres in length: £31.82.</p>

<p>Charges for powered boats and unpowered enclosed boats are subject to a minimum charge of £10.80.</p>

<p>Electrically powered boats shall pay 75% of the visitor charges for powered boats.</p>

<p>Business boats pay these charges plus an additional business charge dependent on the business category. These charges and categories are outlined in section 6. Business charges do not apply to not-for-profit organisations or charities.</p>

<p>Charges for maintenance workboats and tugs are outlined in section 5.</p>

<p>Boats kept on Environment Agency waterways are not eligible for visitor registrations.</p>

<p>Privately owned powered boats, which have a current annual registration issued for an Environment Agency waterway, can visit the other Environment Agency waterways free of charge for two periods of 7 consecutive days.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Tenders</h2>
