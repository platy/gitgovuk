<p>10th December 2020</p>

<p>Dear Chief Constable and Mayor of Greater Manchester,</p>

<p>I am writing to you following sight of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire 
and Rescue Services’ (the Inspectorate) recent Victims Services Assessment report. 
I am deeply concerned that in too many cases the service provided to victims, particularly 
vulnerable victims, is falling short, that too many crimes are not being recorded and that in 
too many cases those failures relate to crimes of domestic abuse. This report follows 
previous crime data integrity inspections which showed serious failings to record crime, 
and to therefore treat victims as they should be treated.</p>

<p>I am also aware of wider issues relating to the quality of service that the people of Greater 
Manchester are receiving from their force as highlighted by disappointing findings on 
effectiveness and efficiency in recent PEEL inspections. The report paints a worrying 
picture of failings in tackling crime more broadly. Most troubling was the Inspectorate’s 
finding of a Cause for Concern in relation to safeguarding of the most vulnerable victims. 
I recognise and appreciate the efforts of every officer in GMP, particularly over the past 12 
months when the challenges of policing during the pandemic have been huge. However, 
while we await the findings of the Inspectorate’s follow up report to determine the progress 
since the widely-reported failures of iOPS, these findings risk further eroding the 
confidence and trust that the people of Greater Manchester are entitled to have in their 
force’s ability to keep them safe.</p>

<p>I should remind you that this year, we are providing the largest increase in funding for the 
policing system since 2010. The 2020/21 settlement provides total police funding of up to 
£15.2 billion, and that is an increase of up to £1.12 billion compared to 2019/20, including 
main grant, council tax precept and national priorities. Greater Manchester Police will 
receive £643m; an increase of up to £49m from the previous year. 
Given my concerns, I am writing to request, no later than 4 February, your (Mayor) 
comments on, and response to, the recommendations of the Victims Services Assessment 
report as required under Section 55 of the Police Act 1996 (as amended by Section 37 of 
the Policing and Crime Act 2017).</p>

<p>Additionally, I would be grateful if you (Chief Constable) would send me your recovery plan 
at the earliest opportunity. This will help me understand the steps you collectively plan to 
take to remedy the issues identified.</p>

<p>I am happy, as ever, to discuss this further and would re-iterate my offer of Home Office 
support where it is appropriate. I look forward to hearing the outcome of the meeting you 
have scheduled with the Policing Minister to discuss this report.</p>

<p>I have copied this letter to HMCIC Sir Tom Winsor and HMI Zoe Billingham.</p>

<p><strong>Rt Hon Priti Patel MP</strong></p>
