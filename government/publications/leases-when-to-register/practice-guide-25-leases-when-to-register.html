<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Land Registration Act 2002, together with the Land Registration Rules 2003, changes the categories of leases that are now either compulsorily or voluntarily registrable, and also the leases that we can note.</p>

<p>Not every leasehold estate is capable of being registered with its own title, but the Land Registration Act 2002 substantially extends the scope of title registration, for example, many more business leases will be subject to compulsory registration.</p>

<p>The information within this guide applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leases dated on or after 13 October 2003</li>
  <li>leases existing before 13 October 2003</li>
  <li>assignments, transfers (on sale, by way of gift or by order of court) or assents, including vesting assents, dated on or after 13 October 2003, of existing leasehold estates having more than seven years of the term left to run</li>
  <li>first legal mortgages dated on or after 13 October 2003</li>
  <li>assignments and transfers dated on or after 6 April 2009 of existing unregistered leasehold estates having more than seven years of the term left to run
    <ul>
      <li>giving effect to a partition of land subject to a trust of land</li>
      <li>by a deed that appoints, or by virtue of section 83 of the Charities Act 1993 has effect as if it appointed, a new trustee or is made in consequence of the appointment of a new trustee</li>
      <li>by a vesting order under section 44 of the Trustee Act 1925 that is consequential on the appointment of a new trustee.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How to apply the Land Registration Act 2002 and Land Registration Rules 2003: compulsory registration</h2>

<p>Section 4 of the Land Registration Act 2002 specifically sets out the circumstances when an application for first registration must be made.</p>

<p>The estate owner, or their successor in title, must apply for first registration – see section 6(1) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>The period for registration is two months from the date of the deed inducing registration – see section 6(4) of the Land Registration Act 2002. However, an order can be made to extend the period of registration – see section 6(5) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Section 27(2)(b) of the Land Registration Act 2002 specifically sets out the circumstances when leases out of a registered title must be registered.</p>

<p>Section 4(5A) of the Land Registration Act 2002 exempts relevant social housing tenancies from compulsory registration, regardless of term.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>New leases granted for a term of more than seven years out of unregistered land</h3>

<p>See section 4(1)(c) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Leases granted for a term of more than seven years from the date of the grant, out of either an unregistered freehold or leasehold estates, will be compulsorily registrable provided they are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for valuable or other consideration – that under section 4(6) of the Land Registration Act 2002 includes estates that have a negative value</li>
  <li>by way of a gift – section 4(7) of the Land Registration Act 2002 provides for
    <ul>
      <li>grants for the purpose of setting up a trust, where the person setting up the trust, ‘the settlor’, does not retain the whole of the beneficial interest</li>
      <li>transfers of the legal title to the beneficial owners, where the settlor did not retain the whole of the beneficial interest when the trust was set up</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>pursuant to an order of any court</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>New leases for a term of more than seven years out of a registered title</h3>

<p>See section 27(2)(b)(i) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Leases granted out of existing registered titles, that are for a term of more than seven years from the date of the grant are compulsorily registrable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Transfers or assignments of unregistered leases having more than seven years of the term unexpired</h3>

<p>See sections 4(1)(a), 4(1)(aa) (as introduced by the Land Registration Act 2002 (Amendment) Order 2008) and 4(2)(b) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Transfers or assignments of unregistered leases, that at the time of the transfers (or assignments) have more than seven years to run, are compulsorily registrable if they are made either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for valuable or other consideration – that under section 4(6) of the Land Registration Act 2002 includes estates that have a negative value</li>
  <li>by way of gift – section 4(7) of the Land Registration Act 2002 provides for
    <ul>
      <li>transfers for the purpose of setting up a trust, where the person setting up the trust, ‘the settlor’, does not retain the whole of the beneficial interest</li>
      <li>transfers of the legal title to the beneficial owners, where the settlor did not retain the whole of the beneficial interest when the trust was set up</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>pursuant to an order of any court</li>
  <li>by means of an assent – including a vesting assent</li>
  <li>if dated on or after 6 April 2009
    <ul>
      <li>to give effect to a partition of land subject to a trust of land</li>
      <li>by a deed that appoints, or by virtue of section 83 of the Charities Act 1993 has effect as if it appointed, a new trustee or that is made in consequence of the appointment of a new trustee</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>by a vesting order under section 44 of the Trustee Act 1925 that is consequential on the appointment of a new trustee</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Not all transfers or assignments attract compulsory registration.</p>

<p>The following are specific types of transfer or assignment that are not subject to compulsory registration</p>

<ul>
  <li>transfer by operation of law, such as, when a deceased’s property vests in their executors – see section 4(3) of the Land Registration Act 2002
    <ul>
      <li>however, a transfer by operation of law that is within section 4(1)(aa) of the Land Registration Act 2002, such as, when property vests in a new trustee by an express vesting declaration, or one that is implied, under section 40 of the Trustee Act 1925 in a deed appointing a new trustee, is subject to compulsory registration</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>an assignment of a mortgage term, ie mortgage by demise – see section 4(4)(a) of the Land Registration Act 2002</li>
  <li>an assignment or surrender of a lease to <abbr title="The person with the documentary or paper titler">the owner</abbr> of the immediate reversion where the term is to merge into that reversion – see section 4(4)(b) of the Land Registration Act 2002</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Transfers or assignments of unregistered leases where section 171A of the Housing Act 1985 applies</h3>

<p>See section 4(1)(b) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>All transfers of unregistered leases, irrespective of the length of the term of the lease, made pursuant to section 171A of the Housing Act 1985 (Preserved Right to Buy) are compulsorily registrable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Transfers of any registered leases</h3>

<p>See section 27(2)(a) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Most transfers of registered leases, irrespective of the length of the term of the lease, are compulsorily registrable. However, the following transfers by operation of law are not required to be registered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a transfer on the death or bankruptcy of an individual proprietor</li>
  <li>a transfer on the dissolution of a corporate proprietor</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Right to buy leases: Part V of the Housing Act 1985</h3>

<p>See sections 4(1)(e) and 27(2)(b)(iv) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>All leases, irrespective of the length of the term of the lease, made pursuant to Part V of the Housing Act 1985 are compulsorily registrable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>Leases where section 171A of the Housing Act 1985 applies</h3>

<p>See sections 4(1)(f) and 27(2)(b)(v) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>All leases, irrespective of the length of the term of the lease, made pursuant to section 171A of the Housing Act 1985 (Preserved Right to Buy) are compulsorily registrable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span>Reversionary leases taking effect more than three months from the date of the grant</h3>

<p>See sections 4(1)(d) and 27(2)(b)(ii) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>A ‘reversionary’ lease gives the lessee a right to possession of the leased property in the future, ie the lessee does not have an immediate right to possession of the land in the lease, at the date of the lease.</p>

<p>A lease granted out of either an:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unregistered leasehold estate, that at the date of grant has more than seven years left to run</li>
  <li>unregistered freehold estate</li>
  <li>existing registered title</li>
</ul>

<p>that is granted for any term to take effect more than three months from the date of the grant is compulsorily registrable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span>Discontinuous leases out of registered titles or granted for a term of more than seven years out of unregistered land</h3>

<p>See section 27(2)(b)(iii) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>These are leases where the lessee’s ‘right to possession’ of the land demised is discontinuous. The lease may be of a property, such as, a flat, apartment or market stall, that is for either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a specified number of days in a week, for example, every Monday to Friday (inclusive)</li>
  <li>a specific week(s) in a calendar year</li>
</ul>

<p>All discontinuous leases granted out of a registered title must be registered, regardless of the term.</p>

<p>Discontinuous leases granted for a term of more than seven years out of unregistered freehold or leasehold estates will be compulsory registrable.</p>

<p>See sections 4(1)(c) and 4(2)(b) of the Land Registration Act 2002 and see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3-1">New leases granted for a term of more than seven years out of unregistered land</a>.</p>

<p>To calculate the length of the term on such a lease, multiply the number of complete weeks each year the property is demised by the number of years granted.</p>

<p>If the total is more than seven years (ie more than 364 complete weeks), the lease and/or transfer will be compulsorily registrable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.10 </span>Protected first legal mortgage</h3>

<p>See sections 4(1)(g) and 4(2)(b) of the Land Registration Act 2002 and rules 21 and 22 of the Land Registration Rules 2003.</p>

<p>A protected first legal mortgage of an unregistered leasehold estate, that has more than seven years of its term unexpired, is subject to compulsory first registration. In order for such a mortgage to be registered, the leasehold estate will also need to be registered. Rule 21 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 allows a mortgagee of a protected first legal mortgage to apply to have the leasehold estate registered, whether or not the mortgagor consents to the application.</p>

<p>Note 1: A ‘protected mortgage’ is a mortgage that is protected by the deposit of documents relating to the mortgaged estate – see section 4(8)(a) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Note 2: A ‘first legal mortgage’ is a legal mortgage that ranks in priority over all other mortgages affecting the mortgaged estate – see s.4(8)(b) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How to apply the Land Registration Act 2002 and Land Registration Rules 2003: voluntary registration</h2>

<p>Section 3 of the Land Registration Act 2002 gives details of when an application can be made to voluntarily register an unregistered leasehold estate.</p>

<p>Section 3(4A) of the Land Registration Act 2002 specifically excludes relevant social tenancies from being eligible for voluntary registration.</p>

<p>The following sections mainly apply to leases that are made before 13 October 2003 and when no events requiring registration have occurred. However, some of the sections will also apply to some leases that are granted on or after 13 October 2003, that can be registered but may not be subject to compulsory registration. For example, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-4-2">Discontinuous leases out of unregistered land</a>.</p>

<p>The following sections give details of the leasehold estates in land that can be lodged voluntarily for first registration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Leases having more than seven years of their term unexpired</h3>

<p>See section 3(3) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Most leases will be accepted for registration, provided there is more than seven years of the original term left unexpired at the time of first registration. If the lease is granted on or after 13 October 2003 it will be subject to compulsory registration – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3-1">New leases granted for a term of more than seven years out of unregistered land</a>.</p>

<p>Where a lessee holds a lease in possession but is granted another lease of the same land, to take effect in possession on or within one month of the expiry of the first lease, the two terms can be treated as creating one continuous term – see section 3(7) of the Land Registration Act 2002. Therefore, if the two terms total more than seven years, we will accept a voluntary application for registration of both leases, that will be registered together on the same title.</p>

<p>Note: Section 3(7) of the Land Registration Act 2002 only provides that such leases can be treated as creating one continuous term for the purposes of voluntary registration. There is no provision that such leases are to be treated as one continuous term for the purposes of compulsory registration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Discontinuous leases out of unregistered land</h3>

<p>See section 3(4) of the Land Registration Act 2002. This provision is new under the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3-9">Discontinuous leases out of registered titles or granted for a term of more than seven years out of unregistered land</a> as to what constitutes a ‘discontinuous’ lease, and how to calculate the length of the term of the lease.</p>

<p>A voluntary application will be accepted, regardless of the length of the term, ie the lease does not have to be for more than seven years (364 weeks). However, if a discontinuous lease is granted on or after 13 October 2003, or a transfer of a discontinuous lease is made on or after 13 October 2003, it must be registered if it falls within sections 4(1)(c) and 4(1)(a) of the Land Registration Act 2002 – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3-1">New leases granted for a term of more than seven years out of unregistered land</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3-3">Transfers or assignments of unregistered leases having more than seven years of the term unexpired</a>.</p>

<p>To calculate the length of the term on such a lease, multiply the number of complete weeks each year the property is demised by the number of years granted.</p>

<p>If the total is more than seven years (ie more than 364 complete weeks) the lease and/or transfer will be compulsorily registrable.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>How to apply the Land Registration Act 2002 and Land Registration Rules 2003: leases that cannot be registered</h2>

<p>Section 3(5) of the Land Registration Act 2002 specifically details when we cannot accept an application to register a leasehold estate, ie if the estate owner (the applicant) has the leasehold estate vested in them as a mortgagee, where there is a subsisting right of redemption.</p>

<p>The following sections give details of the leasehold estates in land that cannot be lodged for registration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Leases granted for a term of seven years or less or where the unexpired term is for seven years or less</h3>

<p>Sections 3(3), 4(1)(c) and 27(2)(b)(i) of the Land Registration Act 2002 state that leases must be granted for a period of more than seven years to be registrable, or have more than seven years of the term unexpired.</p>

<p>Note: The following are exceptions to this and these leases can be registered irrespective of their term.</p>

<ul>
  <li>right to buy leases, pursuant to Part V of the Housing Act 1985</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Lease term starts more than 21 years from date of lease</h3>

<p>Usually a lease for which a rent or premium is payable where the term starts more than 21 years from the date of the lease is void – see section 149(3) of the Law of Property Act 1925. Therefore, such leases cannot be registered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Leases with no certain start date</h3>

<p>If the lease is silent as to the commencement date, we will normally assume (in the absence of other evidence) the term commences on the date of the lease.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Lessor and lessee are the same</h3>

<p>The House of Lords decided that neither one person, nor a company, can create a lease in favour of the same person or company. Any attempt to do so is without legal effect (Rye v Rye [1962] A C 496). Therefore, we cannot give any kind of registered title to such a lease.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Public-Private Partnership (<abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">PPP</abbr>) leases</h3>

<p>A <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">PPP</abbr> lease is a lease that constitutes a ‘public-private partnership’ agreement – see sections 210 and 211 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999.</p>

<p>The lease will usually be between London Regional Transport, Transport for London or one of its subsidiaries and a private company, for the purpose of maintaining or providing a railway, such as, an underground railway.</p>

<p><abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">PPP</abbr> leases are not registrable - see sections 90(1), (2) and (3) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>They are classed as an interest that overrides both first registration and registered dispositions – see section 90(5) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Leases vested in a person as a mortgagee: subsisting right of redemption</h3>

<p>See section 3(5) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>A lease vested in a person as mortgagee where there is a subsisting right of redemption cannot be registered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span>Relevant social housing tenancies</h3>

<p>See sections 3(4A), 4(5A) and 27(5A) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="A flexible tenancy within the meaning of section 107A of the Housing Act 1985 or an assured tenancy of a dwelling in England granted by a private registered provider of social housing other than a long tenancy or a shared ownership lease (see section 132(1) of the Land Registration Act 2002 as amended by section 157 of the Localism Act 2011)">relevant social housing tenancy</abbr> (as defined in section 132(1) of the Land Registration Act 2002) cannot be registered.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>How to apply the Land Registration Act 2002 and Land Registration Rules 2003: noting of leases</h2>

<p>See sections 32, 33, 34, 37 and 38 of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Section 32 of the Land Registration Act 2002 allows us to note certain leases against the registered estate affected, ie lessor’s title.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Noting of leases granted out of registered titles on or after 13 October 2003</h3>

<p>When an application is lodged for registration of a lease granted out of registered land that is required to be registered (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#compulsory-registration">How to apply the Land Registration Act 2002 and Land Registration Rules 2003: compulsory registration</a> for further details) no application is required to note the lease on the lessor’s registered title. Notice will automatically be entered in the lessor’s title by HM Land Registry, pursuant to section 38 of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Noting of leases on lessors’ registered superior titles following first registration</h3>

<p>See rule 37 of the Land Registration Rules 2003.</p>

<p>An application to register a lease that was either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not granted out of a registered estate</li>
  <li>granted before the commencement of Land Registration Act 2002</li>
  <li>and was not previously compulsorily registrable (such as, a lease of more than seven years but for 21 years or less)</li>
</ul>

<p>will be treated as an application for first registration.</p>

<p>Provided the lease can be noted – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6-4">Leases that we cannot note</a> – HM Land Registry will automatically note the lease in the lessor’s registered superior title (if it is not already noted), subject to serving notice on the lessor – see rule 37(3) of the Land Registration Rules 2003. If the lessor’s consent is lodged with the application we will not need to serve notice on the lessor.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Noting of leases for more than three years</h3>

<p>If a notice is not automatically made in the lessor’s title under section 38 of the Land Registration Act 2002 or rule 37(3) of the Land Registration Rules 2003 an application may be made for a notice to be entered if the lease:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is granted for a term of more than three years from the date of the grant</li>
  <li>does not relate to a trust of land or a settlement under the Settled Land Act 1925</li>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-7-3">Noting of leases</a> for details on how an application is made.</p>

<p>Section 37 of the Land Registration Act 2002 also allows HM Land Registry to note leases of more than three years but not exceeding seven years in a registered superior title, even though the lease itself will be incapable of substantive registration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Leases that we cannot note</h3>

<p>See section 33 of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>We cannot note the following in the register. Leases that are:</p>

<p>However, any original copies of death certificates or grants of probate will continue to be returned.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>First registration</h3>

<p>The estate owner or their successor in title should apply for first registration – see section 6(1) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>The period for registration is two months from the date of the deed inducing registration – see sections 6(4) and (5) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Applications must be lodged in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a> – see rule 23(1) of the Land Registration Rules 2003.</p>

<p>If the lease is granted to two or more persons and it either does not contain details, or contains conflicting information, as to whether a Form A restriction (see Schedule 4 to the Land Registration Rules 2003) is required, we will enter a restriction in Form A by default. If the lease is granted on or after 19 June 2006 and contains the prescribed clauses, a declaration of trust is contained in clause LR14. For further information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/private-trusts-of-land">practice guide 24: private trusts of land</a>.</p>

<p>Any restrictions, other than a Form A restriction, must be applied for in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enter-a-restriction-registration-rx1">form RX1</a> – rule 92 of the Land Registration Rules 2003.

A restriction cannot be applied for in a lease however, from 9 January 2006, a lease containing clauses LR1 to LR14 of Schedule 1A, to the Land Registration Rules 2003 may be used, at clause LR13, to apply for entry of a standard form restriction. This will include prescribed clauses leases granted on or after 19 June 2006. An application for a non-standard restriction must always be made in form RX1.

<p>A leasehold register will include sufficient details of the lease being registered to enable it to be identified – see rule 6 of the Land Registration Rules 2003. Such details will no longer include any reference to the rent payable under a lease.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>New leases out of a registered title</h3>

<p>These applications must be lodged in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> – rule 13 of the Land Registration Rules 2003.</p>

<p>A certified copy of the lease and the appropriate fee under the current Land Registration <abbr title="The current version of the Land Registration Fee Order">Fee Order</abbr> must accompany the application (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-registration-services-fees">HM Land Registry: Registration Services fees</a>).</p>

<p>The lease, if granted on or after 19 June 2006, must be a prescribed clauses lease. For further information, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prescribed-clauses-leases">practice guide 64: prescribed clauses leases</a>.</p>

<p>The lease must be accompanied by evidence that SDLT or LTT requirements have been met.</p>

<p>If there is a mortgage registered on the landlord’s title you will need to enclose the consent of the mortgagee.  Consent is always required where there is also a restriction in favour of the lender on the landlord’s title which ‘catches’ the lease application. Otherwise where the consent is not lodged, we will make the following entry in the property register of the new title:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The title to the lease is, during the subsistence of the charge dated ….. in favour of ….. affecting the landlord’s title (and to the extent permitted by law, any charge replacing or varying this charge or any further charge in respect of all or part of the sum secured by this charge), subject to any rights that may have arisen by reason of the absence of chargee’s consent, unless the lease is authorised by section 99 of the Law of Property Act 1925.”</p>
</div>

<p>If the landlord’s title is leasehold enclose the consent of any superior landlord, if the superior lease requires such consent to be obtained. Where the consent of the superior landlord is not lodged we will make the following entry in the property register of the new title:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The registrar has not seen any consent to the grant of this sub-lease that the superior lease out of which it was granted may have required.”</p>
</div>

<p>A leasehold register will include sufficient details of the lease being registered to enable it to be identified – see rule 6 of the Land Registration Rules 2003. Such details will no longer include any reference to the rent payable under a lease.</p>

<p>If the lease is granted to two or more persons and it either does not contain details, or contains conflicting information, as to whether a Form A restriction (see Schedule 4 to the Land Registration Rules 2003) is required, we will enter a restriction in Form A by default. If the lease is a prescribed clauses lease a declaration of trust is contained in clause LR14. For further information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/private-trusts-of-land">practice guide 24: private trusts of land</a>.</p>

<p>Any restrictions, other than a Form A restriction, must be applied for in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enter-a-restriction-registration-rx1">form RX1</a> – rule 92 of the Land Registration Rules 2003.

A standard restriction cannot be applied for in a lease. However, from 9 January 2006, a lease containing clauses LR1 to LR14 of Schedule 1A to the Land Registration Rules 2003 may be used, at clause LR13, to apply for entry of a standard form restriction. This will include prescribed clauses leases granted on or after 19 June 2006. Form RX1 must continue to be used to apply for entry of a restriction contained in any other lease, or for entry of a non-standard form restriction.

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Noting of leases</h3>

<p>See sections 33, 34 and 35 of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Note: Application to note a lease as an agreed or unilateral notice will not fulfil the registration requirements for legal easements. If the lease contains easements you should apply as directed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/easements">practice guide 62: easements</a> – 4.2 Easements in unregistered leases.</p>

<h4>6.3.1 Agreed notices</h4>

<p>If a lease is not automatically noted under section 38 of the Land Registration Act 2002 or rule 37 of the Land Registration Rules 2003, and is not prevented from being noted (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6-4">Leases that we cannot note</a>), an application may be made for an agreed notice to be entered in the register affected by the interest by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the person entitled to the benefit of the interest</li>
  <li>the registered proprietor of the land in which the notice is to be entered</li>
  <li>a person entitled to be registered as such proprietor, such as the personal representative of a sole registered proprietor</li>
</ul>

<p>Such an application should be accompanied by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence that SDLT or LTT requirements have been met</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Before we can note any land transaction as an agreed or unilateral notice, HM Land Registry is obliged to ensure that the appropriate SDLT or LTT certificate accompanies the application where this is required. This is a statutory requirement under section 79(1) of the Finance Act 2003 and s.65(1) of the Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes (Wales) Act 2017. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-7-1">First registration</a> for details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the application is by a person entitled to be registered as proprietor, sufficient evidence to satisfy us of their interest</li>
  <li>if the application is not made by the registered proprietor or a person entitled to be registered as such proprietor, either the consent of such person, or sufficient evidence to satisfy the registrar as to the validity of the claim</li>
  <li>any appropriate consents of restrictioners</li>
</ul>

<p>For further details see <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/professional/guides/practice-guide-19" rel="external">practice guide 19: notices, restrictions and protection of third party interests</a>.</p>

<h4>6.3.2 Unilateral notices</h4>

<p>It may be possible to make an application for a unilateral notice to be entered on the lessor’s title when an agreed notice cannot be entered. For further details see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notices-restrictions-and-the-protection-of-third-party-interests-in-the-register">practice guide 19: notices, restrictions and protection of third party interests</a>.</p>

<h4>6.3.3 Leases with less than one year to run</h4>

<p>We will not note leases with less than one year to run. This is because, in the registrar’s view, entering notice of such a lease in the register is likely to cause inconvenience to HM Land Registry and our customers as application would have to be made within a year for its removal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Deeds of variation</h3>

<h4>6.4.1 Variation of a registered lease</h4>

<p>If lodging an application to register the variation of a lease when the lessee’s title is registered, it will usually be appropriate to make the application under rule 129 of the Land Registration Rules 2003, and, therefore, the application should be lodged in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> – rule 13 of the Land Registration Rules 2003.</p>

<p>Under rule 129 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 you must provide sufficient evidence to show that the variation has effect at law. You must, therefore, lodge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the deed of variation, and</li>
  <li>consent(s) of any chargee or restrictioner if required, or</li>
  <li>where the lessor’s title is unregistered – evidence of the lessor’s title, and</li>
  <li>any other evidence to show that the variation has effect at law, such as, evidence of change of name of one of the parties if the name is not the same as that shown on the register</li>
</ul>

<p>If we are satisfied that the variation has effect at law we will make an entry relating to the deed in the property register of the lessee’s title. We will also enter a notice in the lessor’s title, without a specific application being made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreed-notice-registration-an1">form AN1</a> in respect of the lessor’s title.</p>

<p>Note: If the chargee’s consent is not lodged when required, the following will be added to the register entry of the relevant titles:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“NOTE: The proprietor of the registered charge dated […] [of the landlord’s/tenant’s title number …] was not a party to the deed nor was evidence of its consent to the deed produced to the registrar.”</p>
</div>

<h4>6.4.2 Variation of an unregistered lease</h4>

<p>If notice of an unregistered lease is entered in a lessor’s title, an application may be made to enter a notice in respect of a variation of the lease. Such an application should usually be made for an agreed notice in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreed-notice-registration-an1">form AN1</a>, if the deed of variation can be provided and the lease is already protected as an agreed notice. However, it may be appropriate in some circumstances to make an application in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-application-to-enter-un1">form UN1</a>, for example if the lease is already protected by way of unilateral notice and the lease or/and the deed of variation cannot be provided. For further details see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notices-restrictions-and-the-protection-of-third-party-interests-in-the-register">practice guide 19: notices, restrictions and  protection of third party interests</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that where an application is being made for an agreed or unilateral notice following a deed of variation, the application can be made in respect of the lessor’s title only. This is because, under section 32(1) of the Land Registration Act 2002, a notice is an entry in the register “in respect of the burden of an interest affecting a registered estate”. The lease is clearly an interest burdening the lessor’s registered estate and so can be the subject of a notice in the lessor’s title; it can be argued that any deed of variation can also be noted as the entry is then “in respect of” this burden. But the lease is not an interest affecting the lessee’s estate: it is their estate. So the lease cannot be the subject of a notice in the lessee’s title; and nor, as a result, can the deed of variation be the subject of such a notice.</p>

<h4>6.4.3 Application to note variation where it is not clear that the variation takes effect at law</h4>

<p>It may be appropriate in some cases to apply for a notice in either:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreed-notice-registration-an1">form AN1</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-application-to-enter-un1">form UN1</a></li>
</ul>

<p>in respect of a deed of variation even when the lease is substantively registered, as sufficient evidence may not be able to be provided to satisfy the registrar that the variation takes effect at law. For further details see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notices-restrictions-and-the-protection-of-third-party-interests-in-the-register">practice guide 19: notices, restrictions and protection of third party interests</a>.</p>

<p>Note: If the deed of variation contains easements, these will not operate at law until entries relating to the burden and benefit of the easement are entered in both registered titles – see section 27(1) and paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 to the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>Please note that where an application is being made for an agreed or unilateral notice following a deed of variation, the application can be made in respect of the lessor’s title only. This is because, under section 32(1) of the Land Registration Act 2002, a notice is an entry in the register “in respect of the burden of an interest affecting a registered estate”. The lease is clearly an interest burdening the lessor’s registered estate and so can be the subject of a notice in the lessor’s title; it can be argued that any deed of variation can also be noted as the entry is then “in respect of” this burden. But the lease is not an interest affecting the lessee’s estate: it is their estate. So the lease cannot be the subject of a notice in the lessee’s title; and nor, as a result, can the deed of variation be the subject of such a notice.</p>

<h4>6.4.4 Variation of term or extent</h4>

<p>Although it is clear in law that the term of a lease cannot be extended by deed, deeds of variation are frequently encountered that purport to either</p>

<ul>
  <li>extend the length of a lease</li>
  <li>increase the land demised</li>
</ul>

<p>You should avoid using a deed of variation in such circumstances.</p>

<p>However, if these deeds are lodged for registration, we will treat them as an immediate surrender of the old lease and the grant of the new lease. A deed varying a lease that takes effect as a surrender and re-grant of the leasehold estate does not have to be a prescribed clauses lease. This exception applies whether or not the original lease was a prescribed clauses lease. For further details see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extension-of-leases">practice guide 28: extension of leases</a>.</p>

<p>For guidance on how to correct the extent demised by the lease or the length of the term, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/amending-deeds-that-effect-dispositions-of-registered-land">practice guide 68: amending deeds that effect dispositions of registered land</a> – section 4.4 Leases: Incorrect extent to term demised.</p>
