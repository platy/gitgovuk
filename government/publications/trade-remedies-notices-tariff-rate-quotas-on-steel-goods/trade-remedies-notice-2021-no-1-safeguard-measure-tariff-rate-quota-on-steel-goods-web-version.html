<p>** The number in square brackets indicates the corresponding category of steel products in Taxation Notice 2020/06: Safeguard measures on certain steel products – application of tariff rate quotas, which had effect from 11 p.m. on 31 December 2020 to 30 June 2021.</p>

<h3>Duty amount</h3>

<p>The additional amount of duty (“safeguard duty”) applicable to steel goods imported outside of the quota is 25% ad valorem.</p>

<p>The safeguard duty is applicable to the net free-at-the-frontier price of the good (before any other amount of import duty).</p>

<h3>Duration</h3>

<p>The tariff-rate quota set out in this notice has effect from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2024.</p>

<p>The tariff-rate quota is an extension of the tariff-rate quota imposed by the European Union on behalf of the United Kingdom and other countries or territories that had effect in the United Kingdom from 19 July 2018 to 30 June 2021<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Quota amount and allocation</h3>

<p>The quota is divided into 12 Quarters over 3 years and specifies for each goods category the amount of steel goods that may be imported free of safeguard duty in any given Quarter.</p>

<h4>Right to access quota</h4>

<p>The right to access the quota is granted by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to importers in the United Kingdom on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

<p>Importers are asked to cite the relevant order number set out in the Annex when applying to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to access a particular quota.</p>

<h4>Limited access to unused quota in next Quarter of same year</h4>

<p>Any unused quota allocated for steel goods originating in a country or territory remains available in the next Quarter for steels goods originating in that country or territory. Any unused balance may cumulate within the same year but any quota remaining at the end of each year is not available in the next year.</p>

<h4>Open access to unused quota in Quarter 4 of each year</h4>

<p>Importers of steel goods originating in a country or territory with an exhausted quota allocation for the year may, only in Quarter 4 of that year, apply for the right to use any remaining quota allocated for steel goods originating in all other countries or territories.</p>

<h3>Quota amount and allocation for year 4</h3>

<p>1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022, in tonnes (t), allocated quarterly:</p>

<h2>Transition review TF0006 – Safeguard measure on certain steel products</h2>

<h3>Summary of the review</h3>

<p>In accordance with regulation 49(4) of the Trade Remedies (Increase in Imports Causing Serious Injury to UK Producers) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“the Regulations”)  the Trade Remedies Authority (“the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr>”) has conducted a transition review and considered whether goods belonging to each specified category of steel products were, during the same investigation period considered by the European Commission in connection with the EU tariff rate quotas, imported into the United Kingdom in increased quantities. Where the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> determined that goods were imported in increased quantities, and where those increases were considered significant in accordance with regulation 5, a further consideration in accordance with regulation 49(4)(a)-(d) of the Regulations was made on whether;</p>

<ul>
  <li>the importation of those goods in increased quantities would be likely to recur if they were no longer subject to a tariff rate quota</li>
  <li>there would be serious injury to United Kingdom producers of the like goods and directly competitive goods if goods belonging to that category were no longer subject to a tariff rate quota</li>
  <li>the continuation of a tariff rate quota is necessary to facilitate the adjustment of the United Kingdom producers of the like goods and directly competitive goods to the importation of goods belonging to that category; and</li>
  <li>whether alternative tariff rate quotas or the application of a safeguarding amount to goods belonging to that category would better meet the aim of preventing serious injury to the United Kingdom producers of the like goods and directly competitive goods</li>
</ul>

<p>In accordance with regulation 49(5) of the Regulations, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> review further considered whether it is appropriate to increase the amount of any of the tariff rate quotas; vary (or provide for) the allocation of any of the tariff rate quotas; reduce the additional amount of import duty; reduce or extend the period for which goods are subject to the tariff rate quotas; vary the pace of liberalisation; and vary (or provide for) the terms on which a part or the whole of any of the tariff rate quotas is allocated or may be utilised.</p>

<p>This review has also considered, in accordance with regulation 50(5) of the Regulations, whether the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> is satisfied that the application of the measure meets the United Kingdom’s economic interest test. This consideration has been made where the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr>’s final determination is that the tariff rate quotas applied to goods should be varied.</p>

<p>The Statement of Intended Preliminary Decision (“the <abbr title="Statement of Intended Preliminary Decision">SIPD</abbr>”) was published on 19 May 2021 and, due to the very tight timeline to which this transition review is subject, was followed by a period of 7 days for the reception of submissions in relation to it. Again, due to the tight timeline, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> was unable to grant extensions for submissions. The determinations of the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> were made following the consideration of comments received during this period, pursuant to regulation 29(2) of the Regulations.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> reviewed 19 product categories, which contained 253 different product codes in total. The total number of product codes in the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr>’s determinations reduced by 17 codes to 236 as a result of a scope change which combined two categories. The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> is recommending that the measure is revoked on 130 product codes and extended on 106 product codes. This represents revocation of all codes in nine product categories and extension of the application of the measure on 10 product categories with two of those categories amended (i.e. some codes are revoked).</p>

<h3>Recommendation of the Trade Remedies Authority</h3>

<p>In accordance with regulation 51 of the Regulations, and as a result of the determinations made pursuant to regulation 50 of the Regulations, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> made the following recommendations to the Secretary of State for International Trade.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> recommended in accordance with regulations 51(1), (3)(c) and (8) of the Regulations that the application of the tariff rate quota be revoked, where goods belonging to a specified category of steel products were either not being produced by United Kingdom producers or not being imported into the United Kingdom in increased quantities during the period of investigation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> also recommended in accordance with regulations 51(1), (3)(c) and (8) of the Regulations that the application of the tariff rate quota be revoked, where goods belonging to a specified category of steel products were not being imported into the United Kingdom in increased quantities deemed to be significant, or are not causing serious injury to the United Kingdom domestic industry, as detailed in the table below.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> recommended in accordance with regulations 51(1), (3)(c), (4) and (8) of the Regulations that the application of the tariff rate quota be revoked, where goods belonging to a specified category of steel products were determined not to meet the Economic Interest Test.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> further recommended in accordance with regulations 51(1), (3)(a), (4), (6), (7) and (8) of the Regulations that the application of the tariff rate quota be varied, where goods belonging to a specified category of steel products were being imported into the United Kingdom in increased quantities deemed significant, as their application met the Economic Interest Test and they continue to be necessary to facilitate adjustment of United Kingdom producers to the importation of those goods and there is evidence that United Kingdom producers are adjusting to the importation of those goods. The variation of the measure was recommended to be on the following terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods belonging to each of these categories of steel products are subject to a tariff rate quota and an out-of-quota safeguarding duty of 25%</li>
  <li>the measure is extended for a period of three years</li>
  <li>the liberalisation rate for the measure is set at 3% for each year that the measure is in place, thereby ensuring that the pace of liberalisation is maintained; and</li>
  <li>goods originating from developing countries members of the WTO that are low volume exporters as defined in regulation 46(6)-(7) of the Regulations are excepted from the application of the tariff rate quotas pursuant to regulation 43 of the Regulations, and some FTA partners are excluded from the scope of this transition review pursuant to regulation 44 of the Regulations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reasons for the recommendation</h3>

<p>In the injury analysis conducted by the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> as part of the transition review, a significant increase in imports was found for all product categories apart from product categories 6 and 28. The likelihood of a reoccurrence of imports in increased quantities was found for all product categories if the safeguard measure was revoked. For the assessment on the likelihood of recurrence of serious injury, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found that there is a likelihood that serious injury would recur if the safeguard measure was revoked for all product categories, except 7. Therefore, product categories 6, 7 and 28 were removed from the recommended measure and were not assessed in the economic interest test.</p>

<p>In the significance assessment, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found that the scrap metal industry, coal industry and importers of steel products are relatively small in terms of both numbers of employees and Gross Value Added (<abbr title="Gross Value Added">GVA</abbr>). The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> also found that the United Kingdom steel sector is economically significant with higher employment figures in comparison to the upstream industry and importers. Due to the prevalence of steel as an input, the downstream industries are an order of magnitude bigger than the steel industry by all metrics.</p>

<p>From assessing the impacts of the proposed extended safeguard measure, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found that the measure would significantly benefit the United Kingdom steel and scrap metal industries. The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found that importers of steel into the United Kingdom could incur some costs. The size of these costs would depend on the extent to which imports exceed the quota amounts with the extension of the safeguard measure. While the impact on individual downstream businesses and consumers is expected to be fairly small, owing to the large numbers affected, total costs for downstream sectors and consumers may be significant overall but risks to employment as considered low. There is evidence to suggest that price increases might be greater for products like railway material, stainless wire rod and organic coated sheets than others. Additional evidence following the publication of the <abbr title="Statement of Intended Preliminary Decision">SIPD</abbr>, raised concerns about the impact of the measure on category 15, due to the impact on the downstream industry.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found no evidence of major geographic effects for upstream industries because the significance of steel to the coal sector is fairly small, and because there was a lack of data for the scrap metal industry. For the United Kingdom steel industry, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found evidence that there could be significant benefits of extending the safeguard measure in certain deprived areas such as Port Talbot, due to the presence of the steel industry as a major employer and the threats to employment in the industry if the measure was revoked. The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> does not consider it likely that there would be any significant geographic impacts for importers due to low employee numbers. The downstream industries are concentrated in a variety of areas, however due to the low impact on individual companies, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> does not expect there to be significant regional impacts. There is no evidence to suggest any particular groups will be impacted.</p>

<p>The analysis of the competitive environment highlights variation in market shares across the product categories. On consequences for the competitive environment, there are likely to be positive and negative impacts from the proposed extended measure. The quotas are set at a level that maintains traditional trade flows, meaning most imports will be unconstrained and competition would not be affected up to the quota amounts. However, once the quota amounts are reached, the level of competition in the steel market will be inhibited.</p>

<p>On other factors, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> received evidence in response to the <abbr title="Statement of Intended Preliminary Decision">SIPD</abbr> that extending the measure on category 15 would hinder the growth of downstream industries. The only known United Kingdom producer of this category is supportive of the measure being revoked on this category and also has a very high share of known consumption (over 80%) that the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> considers to be relevant under the economic interest test.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for International Trade guidance to the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> on the economic interest test states that there is no starting presumption that a safeguard measure is in the economic interest of the United Kingdom, and that a measure is not in the economic interest of the United Kingdom, if the negative impacts are disproportionate to the positive impacts.</p>

<p>The key positive impacts of extending the measure, as compared to revoking the measure, that the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> has identified as part of the review include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Benefits to the United Kingdom steel industry from removing the likelihood of serious injury, in light of global overcapacity and the risk of trade diversion due to continuation of the measure in other major markets. The steel industry is economically significant with a <abbr title="Gross Value Added">GVA</abbr> of over £2.2 billion and employment of around 33,000, some of which is concentrated in economically deprived areas like Neath Port Talbot and North Lincolnshire.</li>
  <li>Benefits to upstream suppliers of scrap metal that rely on demand from the steel industry and would suffer if there were serious injury to United Kingdom steel producers.</li>
  <li>Some positive impacts on the competitive environment arising from United Kingdom producers being able to remain viable as suppliers to the United Kingdom market, preserving the ability and incentives to compete in the longer term and offering locally sourced steel preferred by some customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, the key negative impacts include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Negative impact on importers, resulting from the application of tariff rate quotas on goods they import, which will likely reduce their ability to compete with United Kingdom producers. The evidence suggests that importers are a lot less economically significant than United Kingdom steel producers with a smaller <abbr title="Gross Value Added">GVA</abbr> and turnover and employing relatively few people both overall and in any particular area.</li>
  <li>Increase in costs to downstream industries from the measure being extended as compared to them being revoked, resulting from the application of a 25% out-of-quota safeguarding tariff on import volumes above the quota amount. However, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found that the impact is likely to be smaller (0-19% across categories) and that steel costs are likely to account for a small proportion (under 1%) of turnover, indicating that even a relatively large change in the price of steel products is unlikely to have a significant impact on average businesses in these groups. Taken together, these downstream industries are more economically significant than United Kingdom producers and the aggregate impact on them may be large.</li>
  <li>Some negative impacts on the competitive environment, particularly on the number or range of suppliers and their ability and incentives to compete beyond the quota amount. The market share of United Kingdom producers varies considerably across product categories.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the large number of countries and regions from which products under all categories are imported into the United Kingdom, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> did not consider that the relatively high market share of United Kingdom producers is likely to create significant negative consequences for the competitive environment.</p>

<p>In the <abbr title="Statement of Intended Preliminary Decision">SIPD</abbr>, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> concluded that extending the measure for subcategory 25B would not be in the economic interest test of the United Kingdom, due to the small market share of United Kingdom producers, the possibility of increased costs to downstream users under strong demand conditions in the future and the lack of a presumption for safeguard measure being in the economic interest of the United Kingdom. Information submitted following the publication of the <abbr title="Statement of Intended Preliminary Decision">SIPD</abbr> by trade body UK Steel confirms that there is additional production of large welded tubes under subcategory 25B, which significantly increases the market share estimates for United Kingdom producers. Assessing this alongside other available evidence, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> therefore considered extending the measure for subcategory 25B to be in the economic interest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>In light of the submission relating to category 15 received following the publication of the <abbr title="Statement of Intended Preliminary Decision">SIPD</abbr>, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> concluded that, on the basis of the evidence available, extending the measures for category 15 would not be in the economic interest test of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>For all product categories other than 15 (1, 2, 4, 5, 13, 19, 20, 21, 25A, 25B and 26), the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> recognised that there are some potentially significant negative impacts as summarised above, but did not consider them to outweigh or be disproportionate to the more significant positive impacts. The main reasons for this were that the available evidence showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extending the measure would prevent the likelihood of serious injury to the economically significant steel sector facing a challenging global market;</li>
  <li>that injury could include potential adverse impacts on jobs in the steel sector resulting from the measure being revoked, which would be concentrated in economically deprived areas of the United Kingdom; and</li>
  <li>the ability to import within the quota amount without needing to pay the 25% out-of-quota safeguarding amount would limit the increased costs faced by downstream users and importers, and help maintain historical trade flows of steel products.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having considered all of the evidence presented by interested parties, including submissions following publication of the <abbr title="Statement of Intended Preliminary Decision">SIPD</abbr>, and all of the factors listed in the legislation, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> has concluded that the economic interest test is met for product categories 1, 2, 4, 5, 13, 19, 20, 21, 25A, 25B and 26, but not for product category 15. It is therefore recommended that this category is removed from the coverage of the extended steel safeguard measure.</p>
