<p>30 June 2022 with effect from 1 July 2022</p>
</div>

<p>This public notice is published by the Secretary of State under regulation 15(1)(b) of the Trade Remedies (Review and Reconsideration of Transitioned Trade Remedies) Regulations 2022 (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/449/contents" rel="external">S.I. 2022/113</a>) (“the Regulations”). It gives effect to a decision of the Secretary of State under regulation 12 of the Regulations to vary the tariff rate quota that is applicable to the goods described below.</p>

<p>The application of the steel safeguard measure will be temporarily suspended for 2 years (from 1 July 2022 until 30 June 2024) with respect to goods originating in Ukraine.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Summary of the investigation conducted in relation to the matters under reconsideration</h2>

<p>The Trade Remedies Authority (<abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr>) accepted eight applications for reconsideration, the grounds of which set the scope for ongoing analysis. In addition to these, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> received 22 non-application submissions and two further responses from Interested Parties which were all taken into consideration. The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> initiated its reconsideration on 7 September 2021.</p>

<p>On 22 March 2022, the Secretary of State informed the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> that under Regulation 3(b) of the Call-in Regulations, she intended to take a decision as to whether to vary, maintain or revoke the tariff rate quotas applicable to goods that were the subject of the reconsideration.</p>

<p>In the transition review the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> considered 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017 as the period of investigation (<abbr title="period of investigation">POI</abbr>), 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2020 as the most recent period (<abbr title="most recent period">MRP</abbr>), and 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019 as the last three representative years for assessing traditional trade flows. The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> gathered information about these periods during the transition review to inform assessments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Increase in imports and significance</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found that the aggregated UK import data for group 1 (flat products) and group 3 (pipes/tubes) showed a sudden, recent, sharp, and significant absolute and relative increase.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found that the aggregated UK import data for group 2 (long products) did not show a sudden, recent, sharp, and significant absolute increase or relative increase.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Likelihood of increase in imports</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found that the evidence for the global steel market suggested it was highly likely there would be an oversupply in the international market for the steel products under review for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>An industry level analysis considering capacity, import trends, actions of other authorities, and attractiveness of UK market indicated a significant likelihood that imports would increase across all categories if the measure were revoked.</p>

<p>A group level analysis considering import trends found it likely that imports would significantly increase for all groups if safeguard measures were revoked.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Serious injury or threat of serious injury to UK producers</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> assessed several indicators to identify impairment to the position of UK industry, however caused, and reported where it believed that, based on findings against one or more indicators, there was evidence that provided an indication of, or would be consistent with serious injury.</p>

<p>At an industry level, each assessment found an indication of serious injury except for the indicator ‘productivity’ and ‘market share’ where no indication of serious injury was found.</p>

<p>At an industry level other potential factors were assessed to establish whether they could also be a cause of serious injury. The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> considered COVID-19, the UK’s departure from the EU, and cost of production and found it was not clear that any of these caused the serious injury previously experienced, nor was there any reason to believe that any of these factors (or all combined) were significant enough to foreseeably break a link between import pressure and serious injury.</p>

<p>At an aggregated group level, assessments were undertaken to identify any indications of serious injury. For group 1 an indication of serious injury was found in all assessments except productivity and price effects where no indication of serious injury was found. For group 2 an indication of serious injury was found in all assessments except increase in imports, market share, sales volume, and capacity utilisation where no indication of serious injury was found. For group 3 an indication of serious injury was found in all assessments except sales volume, production volume, productivity, and capacity utilisation where no indication of serious injury was found.</p>

<p>As a result of the above assessments at industry and group level the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found that there were indications of serious injury to UK producers for all three steel product category groups.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Summary of the Secretary of State for International Trade’s conclusions</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State has taken into account the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr>’s findings in sections 2.1 to 2.4 of the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr>’s Report of Findings and concluded that the maintenance of TRQs is necessary to remedy serious injury. The Secretary of State also recognised that adjustments are required to certain <abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr>’s to better reflect trade flows.</p>

<p>In its Report of Findings, the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> identified indications of serious injury. The Secretary of State has taken into account the Report of Findings and concluded that removal of the steel safeguard measure would likely result in an increase in imports and therefore would result in serious injury or the threat of serious injury to UK steel producers.</p>

<p>There is evidence in the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr>’s Report of Findings that removal of the measure would likely result in an increase in imports of steel products due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>global steel overcapacity – there would be an oversupply in the international market for steel products under review for the foreseeable future (section 2.2).</li>
  <li>import trends – The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> found an ongoing high rate of import volume during the most recent period, including during the introduction of the EU safeguard measure in 2018 and the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. The <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> also found an increase in import volume during the period of investigation and most recent period, relative to domestic production of multiple product categories in each group (section 2.2).</li>
  <li>actions of other authorities – US steel tariffs imposed in 2018 caused a knock-on effect resulting in numerous other countries introducing trade remedy measures to protect against the diversion of steel products. Were the UK to remove its safeguard, the evidence indicates that the UK would face an increase in diverted steel product imports (section 2.2).</li>
  <li>attractive UK market – actions taken by other authorities reduced their attractiveness and consequently increased the attractiveness of the UK as an export destination for steel products. Not only this, but equivalent countries such as Japan and South Korea experienced import penetration levels than the UK despite the implementation of the EU’s safeguard measure, indicating the UK is a comparatively attractive market (section 2.2).</li>
</ul>

<p>When investigated at an aggregate level (both at the industry level and at the group level) the Secretary of State concluded that UK steel producers were suffering threat of serious injury or threat of serious injury and that this would be likely to increase should the safeguard measure be removed. The Secretary of State has taken into account the assessments made throughout section 2.3 of the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> Report of Findings that, at industry and group level, there were indications of serious injury to UK producers for all three steel product category groups.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Summary of the Secretary of State for International Trade’s decision</h2>

<p>The steel safeguard measure will be extended for a further 2 years (from 1 July 2022 until 30 June 2024) with effect on the following 5 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>6 – Tin mill products</li>
  <li>7 – Non-alloy and other alloy quarto plates</li>
  <li>12 – Merchant bars and light sections (split into categories 12a (Alloy merchant bars and light sections), and 12b (non-alloy merchant bars and light sections))</li>
  <li>16 – Non-alloy and other alloy wire rod</li>
  <li>17 – Angles, shapes, and sections of iron or non-alloy steel</li>
</ul>

<p>In reaching this decision, the Secretary of State for International Trade had regard to the public interest and the advice provided by the <abbr title="Trade Remedies Authority">TRA</abbr> on the economic interest.</p>
