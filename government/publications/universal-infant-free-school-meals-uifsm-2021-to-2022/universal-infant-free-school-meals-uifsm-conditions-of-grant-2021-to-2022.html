<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>We will pay the universal infant free school meals (UIFSM) grant 2021 to 2022 under Section 14 of the Education Act 2002. Under section 16 of that act, the Secretary of State lays down the following terms and conditions on which we give assistance in relation to the UIFSM grant payable to schools and local authorities for the financial year beginning 1 April 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Funding rates and allocations</h2>

<p>Each meal taken by an eligible pupil attracts £2.34. An allocation assumes that pupils will take 190 school meals over an academic year, providing £444.60 per eligible pupil, as counted below.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>There is an additional payment this year as the per meal rate has been increased to £2.41 beginning on 1 April 2022. This additional allocation covers the period from April 2022 to August 2022. Each meal taken in this period attracts £2.41.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Provisional allocation</h3>

<p>For the academic year 2021 to 2022, we will base a provisional allocation to schools on the eligible pupil numbers used for the final allocation for academic year 2020 to 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Final allocation</h3>

<p>We calculate a final allocation for academic year 2021 to 2022 in June 2022 using the number of pupils recorded as taking a meal in year 1 and year 2 in the October 2021, and January 2022, school censuses. We then subtract those pupils known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) in the same censuses who are taking a meal.</p>

<p>This figure is then divided by 2 to give the average number of eligible UIFSM pupils in years 1 and 2.</p>

<p>The number of reception pupils used will be the greater of <strong>either:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of pupils recorded as taking a meal in the October 2021 and January 2022 school censuses, minus those pupils taking a meal known to be eligible for FSM in the same censuses, divided by 2 (this gives the average number of eligible UIFSM pupils in reception for academic year 2021 to 2022) or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the number of pupils recorded as taking a meal in January 2022 school censuses, minus those pupils taking a meal known to be eligible for FSM in the same census.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will count dual registered pupils where they took their meal on the census days, even if it is their subsidiary setting.</p>

<p>Where a school does not record pupils in year groups, we will use those aged 4, 5, or 6, on the relevant school censuses to calculate the allocations. We include pupils on the alternative provision census placed in independent schools in the provisional and final allocations to local authorities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> 3  Additional allocation backdated to 1 April 2022 (updated June 2022)</h3>

<p>The total eligible meal count for each school, including reception and year 1 and year 2 pupils, as calculated above, will be multiplied by £0.07, the difference between £2.34 per meal and £2.41 per meal, and by 190 days and then pro-rated by five-twelfths to cover the period April 2022 to August 2022.</p>

<p>This additional funding will be rounded up to the next pound.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>  Allocations to schools</h2>

<p>The Education and Skills Funding Agency (EFSA) pays the UIFSM grant directly to academies and free schools open on or before 1 May  2021. Local authorities must allocate the amounts set out in the attached schedule of allocations to each maintained school, and any that convert to academy status after 1 May 2021; they cannot hold the grant centrally.</p>

<p>A school may agree to use their UIFSM grant allocation to contribute to central local authority provision, but local authorities must allocate the grant to each school to enable them to make that decision.</p>

<p>We allocate the grant to schools federated, or to be federated, under the provisions of Section 24 of the Education Act 2002, during the financial year beginning 1 April 2021 as if they were not federated.</p>

<p>In the case of a school which closes before 1 September 2021, the local authority should not allocate the grant to the school. In the case of a school which closes between 1 September 2021 and 31 August 2022, the local authority will allocate the grant for the proportion of that period that the school is open.</p>

<p>A school which opens between 1 September 2021 and 31 August 2022, and receives all the pupils from 2, or more, schools which have closed, will receive a grant equal to the total which would be payable to the schools had they remained open. The grant will be proportionate to the period of 1 September 2021 to 31 March 2022, for which the school is open.</p>

<p>Where a school has pupils transferred from a closing school during the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022, the local authority should allocate the grant that would have been paid to the closing school, had it remained open, to the school receiving those pupils; the school should agree the amount allocated.</p>

<p>The grant is payable irrespective of the existence of any deficit relating to the expenditure of the school’s budget share. UIFSM grant is not part of schools’ budget shares and is not part of the individual school’s budget. It is not included in the minimum funding guarantee calculations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Terms on which UIFSM grant is allocated to schools</h2>

<p>The grant supports schools in delivering the legal requirement to offer free school meals, meeting the school food standards, to all their reception, year 1 and year 2 pupils. Subject to meeting this legal duty, schools may spend the grant for the purposes of the school; that is to say for the educational benefit of pupils registered at that school, or for the benefit of pupils registered at other schools.</p>

<p>They may also spend it on community facilities, for example services whose provision furthers any charitable purpose for the benefit of pupils at the school or their families, or people who live or work in the school’s locality.</p>

<p>Schools do not have to spend the entire grant in the financial year beginning 1 April 2021; they may carry forward some or all of the grant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>  Alternative provision pupils</h2>

<p>We will allocate UIFSM grant to local authorities for each pupil recorded as aged 4, 5, and 6, on the January 2021 census, who is not recorded as eligible for a free school meal, and where the local authority placed the pupil in an independent school.</p>

<p>The local authority should spend the amount allocated for such pupils by the end of the academic year 2021 to 2022. They can only spend it on providing a free school meal to pupils not recorded as eligible for a free school meal, and aged 4, 5, and 6.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Payment arrangements</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State will pay the grant to local authorities as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Month</th>
      <th scope="col">Proportion of grant</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>June 2021</td>
      <td>Seven twelfths of each school’s provisional allocation. Schools that were academies on 1 June 2021 will receive their UIFSM grant direct from EFSA in July 2021.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>June 2022</td>
      <td>The final allocation for each maintained school as at 1 June 2022, minus the amount of the allocation paid in June 2021. Any school that converts to academy status after 1 June 2021, and by 1 May 2022, will receive the rest of its allocation direct from EFSA in July 2022.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Non-converter academies and free schools, which open after 1 April 2021, and by 31 August 2022, will receive their grant direct from EFSA.</p>

<p>Where a school’s final allocation is less than the provisional payment made in June 2021, we will deduct the difference from grant payment in June 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Certification</h2>
<p>Local authorities must certify that they have passed on the correct amount of funding to schools or, where they have spent funding centrally, that they have spent it in line with the conditions of grant. We have issued a certification form in April 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Variation</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State may vary the basis for the allocation from those set out above, if the school or local authority requests it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Overpayments</h2>

<p>Any overpayment of grant must be repaid to the Secretary of State.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Further information</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State, and the Comptroller and Auditor General, may inspect the books, records and other documents that relate the recipient’s accounts. Under Section 6 of the National Audit Act 1983, the Comptroller and Auditor General may examine whether the authority or school spent the premium in an efficient and cost-effective way.</p>

<p>The recipient should provide any information the Secretary of State requires in order determine whether the authority or school has complied with the conditions in this document.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Other conditions</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State may require the repayment of the whole or any part of the grant if the authority or school fails to follow the conditions in this guidance.</p>
