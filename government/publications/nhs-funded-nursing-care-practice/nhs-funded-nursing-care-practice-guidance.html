<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>1. The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care practice guidance sets out the principles and processes of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care. It should be read alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">National framework for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, July 2022 (revised)</a> (referred to as âthe national frameworkâ).</p>

<p>2. This 2022 guidance replaces the previous version of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care practice guidance, October 2018 (revised), and will be implemented from 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>3. At the heart of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care practice guidance is the process for determining whether an individual is eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.</p>

<p>4. <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care is the funding provided by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> to care homes with nursing to support the provision of nursing care by a registered nurse for those assessed as eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.</p>

<p>5. Prior to any decision on eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, a decision on eligibility for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare</a> must be made and recorded.</p>

<p>6. Both the national framework and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care practice guidance are underpinned by standing rules regulations, issued under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/41/body" rel="external">National Health Service Act 2006</a>. These regulations, referred to henceforth as âthe standing rulesâ, require integrated care boards (<abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>) to have regard to the national framework.</p>

<p>7. Since 2007, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care has been based on a single-band rate, set out in the standing rules and amended each financial year by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>).</p>

<p>8. The revised <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> funded nursing care practice guidance and national framework take into account legislative changes brought about by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/31/contents/enacted" rel="external">Health and Care Act 2022</a>, which establishes <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> as the statutory bodies with responsibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. The revised <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care practice guidance and national framework also reflect the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted" rel="external">Care Act 2014</a>, which preserves the existing boundary and limits of local authority responsibility in relation to the provision of nursing and/or healthcare.</p>

<p>10. The process of determining eligibility, and planning and delivering services for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care should be âperson-centredâ. The individualâs views and/or those of their representative should be sought and considered throughout the process, and appropriate care and support provided to meet the assessed needs as defined in the care plan.</p>

<p>Access to an assessment, care provision and support should be fair, consistent and free from discrimination.</p>

<p>11. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>, the National Health Service Commissioning Board (referred to throughout this guidance as <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England) and local authorities have legal duties and responsibilities in relation to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.</p>

<p>12. Those eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care continue to be entitled to access the full range of primary, community, secondary and other health services.</p>

<p>13. There are special circumstances where an individual can qualify for an urgent nursing care payment to meet an urgent or temporary need for registered nursing care in a care home with nursing (see paragraphs 29 to 32 below).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Key definitions</h3>

<h4>NHS continuing healthcare</h4>

<p>NHS continuing healthcare means a package of ongoing care that is arranged and funded solely by the National Health Service (NHS) where the individual has been assessed and found to have a âprimary health needâ as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">national framework</a>.</p>

<p>Such care is provided to an individual aged 18 or over to meet health and associated social care needs that have arisen as a result of disability, accident or illness. The actual services provided as part of the package should be seen in the wider context of best practice and service development for each client group.</p>

<p>Eligibility for NHS Continuing Healthcare is not determined by the setting in which the package of support can be offered or by the type of service delivery.</p>

<h4>NHS-funded nursing care</h4>

<p>NHS-funded nursing care is the funding provided by the NHS to care homes with nursing to support the provision of nursing care by a registered nurse.</p>

<p>Since 2007, NHS-funded nursing care has been based on a single band rate.</p>

<p>In all cases, individuals should be considered for eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare before a decision is reached about the need for NHS-funded nursing care.</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>14. This practice guidance replaces the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care practice guidance, October 2018 (revised). It includes information and links to other guidance and sets out the process for the consideration of eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care from 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>This guidance should be read alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">National framework for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, July 2022 (revised)</a>.</p>

<p>There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care-public-information-leaflet">public information leaflet that sets out information on <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care for individuals and their families</a>.</p>

<h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>

<p>15. <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England, <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and local authorities must comply with their responsibilities, as set out in the national framework, standing rules and Care Act 2014, as appropriate, in relation to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.</p>

<p>16. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> are responsible and accountable for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.</p>

<p>17. <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care can only be delivered successfully through a partnership approach at both organisational and practitioner levels between <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England, <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>, local authorities, local <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> bodies and provider organisations. Its delivery should be integrated within local systems.</p>

<p>18. In some limited circumstances, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England may also have commissioning responsibility for some individuals who are either prisoners, or serving military personnel and their families.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England does have such responsibility, both the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care practice guidance and national framework for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care will apply.</p>

<p>Throughout the national framework, where reference is made to an <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>, the relevant responsibilities will also apply to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England in these limited circumstances.</p>

<h2>Core values and principles</h2>

<p>19. Individuals being assessed for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care are frequently facing significant changes in their life and therefore a positive experience of the assessment process is crucial. The process of assessment of eligibility and decision-making should be person-centred. This means placing the individual at the centre of the assessment and care planning process. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">national framework</a> describes the person-centred approach in more detail.</p>

<p>20. Access to assessment, decision-making and provision should be fair and consistent. There should be no discrimination on the grounds of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>race</li>
  <li>disability</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
  <li>marital status</li>
  <li>gender reassignment</li>
  <li>religion or belief</li>
  <li>type of health need (for example, whether the need is physical, mental or psychological)</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and partner organisations are responsible for ensuring that discrimination does not occur and should use effective auditing to monitor this.</p>

<p>21. Assessments of eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care should be organised so that the individual being assessed and their representative understand the process, and receive advice and information that will maximise their ability to participate in the process in an informed way.</p>

<p>Decisions and rationales that relate to eligibility should be transparent from the outset for individuals, carers, family and staff alike (refer to paragraphs 68 to 72 and 146 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">national framework</a>).</p>

<h2>What <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care is</h2>

<p>22. <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care is the funding provided by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> to care homes with nursing to support the provision of nursing care by a registered nurse for those assessed as eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.</p>

<p>23. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/section/22/enacted" rel="external">Section 22 of the Care Act 2014</a> prohibits local authorities from providing, or arranging for the provision of, nursing care by a registered nurse, save in the very limited circumstances set out in Section 22 (4).</p>

<p>Local authorities may arrange for the provision of accommodation together with the provision of nursing care by a registered nurse if either of the following criteria are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authority has obtained consent for it to arrange for the provision of the nursing care from whichever <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> regulations require</li>
  <li>the case is urgent and the arrangements for accommodation are only temporary</li>
</ul>

<p>24. If an individual is not eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare, the need for care from a registered nurse may need to be determined. An individual is eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care if the following criteria are both met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the individual has such a need</li>
  <li>it is determined that the individualâs overall needs would be most appropriately met in a care home with nursing.</li>
</ul>

<p>25. The registered nurse input is defined in the following terms (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2016-0054.html" rel="external">R (on the application of Forge Care Homes Ltd and others) v Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and others</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Services provided by a registered nurse and involving either the provision of care or the planning, supervision or delegation of the provision of care, other than any services which, having regard to their nature and the circumstances in which they are provided, do not need to be provided by a registered nurse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>26. âNursing care by a registered nurseâ covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>time spent on nursing care, in the sense of care which can only be provided by a registered nurse, including both direct and indirect nursing time</li>
  <li>paid breaks</li>
  <li>time receiving supervision</li>
  <li>stand-by time</li>
  <li>time spent on providing, planning, supervising or delegating the provision of other types of care, which in all the circumstances ought to be provided by a registered nurse because they are ancillary to or closely connected with, or part and parcel of the nursing care which the nurse has to provide</li>
</ul>

<p>27. Where an individual may have a nursing need, a nursing needs assessment â which specifies the day-to-day care and support needs of the individual â should be used to assess whether an individual is eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.</p>

<p>28. Consideration of eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care is not an alternative to discussions between providers and commissioners about the appropriate level of fees payable to care homes for accommodation and other non-nursing services. These discussions will take place locally, taking account of local circumstances.</p>

<h3>Short periods in residential care, including in emergencies, for respite care and for trial periods</h3>

<p>29. There may be occasions when, using locally agreed procedures, individuals need to go into a care home with nursing for short periods of time such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in an emergency or crisis â for example, where a carer is suddenly taken ill and is unable to look after the individual</li>
  <li>when those placed in a care home with nursing are awaiting the completion of an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> funded nursing care determination of care by a registered nurse</li>
  <li>for a trial period â to explore whether they would prefer to move into a care home on a permanent basis (this would not apply to permanent residents of care homes who wanted to find another home)</li>
  <li>for respite care, recuperative care or a short break</li>
</ul>

<p>30. Such short periods in a care home providing nursing care of less than 6 weeks can qualify for urgent nursing care. There is no need to carry out a nursing assessment if it is known at the outset that the stay will be less than 6 weeks and the individual has already been assessed as requiring nursing care (for example, they are an existing client of the community nursing service). Periods of less than a week can also qualify for urgent nursing care on a pro rata basis.</p>

<p>31. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> that arrange short-term care for their residents out of their area (and in other circumstances where they continue to be the responsible commissioner as set out in the relevant legislation) should pay the care home directly for urgent nursing care. Where they are doing this, they will need to inform the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> where the care home is located to avoid duplicate payments.</p>

<p>32. Someone who chooses to pay privately for nursing care at home may qualify for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care or urgent nursing care for any periods of care in a care home providing nursing care.</p>

<h2>When <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care should be considered</h2>

<p>33. In all cases, individuals should be considered for eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare before a decision is reached about the need for ongoing <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care (<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care provided by registered nurses) in care home accommodation (registered to provide nursing care).</p>

<p>34. In most cases, therefore, the individual will already have been considered for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and will have had an associated assessment, which should provide sufficient information to gauge the need for nursing care in care home accommodation.</p>

<p>35. In certain circumstances, an individual who has been found not to be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-continuing-healthcare-checklist">eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare at the checklist stage</a> may still need an assessment of needs for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care. In such cases, an appropriate assessment should be completed.</p>

<p>36. Consideration of eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare or for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care should be at the right time and location for the individual, and when the individualâs ongoing needs are clearer. The consideration of eligibility should normally take place when the individual is in a community setting.</p>

<p>The core underlying principle is that individuals should be supported to access and follow the process that is most suitable for their current and ongoing needs.</p>

<p>37. While assessment of eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare or for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care can take place in either a hospital or non-hospital setting, in the vast majority of cases, assessments should take place in community settings. There may be rare circumstances where assessments may take place in an acute hospital environment. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For individuals leaving the acute hospital environment, it is best practice to screen for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare at the right time and in the right place for that individual. In the vast majority of cases, this will be following discharge and after a period of recovery in a familiar setting, or intermediate or rehabilitation placement.</p>

<p>It should always be borne in mind that a screening or assessment of eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare or <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care that takes place in an acute hospital setting is unlikely to accurately reflect an individualâs longer-term needs. This could be because, with appropriate support and opportunity, the individual has the potential to recover further in the near future. Another reason is that it may be difficult to make an accurate assessment of an individualâs needs while they are in an acute services environment.</p>

<p>38. In order to address this issue and ensure that unnecessary stays on acute wards are avoided, there should be consideration of whether the provision of further <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded services is appropriate. This might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>therapy and/or rehabilitation, if that could make a difference to the potential of the individual in the following few weeks or months</li>
  <li>intermediate care or an interim package of support</li>
</ul>

<p>In such situations, assessment of eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare or <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, if still required, should be undertaken when an accurate assessment of ongoing needs can be made.</p>

<p>The interim services should continue until it has been decided whether or not the individual has a need for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare or <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care There must be no gap in the provision of appropriate support to meet the individualâs needs.</p>

<p>It is important that there are clear local protocols setting out where responsibility for meeting an individualâs needs lies, including who is responsible for funding their care and support.</p>

<p>39. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> should commission services that meet the needs of the local population using models that maximise personalisation and individual control, and that reflect the individualâs preferences, as far as practicable.</p>

<p>Alternative ways of providing care and support, other than admission to a care home with nursing, should always be considered as part of the care planning process.</p>

<p>It is important that assessors are aware of local care service provision so that they can advise the individual of care options to meet assessed needs during the care-planning process.</p>

<p>40. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> should work closely with their local partners and develop agreed protocols so that they can refer individuals via the appropriate local process to arrange for an assessment of needs for health and social care to be undertaken. This is particularly important for self-funders.</p>

<p>Local authorities and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> bodies should consider how collaborative arrangements between agencies can ensure that individuals accessing care home provision receive appropriate and timely assessment and care â including continuity of care, should funding arrangements need to change.</p>

<p>41. Where an individual is receiving services under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/20/section/117" rel="external">Section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983</a>, they will nonetheless be eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care as a universal service, discrete from any Section 117 provision, if they meet the relevant criteria.</p>

<h2>Consent and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care</h2>

<p>42. There are a number of principles that underpin the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care process: most importantly that assessments and reviews should always focus on the individualâs needs and follow a person-centred approach. The individual should be fully informed and empowered to participate actively in the assessment process, and any subsequent reviews, and their views should be considered.</p>

<p>In addition, there are a number of legal requirements when it comes to an individualâs consent for parts of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care process.</p>

<p>43. In the spirit of the person-centred approach, practitioners should make all reasonable efforts to seek the participation of the individual (or their representative) for the assessment and review process for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, during each stage of the process.</p>

<p>For a comprehensive assessment, the best evidence available at the relevant time should be considered. This should involve consideration of the individualâs (or their representativeâs) view, and they should be empowered and assisted to participate.</p>

<p>Throughout the process, this person-centred approach should be embedded in all decisions that relate to the individualâs needs assessment and their care planning.</p>

<p>44. Consent is a legal requirement for any physical intervention on or examination of a person with capacity to give consent. To the extent that an assessment for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare or <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care involves such an intervention or examination, informed consent must be sought from an individual with capacity to give consent. Refer to paragraph 85 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">national framework</a>, which gives detailed guidance on what is required for consent to be valid.</p>

<p>45. It is necessary to obtain an individualâs explicit consent before sharing any personal data with a third party such as a family member, friend, advocate and/or other representative.</p>

<p>46. However, it is not necessary to seek consent from an individual in order to share their personal data as part of their <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare assessment (and subsequent reviews) between health and social care professionals.</p>

<p>47. If there is a concern that the individual may not have capacity to give consent to a physical intervention or examination that is part of the assessment process, or to the sharing of personal data with third parties such as a family member, friend, advocate and/or other representative, this should be determined in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents" rel="external">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a> and the associated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice">code of practice</a>.</p>

<p>It may be necessary for a âbest interestsâ decision to be made, bearing in mind the expectation that everyone who is potentially eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare or <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care should have the opportunity to be considered for eligibility. Guidance on the application of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 in such situations is provided in paragraphs 86 to 96 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">national framework</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>48. The fact that an individual may have significant difficulties in expressing their views does not of itself mean that they lack capacity to make a decision. Appropriate support and adjustments should be made available in compliance with the Mental Capacity Act and with equalities legislation.</p>

<p>49. Robust data-sharing protocols â both within an organisation and between organisations â will help to ensure that confidentiality is respected, but that all necessary information is available to complete the necessary assessments.</p>

<p>The duty to share information (for the purposes of providing an individual with health or adult social care) as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/section/251B/2018-05-25" rel="external">Section 251B of the Health and Social Care Act 2012</a> applies equally to assessments for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare as it does to other health and/or care and support assessments.</p>

<h2>Who assesses the need for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care</h2>

<p>50. An assessment by a registered nurse is required to inform eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, irrespective of the setting in which the individual is currently placed. Consideration of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care must be undertaken by a registered nurse, following a decision that the individual is not eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare.</p>

<p>51. An individual is eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care if they meet both of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they do not qualify for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Continuing Healthcare but have been assessed as requiring the services of a registered nurse</li>
  <li>they are resident in a care home that is registered to provide nursing care</li>
</ul>

<p>52. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>, working in partnership with local authorities, are responsible for eligibility assessments and decisions for both <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care and the commissioning of care to meet the identified needs.</p>

<p>Decisions on <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare will be based on a multidisciplinary assessment of need, preferably involving both <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and local authorities so that an individualâs health and social care needs can be identified and met appropriately by each organisation. The multidisciplinary assessment for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare will often suffice for decisions regarding <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care (if the individual is not eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare).</p>

<p>53. Whether the decision about <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care is made subsequent to a full assessment of eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-continuing-healthcare-decision-support-tool">decision support tool</a> (<abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr>) or following use of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-continuing-healthcare-checklist"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare checklist</a>, a registered nurse should be involved in identifying and documenting the registered nursing needs.</p>

<p>54. The registered nurse who undertakes this role should be familiar with the principles and processes of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care as set out in the national framework.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care rate</h2>

<p>55. Since 2007, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care has been based on a single-band rate, set out in the standing rules and amended each financial year by the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>

<p>56. Individuals who are in receipt of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care are entitled to continue to receive it until one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a) on review, it is determined that they no longer have any need for registered nursing care</li>
  <li>b) they are no longer resident in a care home that provides registered nursing care</li>
  <li>c) they become eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare</li>
  <li>d) they die</li>
</ul>

<p>57. Individuals who were in receipt of the high band of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care under the three-band system that was in force until 30 September 2007 are entitled to continue on the high band rate subject to a) to d) above.</p>

<p>In addition, if, on review, it is determined that their needs have changed, so that under the previous three-band system they would have moved onto the medium or low bands, the individual should be moved onto the single rate.</p>

<p>58. The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care rate is the contribution provided by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> to support the provision of ânursing care by a registered nurseâ, as defined in paragraphs 270 to 275 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">national framework</a>.</p>

<p>This does not include the time spent by non-nursing staff such as care assistants (although it does cover the time spent by the registered nurse in monitoring or supervising care that is delegated to others). Neither does it cover the costs of the wider non-nursing care or accommodation provided for the individual.</p>

<p>59. The care home with nursing provider should set an overall fee level for the provision of care and accommodation, and share this with whoever is contracting the service. This should include any registered nursing care supplied by the provider.</p>

<p>Where an <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> assesses that the residentâs needs require the input of a registered nurse, they will pay the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care payment (at the nationally agreed rate) direct to the care home with nursing to meet that need, unless there is an agreement in place for this to be paid via a third party (such as a local authority). The balance of the fee will then be paid by the individual, their representative or the local authority unless other contracting arrangements have been agreed.</p>

<p>60. Contracts between individuals and/or local authorities with providers should have terms and conditions that are transparent and fair, including setting out what happens if a resident is admitted to hospital or what happens if a resident dies.</p>

<h2>Making a decision about <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care</h2>

<p>61. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> are reminded that a decision about the need for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care should only be made after a decision that the individual is not eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare. However, see the above section âShort periods in residential care, including in emergencies, for respite care and for trial periodsâ in relation to emergency, respite and short-stay placements.</p>

<p>62. The assessment of registered nursing needs should help the individual, their carer and/or representative understand the extent and nature of the nursing care required to meet their care needs, and find the most appropriate environment in which to meet those needs.</p>

<p>63. The decision about whether support should be provided in the form of a care home with nursing should take into account all the individualâs nursing and other needs, based on what is known about the individualâs condition and how this usually presents over a period of time.</p>

<p>Consideration should be given to the potential outcomes if support were not to be provided, or was provided in different ways. In making their evaluation, the registered nurse should also focus on the individualâs preferences, the impact of any decisions on the individualâs independence, and risks involved for the individual, their family and others close to them.</p>

<p>64. A care plan should be developed, clearly setting out how the individualâs identified needs should be met, including the provision of care by a registered nurse. This therefore includes not only direct input from a registered nurse, but also time spent in the planning, supervising and monitoring of care delivered by someone else, who may or may not be a registered nurse.</p>

<p>The care plan should identify the need for care (or supervision of care) by a registered nurse across the same comprehensive care domains as those used in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-continuing-healthcare-decision-support-tool"><abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr></a>. A care plan developed as part of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare assessment of eligibility process may already identify the needs for care from a registered nurse.</p>

<p>65. Using all available evidence and their professional skill and judgement, the registered nurse should record the level and quantity of nursing need, and any specific risk factors against each care domain. A recommendation on the nature of the nursing care needed should be made.</p>

<p>66. If the decision about registered nursing care is being reached subsequent to a full assessment of eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare, there is a space in the <abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr> to record the outcome of that process. In the absence of an existing <abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr> or nursing needs assessment, the assessor may want to use the template in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a">Annex A</a> to summarise the necessary care.</p>

<p>67. Only the needs of the individual should be recorded, and this should not be influenced by the restrictions placed on the delivery of care by the hospital or care home environment.</p>

<p>For example, an individual who is physically and mentally competent to self-medicate will, in a hospital or care home environment, nonetheless have their medication dispensed by a registered nurse in order to comply with registration requirements. In such a situation, the individual concerned would not normally have a need for registered nursing in relation to their medication, unless there was a complexity around administering the medication.</p>

<p>68. The registered nurse involved in this decision should consider the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the individual have registered nursing needs that can be met in their own home by community nursing services?</li>
  <li>Does the individual have registered nursing needs of a type or level where they require a care home providing a nursing care environment?</li>
  <li>Do they want or need to be in a residential setting, or is another option preferred or more appropriate?</li>
  <li>Are there any safeguarding concerns relating to the individual or the proposed care placement that should be considered or addressed in the decision-making process?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Possible outcomes of an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care assessment</h3>

<p>69. The registered nurse, working with the multidisciplinary team (<abbr title="multidisciplinary team">MDT</abbr>) as appropriate, will make a decision that the individual is either eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care or not eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.</p>

<p>70. In either outcome, the individual may potentially receive a joint package of health and social care. This is where an individualâs care or support package is funded by both the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and the local authority.</p>

<h3>What happens next when an individual is eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care</h3>

<p>71. Once it has been agreed with the individual, or a best interests decision has been made that a care home providing nursing offers the best environment in which their needs can be met, the next phase is to set goals within the care plan.</p>

<p>This process should usually be completed before a long-term admission to a care home takes place and should be used to inform the identification of an appropriate care home.</p>

<p>72. Where a local authority is involved, the relevant professionals should be working closely together to identify the care required, which, in turn, will inform the selection of a care home able to meet those needs.</p>

<p>In all cases, unless the person lacks mental capacity and a best interests decision has been made, the individual is responsible for making the choice of care home providing nursing care, supported and advised by the relevant professionals.</p>

<p>Where a local authority is funding some or all of the non-nursing care needs, they will advise on funding or other factors that will need to be taken into account in making this choice, including reference to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2670/contents/made" rel="external">Care and Support and After-care (Choice of Accommodation) Regulations 2014</a>.</p>

<h3>Communicating the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care eligibility decision to the individual</h3>

<p>73. Once an eligibility decision with regard to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care has been made, the individual should be informed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>74. In many situations the decision that the individual is eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care may be communicated at the same time as the decision that they are not eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare. In such cases, the content of the letter to the individual should follow the guidance set out in paragraphs 179 to 181 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">national framework</a>.</p>

<h2>Equipment</h2>

<p>75. Where individuals in a care home require equipment to meet their care needs, there are several routes by which it may be provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a) the care home may be required to provide certain equipment as part of regulatory standards or as part of its contract with the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>. Further details of the regulatory standards can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.cqc.org.uk/" rel="external">Care Quality Commissionâs website</a>
</li>
  <li>b) individuals who are entitled to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care have an entitlement â on the same basis as other people â to joint equipment services. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and local authorities should ensure that the availability to those in receipt of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care is taken into account in the planning, commissioning and funding arrangements for these services</li>
  <li>c) some individuals will require bespoke equipment (or non-bespoke equipment that is not available through routes a and b above) to meet specific assessed needs identified in their care plan. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and, where relevant, local authorities should make appropriate arrangements to meet these needs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Entitlement to other services</h2>

<p>76. Those in receipt of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care continue to be entitled to access to the full range of primary, community, secondary and other health services.</p>

<p>77. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> should ensure that their contracting arrangements with care homes that provide nursing care give clarity on the responsibilities of nurses within the care home and of community nursing services, respectively. No gap in service provision should arise between the 2 sectors.</p>

<p>78. Services provided or funded by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> (such as <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare or primary care services) are not subject to a financial assessment and contribution by the individual.</p>

<p>Services provided or funded by the local authority may be subject to a financial contribution, following a financial assessment.</p>

<p>Where an individual has resources above the relevant capital threshold, they may be a âself-funderâ and may be responsible for arranging and funding their own care arrangements. Local authorities also have a power under the Care Act to meet the needs of individuals in residential care who are self-funders and request this.</p>

<p>79. Services commissioned by <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> (which could, for example, include podiatry, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, tissue viability nursing and palliative care services) should be made available to residents of care homes providing nursing care on the same basis as they are to those in other settings, whether in care homes or at home.</p>

<p>80. Residents of care homes are entitled to be registered with a GP on the same basis as anyone else, so that they can have access to the full range of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> services that are available for patients.</p>

<p>81. Apart from <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, additional health services may also be delivered by existing <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> services or funded by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, if these are identified and agreed as part of an assessment and care plan.</p>

<p>The range of services that the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> is expected to arrange and fund includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>primary healthcare</li>
  <li>assessment involving doctors and registered nurses</li>
  <li>rehabilitation or reablement and recovery (where this forms part of an overall package of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> care, as distinct from intermediate care)</li>
  <li>respite healthcare</li>
  <li>community health services</li>
  <li>specialist or health-related equipment</li>
  <li>specialist nursing services</li>
  <li>specialist support for healthcare needs</li>
  <li>palliative care and end-of-life healthcare</li>
</ul>

<p>82. Joint funding arrangements between the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and local authority can be implemented within the care home setting if needs indicate that this is necessary.</p>

<p>83. The <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> responsible for the individual should be determined in accordance with the principles set out in current âresponsible commissionerâ legislation and guidance.</p>

<p>84. Local authority provision of care and support under the Care Act 2014 is based on national eligibility criteria.</p>

<h3>Continence services</h3>

<p>85. Residents of care homes, including those providing nursing care, should have access to professional advice about the promotion of continence. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/excellence-in-continence-care/" rel="external">Excellence in Continence Care: practical guidance for commissioners, and leaders in health and social care</a>.</p>

<p>86. As well as prevention and advice services, the continence service should also include the provision of continence products, subject to a full assessment of an individualâs needs. Continence products or payments should be made available by the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> to care home residents, including those who are also receiving <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, if required.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3- </span> and 12-month reviews of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care</h2>

<p>87. Where an individual has been found eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, a review should be undertaken within 3 months of the eligibility decision being made. After this, further reviews should normally be undertaken on at least an annual basis.</p>

<p>88. When reviewing the need for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, potential eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare must always be considered. This will normally be achieved by completing a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-continuing-healthcare-checklist"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare checklist</a> and, where necessary, a full assessment for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-continuing-healthcare-decision-support-tool"><abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>89. However, where a checklist and/or <abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr> has previously been completed (with the result that the individual was not found eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare) and it is clear that there has been no material change in need, then it will not be necessary to repeat the checklist and/or <abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr>, and this should be recorded. The individual should be informed of this outcome and the reasons for it.</p>

<p>90. Where a new checklist is completed and indicates that a full assessment of eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare is required, then an <abbr title="multidisciplinary team">MDT</abbr> should complete a <abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr> and follow the normal decision-making process.</p>

<p>91. In order to determine whether there has been a material change in need, the annotated previously completed checklist or <abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr> should be available at the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care review. Each of the domains and previously assessed need levels should be considered as part of the review, in consultation with the person being reviewed and any other relevant people who know the individual who are present.</p>

<p>92. If, at the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care review, it is determined that the individual does not require assessment for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare, they or their representative should be advised of this and provided with a copy of the annotated previously completed checklist or <abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr> that indicates that there has been no material change in their needs.</p>

<p>They should be given information explaining how they can request a review of the outcome of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care review, should they wish to do so.</p>

<p>93. Where one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a) there has not been a previous <abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr> completed by an <abbr title="multidisciplinary team">MDT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>b) the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care review indicates a possible change in eligibilityâ¦</li>
</ul>

<p>94. â¦then a positive checklist should always be followed by an <abbr title="multidisciplinary team">MDT</abbr> completing a <abbr title="decision support tool">DST</abbr> and making a recommendation on eligibility regarding <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare.</p>

<p>95. Where there has been a material change in need such that the individual no longer meets the criteria for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, then the individual will no longer be eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care and payments will cease.</p>

<p>96. After the initial 3-month review, further reviews should normally take place annually as a minimum. Some cases may require a more frequent review, in line with clinical judgement, anticipated changing needs or if there is a significant change in the healthcare needs of the individual.</p>

<p>The care provider should notify the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> if there is a significant change in needs that may indicate that an early review is necessary.</p>

<p>97. If the local authority is also responsible for any part of the care, both the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and the local authority will have a requirement to review needs and the service provided. In such circumstances, it would be beneficial for them to conduct a joint review where practicable.</p>

<p>Where the review is not carried out jointly it is important for both parties to share relevant information with each other that may have an impact on their respective commissioning responsibilities â for example, relating to a change in need or safeguarding concerns.</p>

<h2>Additional information</h2>

<h3>Transition between hospital and care home placements</h3>

<p>98. When a care home resident is admitted to hospital, payments for their care by a registered nurse should not be duplicated for the duration of their stay, but should resume on their return to the care home. These terms, and any variations to them, should be reflected in local <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> contracts with care homes.</p>

<p>Local authorities and individuals will need to agree separately with care homes the level of fees necessary to retain the place in the care home providing nursing care in the event of such temporary absences.</p>

<p>99. In order to guarantee the place in the care home on return from hospital and to avoid individuals being asked to pay any shortfall for the time they are in hospital, <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> should consider the payment of an equivalent sum as a retainer.</p>

<p>This should be in accordance with the practice of their local authority partners. Where someone has been placed in residential care under a local authority contract, it has been customary practice for local authorities to continue to pay care homes the full fee for a set period (such as 4 or 6 weeks), followed by a reduced payment thereafter.</p>

<p>100. In these circumstances, the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> may need to pay a sum equal to the amount that was being paid towards <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care immediately prior to the admission to hospital in order to retain accommodation there.</p>

<p>101. Separate contracts that the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> has with providers to pay for nursing care (for self-funders) should also provide for a retainer to be paid on admission to hospital in order to safeguard the care home bed when the individual is ready for discharge from hospital.</p>

<h3>Special circumstances</h3>

<p>102. There are a few care homes where the normal arrangements for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care do not apply.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b">Annex B</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-c">Annex C</a> with reference particularly to Revitalise, war pensioners and Ilford Park, and other charitable or voluntary organisations.</p>

<h3>Death of a care home resident</h3>

<p>103. In their contracts with providers, local authorities often pay a full fee for a certain period following death, in recognition of the fact that rooms need to be prepared for new residents. <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> will need to agree a similar payment in these circumstances to cover the period after death in line with any agreements reached with providers and local authorities.</p>

<p>Contracts between individuals and/or local authorities with providers should have terms and conditions that are transparent and fair, including setting out what happens if a resident is admitted to hospital or resident dies.</p>

<h3>Complaints</h3>

<p>104. If the individual is dissatisfied with the outcome of a decision relating to their eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, they are entitled to ask their <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> for a review of that decision. If they remain dissatisfied following this, they can pursue the matter through the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> complaints procedure</p>

<p>105. Where appropriate, advice should be given to the individual and/or their representative regarding <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.healthwatch.co.uk/" rel="external">Healthwatch</a>, local independent complaints advocacy services and/or other local advocacy providers who can support them through the process.</p>

<h3>Monitoring and assurance</h3>

<p>106. In addition to the responsibilities for governance set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">national framework</a>, which relate mainly to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare eligibility considerations, <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> will find it helpful to carry out routine audits of the award of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.</p>

<p>This should enable the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> to monitor capacity issues, monitor the consistency of decision-making, inform the commissioning process and take action accordingly.</p>

<h5>Not eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare</h5>

<p>Ask: do both of the following apply?</p>

<ul>
  <li>a) The individual needs care from a registered nurse</li>
  <li>b) The individualâs overall needs would be most appropriately met in a care home with nursing</li>
</ul>

<p>No: not eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care â see next steps below:</p>

<h5>Eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care</h5>

<p><abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> pays <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care rate to care home provider. (In some situations, the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> may provide additional services or funding as part of a joint package alongside <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care.)</p>

<p>A review of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care should be undertaken within 3 months of the eligibility decision being made, then at least annually.</p>

<p>At each review, consider whether needs are being appropriately met and also whether the individual may now have a need for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare.&nbsp;Note: where <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare has previously been considered and there has been no material change in need then it is not necessary to re-do the checklist or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-continuing-healthcare-decision-support-tool">decision support tool</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex A: record of registered nursing care needs</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-funded-nursing-care-practice">Templates of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care documentation for local adaptation</a> are available for download in PDF, Word and ODT format, as well as accessible versions.</p>

<h2>Annex B: Revitalise care homes</h2>

<h3>Revitalise</h3>

<p>1. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://revitalise.org.uk/" rel="external">Revitalise</a> (formerly known as the Winged Fellowship) runs care homes specialising in short-term respite care for severely disabled people. Nursing care for periods of short-term respite care in the care homes listed below will be funded by the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> where the care home is physically located, rather than by the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> where the person is GP-registered.</p>

<p>2. To ease administrative burdens, allocations to the host <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> were increased to reflect the additional administrative burden placed on them for making payments and for monitoring care on behalf of other <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and, where partnership arrangements are in place, local authorities.</p>

<h3>Revitalise care homes or centres</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Jubilee Lodge, Epping</li>
  <li>Netley, Eastleigh</li>
  <li>Sandpipers, Southport</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annex C: some special cases</h2>

<h3>War pensioners and Ilford Park</h3>

<p>1. A very small number of residents of care homes receive nursing care and the whole of their care costs, including care from a registered nurse, funded by the state through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/veterans-uk">Veterans UK</a> (including the Ilford Park Polish Home).</p>

<p>2. Although not self-funders, they continue to receive funding for their care from Veterans UK and so are not eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care. The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> will, however, be involved in ensuring that they are receiving other appropriate <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> services and care that they may need, as well as continence advice.</p>

<p>3. For the vast majority of war pensioners who live in care homes, the situation is the same as for any other resident. Local authorities will need to take account of the receipt of a war pension as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2672/contents/made" rel="external">Care and Support (Charging and Assessment of Resources) Regulations 2014</a> (as amended) when carrying out financial assessments.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, eligibility for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care would be unaffected by whether or not they qualify for any support from a local authority.</p>

<h3>Charitable and voluntary organisations</h3>

<p>4. The policy of a number of charities and voluntary organisations has been for them to subsidise all the costs of care provided by a registered nurse for the residents of their care homes. In the majority of cases, those charitable and voluntary sector bodies are also the providers of care.</p>

<p>The individual is usually asked to pay for all the other costs of their care, other than registered nurse care. In these circumstances, the residents may be eligible for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care as a self-funder, subject to this guidance.</p>

<p>5. In order for the charity or organisation to benefit from <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care, it would need to increase the fee level by an equivalent amount of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care payment to include care provided by a registered nurse. The charity or organisation would then be able to collect and retain the full <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care payment.</p>

<p>6. Alternatively, the charity or organisation could amend their policy or status so that the care from a registered nurse is no longer subsidised at all and it would then be entitled to receive the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care payment. With this option, the resident may pay more than their current fee level if the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care payment does not fully cover the cost of registered nurse care provided.</p>

<p>7. Whatever option is chosen, individual residents or their representatives would need to be informed and the position explained to them â in particular if and how this is likely to affect the level of fee they will be expected to pay to the care home.</p>

<h3>Independent hospitals</h3>

<p>8. Some care homes â mainly providing care for those with mental health problems â that used to be registered as a care home providing nursing care under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/23/part/I/enacted" rel="external">Registered Homes Act 1984</a> have opted to register as independent hospitals under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/14/contents" rel="external">Care Standards Act 2000</a>.</p>

<p>9. Residents and patients of independent hospitals are entitled to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care and so should first be considered for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare.</p>
