<p>Now more than halfway through the transition programme, this update provides progress on the transition of EQA to Ofqual between 1 January 2020 and 28 February 2022.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/apprenticeship-end-point-assessments#which-standards-do-we-provide-eqa-for">Information about EQA transition timelines.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>What has been achieved</h2>

<p>More than half of the awarding organisations regulated by Ofqual are now recognised to deliver EPA. This brings more than 90% of apprentices on 178 standards in this first phase of the move to Ofqual into the protection of regulation.</p>

<p>A further 29 phase 1 standards and 37 phase 2 standards will transition on 31 March 2022. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/external-quality-assurance-of-end-point-assessments-status">Confirmed standards we provide EQA for</a> is updated each month.</p>

<p>Over the last 2 years, Ofqual has received and approved more applications for recognition than ever before - receiving 111 first time applications as part of transition and recognising 40 new EPAOs. From archaeology to metal casting, recognised EPAOs are diverse in their size, scope and background. Nineteen were able to achieve recognition at their first attempt. Eleven did so at their second and a further 10 at subsequent applications.</p>

<p>EPAOs successful in achieving recognition were able to demonstrate they meet our Criteria for Recognition, showing amongst other things that they have both the subject and assessment expertise to offer high-quality EPAs and that they can comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook">General Conditions of Recognition</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/epa-qualification-level-conditions-and-requirements">EPA Qualification Level Conditions</a> once recognised.</p>

<h2>Achieving recognition</h2>

<p>Ofqual recognition gives assurance that regulated awarding organisations have the capacity, capability, and assessment competence to design, deliver and award valid qualifications, alongside their sector expertise. This is so that there is confidence in the qualifications themselves and the system at large.</p>

<p>There are EPAOs that are still on their journey to achieving recognition – either awaiting the outcome of an application or working on a resubmission.</p>

<p>On average, it takes EPAOs 28 weeks to achieve recognition from their first submission. This includes our review of their application (usually up to 12 weeks) and the time for them to submit subsequent applications if necessary. EPAOs applying for recognition need to consider this timescale in relation to the deadlines for their respective phase of transition.</p>

<p>EPAOs that are unsuccessful receive feedback from us. This includes factual reasons for our decision, and they are offered a feedback meeting with the team that reviewed their application, so that they can deepen their understanding of the areas they need to address in a subsequent application. Many applicants tell us that they find these meetings invaluable. 72 EPAOs have to date submitted a second application for recognition following feedback from us.</p>

<p>Ofqual recognition should be considered independently of applications to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-end-point-assessment-organisations">Register of End-Point Assessment Organisations</a> (RoEPAO) or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers">Register of Approved Training Providers</a> (RoATP), managed by the ESFA.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>

<p>Nine phase 2 EPAOs have already submitted their application for recognition well in advance of the phase 2 submission deadline of 16 May 2022, with 1 already achieving recognition. The deadline to achieve recognition for phase 2 of EQA transition is 31 December 2022.</p>

<p>EPAOs can apply for recognition at any time. In addition to the formal published information and guidance, our Strategic Relationships team are available to provide further support and guidance. Again, many applicants tell us that they find this support really valuable. The team can be contacted via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://recognition.ofqual.gov.uk/" rel="external">recognition gateway</a>.</p>
