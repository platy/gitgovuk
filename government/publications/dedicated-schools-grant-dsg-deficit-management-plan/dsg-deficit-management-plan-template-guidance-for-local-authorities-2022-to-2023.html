<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Summary</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>About this guidance</h3>

<p>This guidance has been produced by Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) as a reference tool for all local authorities. It provides support when completing plans for managing their dedicated schools grant (DSG).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Review date</h3>

<p>This guidance will next be reviewed in 2023.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Who is this guidance for?</h3>

<p>In response to feedback from local authorities and other stakeholders, we have designed a management plan template to help local authorities manage their DSG. ESFA has developed and enhanced this template in partnership with over 60 attendees from local authorities, their representatives and other stakeholders via user research groups and collated feedback.</p>

<p>This document is a step-by-step guide to help local authorities complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-deficit-management-plan">DSG management template</a>. The template is a supportive tool to enable local authorities to formulate and present their DSG management plans. It will be particularly useful for local authorities when discussing and sharing proposals with internal and external bodies, including schools forum (particularly any high needs working groups), special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) partnership or oversight boards established by the council, parent and carer forums and relevant council committees.</p>

<p>Please note: safety valve funding negotiations are a separate exercise to the DSG management plan template. Guidance on this can be found within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-16-schools-funding-local-authority-guidance-for-2022-to-2023">high needs safety valve funding in the schools revenue funding 2022 to 2023 operational guide</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Overview of the DSG management plan template</h3>

<p>The DSG is a ring-fenced specific grant, provided outside the local government finance settlement. It must be used in support of the schools budget for the purposes defined in regulation 6 and schedule 2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2022/27/contents/made" rel="external">the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2022</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2022-to-2023">DSG: conditions of grant 2022 to 2023</a> paragraph 5.2, requires that any local authority with an overall deficit on its DSG account at the end of the 2021 to 2022 financial year, or whose DSG surplus has substantially reduced during the year, must be able to present a plan to DfE for managing their future DSG spend. We also realise that there will be a requirement for local authorities to share this information with their stakeholders, such as schools forums, parent and carer forum, local headteacher boards or groups.</p>

<p>To help local authorities meet this requirement we have provided a DSG management plan template. This template will help local authorities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>comply with paragraph 5.2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2022-to-2023">DSG: conditions of grant 2022 to 2023</a>
</li>
  <li>monitor how DSG funding is being spent</li>
  <li>highlight areas where local authorities may wish to review spending</li>
  <li>form evidence-based and strategic future plans for the provision of children and young people with SEND</li>
  <li>present complex funding information simply to schools forums and other external stakeholders</li>
  <li>provide a consistent reporting format to help local authorities share best practice and initiatives</li>
</ul>

<p>The template will help local authorities to focus attention on comparisons of high needs provision and spend, to produce the required plan. We encourage all local authorities to use the template as a planning tool.</p>

<p>We expect the plan to be updated and presented at schools forum meetings and any high needs subgroups regularly and at least on a termly basis. The local authority should aim to present their plan to the schools forum in time for budget planning discussions for 2023 to 2024 and before the deadline for block movement requests if it is submitting one. We realise that the management of DSG balances, both bringing spend in line with income and repaying deficits, will take time for some local authorities. We have developed the template in such a way that it is intended to be a live document.</p>

<p>Management plans should reflect the most current forecast DSG position and be published on the local authority local offer website as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">Special educational needs and disability (SEND) Code of Practice: 0 to 25 years</a>.</p>

<p>Relevant leads in the finance and special educational needs (SEN) areas should sign off each version of the management plan (with sign off to be at least at assistant director level).</p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding this guidance or template, please contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Financial.management@education.gov.uk">financial management mailbox</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Glossary</h2>

<p>The ‘introduction page’ within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-deficit-management-plan">DSG management template</a>, which is available on Document Exchange, provides information and reference links to  acronyms that are used throughout this document, for ease of reference.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How to complete the management plan template</h2>

<p>This document describes how to use and complete the management plan template and has been designed as a reference guide.</p>

<p>Please note that based on user feedback, the template has been created using Microsoft Excel and is available on Document Exchange. As such, it is expected that users completing the template will at least have a basic knowledge of this software.</p>

<p>This template relies on calculations running automatically as you select your local authority and enter data. To ensure that this is happening correctly please check your settings by clicking on the formulas tab; in the calculation group, click calculation options, and then select automatic if it is not already selected.</p>

<p>A key change to the updated template version is that we expect outturn and future forecasts to be input on pre-recoupment basis.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-benchmarking-tool">high needs benchmarking tool</a> has been removed from the template as it was causing problems with the speed of the template. However, there is a link on the ‘cover’ tab that will take you directly to the GOV.UK page to use the tool.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Detailed overview</h3>

<p>It is recommended that you save a copy of the management plan template locally before you start to edit. In addition, we advise you to continue to save the workbook often so that you do not lose any updates you add.</p>

<p>The guidance has been composed with deliberate repetition between tabs. This is intended so that you can jump from section to section within the template, dependent on your role and responsibility. Tabs are connected and you are only required to add data once, which then pulls through to other cells within the template.</p>

<p>The template is made up of several individual tabs along the bottom of the screen, which are colour coded depending on type:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Tab type</td>
      <td>Colour</td>
      <td>User input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Summary</td>
      <td>White</td>
      <td>Some user narrative and data input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Introduction</td>
      <td>Grey</td>
      <td>No user input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Narrative</td>
      <td>Light green</td>
      <td>User narrative input</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Placement type</td>
      <td>Red</td>
      <td>User data input</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Within each tab, sections are coloured to represent the following:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cell</td>
      <td>Colour</td>
      <td>Editable or not editable</td>
      <td>Requirement</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>User input cells</td>
      <td>Blue</td>
      <td>Editable</td>
      <td>You’ll need to enter data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pre-populated cells</td>
      <td>Yellow</td>
      <td>Not editable, these are pre-populated</td>
      <td>No requirement</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>User input cells</td>
      <td>Blue</td>
      <td>Editable</td>
      <td>You’ll need to enter outturn data for 2021 to 2022</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Calculation cells</td>
      <td>Purple</td>
      <td>Not editable</td>
      <td>These cells have automatic calculation</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>To note: we have designed the template so that if you wish to provide any further information on any of the tabs, for example, links to further supporting information or evidence, there is blank space to do so.</p>

<p>The option to include additional information is in response to user research. However, we would not expect to see documents inserted in lieu of appropriate narrative being provided on the template.</p>

<p>Additional documents should only be added to evidence decisions being taken or statements being made.</p>

<p>The free text boxes within the narrative tabs on the template should provide a brief commentary of a maximum of 2 paragraphs, summarising your plans.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Cover tab</h2>

<p>The ‘cover’ tab is a narrative tab which requires some user input.<br>
It is important that you update the blue cells to show who last updated the management plan template and when.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Row number</td>
      <td>User input instructions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>Drop-down menu to select the relevant local authority name</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>Cell ‘D’ is a user input cell to input the date the management plan was last modified</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>Cell ‘D’ - intended for internal use for local authority version control</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Local authority change log</h3>

<p>These boxes are for internal use within the local authority to record version history as and when amendments to the management plan are made.</p>

<p>We encourage you to update your plan regularly throughout the year to reflect the most recent forecast position and view this as an on-going live document.</p>

<p>We expect all management plan template users to keep this change log updated throughout the year, on a termly basis and in line with presenting to schools forum meetings.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Executive summary tab</h2>

<p>The executive summary tab provides a high-level overview of the current financial situation and comprises areas where data is automatically pulled through, and areas where user narrative input is required.</p>

<p>This tab has been added to provide a summary of end of year positions, headline savings and pressures. You may wish to build your own summary which is better suited to your specific stakeholders’ needs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Summary of end of year positions</h3>

<p>The tables within this section contain pre-populated data which pulls through from the financial tab.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Headline mitigations/savings</h3>

<p>This table requires user input and should have no more than 10 key savings listed, along with their actual or forecast financial cost savings. The adjacent table allows for details of numbers of education, health and care plans (EHCPs).</p>

<p>To have an audit trail to the figures in the template, please provide narrative as to where the mitigation/saving impacts in the area provided to the right of the table labelled ‘not for publication, audit trail (link to other tabs)’ at W28. For example, an inclusion strategy/saving may have planned saving of £x in top ups for resource units in maintained schools and reduction of £y in non-maintained independent schools.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Headline pressures</h3>

<p>This table requires user input and should have no more than 10 key pressures listed, along with their actual or forecast financial costs. The adjacent table allows for details of numbers of EHCPs.</p>

<p>To have an audit trail to the figures in the template, please provide narrative as to where the mitigation/saving impacts in the area provided to the right of the table labelled ‘Not for publication, audit trail (link to other tabs)’ at W46. For example, an inclusion strategy/saving may have planned to save £x in top ups for resource units in maintained schools and reduction of £y in non-maintained independent schools.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Total number of children and young people supported by the high needs block (with estimated future projections)</h3>

<p>This table pulls together data from all the placements tabs to provide a total number of children and young people that are supported by the high needs block (with or without an EHCP), with percentage increase year on year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Number of children and young people supported by all provisions (with estimated future projections)</h3>

<p>This table pulls together data from all the placements tabs to provide a total number of children and young people with EHCPs, broken down by primary need, that are supported by all provisions, with percentage increase year on year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Summary: financial/children and young people narrative tab</h2>

<p>The summary: financial/children and young people narrative tab comprises 3 separate free text boxes which requires user narrative input and should provide a high-level summary of the proposed strategies to manage current pressures.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please add comments and narrative within the blank free text boxes.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Financial plan narrative</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This narrative should be no more than one concise paragraph which provides a high-level summary of proposed strategies for managing the pressures on the DSG budget.</p>

<p>Please do not refer to further documentation.</p>
</div>

<p>This free text box should provide a short narrative detailing how you are managing pressures on the DSG and your strategy for doing so. When completing this box, consideration should be given to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how pressures will be prioritised to be addressed</li>
  <li>an assessment of how the management plan addresses these pressures</li>
  <li>proposals put in to place to help alleviate these pressures</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>High needs trends</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Narrative provided in both ‘high needs trends’ and ‘outcomes’ free text boxes should be no more than one concise paragraph which provides a high-level summary of the strategies for managing the funding of children and young people from the high needs block and how the management plan proposals will ensure positive outcomes for children and young people.</p>

<p>Please do not refer to further documentation.</p>
</div>

<p>This free text box should provide a short review of high needs trends and the strategy proposals for managing the number of children and young people receiving individual funding from the high needs block. When completing this section, consideration should be given to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>managing demand, top ups and alternative provision (AP) within the local authority</li>
  <li>measures to ensure these issues are being addressed</li>
  <li>how the management plan aligns with the SEND strategic plan alongside the local authorities priorities</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Outcomes</h3>

<p>This free text box should provide a brief description of outcomes, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>greater support for early intervention</li>
  <li>improvements in the capacity of mainstream schools to meet needs without the need for EHCPs</li>
  <li>opportunities to attend schools closer to home</li>
</ul>

<p>Where proposals may pose a risk to outcomes, this section should briefly describe what is being done to mitigate this risk.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Financial summary tab</h2>

<p>The ‘financial summary’ tab requires some user narrative and data input.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Summary of end of year positions</h3>

<p>This summary table provides end of year key figures for financial years 2018 to 2019 through to 2026 to 2027. The table is made up of calculation cells which pull through DSG, and user input data taken from the ‘Financial plan per funding block’ table.</p>

<p>The ‘savings forecast’ row (row 10) shows the difference between the unmitigated (forecast prior to accounting for any cost reduction and/or invest to save measures in place) and the mitigated (forecast after accounting for the cost reductions and/or invest to save measures in place) budgets.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the ‘savings forecast’ row provides a summary of just the savings position and does not include, for example, additional income or block transfers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Financial plan per funding block</h3>

<p>In relation to the DSG: conditions of grant 2022 to 2023 any local authority required to provide information to the department will be expected to complete this level of financial detail, as laid out in this table and share this with schools forum and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>This table enables you to input the overall DSG position (pre-recoupment total) financial data for both actual and forecast spend. Actual spend will be 2018 to 2019 financial year through to 2021 to 2022 financial year. Forecast spend will be 2022 to 2023 financial year, going up to and including 2026 to 2027 financial year (if you wish to forecast this far). We expect your actual spend to match the section 251 outturn return data.</p>

<p>Supporting narrative for any data discrepancies can be included in the additional comments table to the right-hand side of this tab (column R). 
All data input in the ‘overall DSG position (pre-recoupment total)’ table should match the budget on which you are reporting and should reconcile with the latest published DSG allocations.</p>

<p>All expenditure should be input as a positive figure and all income should be input as a negative figure. This will show a surplus as a negative and a deficit as a positive figure.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>When completing the ‘overall DSG position (pre-recoupment total)’ table, users should note the following:</p>

<p>‘Mitigated forecast’: forecast after accounting for the cost reduction and/or invest to save measures in place. This is gross funding, and you must ensure that you include recoupment amounts in your expenditure.</p>

<p>‘Unmitigated forecast’: forecast prior to accounting for any cost reduction and/or invest to save measures in place; a ‘do nothing’ forecast. This is gross funding, and you must ensure that you include recoupment amounts in your expenditure.</p>

<p>To note: income should reconcile to the latest DSG allocation announcement for 2022 to 2023 with a clear assumption for any in year early years  adjustments (the adjustment based on January 2022 census).</p>

<h4>Block transfers (income/block moved to as a negative, outgoing/block moved from as positive. Should net to 0)</h4>

<p>The cells within this section for each funding block should be used to input previously agreed block transfers for financial years 2018 to 2019, 2019 to 2020, 2020 to 2021, 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>You should also record any proposed future years block transfers. Please note that we have not announced arrangements beyond 2022 to 2023. Therefore, you will need to have a fall-back position if what you are proposing is not allowed either in the DSG: conditions of grant or through the outcome of a disapplication request.</p>

<p>Supporting narrative for any proposed future years block transfers should be recorded in the ‘block movements and disapplications’ free text box on the ‘local authority specific’ tab in the template (row 40). Further guidance on block transfers can be found in the ‘Movement between blocks’ section, pages 46 to 50 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-16-schools-funding-local-authority-guidance-for-2022-to-2023">schools revenue funding 2022 to 2023 operational guide</a>.</p>

<p>The data used within ‘total number of EHCPs by age group (with estimated future projection)’ in columns C to F is the actual position for historical EHCP numbers as taken from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/education-health-and-care-plans" rel="external">SEN2</a>. These published figures can be found within the ‘download associated files’ dropdown on the EHCPs page. Future template versions will be updated as and when future published data becomes available.</p>

<p>The data used within ‘published census data – pre-populated total number of EHCPs by primary need’ in columns C to F is the actual position for historical EHCP numbers as taken from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/special-educational-needs-in-england" rel="external">school census</a>. These published figures can be found within the ‘download associated files’ dropdown on the ‘special educational needs in England’ page. Future template versions will be updated as and when future published data becomes available.</p>

<p>Your forecast EHCP numbers should consider the children and young people currently receiving support as will be reported on the high needs census and projected numbers rather than an annual average.</p>

<p>We recognise this may not be the number used for budget planning but is an indicator of the likely pressures on the high needs block over time and should be viewed in this context.</p>

<p>The ‘placement type’ tabs detailed below provide data information for individual placement settings and require user data input:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream (mainstream schools or academies placements)</li>
  <li>resourced or SEN Units (resourced provision or SEN units placements)</li>
  <li>special schools (maintained special schools or special academies placements)</li>
  <li>NMSS or independent (non-maintained special schools or independent 
(NMSS or independent) placements)</li>
  <li>Hospital schools or AP (hospital schools or alternative provision (AP) placements)</li>
  <li>Post-16 and FE (post-16 and further education (FE) placements)</li>
  <li>health, social care (health, social care, therapy services and care provision) 
other (other placements or direct payments and any additional expenditure within the S251 which is funded via the high needs block)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span>Data tables</h3>

<p>Data tables in placement type tabs contain both pre-populated and user input cells.</p>

<p>Yellow cells: pre-populated cells which contain published data cannot be amended.</p>

<p>Blue cells: user input cells for you to input data.</p>

<p>Purple cells: calculation cells which cannot be amended.</p>

<p>White cells: require no data input.</p>

<p>To note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for post-16 and FE placement type you should include young people aged 16+ who are on-roll of mainstream FE, sixth form colleges and special sixth form colleges</li>
  <li>for all other placement types, you should include young people aged 16+ who are on roll with an EHCP</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Other’ tab:</p>

<ul>
  <li>five rows have been added in the expenditure section of the ‘other’ tab (rows 13 to 17) to enable you to record other high needs expenditure contained elsewhere within your S251. This will enable all high needs expenditure to be recorded and reconciled to funding</li>
  <li>rows 13 to 17, column B have been deliberately left blank to enable you to input the S251 line number and a very brief description of the high needs expenditure</li>
  <li>rows 13 to 17, columns C to Q enable you to record historical, outturn and predicted forecast other high needs expenditure figures</li>
  <li>these five rows are included within ‘total expenditure’ row 18 on the ‘other’ tab which then feed into ‘local authority specific spending total expenditure’ row 113 on the ‘financial’ tab of the template, as part of your high needs expenditure</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span>Total projected mitigated expenditure (forecast with savings and invest to save measures) data table</h3>

<p>This data table contains both pre-populated and user input cells. The yellow pre-populated cells contain published data which has been taken from:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/section-251-2018-to-2019#section-251-outturn">S251 outturn returns for 2018 to 2019</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/section-251-2019-to-2020">S251 outturn returns for 2019 to 2020</a></li>

<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/section-251-2020-to-2021">S251: outturn returns for 2020 to 2021</a> 
To note: the pre-populated S251 data is gross therefore projected data must be input as gross for continuity.</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.4 </span>EHCP and children and young people data tables</h3>

<p>These 4 data tables contain user input cells for you to input both historic and estimated future projections of children and young people with or without an EHCP who are supported within the high needs block. These data tables are included in every placement type tab apart from ‘Health, Social Care’ and the data entered in these tables will pull through to the ‘children and young people’ tab elsewhere in the template.</p>

<p>The tables adjacent contain calculation cells and show the percentage increase year on year for the figures input into each of the 4 data tables.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.5 </span>Graphs</h3>
<p>The information displayed within the graphs is representative of the data on each tab. These show calculated cells which combine pre-populated and user input data.</p>
