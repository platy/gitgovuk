<h3>The National Child Measurement Programme</h3>

<p>The National Child Measurement Programme (<abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>) was established in 2006 and involves measuring, on an annual basis, the height and weight of over a million children in reception and year 6 at state-funded schools, including academies, in England.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> is to provide robust public health surveillance data on child weight status in order to understand and monitor obesity prevalence and trends at national and local levels, inform childhood obesity planning and commissioning and underpin the Public Health Outcomes Framework indicators on child excess weight in 4 to 5 year olds and 10 to 11 year olds. Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has responsibility for the overall management of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and provides operational guidance for the programme.</p>

<h3>Childhood overweight and obesity in England</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> 2018 to 2019 school year data</a> showed that 22.6% or more than a fifth of children in reception and 34.3% or 1 in 3 children in year 6 were living with overweight or obesity, including severe obesity. <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data consistently shows that the prevalence of obesity doubles between reception and year 6 (from around 10% to around 20%).</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-child-measurement-programme-ncmp-trends-in-child-bmi-between-2006-to-2007-and-2018-to-2019">data for <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> long-term trends</a> from 2006 to 2007 and 2018 to 2019 shows an upward trend in the prevalence of severe obesity, obesity and excess weight for girls in reception and boys and girls in year 6. Data also shows that there are inequalities in terms of obesity prevalence in children from the most deprived compared with least deprived areas, and between children from different ethnic groups.</p>

<p>The government published the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childhood-obesity-a-plan-for-action/childhood-obesity-a-plan-for-action" class="govuk-link">Childhood Obesity Plan</a> in 2016. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childhood-obesity-a-plan-for-action-chapter-2" class="govuk-link">Chapter two</a>, published in 2018, outlines the actions the government will take towards its goal of halving childhood obesity and reducing the gap in obesity between children from the most and least deprived areas by 2030. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s-consultation-document">Chapter 3 of the childhood obesity plan</a>, published as part of the 2019 prevention green paper, reinforced the government’s commitment to providing support for individuals to maintain a healthier weight. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-obesity-government-strategy/tackling-obesity-empowering-adults-and-children-to-live-healthier-lives" class="govuk-link">Tackling child and adult obesity</a> is a renewed and strengthened priority for the government, as is shown in its recently published strategy. The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> results are used to monitor progress towards reaching these targets and are used in the <a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework/data#page/0/gid/1000042/pat/6/par/E12000004/ati/302/are/E06000015/cid/4/tbm/1/page-options/ovw-do-0" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Public Health Outcomes Framework Indicators on Excess Weight in children</a>.</p>

<p>Children living with overweight or obesity are much more likely to become adults living with overweight or obesity. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> review of disparities in risks and outcomes report</a> emphasised that adults living with overweight and obesity are at an increased risk of serious <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> complications and death, further demonstrating the need to reduce childhood obesity.</p>

<h3>The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> and long-run trends in body-mass index data</h3>

<p>In 2017, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> published <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> long-term trends in body-mass index (<abbr title="body-mass index">BMI</abbr>) data from 2006 to 2007 and 2015 to 2016. Following this, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> commissioned University College London (<abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr>) to research the approaches being taken by local authorities with significant long-term downward trends in childhood <abbr title="body-mass index">BMI</abbr> data.</p>

<p><abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> identified local authorities that had demonstrated downward trends in the <abbr title="body-mass index">BMI</abbr> z-scores<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup> of children in 3 of the 4 cohort groups (The 4 cohort groups are: reception boys, reception girls, year 6 boys, and year 6 girls). In addition to this, <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> investigated local authorities with a significant downward trend amongst the most deprived quintile.</p>

<p>Of the 31 local authorities that were identified as having a small but significant 10-year downward trend in the <abbr title="body-mass index">BMI</abbr> z-scores, 25 agreed to be interviewed and this included one local authority with a downward trend in the most deprived quintile.</p>

<h2>Findings</h2>

<p>Using semi-structured interviews with directors of public health and childhood obesity leads, the main approaches taken by local authorities were thematically analysed. The 13 themes and examples of some approaches the local authorities used are shown in Table 1. These themes are discussed in detail in the main report and 24 practice examples have been published as part of this work (see Table 2).</p>

<p>The term ‘approach’ was used to describe all strategies and activities such as weight management services, childhood obesity policies and commissioned programmes that the local authority referred to in their interview with the researchers.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the methods used in this research cannot show causality nor even association. All local authorities interviewed used more than one approach.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The results from this research support previously published <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> documents and guidance on evidence-based practice for preventing and reducing childhood obesity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Health inequalities (all local authority themes)</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-inequalities-place-based-approaches-to-reduce-inequalities">Health inequalities</a> are unfair and avoidable differences in health across the population, and between different groups within society. Health inequalities arise because of the conditions in which we are born, grow, live, work and age. The <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> data can be used to identify health inequalities in order to understand the local population’s needs and inform planning and commissioning using a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-inequalities-place-based-approaches-to-reduce-inequalities">place-based approach</a>.</p>

<p>Of the local authorities interviewed, 76% focused on deprivation in their area. For some this was a focus when they provided <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> feedback to schools, Redbridge, for example, included deprivation information when they printed school results letters using the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> template.</p>

<p>However, Lewisham, the only local authority included with a downward trend in the most deprived quintile for at least 3 out of the 4 cohorts, delivered most of their interventions or initiatives universally, because there was widespread deprivation with only one affluent ward and others with varying degrees of deprivation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> The life-course approach (Themes A, B, C, D, I, L)</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-life-course-approach-to-prevention" class="govuk-link">life-course approach</a> considers the critical stages, transitions and settings where large differences can be made in promoting or restoring health and wellbeing. A life-course approach values the health and wellbeing of both current and future generations.</p>

<p>Many of the local authorities interviewed offered programmes and services aimed at different life stages to help reduce childhood obesity. This included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pregnancy (Theme C)</li>
  <li>infancy and early years (Theme C)</li>
  <li>childhood and adolescence (Themes A, B)</li>
  <li>adults (Themes D, I, L)</li>
</ul>

<p>Several local authorities also referred to involving the whole family in their approaches. For example, at group weight management programmes for children, 12 of the local authorities interviewed requested parental attendance as well.</p>

<p>A life-course approach requires a skilled workforce and this research shows the importance of supporting those working in different settings to help reduce childhood obesity. Local authority approaches targeting infancy and the early years referred to midwives, health visitors and infant feeding teams. Approaches targeting children and adolescents mostly referred to the school nursing team who are responsible for delivering the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>, as well as GPs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Whole-systems approach to obesity (Theme K)</h3>

<p>A local whole-systems approach responds to complexity through an ongoing, dynamic and flexible way of working. In 2019, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> published their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/whole-systems-approach-to-obesity" class="govuk-link">guide</a> and set of resources to support local authorities with implementing a whole-systems approach to address obesity and promote a healthy weight.</p>

<p>Although this research took place before <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> published the guide, 12 of the local authorities interviewed said that they took a whole-systems approach and this overlapped with some of the other themes including D (childhood obesity strategies).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Childhood obesity resources to support local authorities</h3>

<p>Local authorities in this study referred to some of the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> guidance and resources that they had used to help reduce childhood obesity and deliver the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> in their area. Since this research was undertaken, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> has published additional evidence-based documents and tools for local authorities on the ‘<a href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/all-our-health/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">All Our Health</a>’ childhood obesity interactive townscape.</p>

<p>Many of the local authorities who had “engagement with and integration of the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr>” (Theme A) had used the following <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-child-measurement-programme" class="govuk-link">letter templates for schools and parents found</a>. These templates are updated annually based on feedback the <abbr title="National Child Measurement Programme">NCMP</abbr> team receive and can be amended to include signposting for local services. In addition to this, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework" rel="external">Public Health Outcomes Framework data</a> was also mentioned by some local authorities.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although this research took place in 2017, sharing the learning from these local authorities remains important, since it shows that those with small but significant downward 10-year trends in <abbr title="body-mass index">BMI</abbr> z-score in children were using a highly diverse set of approaches and initiatives.</p>

<p>The commonality of these approaches across local authorities suggests that these may be important in reducing childhood obesity. Although the methods do not attribute causality, all local authorities interviewed used more than one approach to reduce childhood obesity. These common approaches also aligned with some of <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s priorities including reducing health inequalities, understanding the life-course approach and applying a whole-systems approach to obesity. This learning will be of interest to local authorities and to other strategic leaders who have an interest in preventing and reducing childhood obesity.</p>
