<p>The United Kingdom and Norway share a long history as neighbours in the North Atlantic with close economic, cultural, and strategic ties. Relations are deeply rooted in shared values, democratic principles, open societies, and open economies. We are committed to working together to increase security, sustainability, and prosperity, in Europe and beyond. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine underscores the importance of Allied and European solidarity, across a wide range of policy areas.</p>

<p>Bilaterally, we will continue to engage closely on shared interests in defence, foreign policy and security, prosperity, trade and technology, energy, climate and environment, innovation,&nbsp;and culture. Regular dialogue and cooperation across all sectors will advance bilateral trade and investment as we move towards a Net Zero economy.</p>

<p>Internationally, shared democratic values and a desire to promote global sustainable economic and social progress will form the bedrock of collaboration including through the UN, NATO, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the WTO. We will continue to consult and cooperate closely in international and multilateral fora on climate change and biodiversity loss; oceans; food security; reducing poverty; safeguarding human rights and gender equality; supporting access to education and health; and promoting peace and security including by improving conflict prevention and women’s meaningful participation in peace processes.</p>

<p>This Joint Declaration signals our intent to enhance our cooperation, focussing on the following priority areas:</p>

<h3>
