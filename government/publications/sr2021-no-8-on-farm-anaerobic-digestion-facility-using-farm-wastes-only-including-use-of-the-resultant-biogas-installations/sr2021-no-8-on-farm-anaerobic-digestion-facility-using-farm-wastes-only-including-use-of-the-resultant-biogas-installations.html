<p>‘accident’ means an accident that may result in pollution</p>

<p>‘accident management plan’ means a plan that identifies risks and failures which can have an impact on the environment or have environmental consequences. The plan must minimise the potential causes and consequences and identify clearly, the roles, responsibilities and action to be taken to minimise the consequences of accidents. This includes measures to prevent and control fires on site (see fire prevention plan). This must take into account any raw material stored on site and include clearly marked zoning as identified in the <abbr title="the Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002">DSEAR</abbr> risk assessment or plan</p>

<p>‘anaerobic digestion’ means a process of controlled decomposition of biodegradable materials under managed conditions where free oxygen is absent, at temperatures suitable for naturally occurring mesophilic or thermophilic anaerobe and facultative anaerobe bacteria species, which convert the inputs to a methane-rich biogas and whole digestate</p>

This does include, blood, feathers, uncooked butchers waste and any other animal waste that is not catering waste or former foodstuffs. This does not include faecal matter from animals</p>

<p>(a) ‘techniques’ includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned</p>

<p>(b) ‘available techniques’ means those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced inside the Member State in question, as long as they are reasonably accessible to the operator</p>

<p>‘capacity’ means the potential capacity and not historical or actual production levels or throughput. This means that the designed capacity is the maximum rate at which the site can operate. Biological treatment of waste usually takes place over more than one day, so the physical daily capacity can be calculated by dividing the maximum quantity of waste that could be subject to biological treatment at any one time by the minimum residence time.

<p>‘nearest sensitive receptor’ means the nearest place to the permitted activities where people are likely to be for prolonged periods. This term would therefore apply to dwellings (including any associated gardens) and to many types of workplaces. We would not normally regard a place where people are likely to be present for less than 6 hours at one time as being a sensitive receptor. The term does not apply to those controlling the permitted facility, their staff when they are at work or to visitors to the facility, as their health is covered by Health and Safety at Work legislation, but would apply to dwellings occupied by the family of those controlling the anaerobic digestion facility</p>

<p>‘sanitisation’ means the actively managed and intensive stage of composting, lasting for at least 5 days, characterised by high oxygen demand and temperatures of over 55 degrees C, during which biological processes, together with conditions in the composting mass, eradicate human and animal pathogens or reduce them to acceptably low levels</p>

<p>‘sealed drainage system’ in relation to an impermeable surface, means a drainage system with impermeable components which does not leak and which will ensure that:</p>

There is also a residual risk of reheating and leachate breakout</p>

<p>‘specified generator’ means a group of generators, other than excluded, between 1 and 50 megawatts or less than 50 megawatts as defined in Schedule 25B(2) of SI 2018 No.110 of the <abbr title="Environmental Permitting Regulations">EPR</abbr></p>
