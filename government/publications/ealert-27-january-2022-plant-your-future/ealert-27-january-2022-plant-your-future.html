<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Plant your future: create a lasting legacy that benefits you and future generations</h2>

<p>New drive to encourage farmers and landowners across England to plant and manage more trees has launched this week.</p>

<p>Woodland creation offers a profitable way for farmers and landowners to boost their business as well as deliver environmental benefits, while complementing food production.</p>

<p>There are a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tree-planting-and-woodland-creation-funding-and-advice">variety of funding opportunities</a> available to support the creation and management of new and existing woodlands, provided by both Defra, the Forestry Commission, and other woodland creation partnerships across England.</p>

<p>The grant schemes will help land managers diversify their business, with the potential to receive a grant of over £10,000 for every hectare of new woodland created.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Urban Tree Challenge Fund and Local Authority Treescapes Fund to re-open in 2022</h2>

<p>The Forestry Commission will re-open two major grant schemes in early 2022, the Urban Tree Challenge Fund (<abbr title="Urban Tree Challenge Fund">UTCF</abbr>) and Local Authority Treescapes Fund (<abbr title="Local Authority Treescapes Fund">LATF</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Urban Tree Challenge Fund">UTCF</abbr> is a key government offer to level up access to nature across the country, targeting tree planting toward socially deprived urban areas with low canopy cover, in proximity to healthcare and educational facilities.</p>

<p><abbr title="Local Authority Treescapes Fund">LATF</abbr> is a strategic grant scheme for local authorities to drive an increase in non-woodland tree planting across our landscapes.</p>

<p>Read about how the schemes differ and which you should apply for below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>How do I apply?</h3>
<p>Application forms will be available on gov.uk when the funds open.<abbr title="Local Authority Treescapes Fund">LATF</abbr> and <abbr title="Urban Tree Challenge Fund">UTCF</abbr> applications now require you to register with Rural Payments to obtain a Single Business Identifier (SBI) and Customer Reference Number (CRN). This must be provided on the application form. You can register with Rural Payments now.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>I am a local authority, which scheme should I apply for?</h3>
<p>You can apply for both! Apply to <abbr title="Urban Tree Challenge Fund">UTCF</abbr> if you wish to plant new large trees (standards) in urban areas, or <abbr title="Local Authority Treescapes Fund">LATF</abbr> if you wish to plant other non-woodland trees (including replacement urban standards that have been recently lost).</p>

<p>This year, applicants will need to register with Rural Payments (if not already registered) before applying to either of the funds, in order to obtain a Single Business Identifier and Customer Reference Number. This can be done straight away and before the application window opens. We will be changing our application forms this year (to be made available when the window opens) – please do not begin to complete an application on withdrawn versions of the forms.</p>
