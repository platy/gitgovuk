<h2>Approval standard: scientific protocol</h2>

<h3>When must this standard be met</h3>

<p>This standard must be met for all applications to process personally identifiable or de- personalised data.</p>

<h3>Standard</h3>

<p>1. All applications must be accompanied by a project-specific protocol that describes in a precise, understandable manner the purposes for which <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> data will be processed through its lifecycle up to data destruction. The project-specific protocol must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be consistent with other evidence supplied as part of the application</li>
  <li>document the role and responsibility of each organisation involved in the project (including sponsors, funders, co-applicants and any data processors operating under instruction)</li>
  <li>
    <p>demonstrate the necessity, proportionality and adequacy of using <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> data by clearly identifying all processing activities:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the project aims and objectives must be clearly stated, feasible, appropriately focused and specific</li>
      <li>the project methods and/or data management plan must be clearly stated and be descriptive of how the aims or objectives will be met</li>
      <li>the project methods and/or data management plan must clearly describe and defend the types, scale and complexity of data being requested (including data provenance, level of identifiability, relevant population and key attributes, such as temporality, as well as planned statistical analysis or end user application) – broad statements referring only to the data set, without context will not be accepted</li>
      <li>where data is requested from multiple sources or from different data controllers, the provenance of each data set must be clearly attributed in the project methods and/or data management plan</li>
      <li>where the project is a clinical audit, the methods must detail the standards against which practice will be compared, indicating the relevant published national, regional or local standards</li>
      <li>where the methods include data linkage, how the linkage will be conducted (the method and variables to be used) and by whom must be clearly articulated in the project methods and/or data management plan, alongside the legal basis under which the linkage can occur</li>
      <li>the project protocol must demonstrate that due consideration has been given to data minimisation and where personally identifiable data is requested, defend why the project cannot be delivered using de-personalised data in the ethical assessment</li>
      <li>the project methods must include a comprehensive description of the data subjects of interest (the population or sample) and how thy will be selected, using the medical coding systems (nomenclature) common to the data sets of interest</li>
      <li>where the application includes data disseminations at period intervals, the project methods and/or data management plan methods must include the frequency of measurements or interventions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the protocol must demonstrate the safeguards all organisations involved in the project have in place to ensure appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures – this can include highlighting contractual controls or the extent of written instructions to data processors</li>
  <li>the protocol must describe the end-to-end processing of the data and by whom this will be conducted, including any data sharing, the instruction of data processors, persistent or in-transit storage, or tools compliant with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) guidelines that will be used for data destruction</li>
  <li>the protocol must clearly articulate any data sharing, which includes movement across a network, physical transfers, transfers from one media or device to another, or by remote access to the data
<br><br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>2. All applications must demonstrate that the proposed processing documented in the project protocol is worthwhile and will have beneficial effects that outweigh the risks posed by the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the protocol must include an ethical assessment of the processing and how such issues are accepted or mitigated</li>
  <li>the protocol must include an assessment of data protection risks, and how such risks are accepted or mitigated</li>
  <li>the protocol must consider the risks of the proposed processing to the rights and freedoms of the data subject – where risks are identified that could compromise the data or the rights or freedoms of data subjects, the protocol must explain how these risks are to be mitigated</li>
  <li>where personally identifiable data is requested, the protocol must demonstrate how the ‘right to object’, including the national data opt out, will be upheld (where applicable)</li>
  <li>the protocol must demonstrate the translational potential or value of the project</li>
  <li>the protocol must include a pathway to impact (what you will do to make beneficiaries aware of the project and its outputs, so that impact can be achieved) and the project’s publication policy should be clear</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Where the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> data application form includes a request to onwardly share the data, the approach for doing this must be described.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Protocol content</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> does not prescribe the exact format of the project specific protocol to be included in your data application. However, you are advised to think carefully about the structure and content so that each approval standard, where applicable, is met.</p>

<p>Table 1 has been produced as a guide to help you shape your protocol and broadly describes the necessary content to enable <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to determine if the approval standards are met.</p>

<h3>Ethical conduct</h3>

<p>All applications submitted to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> must be descriptive of the ethical implications of the project throughout its lifecycle, including impact of the results, publication strategy and archiving. Examples are highlighted under the sub-header ’Ethical considerations, including potential harms to the data subjects’ found in Table 1.</p>

<p>All applications for <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> data will be expected to show that the proposed analysis is worthwhile and will have beneficial effects that outweigh the risks posed by the project.</p>

<p>NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC) Favourable Opinion must be demonstrated for all processing of personally identifiable patient data. Access to de-personalised data will be subject to evidence of institutional ethical oversight, however, in circumstances where the proposed processing is deemed high risk, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> reserves the right to require review by the Health Research Authority (HRA).</p>

<h3>Version control</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will compare the versioning of each document it receives with those considered by any other approval body. This helps protect against unauthorised changes outside of the approved NHS REC Favourable Opinion, institutional REC or where applicable, any exemption to the common law duty of confidentiality. It also supports the handling of future amendments, when superseded or obsolete documents need to be updated.</p>

<p>It is strongly advised that you have in place clear standard operating procedures (SOPs) that govern your document control practices and that all documents shared with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> are appropriately versioned.</p>
