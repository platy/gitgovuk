<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: 16 to 19 Bursary Fund assessment processes </h2>

<p>This is a reminder for institutions to ensure they comply with the funding rules in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2021-to-2022-academic-year" class="govuk-link">16 to 19 Bursary Fund guide 2021 to 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Both types of bursary funding are designed to help students overcome the individual financial barriers to participation they face.</p>

<p>Institutions must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure funds go to those who genuinely need them and reflect the needs each student has, which will vary depending on individual circumstances</li>
  <li>not award any student a fixed or flat rate of funding without an assessment of the actual needs they have</li>
  <li>make sure their application forms and bursary policies avoid any terminology such as ‘guaranteed bursary’ or any wording that implies a student will get a fixed amount of funding.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/973806/16_to_19_Bursary_summary_of_key_funding_rules.pdf" class="govuk-link">guide includes a summary of key points</a> for institutions to consider when administering the bursary fund.</p>
