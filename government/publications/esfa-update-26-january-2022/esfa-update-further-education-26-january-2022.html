<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: variation to the ESFA Apprenticeship Agreement for Training Providers (for the provision of apprenticeship training)</h2>

<p>A variation to the Apprenticeship Agreement for Training Providers will be published w/c 24 January 2022.</p>

<p>A number of changes have been made to the existing agreement, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an extension of the Agreement for a period of three years from 31 July 2022;</li>
  <li>an Accountability Framework for Training Providers has been introduced; and</li>
  <li>a new schedule relating to sub-contracting requirements has also been added.</li>
</ul>

<p>Training providers will receive a notification that the variation to the agreement is ready to sign. You will then be able to sign the variation to the agreement through the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/">Manage Your Education and Skills Funding service</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Action: 16 to 19 Bursary Fund assessment processes </h2>

<p>This is a reminder for institutions to ensure they comply with the funding rules in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2021-to-2022-academic-year">16 to 19 Bursary Fund guide 2021 to 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Both types of bursary funding are designed to help students overcome the individual financial barriers to participation they face.</p>

<p>Institutions must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure funds go to those who genuinely need them and reflect the needs each student has, which will vary depending on individual circumstances</li>
  <li>not award any student a fixed or flat rate of funding without an assessment of the actual needs they have</li>
  <li>make sure their application forms and bursary policies avoid any terminology such as ‘guaranteed bursary’ or any wording that implies a student will get a fixed amount of funding.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/973806/16_to_19_Bursary_summary_of_key_funding_rules.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guide includes a summary of key points</a> for institutions to consider when administering the bursary fund.</p>

<p>We <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1033711/Interim_Measures_Guidance_External.pdf">notified the sector in September 2021</a> that providers are required to share a minimum level of due diligence with the agency. Providers are in scope if they are using a subcontractor who receives an aggregate value of £100,000 or more of ESFA funding but does not have a direct relationship with the agency, in the 2021 to 2022 academic year (1 August 2021 to 31 July 2022).

<p>You should review the published outcomes as soon as possible, to ensure the numbers reflect those expected. If an institution is not listed, this means no change was notified for that institution and the published 2021 to 2022 place numbers will be used as the basis of the 2022 to 2023 allocation. </p>

<p>Local authorities, academies or further education institutions can contact ESFA to query their 2022 to 2023 place numbers between 19 January 2022 and 4 February 2022.  </p>

<p>The Department for Education (DfE) recently announced continuation of FE ITE bursaries for the 2022 to 2023 academic year for skilled non-graduates as well as graduates who are training pre-service to teach high-priority shortage subjects in the FE sector in England. </p>

<p>The pre-service bursaries are a tax-free cash incentive paid to individual trainees while completing a specified teaching qualification (Level 5 or above).  </p>

<p>From academic year 2022 to 2023, in-service grants, previously offered alongside pre-service bursaries, will no longer be available under this scheme. Any information regarding support for in-service FE teacher training will be published on GOV.UK in due course. </p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: availability and review of provisional qualification achievement rates (QAR) 2020 to 2021 and data query window 31 January 2022</h2>

<p>Provisional QAR for 2020 to 2021 was released last week and providers can now access their data through <a href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">View Your Education Data portal</a>. Providers have until 5pm on Monday 31 January 2022 to inform us of any concerns about how we have implemented our published methodology. You cannot request fixes or adjustments to your 2020 to 2021 Individualised Learner Record (ILR) data. </p>

<p>If you have any queries with the provisional data, please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualification-achievement-rates-qar-2020-to-2021">complete and submit the data query form</a> and submit this via our <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen">online enquiry form</a>, selecting the QAR query type, and ask us to assign your query to ‘ESFA Business Operations QAR’.</p>

<p>On the Education and Training (E&amp;T) dashboard, many providers are reporting not seeing the data they anticipated. This could be due to where a substantial proportion of E&amp;T delivery fall under the ‘Teacher Assessed Grade’ rule noted in both the QAR Business rules and E&amp;T Technical Specification which means they are out of scope for QAR.</p>

<p>As alerted previously in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-update-9-june-2021/esfa-update-further-education-9-june-2021">ESFA update</a>, the spreadsheet within <a href="https://analytics.ofqual.gov.uk/apps/AllQualifications/summer2021tool/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Ofqual’s Summer 2021 Qualification Explainer Tool</a> confirms which categories apply for normal assessment/teacher assessed grades. This is in recognition of the ongoing impact of the pandemic and published guidance on the awarding of qualifications for summer 2021. Qualifications confirmed as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>subject to normal assessment (category A) will be included in institution level QARs and shared with Ofsted and providers.</li>
  <li>teacher assessed (category B1) and those which may be subject to a teacher assessed grade (if they cannot safely access an assessment) (category B2 and Access to HE courses regulated by QAA) will not be included in institution level QARs or shared with Ofsted or providers for 2020 to 2021.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alongside this release of data, following feedback from providers, we have also provided clarification on a number of points across the business rules and technical specifications. This includes greater detail on the derivation of the Achievement Year for Apprenticeship Standards (data item ‘P_Achyr’) in the contents table of the QAR dataset. These documents provide technical information about how we produce the QAR dataset and should be read alongside the business rules, which explain the methodology for calculating QARs for 2020 to 2021 and can be accessed on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualification-achievement-rates-qar-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">qualification achievement rates 2020 to 2021</a>.</p>

<p>R05 data is now available in the <a href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/account/selector?ReturnUrl=%2Fwelcome" class="govuk-link" rel="external">post-16 monitoring dashboard</a>.
