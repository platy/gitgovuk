<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.	This document sets out the framework for inspecting local authority childrenâ€™s services (<abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr>). We first published this framework in November 2017. We last updated this framework in December 2021. There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services-from-2018/summary-of-framework-changes">summary of the changes</a> available.</p>

<p>2.	This framework and guidance are to help inspectors to be consistent in inspections while being flexible enough to respond to the individual circumstances of each local authority. We will periodically review and amend this framework and evaluation criteria.</p>

<p>3.	These inspections focus on the effectiveness of local authority services and arrangements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to help and protect children</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the experiences and progress of children in care wherever they live, including those children who return home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the arrangements for permanence for children who are looked after, including adoption</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the experiences and progress of care leavers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We also evaluate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the effectiveness of leaders and managers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the impact they have on the lives of children and young people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the quality of professional practice</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4.	In law, the term â€˜children in careâ€™ refers to those who are subject to a care order. However, in this framework and the associated inspection reports we have chosen to use â€˜children in careâ€™ to refer to all looked after children and young people because it is what this group have told us they prefer.</p>

<h2>Inspection principles</h2>

<p>5.	Ofstedâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ofsted-strategy-2017-to-2022">corporate strategy</a> outlines how we will carry out inspection and regulation that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>intelligent: all of our work will be evidence-led, and we will work to ensure that our evaluation tools and frameworks are valid and reliable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>responsible: our frameworks will be fair. We will seek to reduce inspection burdens and make our expectations and findings clear</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>focused: we will target our time and resources where they can lead directly to improvement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>6.	Our approach to <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> is further underpinned by 3 principles that apply to all social care inspections. Inspection should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>focus on the things that matter most to childrenâ€™s lives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be consistent in our expectations of providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prioritise our work where improvement is needed most</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Whole-system approach</h2>

<p>7.	<abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> is a system of inspection. Under this system, we use the intelligence and information we have to inform decisions about how best to inspect each local authority. Local area special educational needs and disability (<abbr title="Local area special educational needs and disability">area SEND</abbr>) inspections are inspections of the local area that sit outside <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr>, but we will take them into account when we schedule inspections.</p>

<p>8.	The <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> system includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>local authorities sharing an annual self-evaluation of the quality and impact of social work practice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an annual engagement meeting between our regional representatives and the local authority to review the self-evaluation and to reflect on what is happening in the local authority and inform how they would engage with each other in future</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>our local authority intelligence system (<abbr title="local authority intelligence system">LAIS</abbr>) (which brings data and information into a single record)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>focused visits that look at a specific area of service or cohort of children</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>standard and short inspections where we make judgements using our 4-point scale</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/joint-inspections-of-arrangements-and-services-for-children-in-need-of-help-and-protection">joint targeted area inspections (<abbr title="joint targeted area inspections">JTAI</abbr>)</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We have described each part of this system in more detail later in the framework.</p>

<h2>Applying a proportionate and risk-based approach to inspection</h2>

<p>9.	There is no fixed cycle or end date for the <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> programme. We use the intelligence and information we have to inform decisions about how best to inspect each local authority.</p>

<p>10.	There will be times when concerns arise about a local authority. The regional director will decide whether to carry out an inspection (standard or short inspection), at which we make a graded judgement, or whether a focused visit would be more appropriate. In most cases, if the next standard or short inspection is not due, we will carry out a focused visit. This gives the local authority and us the opportunity to identify what is going well and what needs to improve before the next judgement inspection.</p>

<p>11.	After a focused visit, we will not usually follow up with an urgent inspection. We will publish the focused visit letter setting out the areas that the local authority needs to address. We will review the progress in these areas through the local authorityâ€™s self-evaluation and the annual engagement meeting until the next judgement inspection happens. This approach aims to support improvement, while still holding the local authority childrenâ€™s services to account in meeting their legal responsibilities to children in need of help, protection and care.</p>

<p>12.	Within the <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> system, deciding which type of inspection to deploy in which local authority is a complex and dynamic process. Figure 1 sets out this process.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Steps for agreeing the <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> inspection programme</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="This is a flow chart that shows the steps we follow to decide which local authorities we will inspect and visit under the ILACS framework." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/103272/ILACSfigure1.PNG"></div></figure>

<h3>Proportionate timing of inspection</h3>

<p>13.	We will inspect local authorities based on the intelligence we have about them and their most recent inspection judgement. Standard and short inspections will usually happen once every 3 years, plus or minus 6 months. Figure 2 summarises the different inspection pathways we use depending on the most recent inspection judgement.</p>

<h4>Figure 2. The proportionate inspection pathways for <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr>
</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="This diagram shows how the inspections and visits we carry out differ based on the outcome of a local authority's most recent inspection. This is also outlined in the Pathway 1, Pathway 2 and Pathway 3 sections of this guidance." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/103273/ILACSfigure2.PNG"></div></figure>

<p>14.	Inspections will not usually begin over the Christmas and New Year period. The only activities that might take place in August are planned monitoring visits and focused visits by agreement, or if concerns arise.</p>

<p>15.	Each <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about#who-we-are">Ofsted region</a> will decide when to inspect each local authority and whether to carry out a standard inspection, short inspection or focused visit. The national programme will be agreed by the national director, social care.</p>

<h4>Deferring an inspection</h4>

<p>16.	The local authority may request a deferral of an inspection or visit. We will decide whether a deferral should be granted in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/deferring-ofsted-inspections">our policy</a>.</p>

<h4>Pathway 1: local authorities judged good or outstanding at their most recent inspection</h4>

<p>17.	Local authorities judged to be good or outstanding at their most recent inspection will usually receive a short inspection. The short inspection will usually take place about 3 years after the previous inspection. If that short inspection results in the local authority being judged requires improvement to be good, it will move to pathway 2.</p>

<p>18.	In between inspections, the local authority will usually receive one focused visit or a <abbr title="joint targeted area inspections">JTAI</abbr>.</p>

<p>19.	If we hold intelligence suggesting a significant deterioration in performance before a short inspection, including any areas of concern identified at a focused visit, we may decide to carry out a standard inspection.</p>

<h4>Pathway 2: local authorities judged requires improvement to be good at their most recent inspection</h4>

<p>20.	Local authorities judged to require improvement to be good at their most recent inspection will receive a standard inspection. The standard inspection will usually take place about 3 years after the previous inspection. If that standard inspection results in the local authority being judged good or outstanding, it will follow the process described in pathway 1.</p>

<p>21.	In between inspections, the local authority will receive up to 2 focused visits. A focused visit may be replaced by a <abbr title="joint targeted area inspections">JTAI</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Pathway 3: local authorities judged inadequate at their most recent inspection</h4>

<p>22.	Local authorities judged inadequate at their most recent inspection will receive monitoring visits followed by a re-inspection. We will usually carry out between 4 and 6 monitoring visits before the re-inspection. We will re-inspect an inadequate local authority using a standard inspection.</p>

<p>23.	If, at the re-inspection, its overall effectiveness grade improves, that local authority will then enter the relevant pathway. Should it remain inadequate, it will remain in pathway 3.</p>

<p>The table below summarises the range of events that will exist under the <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> system by the Ofsted inspection grade.</p>

<abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> and other joint inspections</h4>

<p>24.	We will continue to carry out both JTAIs and <abbr title="Local area special educational needs and disability">area SEND</abbr> inspections. We will continue to coordinate the scheduling of inspections of <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> and the <abbr title="Local area special educational needs and disability">area SEND</abbr> programme to avoid any clash of timing and to minimise the burden on local authorities. The scope of <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> does not replicate that of the <abbr title="Local area special educational needs and disability">area SEND</abbr> inspection.</p>

<p>25.	The 4 inspectorates (Ofsted, Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>), Her Majestyâ€™s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services">HMICFRS</abbr>) and Her Majestyâ€™s Inspectorate of Probation (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation">HMIP</abbr>)) remain committed to carrying out up to 10 JTAIs each calendar year. The scheduling of the JTAIs is a complex task. We try to avoid any unnecessary clash of timing and minimise the burden on each of the inspected bodies.</p>

<h2>Activity outside of inspection</h2>

<h3>Local authority self-evaluation of social work practice</h3>

<p>26.	Each year, we will ask local authorities to share a self-evaluation of social work practice with us and to meet with our regional representatives to discuss it. This part of the framework is voluntary but it plays an important role in our understanding of local authorities and how they work. We have developed this section in conjunction with the Association of Directors of Childrenâ€™s Services (<abbr title="Association of Directors of Childrenâ€™s Services">ADCS</abbr>), The Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (<abbr title="The Society of Local Authority Chief Executives">SOLACE</abbr>) and the Local Government Association (<abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr>).</p>

<p>27.	Engagement between us and local authorities outside of inspection will help us to apply the risk-based and proportionate approach that <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> offers. It will help us to carry out our inspections and visits more efficiently. It will also help ensure that inspection frequency and arrangements are appropriate to that local authority.</p>

<p>28.	We ask local authorities to share an annual self-evaluation of social work practice with us. This will help us to see whether leaders and managers have a grip on practice and are taking suitable action.</p>

<p>29.	We will not ask local authorities judged inadequate to share a self-evaluation until the monitoring visits in the first 12 months are complete. Engagement (outside the monitoring visits) will focus on the quality of the local authority action planning.</p>

<p>30.	The self-evaluation should draw on existing documentation and activity. It should reflect the local authorityâ€™s business as usual in order to avoid additional burden. We do not expect local authorities to carry out additional work to inform the self-evaluation.</p>

<p>31.	Inspectors look at a local authorityâ€™s most recent self-evaluation when preparing for the next inspection or focused visit.</p>

<p>32.	The self-evaluation should answer 3 questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What do you know about the quality and impact of social work practice in your local authority?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you know it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are your plans for the next 12 months to maintain or improve practice?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>33.	There is no set time each year that we ask local authorities to share a self-evaluation. The timing should take into account any planned regional peer review and challenge activity. To be most effective, this should happen before the planned annual engagement meeting, but there is no expectation that local authorities schedule their work around our timelines. Ideally, we ask the local authority to share this early enough for us to analyse its content, but not so far in advance that the information is out of date by the time of the annual engagement meeting.</p>

<p>34.	When there is a significant gap between sharing the self-evaluation and the annual engagement meeting, it is helpful if the local authority can refresh the self-evaluation with the most up-to-date data and information. A regional representative will contact the director of childrenâ€™s services (<abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr>) to agree appropriate arrangements.</p>

<p>35.	There is no prescribed format or content for the self-evaluation. Local authorities should apply the following principles. The self-evaluation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>should answer the <a class="govuk-link" href="#3-questions">3 questions outlined above</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>should set out the main themes and learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>should make sense as a standalone document (appendices can be included, but should be kept to a minimum)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>may be an existing document or combination of documents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>should be succinct, focused and evaluative; overly long self-evaluations are unlikely to be helpful to the local authority or inspectors</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>36.	It is for the local authority to determine which documentation and information to draw on for the self-evaluation. The following list offers some suggested sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an overview of how the local authority evaluates the impact of social work practice with children and families</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high-level performance reports that give the most recent position of the local authority case audit plans</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>case audit summaries of learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>outcome of multi-agency section 11 audit work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>recent learning about frontline social work practice, for example from complaints or serious case and management reviews</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>feedback from children and families</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>37.	If the self-evaluation identifies weaknesses in practice and the local authority has credible plans to take clear, appropriate and effective action in response, we will treat this as effective leadership rather than an automatic trigger for an inspection or focused visit. Our regional representatives will discuss these issues with the local authority at the annual engagement meeting.</p>

<h3>Annual engagement meeting</h3>

<p>38.	This meeting may be solely about childrenâ€™s social care or part of a broader meeting covering education and early years. This will be determined by the region.</p>

<p>39.	The meeting should be carried out in a spirit of positive transparency and benefit everyone involved.</p>

<p>40.	The meeting is not an opportunity for inspectors to evaluate direct social work practice with children and families. The intelligence gathered from the meeting will inform any plans for future inspection activity and focused visits.</p>

<p>41.	The meeting should cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the content of the self-evaluation â€“ what leaders know about practice and outcomes, and the evidence that supports this</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the impact of the self-evaluation â€“ what leaders are doing to address weaknesses in practice and maintain or improve good practice, including evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of their actions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>actions taken in response to previous inspections</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the local authorityâ€™s current financial, political and professional practice context</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the broader issues that affect delivery of childrenâ€™s social care services, for example schools and early years provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the possible scope of a focused visit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the approximate timing of the next self-evaluation and annual engagement meeting</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>42.	The annual engagement meeting will be planned for a mutually convenient time but does not need to be at exactly the same point in time every year. Its timing will usually be linked to when the local authority shares its self-evaluation so that the information is up to date.</p>

<p>43.	The timing of the annual engagement meeting should take into account planned peer review arrangements and activity relating to a regional improvement alliance.</p>

<p>44.	A regional representative from Ofsted will chair the meeting. The meeting may focus on other local authority duties, for example in relation to school inspection, but it should include the appropriate personnel and allow sufficient time for childrenâ€™s social care issues to be explored.</p>

<p>45.	The <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and our regional director and/or social care Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector (<abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr>) or Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector (<abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr>) will attend. The <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> has professional responsibility for childrenâ€™s services, including operational matters, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/directors-of-childrens-services-roles-and-responsibilities">â€˜Statutory guidance on the roles and responsibilities of the Director of Childrenâ€™s Services and the Lead Member for Childrenâ€™s Servicesâ€™</a>. It is for the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> to determine who else attends from the local authority, for example the assistant director responsible for social care or the practice leader. For the meeting to be effective, those attending the meeting should have a clear purpose for being there. The regional <abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr> and the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> will agree the agenda in advance of the meeting.</p>

<p>46.	We will write to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> within a month of the meeting. The letter will not be published nor contain any judgements about practice. It will set out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the date of the meeting and who attended</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a factual summary of the agenda items discussed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the possible scope of a future focused visit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the approximate timing of the following yearâ€™s self-evaluation and annual engagement meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any next steps</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>47.	What the inspections will cover: the children whose experiences inspectors will evaluate during inspections and visits.</p>

<p>48.	In standard and short inspections, inspectors will evaluate the experiences of the children and young people listed below. On focused and monitoring visits, they will evaluate the experiences of one or more of these groups of children and young people:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>who are at risk of harm (but who have not yet reached the â€˜significant harmâ€™ threshold) and for whom a preventative service would provide the help that they and their family need to reduce the likelihood of that risk of harm escalating and to reduce the need for statutory intervention (these children may be known by any person with a duty under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/31/section/11" rel="external">Children Act 2004</a>; the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/21/section/40/enacted" rel="external">Childcare Act 2006</a>; section 175 or any regulations made under 157 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/contents" rel="external">Education Act 2002</a>; the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/11/section/55" rel="external">Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009</a>, a member of the local safeguarding partnership; or a person associated with a commissioned service, including local voluntary services)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who have been referred to the local authority, including those for whom urgent action has to be taken to protect them; those subject to further assessment (including children subject to private fostering arrangements) and those subject to child protection enquiries</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who become the subject of a multi-agency child protection plan that sets out the help they and their families will receive to keep them safe and promote their welfare</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who have been assessed as no longer needing a child protection plan, but who may need continuing help and support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who are receiving (or whose families are receiving) social work services because there are significant levels of concern about their safety and welfare, but these have not reached the significant harm threshold or the threshold to become looked after</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who are missing from education or are being offered alternative provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>looked after either by being accommodated under section 20 or by being placed â€˜in careâ€™ during or as a result of proceedings under section 31 of the Children Act 1989 and those accommodated through the police powers of protection or emergency protection orders (including children and young people who are detained, unaccompanied child migrants or asylum seekers)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>aged 16 or 17 who are preparing to leave care and meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/schedule/2#commentary-c15178061" rel="external">definition of â€˜eligibleâ€™</a>; those aged 16 or 17 who have left care and are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/23A" rel="external">â€˜relevantâ€™</a>; young people aged 18 and above and are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/23C" rel="external">â€˜former relevantâ€™</a>; and young people aged 18 to 25 who qualify as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/23C" rel="external">â€˜former relevant children pursuing further education or trainingâ€™</a>, including children in houses of multiple occupation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who have left care to return home or who are living with families under a special guardianship order, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/6/section/12/enacted" rel="external">child arrangements order</a> or an adoption order</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>49.	In addition, inspectors will evaluate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the impact of leaders and managers on social work practice with children and families</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the local authorityâ€™s own evaluation of the quality and impact of its performance and practice is accurate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Standard and short inspections</h2>

<p>50.	<abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> carry out these inspections under section 136(2) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 (<abbr title="Education and Inspections Act 2006">EIA</abbr>). Her Majestyâ€™s Chief Inspector (HMCI) has the power to carry out <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> functions as listed in section 135 of the <abbr title="Education and Inspections Act 2006">EIA</abbr>.</p>

<p>51.	Inspections will focus on social workersâ€™ direct practice with families by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>scrutinising and discussing the sample of childrenâ€™s cases that reflect the scope of the inspection alongside discussions with practitioners working with the child or young person â€“ this will include social workers and may also include other professionals and providers; these discussions do not have to be in person and in some cases will be by telephone during the notice period when practicable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when possible and appropriate, having meetings with children, young people, care leavers, parents and carers, foster carers and adopters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>shadowing staff in their day-to-day work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when possible and appropriate, observing practice in multi-agency/single-agency meetings or, more likely, parts of meetings that relate to the protection of children and young people and in reviews for children in care; inspectors will take opportunities for observing practice as they arise</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Standard inspection arrangements</h3>

<p>52.	On a standard inspection, inspectors will gather evidence across the <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> scope.</p>

<p>53.	We usually give 5 working daysâ€™ notice of the inspection.</p>

<p>54.	The inspection team for a standard inspection will usually be 4 social care inspectors, but for some smaller local authorities, we may send fewer inspectors. In addition, a social care regulatory inspector and an education inspector (usually a schools <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr>) will carry out 2 days of fieldwork.</p>

<p>55.	Inspection teams may include an additional inspector who will be shadowing the work of their colleagues. Any activity they carry out will be for their training and development or to evaluate the inspection framework and methodology. They will not carry out any inspection work independently or gather evidence that will inform the inspection judgements.</p>

<p>A short inspection covers the <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> scope, which is the same as a standard inspection. Judgements are made against the same grade descriptors. However, it is not a 2-week inspection delivered in 1 week. Inspectors preparing for a short inspection will start with a mindset that â€˜this is a good local authorityâ€™. This assumption is based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the previous inspection judgement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a focused visit or <abbr title="joint targeted area inspections">JTAI</abbr> that has reinforced earlier findings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the quality of self-evaluation over the preceding years, which will have been explored during the annual engagement meetings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information held on the <abbr title="local authority intelligence system">LAIS</abbr> that supports a view of continuing strong performance</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In a short inspection, inspectors will seek to answer 3 questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Has the quality and impact of practice been maintained?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there any areas where the quality and impact of practice have improved?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there any areas where the quality and impact of practice have deteriorated?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>60.	This approach enables the lead inspector to prioritise gathering primary evidence on the areas that need the greatest focus. It also enables the team to test the validity of the most recent self-evaluation by testing samples of casework. This will help inspectors to quickly close down lines of enquiry.</p>

<p>61.	Evaluating individual childrenâ€™s records that have already been audited by the local authority is another effective way to answer the 3 questions set out above. If the local authorityâ€™s evaluation of practice is in line with our evaluation, this will usually reduce the need for further primary evidence in that part of the inspection.</p>

<h3>Further guidance on short and standard inspections</h3>

<h4>Inspecting against the scope and making judgements based on the evaluation criteria</h4>

<p>62.	Inspectors inspect across the areas included in the scope of the inspection and record their evidence under the 17 headings in the evaluation criteria. Each heading has several criteria that describe the features of a good service or good experiences and progress for children. Inspectors do not have to gather evidence against each individual criterion. The evaluation criteria help the inspection team make the correct judgement on the 4-point grading scheme.</p>

<h4>The order of evidence-gathering in standard and short inspections</h4>

<p>63.	In previous inspection programmes, inspections have followed â€˜the journey of the childâ€™ â€“ starting with the â€˜front doorâ€™, then help and protection, children in care and, finally, leaving care. For standard and short inspections, this may not always be the best approach.</p>

<p>64.	The factors that influence where the evidence-gathering will start are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the geography of the local authority â€“ for example, we may not always start in the main centre of population</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>previous known strengths and weaknesses (including the findings from a focused visit or the most recent annual engagement meeting); the lead may wish to inspect the stronger areas first to swiftly close down areas of enquiry, so that the inspection can focus on whether performance has improved in a previously weaker area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>structure of services â€“ where teams are located and across how many offices</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>logistical issues â€“ where inspectors need to go at the start of the work to sort practical issues (for example, to pick up security passes or gain access to IT systems)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>65.	An inspection might therefore start, for example, in the children in care service. In these circumstances, inspectors may gain helpful insights into the help and protection services through evaluating the experiences of those children who have recently become looked after.</p>

<p>66.	In all cases, it will be for the lead inspector, with the quality assurance manager, to determine the approach. The lead inspector will provide the rationale to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Off-site evaluation</h4>

<p>67.	Off-site evaluation and planning are important parts of all inspections. All inspectors will have access to <abbr title="local authority intelligence system">LAIS</abbr>. For standard and short inspections, the Ofsted analytical officer will coordinate the data, provide a pre-inspection analysis (<abbr title="pre-inspection analysis">PIA</abbr>) and discuss priorities for the inspection with the inspection team. The analytical officer will ensure that the <abbr title="pre-inspection analysis">PIA</abbr> contains the information the lead inspector and team will need to inform the inspection planning and on-site activity. This will summarise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a contextual overview of the local authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>findings from relevant inspections (including previous focused visits) and regulatory activity, including some inspections carried out by other inspectorates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regional intelligence about the effectiveness and impact of the virtual school on the educational progress of children in care</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>findings from published serious case reviews</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analysis of published statistics and national comparisons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence from whistleblowing or complaints to Ofsted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regional intelligence, including events of public concern, such as high-profile court cases or media issues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>search and review of recently published documentation, such as the independent reviewing officer annual report</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>68.	The <abbr title="pre-inspection analysis">PIA</abbr> will include the regional <abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr>â€™s analysis of the most recent self-evaluation and annual engagement meeting with the local authority.</p>

<p>69.	<a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-A">Annex A</a> lists the information that we request from the local authority at the start of the inspection.</p>

The lead inspector will have time allocated, before fieldwork begins, to review the <abbr title="pre-inspection analysis">PIA</abbr>, information on <abbr title="local authority intelligence system">LAIS</abbr>, the information from Annex A and the views of children, young people, parents and staff expressed through the social care annual point-in-time surveys run by Ofsted. The lead inspector will use this information to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that the fieldwork is properly focused and used to the best effect in collecting first-hand evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide which site(s) within the local authority to visit during inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify initial lines of enquiry for the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>allocate information to the inspection team for them to analyse</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>71.	Only initial lines of enquiry will be generated at this point. These will be few in number and themed around priority areas. The lead inspector will share verbally the lines of enquiry with the local authority at the beginning of the inspection. The lead inspector will explain to the local authority how these lines will be pursued and what, if any, specific information is required from them as a result.</p>

<p>72.	We do not expect the local authority to produce documents and data in response to these initial lines of enquiry unless specifically requested by the lead inspector. During the inspection, additional requests for further documentation will be kept to an absolute minimum and agreed by the lead inspector.</p>

<p>73.	All inspectors have time allocated to prepare for the inspection. All team inspectors must read the <abbr title="pre-inspection analysis">PIA</abbr> and familiarise themselves with the relevant material and profile of the local authority area before arriving on site. The lead inspector is likely to identify other documents for inspectors to read before the on-site activity.</p>

<p>74.	Inspectors must review the information in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-A">Annex A</a> provided by the local authority. The lead inspector may decide that some documents must be read by all team members; others will be read by only one inspector and then summarised for the team. Some documents may be used as reference material and read only when required. The lead inspector will ensure that key points of analysis are collated and disseminated to the inspection team to inform the inspection.</p>

<h4>Notifying the local authority and requesting information</h4>

<p>75.	The lead inspector will ensure that the local authority (usually the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr>) is notified by telephone of the inspection by 9.30am 5 working days before the fieldwork starts. If notification is due on a bank holiday, we will move it to the previous working day.</p>

<p>76.	As part of this telephone call, the lead inspector will also arrange to meet with the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> or the most senior manager available at the earliest opportunity when they arrive on site.</p>

<p>77.	Immediately following the telephone call to the local authority, the lead inspector will email the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> to confirm the start of the inspection and ask them to share the information set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-A">Annex A</a>. Annex A lists information we think the local authority will already maintain to inform its oversight and management of its service. On this basis, we do not consider that the information we request is unreasonable. The lead inspector will offer the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> an opportunity for a conversation later the same day to give the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> time to bring together the relevant staff. This conversation will usually be by phone, but the lead inspector may meet with the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> in person if it is practical to do so.</p>

<p>78.	If the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> is not available, the lead inspector will speak with or email the most senior manager available and ask them to notify the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> or, if the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> is not available, the chief executive. The non-availability of the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> or a senior manager will not delay the start of the inspection.</p>

<p>79.	The lead inspector will ask the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> to identify a link support person for the inspection. It is important that the link person has ready access to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and senior leaders and sufficient authority to be able to respond to the lead inspectorâ€™s requests.</p>

<p>80.	In the week before inspectors are on site, the lead inspector will work with the link person and/or <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> to prepare for the on-site activity. They will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>answer questions about the scope of the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>outline the format and methodology of the inspection, which will focus almost exclusively on practice with children and families. Meetings will be kept to a minimum, will only look into matters arising from case evaluations and will only take place at the lead inspectorâ€™s request</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discuss how inspectors will directly consider the experiences of children, young people and families as an integral part of the inspection. When opportunities arise during the fieldwork to speak with or observe contact with children, young people and families, the local social work staff will be asked to obtain their agreement to observe any meetings and speak to inspectors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agree practical arrangements, such as work space, access to files and information technology systems, and any staff support required to access these files and systems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agree arrangements to meet with the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and his/her senior leadership team for regular keep-in-touch meetings and the feedback meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide contact details for the lead inspector, inspection team members and the allocated <abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr> responsible for quality assurance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide information for affected/relevant staff, such as copies of the summary of the framework explaining the purpose of the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gain an understanding of how the local area services are structured, as well as any issues specific to the site(s) being inspected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide an opportunity for the local authority representatives to explain the local authorityâ€™s local context, key strengths and challenges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clarify whether there are any serious incidents that are awaiting notification or have been notified to Ofsted recently; this should include significant and current investigations (including police investigations), national or local learning reviews and local issues of high media interest</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>81.	During the week before inspectors arrive on site, an Ofsted analytical officer will ask to speak with an analyst at the local authority. This is to discuss issues about data quality, performance documents, the performance reporting process and the types and breadth of management information produced.</p>

<p>The lead inspector may also ask for a phone conversation with the lead member for childrenâ€™s services and/or the local authority chief executive.</p>

<h4>Fieldwork</h4>

<p>82.	The lead inspector and 3 inspectors will arrive on site on Monday afternoon. All inspectors will show their inspector identity badges. They do not need to carry copies of their Disclosure and Barring Service checks.</p>

<p>83.	When the lead inspector arrives on site, they will meet with the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and/or the most senior manager available. At this meeting, the lead inspector will review the matters and arrangements discussed in the previous week. The lead inspector will answer any remaining questions and ask local leaders to confirm that the practical arrangements inspectors requested are in place.</p>

<p>84.	When planning the on-site aspect of inspection, the lead inspector should ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>support is provided to facilitate communication with children, young people, care leavers, carers and parents who require additional support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the plan allows realistic travel time for inspectors between activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the plan allows sufficient time and flexibility for inspectors to pursue lines of enquiry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff are given the opportunity to provide their evidence separately to those who manage them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the need for any meeting arises as a result of evaluating childrenâ€™s experiences, the lead inspector asks for this as soon as the need becomes apparent; these meetings may be held by telephone as well as in person</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inspectors have time to reflect on, record and analyse evidence, individually and as a team</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>85.	The schedule for the inspection will develop throughout the inspection in response to issues emerging from evaluating children and young peopleâ€™s experiences. The lead inspector has overall responsibility for the schedule. On-site inspection activity will not normally continue after 6pm on any fieldwork day.</p>

<h4>Evaluating the effectiveness of the recruitment, assessment, training and support for foster and adoptive carers</h4>

<p>86.	During a standard or short inspection, the social care regulatory inspector will carry out two days of fieldwork. For a standard inspection, these days will usually be in the second week of fieldwork. Their focus will be on evaluating the effectiveness of the recruitment, assessment, training and support for foster and adoptive carers. They will evaluate the experiences of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>up to 4 foster carer households (including a recent carer assessment)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>up to 4 adopter households (including a recent carer assessment)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>87.	The lead inspector will ask the local authority to provide lists of foster carers and adopters at the start of the inspection (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-A">Annex A</a>). They will use these lists to select the households mentioned above and ask the local authority to share their most recent assessments of these foster carers and adopters. In addition, the social care regulatory inspector will speak to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>foster carers and adopters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff and managers who support foster and adoptive carers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the foster and adoption panel chairs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>88.	Conversations with carers and staff will usually be by telephone. The lead inspector will ask the local authority to help arrange these calls.</p>

<p>89.	Social care regulatory inspectors will evaluate the effectiveness of the recruitment, assessment and training of prospective foster and adoptive carers against the criteria in this framework that cover arrangements to secure timely permanence for all children.</p>

<p>90.	Local authorities may be part of a regional adoption agency (<abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>), where groups of local authorities and voluntary adoption agencies (<abbr title="voluntary adoption agencies">VAAs</abbr>) work together to improve their adoption services. In these circumstances, it remains the responsibility of each local authority to demonstrate how the arrangements comply with their statutory responsibilities and meet the needs of local children.</p>

<p>91.	If a local authority manages its own recruitment, assessment, training and support for adopters, inspectors will evaluate the effectiveness of these arrangements. If these are managed by an <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>, inspectors will look at the local authorityâ€™s arrangements to assure itself that the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> meets the needs of local children. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#Guidance_inspecting_LA_regionaladoptionagency">â€˜guidance for inspecting local authorities that are part of a regional adoption agencyâ€™</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Evaluating the educational progress of children in care and care leavers</h4>

<p>92.	Each standard and short inspection will include a schools <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr>. The schools <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> will carry out two days of fieldwork. For a standard inspection, these days will usually be in the second week of fieldwork.</p>

<p>93.	Working off site, they will evaluate data and information to provide analysis and lines of enquiry. They may contact the virtual school headteacher for a conversation by phone.</p>

<p>94.	During fieldwork, they will usually be on site and will interview the virtual school headteacher and, if appropriate, the local authority data personnel. They will evaluate some case studies of specific childrenâ€™s and care leaversâ€™ progress. They may contact specific schools by phone for further information.</p>

<p>95.	The schools <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> will analyse data and information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the educational progress of children in care and care leavers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>elective home-educated children</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children missing education</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Making judgements at standard or short inspections</h4>

<p>96.	Inspectors will make the following graded judgements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>overall effectiveness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the experiences and progress of children in need of help and protection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the experiences and progress of children in care and care leavers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the impact of leaders on social work practice with children and families</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>97.	Inspectors will make their graded judgements on a 4-point scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>outstanding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>requires improvement to be good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inadequate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>98.	Inspectors will evaluate the experiences of children, young people and families and the services they receive using the evaluation criteria as a benchmark. Inspectors will use professional judgement to determine the weight and significance of their findings. A judgement of good will be made if the inspection team concludes that the evidence overall sits most appropriately with a finding of good. This is what we describe as â€˜best fitâ€™.</p>

<p>99.	The overall effectiveness judgement is derived from findings in each of the 3 other judgement areas. Inspectors will use both evidence and their professional judgement to award the overall effectiveness grade.</p>

<p>100.	If inspectors find widespread or serious failure resulting in harm, continued risk of harm or failure to safeguard the welfare of children and young people in either the arrangements to protect or care for them, they will always give an overall effectiveness judgement of inadequate.</p>

<p>101.	It is possible for the impact of leaders to be judged good or requires improvement to be good even if any of the other judgements given is inadequate. Inspectors will make this judgement if leaders and managers show sufficient understanding of the widespread or serious failure and have taken effective action to prioritise, challenge and make sustained improvement to services. Inspectors will acknowledge this in the report. The overall judgement will be inadequate because childrenâ€™s experiences have the most weight in determining this judgement.</p>

<p>102.	If, at the end of fieldwork, the local authorityâ€™s childrenâ€™s services are judged inadequate, inspectors will follow the section in this guidance on monitoring inadequate local authorities.</p>

<h2>Focused visits</h2>

<p>103.	Focused visits evaluate an aspect of service, a theme or the experiences of a cohort of children. <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> carry out these visits under section 136(2) of the <abbr title="Education and Inspections Act 2006">EIA</abbr>. HMCI has the power to carry out <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> functions as listed in section 135 of the <abbr title="Education and Inspections Act 2006">EIA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Focused visit arrangements</h3>

<p>104.	We carry out focused visits between standard and short inspections. We usually give 5 working daysâ€™ notice of the visit.</p>

<p>105.	Usually, 2 inspectors will carry out 2 days of fieldwork contained within one week. Focused visits will include some or all of the same inspection activity as a standard or short inspection.</p>

<p>106.	The table below shows an example timeline for a focused visit that takes place on a Tuesday and Wednesday. If a focused visit takes place on other days of the week, we will move the other activities accordingly. The lead inspector will provide the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> with a specific timeline when they notify them of the visit.</p>

<h3>Focused visit topics</h3>

<p>107.	A focused visit will look at one or more aspects of the service, themes or cohorts of children. Inspections will use evaluation criteria from this framework or from our JTAIs.</p>

<p>108.	We will make the final decision about the focused visit topic to be covered. The decision will be based on one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if a specific area of service has been identified in a local authority as an example of good or outstanding practice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if a specific area of service has been identified as one that needs to improve or an area where themes, trends and issues are identified</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if an agreement between us and the local authority has been made that a specific focus will support that local authorityâ€™s improvement journey</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if we decide to carry out a short programme in a particular area of service, which will then lead to a thematic overview</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>109.	Each focused visit will cover part of the scope of standard and short inspections.</p>

<p>110.	The scope for individual focused visits can be narrowed within each topic. Leadership is a feature of all focused visits, principally through the lens of the impact of leaders on practice with children and families.</p>

<p>A list of topics and what they may include is set out below.</p>

<h4>Topic: the front door</h4>

<p>The front door is the service that receives contacts and referrals (single- or multi-agency), where decisions are made about:</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Findings at focused visits</h3>

<p>In each of these focused visits, inspectors will evaluate the effectiveness of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>performance management</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>management oversight</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supervision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quality assurance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>continuous professional development of the workforce</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>111.	Inspectors will not make graded judgements at the outcome of a focused visit. Nor will they indicate what the grade may have been if the visit had been a short or standard inspection. The outcome will be findings about strengths and areas for improvement, reported in a published letter.</p>

<p>112.	If inspectors find serious weaknesses, they will identify areas for priority action. An area for priority action is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an area of serious weakness that is placing children at risk of inadequate protection and significant harm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an unnecessary delay in identifying permanent solutions for children in care that results in their welfare not being safeguarded and promoted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a failure to keep in touch with care leavers, or provide them with support and services, that results in their welfare not being safeguarded and promoted</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>113.	Priority actions may result from particular or localised failings to protect or care for children or care leavers as well as from systemic failures or deficits. Some examples of areas for priority action are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>unrecognised or unallocated childrenâ€™s cases and/or significant delays in addressing child protection concerns or safeguarding the welfare of a child in care</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>systemic failure or significant weakness in practice that expose children or care leavers to significant risk of harm or fail to safeguard and promote their welfare</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a significant shortfall in capacity (frontline staffing numbers, qualifications and expertise) or deficit in management oversight and supervision that impacts adversely on delivery of help, protection or care to children or care leavers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>significant delays in the allocation or assessment of a large number of children in need cases that expose those children to potential and unquantified risk of harm</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>114.	Inspectors will use findings from focused visits when planning their next short or standard inspection. The evidence from a focused visit will not be used as primary evidence but may enable inspectors to target their evidence-gathering more effectively.</p>

<h2>Monitoring inadequate local authorities</h2>

<h3>Notifying the local authority of monitoring activity</h3>

<p>115.	If local authority childrenâ€™s services are judged inadequate, we will carry out monitoring activity that includes an action planning visit, monitoring visits and a re-inspection. The lead inspector will inform the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> of this at the feedback meeting for the inspection where the inadequate judgement is given.</p>

<p>116.	If a local authority is not prepared to agree the programme of monitoring visits, the Secretary of State for Education is likely to intervene and direct us to carry out these visits. Section 118(2) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 enables the Secretary of State for Education to direct the Chief Inspector to carry out an inspection of a local authorityâ€™s childrenâ€™s services.</p>

<p>117.	These activities may also take place if inspectors identify areas for priority action at a <abbr title="joint targeted area inspections">JTAI</abbr> that suggest that children are at risk of significant harm.</p>

<p>118.	Monitoring visits will focus on where improvement is needed the most. Inspectors will monitor and report on the local authorityâ€™s progress since the inspection. Inspectors will also check that performance in other areas has not declined since the inspection. If new concerns emerge, inspectors are likely to look at these on the monitoring visits.</p>

<p>The table below sets out an illustrative timetable for activities after an inadequate judgement. Each step is set out in more detail after the table.</p>

<h3>Action planning visit following an inadequate judgement</h3>

<p>119.	At the inspection feedback meeting, the lead inspector will ask the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> to arrange an action planning visit. The visit should take place about 30 working days after the local authority has received its inspection report.</p>

<p>The purpose of the visit is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>clarify the roles, responsibilities and activities of Ofsted and the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>help the local authority and its partners understand the inspection findings so that they can develop an action plan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>set out the implications for statutory partners, including those included in the local strategic safeguarding arrangements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discuss the draft action plan (if available)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the date of the first monitoring visit and establish the pattern of future monitoring activity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agree the focus of the first monitoring visit and (if possible) any subsequent monitoring visits</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>120.	Once the local authority has received its inspection report, the regional director will write to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> confirming the action planning visit. They will copy this letter to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> inspections and interventions team.</p>

<p>121.	A member of the inspection team, usually the lead inspector, and a <abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr> based in the local authorityâ€™s region will attend the visit. The role of the inspector and <abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr> is to help the local authority understand the findings from the inspection.</p>

<p>122.	The <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> will decide who else attends the action planning visit. The <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> may wish to discuss this with the lead inspector to ensure that attendees are appropriate to the findings in the report. The attendees will usually include senior managers of the local authority childrenâ€™s services and other key partners. The visit is concerned with the operational work of childrenâ€™s services professionals, so elected councillors will not normally attend.</p>

<p>123.	The <abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr> and lead inspector will discuss the agenda for the action planning visit with the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> before the event. The lead inspector will circulate the final agenda 5 working days before the visit.</p>

<p>124.	If the local authority has a draft of its action plan, the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> should share this with the lead inspector before the action planning visit. Early drafts of action plans are accepted as a â€˜work in progressâ€™ and will not be formally reviewed by the inspector.</p>

<p>125.	The lead inspector will record the outcome of the discussions. The <abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr> will send this to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr>, regional director and the national director, social care.</p>

<h3>Reviewing the local authority action plan</h3>

<p>126.	The lead inspector will review the action plan as soon as possible after receiving it. We are not responsible for â€˜signing offâ€™ or endorsing the action plan â€“ this is the responsibility of the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr>. Our role is to advise the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> about whether the action plan reflects the findings in the inspection report. Our regional director will write to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> confirming whether the action plan reflects the inspection findings.</p>

<p>127.	If the regional director thinks that the action plan does not respond to the findings set out in the inspection report, the lead inspector and/or <abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr> will discuss this with the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr>. If we and the local authority disagree on this matter, the regional director will write to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> setting out the area(s) of difference and the reasons.</p>

<p>128.	The lead inspector will share the letter they send to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> inspections and interventions unit. If we and the local authority differ in our view of the action plan, we will ask the Secretary of State for Education to consider what action (if any) they want the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to take.</p>

<p>129.	With the agreement of the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr>, the inspector and/or <abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr> may attend the local authorityâ€™s improvement board or other related meetings, for example with <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> officials. Our inspectors will attend as observers.</p>

<h3>Arrangements for monitoring visits</h3>

<p>130.	At the action planning visit, the <abbr title="Senior Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">SHMI</abbr>, lead inspector and <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> will agree arrangements for monitoring visits. The following guidelines will usually apply.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The first monitoring visit will be within 3 months of the submission deadline for the local authorityâ€™s action plan (which is about 6 months after publication of the inspection report).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will carry out 3 or 4 monitoring visits a year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will carry out between 4 and 6 monitoring visits before a re-inspection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The monitoring visits may not be equally spaced throughout the year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lead inspector will confirm the dates of the visits in advance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After we have completed these monitoring visits, we will either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>adopt the <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> process for self-evaluation and annual engagement before carrying out a re-inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider whether further monitoring would continue to add value in light of further plans for improvement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>131.	Usually, 2 inspectors will carry out each visit. Each visit will usually last for 2 days. Whenever possible, the same inspector will lead all the monitoring visits in the same local authority.</p>

<p>132.	The table below shows an example timeline for a monitoring visit that takes place on a Tuesday and Wednesday. If a monitoring visit takes place on other days of the week, we will move the other activities accordingly. The lead inspector will provide the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> with a specific timeline when they notify them of the visit.</p>

<h3>Before a monitoring visit</h3>

<p>133.	Two weeks before the visit, the lead inspector will ask the local authority to provide up-to-date child-level data. When providing the data, the local authority should indicate any cases that it has audited since the last monitoring visit.</p>

<p>134.	The inspector may ask the local authority to audit cases. Usually, the inspector will request information about up to 6 cases that have already been audited by the local authority. The local authority should share the completed audits at least 3 working days before the monitoring visit.</p>

<p>135.	We will only request information that is necessary to inform that monitoring visit. Requests will be based on the information in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-A">Annex A</a>.</p>

<p>136.	Inspectors will provide details for accessing a secure online site that the local authority can use to share this information.</p>

<h3>Fieldwork for monitoring visits</h3>

<p>137.	The lead inspector and <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> will agree a timetable for the on-site activity. On-site activity will usually consist of evaluating the experience of up to 6 children and young people. Inspectors will evaluate the cases audited by the local authority to see how effective the local authorityâ€™s auditing systems are.</p>

<p>138.	To triangulate their findings, inspectors will look at a sample of other cases. Any sampling activity will be proportionate to the practice that inspectors are evaluating. Inspectors will usually only sample cases from the previous 3 months.</p>

<p>139.	If the inspector identifies a cause for concern about the help, protection or care given to a child or children, they must bring it to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr>â€™s attention.</p>

<p>140.	Inspectors will record the evidence collected and their conclusions during each monitoring visit. Inspectors must record the case numbers of tracked and sampled cases so that these can be cross-referenced in future visits.</p>

<p>141.	At the end of each visit, the lead inspector will feed back a summary of the inspection findings to the local authority. It is for the local authority to decide who will attend this meeting. If the Secretary of State for Education has appointed a childrenâ€™s services commissioner, the local authority may invite the commissioner to attend the feedback as an observer. The Ofsted regional director and/or quality assurance manager may be present for the feedback. If the authority and inspectors disagree about the findings, this must be recorded.</p>

<p>142.	The lead inspector and the local authority will discuss the areas to consider at the next monitoring visit. If the date of the next monitoring visit is known, the lead inspector will confirm the milestones for the local authority to provide information and whether it will need to audit any cases.</p>

<h2>Roles and expectations of inspectors</h2>

<p>The things inspectors should do when working as part of an inspection team.</p>

<p>143.	In all inspections, all inspectors work collaboratively on all aspects of the scope to ensure that evidence is analysed as a group activity. In short and standard inspections, all inspectors usually gather evidence and evaluate the same cohort of childrenâ€™s experiences and progress at the same time. This is central to the effectiveness of a small team.</p>

<p>The lead inspector will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>coordinate the inspection between the team and with the local authority area leaders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>challenge, support and give advice to the team and quality assure the teamâ€™s work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develop lines of enquiry alongside the team</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prioritise inspection activity according to lines of enquiry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider any health and safety risks for individual inspectors</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The team inspector will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>work across judgement areas to provide challenge and scrutiny to the work of other inspectors throughout the inspection and in the final judgement meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>present succinct analysis of the main findings based on reliable evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quality assure their own and other inspectorsâ€™ work during inspections</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Inspection team meetings</h3>

<p>144.	Team meetings are important to ensure that the team covers the scope of the inspection. Inspectors should come together at the beginning, middle and end of each fieldwork day to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>share and triangulate their evidence and analysis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agree and record shared findings in their joint evidence record</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develop and close down lines of enquiry as a team</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>build up an evidence-based view of the quality and impact of practice and leadership within the local authority area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep the lead inspector fully aware of any key developments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enable the lead inspector to coordinate the inspection effectively</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>145.	The team will meet for an extended period on the penultimate day on site to discuss findings, agree provisional judgements and identify areas for improvement.</p>

<h2>Inspection methodology</h2>

<p>The things that inspectors will do to gather and evaluate evidence and report their findings.</p>

<h3>Inspection activity and gathering evidence</h3>

<p>146.	Almost all inspection evidence will be gathered by looking at individual children and young peopleâ€™s experiences. This will be largely through meeting with practitioners to understand the nature and impact of their work with children and families, including scrutinising electronic records.</p>

<p>147.	We take into account individual childrenâ€™s starting points and circumstances during inspections. We recognise that even slight progress in a particular aspect of their lives may represent a significant improvement for some children. We also recognise that for some children, because of their experiences of trauma, abuse or neglect, progress is not always straightforward. Progress in one area may result in deterioration in another as they work through the impact of their past experiences.</p>

<p>148.	Evaluating individual childrenâ€™s records that have already been audited by the local authority is an effective way for inspectors to understand the local authority and target their evidence-gathering. If the local authorityâ€™s evaluation of practice is in line with our evaluation, this will usually reduce the need for further primary evidence in that part of the inspection.</p>

<p>149.	When evaluating individual childrenâ€™s experiences, inspectors will not grade individual pieces of work.</p>

<p>150.	If statutory functions have been delegated, the inspectors will evaluate the experiences of children and young people in the same way as they do in areas where functions have not been delegated. For further information on delegated functions, see the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#alternative-delivery-models">alternative delivery models</a>.</p>

<p>151.	When inspectors select the children and young people whose experiences they will evaluate, they will take into account the factors set out below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>age, gender, disability and ethnicity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children at risk of harm from physical, emotional and sexual abuse and neglect. Inspectors will also want to identify those children and young people who the local authority is concerned may be vulnerable to sexual and other forms of exploitation and those children and young people who have been missing from care, home and education. These children must be part of the cohort of children whose experiences inspectors evaluate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>educational achievement and ability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>type of placement, including out-of-area placements, kinship care or â€˜connected personâ€™ arrangements and children placed at home and subject to a care order (Regulation 24(3) Care Planning, Placement and Care Review (England) Regulations 2010)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at least one child from a large sibling group</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children and young people supported by a third-party provider operating with social services functions delegated to it by the local authority (if the local authority has delegated functions to a provider of social work services; for further information on delegated functions, see the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#alternative-delivery-models">alternative delivery models</a>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>152.	The lead inspector will take into account any lines of enquiry identified before arriving on site or particular children and young people who are identified through the sample information, such as children who appear to have experienced significant delay.</p>

<p>153.	It is important that inspectors examine good practice as part of the inspection. We encourage local authorities to provide examples of cases that demonstrate good practice that it has identified through local case audit activity.</p>

<p>154.	In evaluating children and young peopleâ€™s experiences, inspectors will test the following thresholds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>early help â€“ including early help assessments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>referral and assessment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children in need</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>child protection (for investigation and for a plan)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>continuing help and support for families</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the decision to accommodate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the decision to remove</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>permanence planning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>matching and placement decisions, including work to support return home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaving care</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>155.	Inspectors will base their judgements on contemporary practice. This will usually be practice in the 6 months before the inspection. They may need to evaluate practice from before this to understand a childâ€™s journey.</p>

<p>156.	Judgements will generally be based on practice that has an impact on the childâ€™s or young personâ€™s current situation, although inspectors will read some historical information to understand the childâ€™s journey, their progress and how this relates to the plans for their future.</p>

<p>157.	If case files are wholly or partly electronic, the local authority should arrange for each inspector to have individual access to all relevant electronic systems. Inspectors must return any paper case files when they are needed by the staff working with the child and/or family.</p>

<p>158.	Inspectors will review a sample of supervision records and carersâ€™ records (when appropriate), including those related to the sample of children and young people.</p>

<h3>Protecting personal data</h3>

<p>159.	During inspections and visits, inspectors will gather personal information that is necessary to help them evaluate local services. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ofsted-privacy-notices/social-care-ofsted-privacy-notice#local-authority-childrens-services">privacy notices</a> set out what data we collect, what we do with it, how long we keep it for and peopleâ€™s rights under the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

<h3>Hearing the views of children and young people and their families</h3>

<p>160.	There are various opportunities to hear the views of children, young people and their families. Inspectors will use these whenever possible. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>direct testimony â€“ for example, speaking to those whose cases we are looking at closely</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>views of representative groups â€“ for example, from the Children in Care Council</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>views expressed by others advocating for children in care and care leavers, including foster carers and residential staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>views directly recorded in case files and meeting minutes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>views expressed by practitioners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>views expressed by others advocating for children, young people and their families</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analysis of the annual questionnaires, including those from children in care, carers, social workers and stakeholders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reviewing complaints made by children</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>161.	Inspectors will talk to children and young people whenever possible during the inspection, although these discussions will not always be face to face. When talking to or about children or young people, inspectors are interested in hearing how the children and young peopleâ€™s rights are being considered, how their entitlements are realised and about their experiences of the local pledges or charters in practice. Inspectors may speak with children and their families during the notification period or outside of usual working hours during fieldwork. This will happen only when children and families indicate that this is their preferred time to speak with inspectors. The lead inspector will make sure that the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> is aware of these arrangements. Any information gathered in these discussions will be part of the evidence base for the inspection or visit.</p>

<p>162.	 It is the responsibility of the local authority to inform inspectors of anything they need to know to carry out discussions with a child sensitively. Inspectors may read records about the child before a discussion with or about them. This is to help the inspector understand the context of the childâ€™s views, any communication needs they have or sensitive matters that may arise during the discussion. Inspectors will be proportionate and read only records that are necessary to ensure the discussion is child-centred. Inspectors will not pre-judge anything about a childâ€™s experience or progress as a result of accessing case records. Inspectors will inform the local authority if any information from the records causes inspectors to be concerned about the safety or wellbeing of a child.</p>

<p>163.	Inspectors will provide the local authority with guidance to help prepare children, young people, carers and families to be involved in the inspection. Inspectors must make sure that children and young people and their families understand what their involvement in the inspection means before speaking with them about their experiences. We have published 2 documents with this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services-from-2018">framework</a> to help local authorities and inspectors explain to children and their families what their involvement in inspections and visits means.</p>

<p>164.	Inspectors will discuss any risks or ethical issues concerned with meeting children and birth family members with the childâ€™s social worker or lead practitioner.</p>

<p>165.	Inspectors will work with agencies to ensure that any child or young person with communication difficulties has access to the necessary support to facilitate her/his full involvement in the inspection.</p>

<p>166.	We will also want to see and hear the impact of local consultation with all children and young people. This includes children in care, care leavers, carers and birth families. We will want to see how their feedback has been asked for, both individually and collectively, and taken into account to improve practice and services.</p>

<p>167.	During a standard or short inspection, an inspector may meet with a group of foster carers, either an established group or a group identified through an open invitation to meet the inspection team.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>168.	The inspection team will review the documentation requested in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-A">Annex A</a>. If the local authority wants to share any information additional to what is listed in Annex A, it must discuss this with the lead inspector first. The local authority must be clear why it believes the information is relevant to the inspection. The lead inspector will make the final decision about whether to accept the information as part of the inspection evidence.</p>

<h4>When inspectors request further information</h4>

<p>169.	We sometimes have to ask for further information. This may be about a service or strategy or about an individual childâ€™s experiences.</p>

<p>170.	Requests for further information about an individual childâ€™s experiences should not be seen as a negative. Sometimes it is because inspectors have insufficient information to know that a child is safe and it may appear that the child is at risk of harm. For example, the inspectors may be unable to find the information or it may not have been recorded by the local authority. After the local authority senior leadership team has responded to the request, inspectors are able to make a more informed judgement about the quality and impact of the practice they have seen. In some cases, requests for further information enable inspectors to explore good practice.</p>

<p>171.	At the start of the inspection, the lead inspector will set up a record of requests for further information and share this with the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr>. The lead inspector will ask the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> to enter responses to a request for information on the record. When inspectors request information about a child, they will be specific about the issue they are asking the local authority to respond to.</p>

<h3>Engaging with leaders and staff</h3>

<h4>Interviews with practitioners, managers and stakeholders</h4>

<p>172.	Inspectors will triangulate evidence by talking to practitioners and/or managers, either by telephone or in person. If children and young people are supported by a third-party provider as the result of statutory functions being delegated, inspectors will talk to the practitioners and managers of that provider in the same way as they would to local authority staff. Lead inspectors will only request that groups of people are brought together for discussions or meetings if this is the only way to triangulate evidence and is needed to explore lines of enquiry arising from case evaluations.</p>

<p>173.	When talking to social workers about practice, inspectors are likely to ask questions about a range of issues, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the quality and impact of supervision and management oversight</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the ways in which they are helped to strengthen families and minimise risk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>workloads and workload management</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the availability, quality and impact of training and development opportunities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the impact on practice of multi-agency training and the dissemination of learning from national or local learning reviews</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>174.	Inspectors will usually speak about these issues alone with social workers. They may ask for the social workerâ€™s line manager to be present. If these individuals are not available, inspectors may talk to those who are deputising for them in their absence.</p>

<p>175.	If local authorities are in a process of reform or implementing an improvement plan, the lead inspector will ensure that the impact of these changes is evaluated throughout the inspection and discussed with the senior managers. This is likely to be reflected in the report, particularly the impact of leaders on frontline social work practice judgement.</p>

<p>176.	If, as part of the assessment of the impact of leadership on social work practice with children and families, inspectors identify an issue arising from the arrangements for discharging the functions of the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and lead member for childrenâ€™s services, they will look at the quality and effectiveness of the local authorityâ€™s assurance and compliance process.</p>

<p>177.	Statutory guidance states that the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and lead member should provide a clear line of political and professional accountability for childrenâ€™s well-being. The <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> should report to the chief executive and the lead member should report to the council leader or mayor, as the individuals with ultimate responsibility for the political and corporate leadership of the council.</p>

<p>178.	It is legal for the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and lead member roles to be combined with other operational and political functions. However, given the breadth and importance of childrenâ€™s services functions that they cover, local authorities should give due consideration to protecting the discrete roles and responsibilities of the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and lead member before allocating any additional functions to individuals performing these roles.</p>

<p>179.	If issues arise during inspection, inspectors will ask to see the local test of assurance. Inspectors will evaluate whether the focus on outcomes for children and young people has been weakened or diluted as a result of adding other responsibilities to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and/or lead member roles. They will also seek to understand how the local authority has considered all aspects of any combined posts, for example the impact on both children and adult services if there is a joint <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and director of adult social services post.</p>

<h4>Engaging the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> during an inspection/visit</h4>

<p>180.	The lead inspector will inform the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> or another member of the senior staff of emerging findings throughout the inspection/visit. This is likely to be on a daily basis through a brief face-to-face meeting, which may involve other inspectors from the team. This gives the local authority the opportunity to challenge and understand emerging findings. In a large local authority, where the inspection team is working at different locations on different days, the lead inspector may ask the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> to travel to that location for the daily meeting or be in touch by telephone or video conference.</p>

<p>181.	These meetings will be short and focus on the main findings arising from the inspection. They will not be a description of all the inspection activity. The lead inspector should check that the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> is clear about the relationship between the evidence and the emerging and/or substantiated findings.</p>

<p>182.	Although the lead inspector will always offer the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> opportunities for engagement, the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> may choose whether or not to accept. For example, they may not be available to meet with the lead inspector due to other commitments. The extent to which the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> engages with the inspection team will not, in itself, influence inspection judgements.</p>

<h4>Local family justice system</h4>

<p>183.	In evaluating services for children subject to care, supervision and adoption proceedings, it is important to understand local authority performance in the context of the local family justice system and to gather a wide range of valuable evidence, particularly in reviewing the childâ€™s journey on coming into care and plans for permanence. Inspectors may contact the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (<abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>) to hear its experience of local authority performance and get its perspective on the local family justice system.</p>

<p>184.	Inspectors may, in some circumstances, decide to speak with the local judiciary (likely to be the local designated family judge and/or the chair of the family proceedings court bench) and/or court administration (court manager, family court listing officer or clerk to the family justices). Interviews will usually be by telephone.</p>

<p>185.	We will not make judgements about family justice partner organisations or the judiciary in the report, but may report system-wide strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>186.	The range of information gathered will vary according to the lines of enquiry in each area and will be proportionate.</p>

<p>187.	Contact with the local <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> service area will add to the evidence base. <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> may have information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>response to referrals and requests for information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the appropriateness of thresholds for care applications and timeliness of applications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>level and appropriateness of applications for section 25 secure orders and emergency protection orders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the quality of the local authorityâ€™s pre-proceeding work within the Public Law Outline (<abbr title="Public Law Outline">PLO</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>timeliness and quality of assessments and reports to court, including quality assurance processes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the effectiveness of independent reviewing officers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the local authorityâ€™s engagement with the Local Family Justice Board</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the involvement of <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> in the local safeguarding arrangements and their effectiveness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the quality of the local authorityâ€™s legal advice and representation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the appropriate allocation of requests for section 7 reports to <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> or the local authority</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>188.	A note on the last point above: when a court is considering any question with respect to a child under the Children Act 1989, it can â€˜askâ€™ a <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> officer or a local authority to report to the court. These often relate to questions like where a child should live or with whom they should have contact in circumstances when parents are divorcing or separating. A national protocol between <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> and <abbr title="Association of Directors of Childrenâ€™s Services">ADCS</abbr> states that if the child is in an open case to a local authority or a closed case of less than a month, the report should be prepared by the local authority. The protocol, called â€˜Determining whether <abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr> or a LA should prepare a s7â€™, is available under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cafcass.gov.uk/about-cafcass/policies/" rel="external"><abbr title="Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service">Cafcass</abbr>/<abbr title="Association of Directors of Childrenâ€™s Services">ADCS</abbr> good practice guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Recording evidence</h3>

<p>189.	Throughout an inspection or visit, inspectors will maintain a record of the evidence they gather. The record will include their individual and team analysis of the evidence. Inspectors may use an electronic recording system for this.</p>

<p>190.	Each inspector will maintain records of the evidence they gather throughout the inspection. Inspectors must record the source, date and time of the evidence they gather. If the local authority provides any evidence on paper that is essential to the inspection, the inspector will ask it to add electronic copies to the online portal.</p>

<p>191.	The lead inspector must allocate time for team inspectors to analyse their record and add individual evaluative summaries to the teamâ€™s shared evidence record.</p>

<p>192.	Inspectors should meet at least once a day to discuss their individual findings and record shared evaluative summaries. These shared summaries will usually draw on findings from multiple sources of evidence gathered by more than one inspector â€“ they are essential for underpinning feedback at keep-in-touch (<abbr title="keep-in-touch">KIT</abbr>) meetings, judgements and the inspection report.</p>

<p>193.	Evaluative summaries must set out the inspectorâ€™s or teamâ€™s view about the quality, effectiveness and extent of practice. They should not simply describe the practice that is in place. A 3-part structure can help to achieve summaries that are clear, concise and inform judgements and reporting effectively:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>start with an overall evaluative statement about the aspect of practice being considered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>briefly summarise the evidence underpinning this statement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>end with a comment on the difference this makes for children and young people</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>194.	Inspectors should always consider and record what the evidence about practice with children and families tells them about the impact of local authority leaders.</p>

<p>195.	When considered as a whole, the teamâ€™s shared evaluative summaries must cover the scope of the inspection or visit and be clearly linked to the relevant headings in the evaluation criteria. They must reflect strengths and areas for improvement found across the scope. However, the number of summaries is less important than their quality.</p>

<p>196.	All inspectors are responsible for reviewing the evidence record to identify gaps and make sure that the record is of good quality. The lead inspector will decide when sufficient evidence has been recorded about an issue so that it can be closed.</p>

<p>197.	Inspectors should record individual summaries in the evidence record if they have serious concerns about the safety and welfare of a child that the local authority does not appear to be aware of and/or is not responding to appropriately. This may lead to a request for additional information, which inspectors should record.</p>

<p>198.	Inspectors should also record summaries of examples of outstanding practice.</p>

<p>199.	Inspectors should not use the names of individual children, young people or family members in their evidence records. They should use case reference numbers and/or initials. Inspectors should use job titles or roles for individual staff or practitioners.</p>

<p>200.	The quality assurance manager will review the evidence record and challenge the teamâ€™s findings to make sure that the 2 align. They will add their analysis to the evidence record, which may include recommending areas for further investigation by the inspection team.</p>

<h4>Finalising evidence</h4>

<p>201.	Towards the end of the inspection or focused visit, the inspection team will complete its inspection activities and inspectors will meet to agree their findings and judgements. This meeting should be informed by clear and aligned evaluation of the evidence.</p>

<p>202.	Inspectors will weigh the evidence against the evaluation criteria. At a standard or short inspection, inspectors will make a judgement of good if the characteristics set out in the framework are widespread and common practice and are demonstrably leading to improved outcomes. Inspectors will use their professional judgement to determine the weight and significance of their findings. They will make a judgement of good if the inspection team concludes that the evidence overall sits most appropriately with a finding of good. This is what we describe as â€˜best fitâ€™.</p>

<p>203.	At the end of a focused visit, the team will agree the main strengths and areas for improvement and whether there are any priority actions.</p>

<p>204.	Before formal feedback at the end of a standard or short inspection, the lead inspector and quality assurance manager will usually inform the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> of the provisional judgements from the inspection.</p>

<h3>Feedback at the end of the inspection/visit</h3>

<p>205.	On the final day on site, the lead inspector will invite the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> and senior leaders to meet with the inspection team to hear the provisional findings and/or judgements and, most importantly, the evidence that supports them. The meeting should encourage dialogue between the inspection team and the local authority about this evidence. Because the strengths and areas for development should have been discussed in the daily meetings, there should be no surprises on the final day. In short and standard inspections, the lead inspector will inform the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> of the provisional judgements before the meeting.</p>

<p>206.	Senior leaders are invited to engage in this final discussion about the evidence supporting the provisional findings and/or judgements to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>understand the evidence that the team used to reach findings and/or judgements to support improvement (for local authorities judged to be good, this includes understanding the factors that kept them from being judged outstanding)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>participate in a dialogue about the areas for development that are likely to follow the inspection and to ensure that senior leaders fully understand the issues that have been identified</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understand what will make the most difference for the individual local authority and the children, young people and families that it serves</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support understanding of the evidence so that the findings and/or judgements of the inspection can be disseminated accurately and inform internal discussions about improvement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>207.	To make findings and/or judgements clear and to inform the discussion with the local authority, inspectors should share their analysed, prioritised and themed summary evidence. They will highlight strengths and areas for development across the scope of the inspection/visit. This is an opportunity for dialogue with senior leaders to help them understand the findings and not just a scripted presentation by inspectors. The meeting will usually last no longer than 60 minutes. Inspectors will not have produced a written report or letter at this stage of the inspection.</p>

<p>208.	The lead inspector will outline the teamâ€™s final findings and/or judgements. Members of the inspection team will then describe to the local authority the key evidence that supports their findings and/or judgements and the areas they have debated. They will invite discussion about what this means. The discussion should relate to the scope of the inspection/visit and be focused on the experience of children and young people through evidenced examples.</p>

<p>209.	At the feedback meeting, the lead inspector will set out the procedures for sharing the draft report/letter for the local authority to review, publishing the report/letter and making a complaint.</p>

<h3>Engaging childrenâ€™s services commissioners appointed by the Secretary of State for Education</h3>

<p>210.	At the time of an inspection or visit, a commissioner appointed by the Secretary of State for Education may be reviewing action taken by the local authority to secure improvement to childrenâ€™s services. This is usually in a local authority that is having a monitoring visit or re-inspection because it was judged to be inadequate at its previous inspection. The commissioner is an important stakeholder.</p>

<p>211.	Ofsted will contact the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> to announce the inspection or visit. The local authority should inform the commissioner and any other relevant partners. Ofsted will also inform the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> that an inspection or visit has started. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> would also inform the commissioner.</p>

<p>212.	The lead inspector should contact the commissioner for their view of the action taken by the local authority to improve. This will usually be in the week before fieldwork. The lead inspector will use the commissionerâ€™s information to refine their lines of enquiry, not as primary evidence.</p>

<p>213.	It is for the local authority to decide whether the commissioner should attend the feedback meeting. If a commissioner does attend, this will be as an observer.</p>

<p>214.	In some circumstances, the commissioner may be providing or facilitating direct improvement support to the local authority in addition to their role reviewing services for the Secretary of State for Education. For example, if the commissioner is employed by a local authority or organisation delivering childrenâ€™s services, they may offer peer support and challenge through members of their own childrenâ€™s services team. If this is the case, the guidance above still applies. It remains the responsibility of the local authority to carry out its statutory functions and demonstrate what it is doing to improve childrenâ€™s experiences and progress, even when it is delivering this with support or in partnership with others.</p>

<h2>Inspection reports and letters</h2>

<p>215.	The following table sets out the kind of report we publish after each type of inspection or visit:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Type of inspection</th>
      <th scope="col">Type of report</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Standard inspection</td>
      <td>Inspection report with judgements on the Ofsted 4-point scale<br>Plus, a standalone summary written for children and young people</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Short inspection</td>
      <td>Inspection report with judgements on the Ofsted 4-point scale<br>Plus, a standalone summary written for children and young people</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Focused inspection</td>
      <td>Letter setting out narrative findings about strengths and areas to improve</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Monitoring visit</td>
      <td>Letter setting out narrative findings about strengths and areas to improve<br>We do not usually publish a letter after the first monitoring visit, unless this is the second set of monitoring visits for a local authority.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>216.	The lead inspector will write the inspection report/letter. The lead inspector is responsible for collating all the information into a final report following fieldwork and is accountable for its quality and integrity.</p>

<p>217.	Reports/letters should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be concise, evaluative documents, written in clear, straightforward language and be free of jargon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be a fair and accurate reflection of the local area being inspected, with text, balance and tone that reflect the quality of childrenâ€™s experiences</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be written so that they highlight good and outstanding practice and identify clear areas of strength and improvement for the local authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>strike a balance between being accessible to a wider audience and being of value to the local authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be sufficiently clear, precise and detailed about areas that need to improve so the local authority has a basis for subsequent action to lead to improvement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sections in the report/letter</h3>

<p>218.	The first page of the report for a standard or short inspection will include the graded judgements and a brief summary that answers these questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What do we know about the overall experiences of children living in this local authority?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To what extent do leaders know about the quality of frontline practice?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How well do they support practice to help it stay or become good?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has changed for children since the last inspection?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>219.	The report will then identify areas where improvement is needed most. The rest of the report will include a section on each of the judgement areas.</p>

<p>220.	Letters following focused visits will set out the findings from the visit. The letter may identify a small number of areas where improvement is needed most in relation to the practice inspectors looked at. If inspectors find serious weaknesses, they will include a section that identifies areas for priority action. If inspectors identify an area for priority action, the letter will be subject to additional moderation. If this will affect the pre-publication checks and milestones, we will write to the <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> to confirm this.</p>

<p>221.	After a monitoring visit, the inspector will write a brief report about their findings and, in particular, their evaluation of the local authorityâ€™s progress.</p>

<h3>Summary for children and young people</h3>

<p>222.	After each standard and short inspection, we will provide a summary of the inspection findings for children and young people. This document will be separate from the main report.</p>

<p>223.	We will not publish this summary. We will send it to the local authority at the same time that we send the pre-publication version of the main report. It will be for the local authority to decide how best to share this summary with the children and young people it helps, protects and cares for.</p>

<h3>Writing the report/letter</h3>

<p>224.	When identifying the things that need to improve most, inspectors must ensure that these are proportionate to the overall grade in inspection reports and to the findings in letters. This section of the report/letter must help the local authority to fully understand the areas of the service where improvement is needed most to ensure that children receive or continue to receive a good or better service. We will set out the area of service or practice that needs to improve but will not make a recommendation as to how the local authority should remedy this issue.</p>

<p>225.	In the rest of the report/letter, inspectors will only report the main strengths and areas that need to improve. Standard and short inspection reports do not need to report on every aspect of what has been inspected. If a particular issue is not mentioned, this will be because it was neither a strength nor an area in need of improvement.</p>

<p>226.	Inspectors must make clear the extent of all the issues reported and the experience that children and young people have and the progress they make. The report must outline the local authorityâ€™s knowledge about these children and the effectiveness of its response. If any specific group of children is particularly affected â€“ such as those from a specific age, community or ethnic group, disabled children or those with a specific placement type, for example fostered children â€“ inspectors should include this in the report. On short and standard inspections, we will always report findings about the experiences and progress of care leavers.</p>

<p>227.	Reports following a standard or short inspection should be no more than 10 pages.</p>

<p>228.	If children and young people are supported by a third-party provider operating under delegated functions, strengths and areas for improvement must include the extent to which the local authority assures itself of the effectiveness of help, protection and care given to children, young people, families and carers. This includes the effectiveness of the contract management and quality assurance arrangements, as defined by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/2014/2407" rel="external">The Children and Young Persons Act 2008 (Relevant Care Functions) (England) Regulations 2014</a>.</p>

<h3>Arrangements for publishing inspection reports and letters</h3>

<p>229.	The quality assurance manager allocated to the inspection will review the report/letter and support the lead inspector throughout the report writing process. Our regional director and/or national director, social care, will review all reports.</p>

<p>230.	After we send the draft report/letter to the local authority, it will have 5 working days to comment on the report/letter, inspection process and findings. We will respond to the local authorityâ€™s comments when we send the final report/letter. If the local authority wishes to submit a formal complaint, it will have 5 working days after we send the final version of the report/letter to do so.</p>

<p>231.	We will usually publish the report/letter on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">reports site</a> 8 working days after we send the final version to the local authority. If the local authority submits a complaint within the deadline set out above, we will not publish the report/letter while we consider the complaint.</p>

<h2>Quality assurance</h2>

<p>232.	The principles of quality assurance for all inspections, focused visits and monitoring visits are based on the assumption that the lead inspector owns the inspection and is responsible for the quality of the report/letter.</p>

<p>233.	Quality assurance arrangements will be flexible and proportionate depending on the type of inspection activity carried out. The level of quality assurance will be influenced by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether it is an inspection resulting in a judgement or a visit resulting in a letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the experience of the team</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the influencing factors of the local authority, including size and location</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>local intelligence held by us.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Incomplete inspections</h3>

<p>234.	We will apply our policy on incomplete inspections, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gathering-additional-evidence-to-secure-an-incomplete-inspection-ofsted-related-protocol">Gathering additional evidence to secure an incomplete inspection â€“ Ofsted protocol</a>, where appropriate.</p>

<h2>Sharing information with other inspectorates</h2>

<p>235.	We share the final version of our local authority reports with our partner inspectorates under embargo until the report is published. Our partner inspectorates are the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>, <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services">HMICFRS</abbr>, <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation">HMIP</abbr>, <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> Prisons and HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.</p>

<p>236.	If there is evidence of significant concerns relating to the practice of other agencies, we will write to the relevant inspectorate setting out the concerns in the report and our advice that they may wish to investigate under their powers. There may be occasions when, due to the serious nature of the concern, we will share information with other inspectorates during the inspection.</p>

<p>237.	It is the responsibility of the lead inspector to draft and submit letters to partner chief inspectors at the same time that the draft inspection report is submitted for quality assurance.</p>

<p>238.	If inspection evidence suggests that there are weaknesses in practice in other providers or agencies that we regulate or inspect, inspectors will record this to inform future inspections of those providers/agencies.</p>

<h2>Conduct during inspections</h2>

<p>239.	It is important that inspectors and providers establish and maintain a positive working relationship based on courteous and professional behaviour. Both must follow guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conduct-during-ofsted-inspections">Ofstedâ€™s conduct during inspections</a> policy.</p>

<h2>Concerns and complaints about an inspection</h2>

<h3>Concerns</h3>

<p>240.	Most of our work is carried out smoothly and without incident. If concerns arise during an inspection, these should be raised with the lead inspector or quality assurance manager as soon as possible during the inspection/visit. This provides an opportunity to resolve the matter before the inspection/visit is completed.</p>

<p>241.	The local authority will have an opportunity to raise concerns about the draft inspection report, inspection process and findings when it receives the draft report.</p>

<h3>Complaints</h3>

<p>242.	If it has not been possible to resolve concerns, a formal complaint can be raised under our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complaints-about-ofsted">complaints procedure</a> before the final report/letter is published.</p>

<p>243.	If the local authority wishes to submit a formal complaint, it will have 5 working days after receiving the final report to do so.</p>

<h2>Inspection feedback survey</h2>

<p>244.	After a standard inspection, short inspection or focused visit, we will ask the local authority for feedback through an online survey. We will send the local authority a link to this survey at the same time that we send the final inspection report/letter.</p>

<p>245.	We do not send a feedback survey after each monitoring visit to an inadequate local authority. We will ask for feedback about monitoring visits in the survey that we send to the local authority after its re-inspection. We will use feedback from local authorities to improve our inspections.</p>

<h2>Action plan after an inspection or visit</h2>

<p>246.	After a standard or short inspection, the local authority should write an action plan that responds to the findings in the report. It must submit its action plan to us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ProtectionOfChildren@ofsted.gov.uk">ProtectionOfChildren@ofsted.gov.uk</a> within 70 working days of receiving the final inspection report. The requirement for this is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/462/contents/made" rel="external">Education and Inspections Act 2006 (Inspection of Local Authorities) Regulations 2007</a>.</p>

<p>247.	Following a focused visit, updating the existing action plan from the previous inspection will be deemed sufficient for Ofsted and the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>â€™s purposes. The local authority should send the updated action plan to us when it shares its self-evaluation in preparation for the next annual engagement meeting.</p>

<p>248.	If a focused visit results in an area for priority action, the local authority should submit an action plan that responds to the priority action within 70 working days of receiving the final focused visit letter. We will also ask that the local authority share a draft of its action plan within 20 working days of receiving the focused visit letter. This is so we can be assured that the local authority is taking action with an urgency commensurate with the seriousness of the findings.</p>

<p>249.	The local authority does not need to submit an action plan to us after a monitoring visit.</p>

<h2>Alternative delivery models and delegation of local authority functions</h2>

<p>Information about how we inspect and report when a local authority delivers services through a third-party organisation, for example a trust.</p>

<p>250.	This section provides information about inspections when a local authority has delegated statutory functions to a third-party provider â€“ an alternative delivery model.</p>

<p>251.	In these circumstances (with the exception of arrangements under section 497A(4AA) of the Education Act 2006), the inspection is still an inspection of the local authority. This is because the third party is acting as the local authorityâ€™s agent.</p>

<h3>Local authority functions</h3>

<p>252.	Under Part 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 2008, local authorities may make arrangements with a body corporate for the discharge of some or all of the local authorityâ€™s statutory care functions.</p>

<p>253.	Relevant care functions are those functions set out in section 1(2) of the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 and regulation 3 of the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 (Relevant Care Functions) (England) Regulations 2014. Relevant care functions do not include those functions set out in section 2 of the Children and Young Persons Act. A body corporate that is carried on for profit may not be party to an arrangement for the discharge of a function set out in regulation 3 of the 2014 Regulations.</p>

<h3>Direction by the Secretary of State for Education</h3>

<p>254.	Under section 497A(4) of the Education Act 1996, the Secretary of State for Education may direct a local authority to contract out its social services functions relating to children or transfer those functions to a nominee. At the time of writing, the delegation of functions by local authorities has either been on a voluntary basis (with no direction from the Secretary of State for Education) or under a section 497(4) direction. In both cases, the body operating under the delegation is acting as the agent of the local authority. Any inspection judgement is therefore of the local authority.</p>

<p>255.	If the Secretary of State for Education has given a direction under section 497A(4A), then by virtue of section 497A(4AA), any reference to a local authority is to be read as a reference to the body corporate or person who is exercising the function. If a direction is made under section 497(4A) or (4AA), the inspection is of the nominee or the Secretary of State for Educationâ€™s exercise of the relevant functions and therefore the judgement will be of that person/body and not the local authority. At the time of writing, no such directions have been made.</p>

<h3>Judgements about leadership when there are alternative delivery models</h3>

<p>256.	If a local authority makes arrangements with a third-party provider to discharge functions, that provider is acting as the agent of the local authority. Therefore, inspectors will evaluate their effectiveness using the same evaluation criteria.</p>

<p>257.	When applying the criteria, inspectors will consider whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>effective contract monitoring arrangements by the local authority are in place to ensure that children receive services that meet their needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the local authority reviews these arrangements regularly to ensure that they remain effective</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the local authority has proportionate scrutiny arrangements in place to ensure that it fulfils its role as the corporate parent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in cases where the third-party provider is responsible for managing local authority partnerships, the provider is engaged with partner organisations to ensure that their responsibilities are carried out to a high standard</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in cases where a local authority has delegated all of its functions to a third-party provider, the chief executive or equivalent and the board of that provider discharge the individual and collective responsibilities of local authority leaders (as outlined)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in cases where only some functions have been delegated, the arrangements for how the local authority holds the provider to account are proportionate to the nature and extent of delegation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>258.	All references in the evaluation criteria to a â€˜local authorityâ€™ also refer to all arrangements for alternative delivery models.</p>

<h3>Action plans when there are alternative delivery models</h3>

<p>259.	We and the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have agreed that the local authority and alternative delivery model (<abbr title="alternative delivery model">ADM</abbr>)/trust are responsible for different aspects of any action plans. Our expectations are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>arrangements reflect what has already been agreed as part of existing service contract</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the local authority will draft the overarching strategic elements (information taken from any existing services contract) that would include any wider issues that are not the responsibility of the <abbr title="alternative delivery model">ADM</abbr>/trust (for example governance, relationship with trust, scrutiny function and support services)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <abbr title="alternative delivery model">ADM</abbr>/trust should draft the operational content describing how outcomes will be achieved to address our findings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the local authority is responsible for submitting the plan (copied to the <abbr title="alternative delivery model">ADM</abbr>/trust)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>260.	It must be made clear whether the plan has been agreed and, if there is any disagreement, these areas must be set out.</p>

<p>261.	If the <abbr title="alternative delivery model">ADM</abbr>/trust has been created at the direction of the Secretary of State for Education, the plan should be copied to the Secretary of State to enable these issues to be addressed through the appropriate route.</p>

<h2>Evaluation criteria and grade descriptors</h2>

<p>Our description of what a good experience for children and young people looks like. Inspectors use this to make their judgements.</p>

<h3>Overall effectiveness</h3>

<p>262.	Inspectors will determine the overall effectiveness graded judgement by taking account of the grading of the other judgements that have been agreed and by looking at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the extent of good practice across the service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent and impact of any areas for improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether areas for improvement have been identified and the extent to which leaders and managers have a â€˜gripâ€™ on the issue</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The experiences and progress of children who need help and protection</h3>

<h2>Regional adoption agencies and <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr> inspections</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>267.	We want to determine whether children in need of adoption are well served. At each inspection, we are interested in the children that the local authority is responsible for. This includes when a local authority may be part of an <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>.</p>

<p>268.	Whatever the local arrangements, we will ask whether there is a sufficient and appropriate supply of adopters for the local authorityâ€™s children.</p>

<p>269.	If there are failings for children, we will ask what the local authority has done to challenge or remedy this.</p>

<p>270.	When writing our report, we will state the name of the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>. Although we will report on any strengths or weaknesses for children in the local authority, we will not imply or make any judgement on the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>.</p>

<p>271.	The evaluation of the quality of childrenâ€™s experiences, local authority oversight and leadership are <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> tasks. If there is an <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>, a social care regulatory inspector will usually look at the adoptive carer cases as identified by the lead inspector.</p>

<h3>Role of RAAs</h3>

<p>272.	An <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> is a larger organisation made up of local authorities, trusts and, in some cases, <abbr title="voluntary adoption agencies">VAAs</abbr>. An <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> is likely to be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a group of local authorities collaborating to provide a central service, with one local authority as host</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a separate company registered as a VAA</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>273.	The <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> generally takes on responsibility for recruiting, assessing, approving and supporting adopters. It provides a central pool of adopters for the local authorities in question.</p>

<p>274.	We are not inspecting the effectiveness of the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>, but we do take into account the interface between the individual local authority and the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>. We focus on how the local authority discharges its functions through the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> and how it ensures that the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> meets the local authorityâ€™s needs. We always look at this through the lens of the local authority.</p>

<h3>On inspection</h3>

<p>275.	The <abbr title="director of childrenâ€™s services">DCS</abbr> should notify the management team at the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> that an inspection has started.</p>

<p>276.	A local authority that is part of an <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> must be able to demonstrate how the arrangements comply with its statutory responsibilities and meet the needs of local children.</p>

<p>277.	To understand how the local authority works with the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> to meet the needs of local children, inspectors will speak to the local authorityâ€™s link officer for the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> and the independent chair of the adoption panel. We may wish to arrange a joint meeting with the local authorityâ€™s link officer and the relevant manager in the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>.</p>

<p>278.	We have the right to access records relevant to the performance of a local authority, wherever they may be held. <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> will arrange this access with the local authority. Inspectors will visit the premises of the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> if that is the best way to access the records they need to see as part of the inspection of the local authority. Many RAAs are co-located with local authorities.</p>

<p>279.	When a local authority is part of an <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>, inspectors will still look at the planning, decision-making and matching for the children in that local authority. Each local authority will need to have an agency decision-maker. In some local authorities, the agency decision-maker is supported by the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> at different stages in the case management process. We would want to be assured of the effectiveness of the agency decision-maker role. This is usually an <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> task.</p>

<p>280.	We want to understand how the local authority ensures that there are sufficient suitable adopters available and what action it has taken if this is not the case. This is usually an <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> task.</p>

<p>281.	If any of the local authorityâ€™s children are placed for adoption, a social care regulatory inspector will look at the quality and impact of the recruitment and assessment of those specific carers in up to 4 cases.</p>

<p>282.	 To allow the inspector to access case records relating to recruitment and assessment, the children selected for sampling by the <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> should be those placed with adoptive families approved by the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> (or by the local authority if assessment and approval are within the timeframe of the inspection, that is 6 months before the inspection).</p>

<p>283.	The social care regulatory inspector will usually speak to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the local authorityâ€™s responsible person for adoption</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the lead for recruitment in the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the adoptive carers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the assessing social workers in the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the chair of the adoption panel</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>284.	We will consider information relating to children with a plan for adoption. This is usually an <abbr title="Her Majestyâ€™s Inspector">HMI</abbr> task.</p>

<p>285.	If the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> arrangements hinder children achieving permanence and/or other issues emerge, inspectors will follow this as a line of enquiry and seek assurances from the local authority about the steps it is taking.</p>

<p>286.	If the local authority being inspected is the host local authority for the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>, we only focus on the children of that local authority and equally on the availability and suitability of adopters for the children.</p>

<p>287.	Some RAAs carry out other adoption tasks in addition to the recruitment and assessment of adopters. This may include, for example, life story work, family finding activities or adoption support. In these cases, we will look at the local authorityâ€™s arrangements to assure itself that the needs of local children are being met.</p>

<h3>Evaluating practice and writing the report</h3>

<p>288.	We are not judging the performance of the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>.</p>

<p>289.	If a local authority is involved in an <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>, we will state the name of the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>. However, we only evaluate what the local authority is doing for its children and this will be the focus of our overall evaluation and final report.</p>

<p>290.	The report should not make or imply any broader evaluation of the performance of the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>.</p>

<p>291.	We will only comment on the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>â€™s performance for the local authority when this represents a strength or area for improvement in meeting local need. The use of any judgement language relating to the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> is likely to be misleading. This is because the impact of the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> may differ between local authority partners.</p>

<p>292.	We do not share any findings with the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> directly. Our inspection relationship is with the local authority. However, inspection evidence may inform our inspections of other providers or agencies that we regulate or inspect, including other <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> partners.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

<h4>Q: Should the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> register with Ofsted?</h4>

<p>The majority of RAAs are several local authority services collaborating under a host local authority arrangement to deliver services. In these cases, the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> will not need to register and therefore not be subject to inspection as a single entity.</p>

<p>However, there are some RAAs that are formed of other types of bodies (such as local authority trading companies or not-for-profit entities) or are hosted by trusts. These types of RAAs will be required to register as <abbr title="voluntary adoption agencies">VAAs</abbr> and/or independent fostering agencies (IFAs). If you are in any doubt about the legitimacy of the arrangements, you should seek legal advice.</p>

<h4>Q: Some RAAs are comprised of a group of local authorities operating as a trading company. Are these RAAs required to register with Ofsted?</h4>

<p>Yes. As a trading company, the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> is a separate legal entity from the local authority and is required to register as a VAA and/or IFA (as appropriate).</p>

<h4>Q: If the local authority childrenâ€™s services are delivered through a trust, which is part of an <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>, and an <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> takes on adoption functions, is the trust required to register as a VAA?</h4>

<p>Yes. As the trust will be a separate legal entity and continue to perform adoption functions, it must be registered as a VAA.</p>

<h4>Q: Under which framework do we inspect those local authority childrenâ€™s services that are also a trust, registered as a VAA/IFA and are part of a <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>?</h4>

<p>We inspect <abbr title="voluntary adoption agencies">VAAs</abbr> and IFAs under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/social-care-common-inspection-framework-sccif-voluntary-adoption-agencies">social care common inspection framework (<abbr title="social care common inspection framework">SCCIF</abbr>)</a> and local authority children services under <abbr title="local authority childrenâ€™s services">ILACS</abbr>. If the local authority adoption provision is delivered through a trust and registered as VAA and IFA, both frameworks will apply. The timing of inspections in these circumstances will be determined by the relevant Ofsted regional team.</p>

<h4>Q: Can the local authority childrenâ€™s services delegate the role of the responsible officer to the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr>?</h4>

<p>For local-authority-hosted RAAs, each local authority must appoint one of its officers as the responsible officer of the adoption service (under regulation 5 in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/370/contents/made" rel="external">The Local Authority Adoption Service (England) Regulations 2003</a>). The officer can sit in the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> if that is what the local authority and the <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> agree, but the person must be one of that local authorityâ€™s officers and not an officer from another local authority.</p>

<p>In those RAAs that have chosen to set up as a local authority trading company model, they must register as a VAA (see question above). For that reason, <a class="govuk-link" href="The%20Voluntary%20Adoption%20Agencies%20and%20the%20Adoption%20Agencies%20(Miscellaneous%20Amendments)%20Regulations%202003">The Voluntary Adoption Agencies and the Adoption Agencies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2003</a> apply to the VAA. The local authority would still need a responsible officer for adoption services.</p>

<h4>Q: Should local authorities that are participating in <abbr title="regional adoption agency">RAA</abbr> arrangements continue to notify Ofsted of the named officer responsible for each local authority children adoption service?</h4>

<p>Yes. Individual local authorities should use <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childrens-social-care-providers-sc3-changes-to-individuals-or-premises">form SC3</a> to notify us of a change of officer for the adoption service. The regulations continue to require all notifications of a change to the named local authority officer responsible for the adoption service to be sent to us by the individual local authority. This includes all participating local authorities in regional adoption arrangements.</p>

<h2>Annex A: Information we request from the local authority</h2>

<p>293.	This annex sets out the information inspectors will ask the local authority to share to support the inspection/visit. The milestones for sharing the information are set out in the table below.</p>

<p>294.	We will provide secure means for the local authority to share this information. The lead inspector will provide details when they notify the local authority that the inspection/visit will take place. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services-from-2018">Guidance on how to share information with us</a> is published with this framework.</p>

<p>295.	The lead inspector will make the final decision about whether to request or accept additional information based on whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is necessary for an accurate understanding of childrenâ€™s experiences and social work practice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is already sufficient information on the issue available through other sources in Annex A or primary evidence-gathering</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>296.	The lead inspector will maintain a record of <a class="govuk-link" href="#further-info">requests for further information</a>.</p>

<h3>Child-level data</h3>

<p>297.	When the lead inspector contacts the local authority, she/he will ask for lists containing child-level data. The local authority should provide the child-level data lists as soon as they are able. The table at the start of <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-A">Annex A</a> sets out expected deadlines for submission. The child-level data lists should be as up to date as possible. However, the local authority may provide lists that it has prepared in advance that show data up to the Wednesday before notification. Please provide these lists in Excel.</p>

<p>298.	Below is an outline of the broad contents of each list. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services-from-2018">Detailed guidance about the fields for each list is available in a spreadsheet</a>. Included in the spreadsheet is an optional template for each child-level list.</p>

<p>299.	To reduce the burden on local authorities, we have aligned the information within the child-level lists with <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/children-looked-after-return-2019-to-2020-guide">children looked after</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/children-in-need-census-2019-to-2020-guide">children in need</a>.</p>

<p>300.	The spreadsheet template includes an overview of the ideal codes to use and how these link to the more detailed descriptions in the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance.</p>

<p>301.	The child-level data lists should cover a period of 6 months before the date of notification. When the local authority shares the lists, they should indicate the specific date range that each list covers.</p>

</table>

<p>302.	It is likely that children will appear on more than one list. The consistent use of the child ID across lists will enable the lead inspector to recognise when this occurs.</p>

<p>303.	For lists 6 to 10, please provide only one row for each unique child ID. Information should relate to the most recent event (for example, list 6 should show the most recent episode of need).</p>

<p>304.	Some of the requested data â€“ particularly in relation to list 1 â€˜contactsâ€™ and list 2 â€˜early help assessmentsâ€™ â€“ may not be recorded on the local authorityâ€™s main <abbr title="integrated childrenâ€™s system">ICS</abbr> system. In these circumstances, the local authority is free to use the solution that suits it best and enables them to provide the data in the timeframe requested. Whatever the format, the data should be clearly identifiable.</p>

<p>305.	If certain data is unavailable, we will ask the local authority to demonstrate how it has sufficient management oversight of the specific issue.</p>

<p>306.	After the local authority shares Annex A, we may arrange a brief telephone conversation between an Ofsted analytical officer and a local authority analyst. This is to help us understand the composition and content of the local authorityâ€™s information and the layout of its management information systems.</p>

<p>307.	Queries about the child-level data should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:SocialCareSAO@ofsted.gov.uk">SocialCareSAO@ofsted.gov.uk</a>. However, if you have any queries after you have been notified that an inspection is to take place, please contact the lead inspector.</p>

<h3>Local authority audits</h3>

<p>308.	The local authority should share a list of the audits that they have carried out in the 6 months before the inspection/visit. The list should identify the child unique ID for those children whose experiences were evaluated, the audit theme and when the audit was completed. If the local authority has an overview report, learning or action plan from the audits, it should share this too.</p>

<h3>Case file documents</h3>

<p>309.	The lead inspector will not ask the local authority to carry out audits specifically for the inspection. Before fieldwork, the lead inspector will identify 6 to 12 cases the local authority has already audited and ask the local authority to provide the audit document for each of these cases. They may ask for other case file documents about these children, for example the most recent assessment, care plan, chronology and supervision record.</p>

<p>310.	Inspectors will evaluate these cases during fieldwork. The lead inspector will ask the local authority to speak to the children, young people, parents and carers to see if they are happy to speak to an inspector.</p>

<h3>Information the local authority uses to manage its services</h3>

<p>311.	The lead inspector will ask the local authority to share information it uses to understand and manage its social work practice. The local authority should share its best and most recent information. The local authority must clearly direct the lead inspector to the relevant documents or sections within them. If the reasons for sharing a particular piece of information are unclear or the lead inspector decides the information is not relevant to the scope of the inspection/visit, inspectors will not read it.</p>

<p>312.	The local authority should provide the information below as soon as it is able to and by the deadlines set out at the beginning of Annex A.</p>

<p>313.	Each of the topics is numbered. When the local authority shares the information with inspectors, it should include the number in the document name as a prefix. This will enable inspectors to easily identify and retrieve information and support the local authority to link its evidence to the topic.</p>
