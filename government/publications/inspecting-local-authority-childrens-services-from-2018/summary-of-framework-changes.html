<p>This section outlines changes to inspection practice. These do not include corrections or changes made to improve clarity.</p>

<h2>September 2022</h2>

<p>Added guidance for inspectors to discuss Ofsted’s code of conduct during inspections with the local authority (paragraph 239).</p>

<h2>August 2022</h2>

<p>Amended guidance to make clear that we will confirm the month of a monitoring visit in advance, not the specific dates of fieldwork (paragraphs 119, 130 and 142).</p>

<p>Added guidance about when inspectors speak with local authority staff confidentially (paragraph 174).</p>

<h2>April 2022</h2>

<p>Made clear that areas for priority action can be given in relation to services for care leavers (paragraphs 112 to 113).</p>

<p>Added guidance about when inspectors may ask to read children’s case files before speaking to them (paragraph 162).</p>

<p>Amended item 2.02 in Annex A to cover criminal as well as sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>Rephrased item 3.18 in Annex A to make the request about deprivation of liberty orders clearer.</p>

<h2>December 2021</h2>

<p>Added paragraph numbers to help readers more easily reference the guidance.</p>

<p>Removed the reference to inspections and focused visits having an extended notice period to enable remote fieldwork arrangements (paragraphs 53, 57 and 104).</p>

<p>Introduced more flexibility on the days of the week that focused visits and monitoring visits can take place (paragraphs 106 and 132).</p>

<p>Added guidance to give inspectors more flexibility for when they speak with children and families during inspections and visits (paragraph 161).</p>

<p>Added a new request to Annex A: a list of all children placed under the inherent jurisdiction of the high court, including children subject to a deprivation of liberty order (item 3.18).</p>

<h2>August 2021</h2>

<p>Deleted the guidance on ILACS focused visits during the restart of routine inspection. This guidance covered the period from September 2020 to May 2021 when we suspended our usual arrangements because of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Amended guidance to allow for fieldwork to be carried out remotely when this is required and possible.</p>

<p>Increased the number of fieldwork days for the education HMI on standard and short inspections from 1 to 2 days.</p>

<p>Added a new topic for focused visits: children placed in unregulated and unregistered settings.</p>

<h2>March 2021</h2>

<p>The updates in March 2021 include changes to the order of some sections in the framework. If you have previously downloaded a copy of the framework, we recommend you delete these copies to ensure that you are referring to the most up-to-date guidance.</p>

<p>Notification periods for inspections and visits may be extended to 10 working days if fieldwork is likely to include remote activities due to the impact of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Updated guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services-from-2018/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services#publishing-reports">arrangements for publishing inspection reports and letters</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services-from-2018/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services#concerns-and-complaints-about-an-inspection">concerns and complaints about an inspection</a> to reflect Ofsted’s new timescales, arrangements and guidance for these activities.</p>

<p>Updated guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services-from-2018/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services#RAA-ILACS-inspections">how our inspections and visits consider the local authority’s arrangements with regional adoption agencies (RAAs)</a>.</p>

<h2>December 2020</h2>

<p>Changes made to the guidance on ILACS focused visits during the restart of routine inspection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fieldwork changed from 3 days to 2 days. Fieldwork can start on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday (see the section called ‘focused visit arrangements’)</li>
  <li>inspectors will consider edge of care/pre-proceedings as part of the scope for help and protection rather than children in care (see the section called ‘scope’)</li>
  <li>more detailed guidance on the Annex A request for these visits. This request is based on our usual Annex A for ILACS. However, we have added narrower descriptions of the items to reflect the specific focus of these visits (see the section called ‘off-site evaluation’)</li>
</ul>

<h2>September 2020</h2>

<p>Updated the spreadsheet ‘Child-level data: additional guidance and template for Annex A’ in line with changes by DfE to their annual data returns</p>

<p>Changes made to the guidance on ILACS focused visits during the restart of routine inspection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>additional guidance on when inspectors will raise an area for priority action (see the section called ‘letter of findings’)</li>
  <li>Annex A items 1.06 and 3.17 added to the information request. Both items were referred to in the text but were missing from the table (see the section called ‘off-site evaluation’)</li>
</ul>

<h2>August 2020</h2>

<p>Added a new section called ‘Guidance on ILACS focused visits during the restart of routine inspection’. This sets out focused visit arrangements that take account of the impact of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The section on ‘Engaging with leaders and staff’ has new guidance on lines of accountability. It sets out what inspectors may ask if the DCS or lead member are responsible for other functions in the local authority.</p>

<p>Converted the framework from Microsoft Word and PDF versions to an HTML webpage. The presentation of the guidance has changed but not the content or methodology of ILACS.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been moved into the main text of the framework. This includes footnotes in the evaluation criteria. This has not changed our description of the features of a good service or good experiences and progress for children.</p>

<p>Annexes have been turned into sections in the main body of the framework or have moved to their own pages. Annex A still appears in the guidance; it is the last section in the framework, after the new guidance on ILACS focused visits during the restart of routine inspection.</p>

<h2>December 2019</h2>

<p>In the section on focused visit topics, we’ve made clear that focused visits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>about children in care will consider children in unregulated and/or unregistered provision</li>
  <li>about care leavers will consider the quality and suitability of accommodation</li>
</ul>

<p>In the section on monitoring visits: added an approximate timetable for activities after an inadequate judgement to help make the timescales clearer.</p>

<p>In the care leavers and transitions section of the evaluation criteria: provided additional clarity about what inspectors look for when young people live in unregulated settings.</p>

<p>In the Annex A request for the impact of leadership: added a new request for rapid reviews carried out following child safeguarding incident notifications.</p>

<h2>August 2019</h2>

<p>Clarified arrangements for sharing provisional judgements at the end of the inspection.</p>

<p>Added a new request to Annex A for information about the local authority’s use of unregulated provision.</p>

<p>Changes to the presentation and layout of tables and charts to improve the accessibility of the framework.</p>

<h2>April 2019</h2>

<p>For standard and short inspections, the set-up discussion on the notification day can happen in person if it is practical for the lead inspector and DCS to do so.</p>

<p>Annex A: Child-level data lists: the guidance and request has been changed to align more closely with existing data submissions. The Excel spreadsheet with detailed guidance has been updated and published with this framework.</p>

<p>Annex A: Information the local authority uses to manage its services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amended items: 1.09, 2.02, 2.04 and 3.07</li>
  <li>New items: 3.13, 3.14, 3.15 and 3.16</li>
</ul>

<h2>December 2018</h2>

<p>Updated arrangements for monitoring visits to inadequate local authorities to provide more flexible and proportionate timing.</p>

<p>Redrafted guidance on recording evidence to reflect new recording tools.</p>

<p>Added new guidance for inspectors when inspecting a local authority being reviewed and/or supported by a children’s services commissioner appointed by the Secretary of State for Education.</p>

<p>Added a request for the local authority to share an early draft of its action plan following an area for priority action at a focused visit.</p>

<p>A new footnote in Annex A that adds some flexibility in sharing child-level data.</p>

<p>Additional guidance in Annex A on the information inspectors request about children who are electively home educated.</p>

<h2>September 2018</h2>

<p>We will no longer carry out re-inspections of inadequate local authorities using the single inspection framework. We will re-inspect using a standard inspection under this framework.</p>

<p>Added a reference to our new privacy notices.</p>

<p>Introduced additional moderation for focused visit letters that identify an area for priority action.</p>

<p>New guidance on producing an action plan after giving an area for priority action on a focused visit.</p>

<p>Clarified our arrangements for a summary report for children and young people after standard and short inspections.</p>

<p>In Annex A, 2 items were numbered 3.04 in the list of ‘Information the local authority uses to manage its services’. We corrected this, which also affects the numbering of subsequent documents in this list.</p>

<h2>February 2018</h2>

<p>Added guidance for inspecting local authorities that are part of a regional adoption agency.</p>
