<p>This guidance provides a summary of information for employers to help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase their understanding of disability</li>
  <li>enable them recruit and support disabled people and those with long term health conditions in work</li>
</ul>

<p>It has links to other resources to enable employers to become more confident when attracting, recruiting, developing and retaining disabled people.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Why recruit disabled people?</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Definition of disability</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010">A disabled person is defined</a> as someone with a physical or mental impairment that has a ‘substantial’ and ‘long-term’ effect on their ability to do normal daily activities (<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/6" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>The benefits of employing disabled people</h3>

<p>Over 7.7 million people of working age in the UK are disabled or have a health condition. Historically there has been a significant gap between the proportion of disabled people employed compared with non-disabled people.</p>

<p>Encouraging applications from disabled people is good for business. It can help you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase the number of high quality applicants available</li>
  <li>create a workforce that reflects the diverse range of customers it serves and the community in which it is based</li>
  <li>bring additional skills to the business, such as the ability to use British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>), which could result in large savings</li>
</ul>

<p>The costs of making reasonable adjustments to accommodate disabled employees are often low.</p>

<p>The benefits of retaining an experienced, skilled employee who has acquired an impairment are usually greater than recruiting and training new staff. It is also good for the individual.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Disability Confident</h4>

<p>We are working with employers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give them the skills, techniques and confidence they need to recruit, retain and develop disabled people</li>
  <li>increase the understanding amongst employers of disability and the benefits disabled people can bring to their businesses</li>
  <li>steadily increase the number of employers, across all sizes, sectors and locations, signing up to be Disability Confident and taking action that will make a difference to disabled people</li>
  <li>make a substantial contribution towards getting 1 million more disabled people in work by 2027</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Help employing disabled people</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Reasonable adjustments</h3>

<p>You must make reasonable adjustments to support disabled job applicants and employees. This means ensuring disabled people can overcome any substantial disadvantages they may have doing their jobs and progressing in work (<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/2/chapter/2/crossheading/adjustments-for-disabled-persons" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a>).</p>

<p>An individual can take you to an employment tribunal if they think you have not made reasonable adjustments.</p>

<p>Many reasonable adjustments involve little or no cost and could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making changes to a disabled person’s working pattern</li>
  <li>providing training or mentoring</li>
  <li>making alterations to premises</li>
  <li>ensuring that information is provided in accessible formats</li>
  <li>modifying or acquiring equipment</li>
  <li>allowing extra time during selection ‘tests’</li>
</ul>

<p>Find out more about what <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers">reasonable adjustments are and what you may need to do</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employing-disabled-people-and-people-with-health-conditions/employing-disabled-people-and-people-with-health-conditions#help-with-the-extra-costs-disabled-people-face-in-work">Access to Work</a> can help towards the costs of making reasonable adjustments.</p>

<p>More information on reasonable adjustments, including examples, is in Chapter 6 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/publication/employment-statutory-code-practice" rel="external">Equality Act 2010 Code of Practice</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Help with the extra costs disabled people face in work</h3>

<p>You may be able to get help from Access to Work towards some costs where an individual requires support or adaptations. Find out more in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-work-guide-for-employers">Employer’s guide to Access to Work</a>.</p>

<p>Access to Work usually provides a grant to pay for the cost of the support. For example it can provide funds towards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special aids and equipment</li>
  <li>adaptations to equipment</li>
  <li>travel to and from work</li>
  <li>communication support at interview</li>
  <li>a wide variety of support workers</li>
</ul>

<p>Access to Work also has a Mental Health Support Service. This can offer support to individuals with a mental health condition who are absent from work or finding work difficult.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Health Adjustment Passport</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-adjustment-passport">Health Adjustment Passport</a> is a document that is completed by Individuals with a disability or health condition to help them identify what extra support they will need as a result of their disability or health condition in the workplace.&nbsp; This could include provision of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help communicating at interview</li>
  <li>help with travel to work or travelling in work time</li>
  <li>workplace assessments</li>
  <li>specialist IT software</li>
  <li>specialist equipment</li>
  <li>a support worker</li>
</ul>

<p>The passport will provide a personalised live document of their in-work support needs and adjustments. It can help with a smooth transition into employment and when changing job roles.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Supporting older workers</h3>

<p>Older workers often have a vast amount of experience, knowledge and skill. By not retaining older workers you can face a loss of output and extra recruitment costs.</p>

<p>Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/help-and-support-for-older-workers/help-and-support-for-older-workers">help and support for older workers</a> page provides information on employing older workers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Supporting disabled people to remain in work</h3>

<p>You can get help from the Employer Adviser and Work Psychology Services at Jobcentre Plus if an employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>becomes disabled</li>
  <li>has a change in their impairment or health condition that could mean they face barriers to remaining in work</li>
</ul>

<h4>Work and Health Programme</h4>

<p>The Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) was launched throughout England and Wales on a rolling basis between November 2017 and April 2018. It predominantly helps people with a wide range of health conditions or disabilities, as well as the long-term unemployed, and certain priority groups, to enter into and stay in work, using the expertise of private, public and voluntary, and community sector providers.</p>

<p><abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> providers are building strong links to national and local employers to identify employment needs, identify roles and provide more individual training to better match people’s skills to jobs. They also offer light touch in-work support from job start for the participant if they need it, and ensuring that appropriate arrangements for continuation of support, including Access to Work is in place before the provider support ends.</p>

<p>For more information on available support, employers can contact the following <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> providers:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Disability law</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Discrimination</h3>

<p>It is against the law to treat someone less favourably than someone else because of a personal characteristic, such as being disabled. There are different <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights/how-you-can-be-discriminated-against">kinds of discrimination</a>.</p>

<p>Discrimination does not have to be direct to be illegal. You can discriminate indirectly with working conditions or rules that disadvantage a group of people more than another.</p>

<p>Discrimination can include, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not hiring someone because of their disability</li>
  <li>selecting a particular person for redundancy because of their disability</li>
  <li>paying someone less than another worker without good reason</li>
</ul>

<p>Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employer-preventing-discrimination/recruitment">avoid discriminating against disabled people during the recruitment process and while they work for you</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Dealing with performance issues</h3>

<p>All employees, whether or not they are disabled, have changes in their performance levels. These could be problems with attendance, behaviour or conduct.</p>

<p>Before starting action to deal with poor performance, you must make <a class="govuk-link" href="#reasonable-adjustments">reasonable adjustments</a> to allow a disabled employee to improve their performance. If you don’t, they could take you to an employment tribunal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>How to recruit disabled people</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Accessible job adverts</h3>

<p>You must not discriminate against disabled people at any stage of the recruitment process.</p>

<p>You must make job adverts accessible to all those who can do the job, whether or not they are disabled.</p>

<p>When writing job adverts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a font that is easy to read and large enough to read</li>
  <li>make sure that they don’t exclude any section of the community</li>
  <li>state clearly that you welcome applications from all sections of the community and that you have an equal opportunities policy</li>
  <li>include in your person specification only the skills and experience which are vital to the job</li>
  <li>do not set criteria which automatically exclude certain groups, for example stating that applicants must have a driving licence when there is no requirement for travel within the role</li>
  <li>provide the contact details of someone in your organisation who can provide further information and discuss any reasonable adjustments that the applicant may need</li>
  <li>offer alternative formats for applications, for example if the application is to be made online, provide a paper based form as an alternative</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Conducting interviews</h3>

<p>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a> you must not ask about a job applicant’s health until you have offered them a job, except to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>find out whether they need any reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process</li>
  <li>find out if they can carry out an essential function of the job</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-responsibilities-equality-monitoring">monitor whether applicants are disabled</a> (this must be anonymous)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask applicants if they need an adjustment to the interview process to allow them to be considered for the job. Make any adjustments if they are reasonable, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use premises that are fully accessible</li>
  <li>change lighting or room layout</li>
  <li>show a visually impaired applicant to their seat</li>
  <li>offer an alternative to a standard interview, for example a working interview or allow extra time</li>
  <li>allow applicants to complete a written test using a computer</li>
</ul>

<p>When interviewing a disabled applicant, help them to perform to the best of their ability by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>speaking directly to them rather than any support worker</li>
  <li>telling them about any flexible working patterns that you may be able to offer them</li>
  <li>making sure that you ask each applicant the same questions, whether or not they are disabled</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Disability Confident symbol</h3>

<p>The Disability Confident symbol replaced the ‘Two Ticks’ (positive about disabled people) symbol in 2016.</p>

<p>Disability Confident is creating a movement of change, encouraging employers to think differently about disability and take action to improve how they recruit, retain and develop disabled people.</p>

<p>Being Disability Confident is a unique opportunity to lead the way in your community, and you might just discover someone your business cannot do without.</p>

<p>Sign up to the Disability Confident scheme and you can use the Disability Confident symbol on adverts to show that you encourage applications from disabled people.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Advice on specific conditions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Mental health conditions</h3>

<p>Mental Health conditions cover a wide range of illnesses which can affect how people feel, think and behave. They can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>depression</li>
  <li>anxiety</li>
  <li>bipolar disorder</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the Mental Health Foundation, 1 in 4 people experience a problem with their mental health every year. It’s likely you will at some point employ someone with a mental health condition. Being in work can improve someone’s mental health. With understanding and support from an employer, there is no reason that someone with a mental health condition cannot succeed in the workplace.</p>

<p>Adjustments for employees with a mental health condition include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>offering flexible working patterns, including changes to start and finish times and adaptable break times</li>
  <li>changing their working environment, for example providing a quiet place to work</li>
  <li>working with them to create an action plan to help them manage their condition</li>
  <li>allowing them leave to attend appointments connected with their mental health</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Hearing impairment</h3>

<p>Someone with a hearing impairment may have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>partial or complete hearing loss</li>
  <li>had their impairment from birth or it may have increased gradually over time</li>
  <li>a temporary or permanent impairment</li>
</ul>

<p>The proportion of people with a hearing impairment who are in work is below the national average. However, there are many people with a hearing impairment who are in work and even more who would like the opportunity to be in work.</p>

<p>The National Deaf Children’s Society (<abbr title="National Deaf Children's Society">NDCS</abbr>) has developed a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ndcs.org.uk/family_support/leaving_school/employment/breaking_down.html" rel="external">collection of resources</a> with the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) to support the transition young people with a hearing impairment make into employment. These resources include a personal profile template for young people to complete about their working environment needs, an employer handbook and short videos aimed at young people, parents and employers.</p>

<p>Adjustments for an employee with a hearing impairment include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing information in accessible formats</li>
  <li>seating an employee in a quiet area, away from distracting noises</li>
  <li>using adapted telephones with adjustable volumes and lights</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Visual impairments</h3>

<p>There are almost 80,000 registered blind and partially sighted people of working age in the UK (not including conditions which can be corrected by glasses or contact lenses). The majority have some useful vision. They represent a huge pool of potential employees.</p>

<p>Advances in technology mean that blind and partially sighted people can now overcome many of the barriers to work that they faced in the past. With the right training, skills and experience a blind or partially sighted person can do just about any job. Just like any other worker, they will need the right tools to do the job, for example additional tools that reduce or eliminate the need for eyesight.</p>

<p>Adjustments for a blind or partially sighted employee include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>offering additional training about visual impairments for other colleagues</li>
  <li>making alterations to the working environment</li>
  <li>supplying documents in audio or Braille formats</li>
  <li>carrying out a risk assessment of the workplace</li>
  <li>arranging a tour of the workplace</li>

<h4>Dyspraxia (developmental co-ordination disorder)</h4>

<p>Co-ordination difficulties associated with dyspraxia (<abbr title="Developmental co-ordination disorder">DCD</abbr>) can affect many areas of everyday life, such as learning to drive or ride a bicycle and acquiring fluent word processing skills. Some people with dyspraxia appear clumsy, with weak muscle tone. They may also have poor social skills and come across as abrupt.

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Epilepsy</h3>

<p>Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain. When someone has epilepsy, it means they have a tendency to have epileptic seizures.</p>

<p>Anyone can have a one-off seizure, but this doesn’t always mean they have epilepsy. Epilepsy is usually only diagnosed if someone has had more than one seizure, and doctors think it is likely they could have more.</p>

<p>Epilepsy can start at any age and there are many different types. Some types of epilepsy last for a limited time and the person eventually stops having seizures. For many people epilepsy is a life-long condition.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Stammering</h3>

<p>Stammering is hard to define even though everyone knows it when they hear it. Stammering is typically recognised by a tense struggle to get words out, characterised by repetition or prolongation of sounds, and silent blocks (known as ‘overt stammering’). However, many people who stammer have developed techniques to hide it (known as ‘covert stammering’).</p>

<p>We know that stammering has no influence on someone’s intelligence or abilities. However, personal experiences can affect educational attainment, career choice, professional success and even mental health.</p>

<p>Stammering varies tremendously from person to person and is highly variable for the person who stammers.They may be fluent one minute and struggling to speak the next.</p>

<p>Stammering affects about 500,000 adults in the UK, including 380,000 adults of working age.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis</h3>

<p>Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. In Crohn’s and Colitis, the immune system starts attacking the body. This causes painful ulcers and inflammation in the gut.</p>

<p>Everyone experiences the conditions differently, but the main symptoms include tummy pain, diarrhoea, fatigue, and blood or mucus in poo. Other parts of the body can also be affected: from your digestion and joints to your energy levels and mental health.</p>

<p>Crohn’s and Colitis are invisible, because you cannot tell by looking at someone that they have the condition. These are lifelong conditions, but this does not mean that someone with the condition will always be unwell. Treatments like medicines and surgery can help keep symptoms under control.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span>Dwarfism</h3>

<p>A person with dwarfism is typically under the height of 4 foot 10 inches, there are over 200 different types of dwarfism, with around 7,000 people in the UK having one of these dwarfism types. 80% of people with dwarfism are born to average height parents and their condition is as a result of a spontaneous mutation. Some forms of dwarfism can be passed down to children.</p>

<p>Many conditions of dwarfism can have some medical complications, but most people have an average life expectancy and intelligence, proving themselves to be productive members of society. Slight adaptations may be required in the workplace for a person with dwarfism, however speaking with the person with dwarfism will determine the extent of these adaptions, however this should not be a barrier for a person with dwarfism to undertake their work commitments.</p>
