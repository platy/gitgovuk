<h2>Plastic packaging designed for use in the supply chain</h2>

<p>This is packaging designed to be used in the supply chain from the manufacturer to the user or consumer. It is used for the containment, protection, handling, delivery, or presentation of goods.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/work-out-which-packaging-is-subject-to-plastic-packaging-tax#supplychain">read the definition of packaging designed for use at any stage in the supply chain</a>.</p>

<p>If the packaging component meets this definition, it does not matter if it is produced or imported for use in the supply chain of the goods, or by a consumer or user.</p>

<h3>Examples in scope of the tax</h3>
