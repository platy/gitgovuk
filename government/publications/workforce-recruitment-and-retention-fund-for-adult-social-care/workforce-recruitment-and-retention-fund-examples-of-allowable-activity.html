<h2>Examples of allowable activity</h2>

<p>This document sets out a range of tried and tested initiatives which other local authorities and care providers have successfully implemented to increase adult social care workforce capacity.&nbsp;</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This range of initiatives is&nbsp;for the purpose of&nbsp;providing&nbsp;illustrative examples. Use of the fund&nbsp;is&nbsp;not limited to this range&nbsp;so long as&nbsp;the conditions of the funding are met.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p>We expect that local authorities will work closely with local care providers and care provider representatives to&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;a realistic assessment of&nbsp;the local labour market,&nbsp;workforce issues and the extent of staff absence.</p>

<p>Skills for Care’s&nbsp;area teams&nbsp;can support local authorities to set up staffing capacity measures and workforce planning. Local authorities should contact their Skills for Care&nbsp;area team&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Getting-involved/In-your-area/In-your-area.aspx" class="govuk-link">using the contact details on the Skills for Care website</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/our-support/sector-support-offer/care-and-health-improvement" class="govuk-link">care and health improvement programme</a> led by the <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Local Government Association</a> (<abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr>) and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.adass.org.uk/">Association of Directors of Adult Services</a> (<abbr title="Association of Directors of Adult Services">ADASS</abbr>) can also provide examples or more bespoke support to local authorities on how best to use the fund.</p>

<p>Local care provider associations may also be able to support the set-up of staffing capacity measures. A&nbsp;list of care provider associations can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.caa.care/" class="govuk-link">Care Association Alliance website</a> (this is limited to members of the Care Association Alliance).</p>

<p>National care organisations may be able to connect local members to work more closely around these issues. See a&nbsp;<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://careprovideralliance.org.uk/">full list of national organisations that work together as the Care Provider Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>If appropriate, local authorities should work with their local resilience forum or clinical commissioning group (<abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>) to identify additional sources of support.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care’s (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s) regional team can also provide support and guidance on models of best practice and on delivery of the fund.</p>

<h2>Examples from the Workforce Capacity Fund</h2>

<p>The Workforce Capacity Fund was a £120 million fund introduced by the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> for the adult social care sector to supplement and strengthen staff capacity to meet critical staffing shortages caused by coronavirus. This fund was part of a wider package of support put in place by the government to support the sector during the pandemic.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workforce-capacity-fund-for-adult-social-care/workforce-capacity-fund-outcomes-and-findings-october-2021" class="govuk-link">Workforce Capacity Fund evaluation</a> was published on 3 November 2021.</p>

<p>Learning can be taken from this previous fund to inform the implementation of recruitment and retention activities using the Workforce Recruitment and Retention Fund.</p>

<h2>Examples of local authority and provider staffing initiatives</h2>

<p>The below local authority-led initiatives have been collated through the&nbsp;<abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr>, Skills for Care&nbsp;and&nbsp;<abbr title="Association of Directors of Adult Services">ADASS</abbr>&nbsp;networks. Local authorities should note that the examples contained in this guidance are not an exhaustive list. The grant may be used to fund alternative approaches not specified within this document, including those delivered by care providers, on the condition that such measures generate sufficient adult social care workforce capacity where shortages arise due to winter pressures.</p>

<p>Examples below include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>establishing or expanding local authority staff banks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supporting administrative tasks so that more experienced and/or trained staff can focus on providing care</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>redeployment of existing staff into new roles. This would cover local authority employed staff as well as staff from other services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>local recruitment initiatives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>funding new training costs for new recruits or to increase productivity of existing staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provisions for personal assistants</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other types of workforce capacity measures</h3>

<p>As per this guidance and the Section 31 grant determination letter, local authorities can pass some or all the funding directly to&nbsp;Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>)-registered care providers to allow them to implement measures that generate additional staffing capacity in the most effective way to address staff shortages.</p>

Since its creation, it has run   as a 7-days-a-week, in-and-out-of-hours service for   all care providers in Hertfordshire. A telephone line and dedicated   email is staffed by a team of 12 staff, all of whom have specific   knowledge of the sector, allowing them to support all types   of providers.

And in Lancashire, the local authority set up the   Lancashire Temporary Staffing Agency (LTSA) during the first wave of the   pandemic.

Providers can access the casual worker pool at a   subsidised rate and deploy staff into their services. They reimburse the local authority   the staff cost minus 20% which equates to the provider paying £9 per   hour.</td>

This would involve the rapid support of staff   at risk of redundancy to find an alternate suitable role within the sector   that fills a capacity gap.</td>

This was a 3-stage virtual learning   course covering bespoke training in key aspects of care that was tailored to   the roles staff would   be redeployed into. They complemented the training   with shadowing opportunities and offered extended training for   staff who would be redeployed for a longer period.</td>

      <td>Redeployment</td>
      <td>In Suffolk County Council’s ‘Preparing to Care’   programme, staff in their adult services team were trained to be redeployed   into frontline care roles to provide reablement support. The local authority designed an   upskilling programme tailored to the existing capability of local authority staff and the   roles they would be redeployed into and were able to place staff into roles   requiring differing level of skills and experience. Other redeployment   schemes in Blackpool and Nottinghamshire have successfully   redeployed existing staff into support roles such as cleaners,   chefs, and drivers.</td>

<h2>Key considerations</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Where&nbsp;care home providers&nbsp;are deploying bank staff in&nbsp;their&nbsp;services, they should continue to follow the latest guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricting-workforce-movement-between-care-homes-and-other-care-settings">workforce movement between care homes and other care settings</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local authorities should consider their options for&nbsp;making available&nbsp;re-deployed&nbsp;staff&nbsp;from within the&nbsp;local authority,&nbsp;or from&nbsp;independent care providers&nbsp;who may have capacity and are able&nbsp;to collaborate,&nbsp;into other roles or settings to best meet workforce demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When implementing staffing&nbsp;capacity&nbsp;measures such as&nbsp;redeployment, care providers must ensure that they are operating within the margins of their indemnity insurance, checking with insurance providers where necessary that existing indemnity and insurance arrangements for employer and public liability are adequate to cover redeployed workers. Whoever is directing the work of the worker, usually the receiving employer, will be responsible for ensuring there is an appropriate indemnity in place. The local authority may wish to consider the use of mutual aid agreements with appropriate documentation to facilitate redeployment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local authorities&nbsp;and providers&nbsp;should utilise the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Recruitment-retention/COVID-19/Sharing-recruitment-solutions.aspx" rel="external">Skills for Care resources on recruitment solutions</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local authorities and providers should consider how they can best support the mental health and wellbeing of existing care staff to ensure they are supported in carrying out their roles and the workforce is able to be used to its maximum capacity. The government has worked alongside the NHS and other organisations to&nbsp;provide&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-health-and-wellbeing-of-the-adult-social-care-workforce/health-and-wellbeing-of-the-adult-social-care-workforce" class="govuk-link">package of emotional, psychological and practical resources for the workforce</a>. This package includes support helplines, guidance, bereavement resources and webinars for registered managers.&nbsp;To make it easier for employers and staff to locate relevant resources, we have also supported Skills for Care in developing the online <a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Leadership-management/managing-people/Wellbeing/Wellbeing-tool/Wellbeing-tool.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Workforce wellbeing resource finder</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may also be helpful for care providers to note that the Working Time Regulations 1998 were amended in March 2020 to enable workers to carry forward their statutory leave into their next 2 leave years where it is not reasonably practicable for a worker to take some or all their leave as a result of the effects of coronavirus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local authorities and care providers may wish to consider potential barriers to care staff taking on additional hours. One of these may be the impact of staff working extra hours on benefit entitlement and passported benefits to other support schemes such as free school meals. The impact of increasing weekly hours on the benefit entitlement of care staff will vary depending on individual circumstance. However, as a result of the flexibilities in the system such as the work allowance in Universal Credit and the income disregard in Tax Credits, many are likely to experience an increase in total income by taking on additional paid hours. The&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits">government has guidance where claimants can find more information about interactions between income and their benefits</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local authorities should consider whether there are trained individuals who have been made redundant from care providers which have exited the market and so would be able to transition quickly into a new care setting. However, there may also be individuals without care experience who have recently been made redundant and may require support applying to the care sector and training, which the local authority could use this funding to help coordinate.</p>

<h3>Free resources to support recruitment and redeployment</h3>

<p>Local authorities and social care providers are reminded that the Home Office and <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> have put temporary arrangements in place to allow remote ID and Right to Work Checks, free-of-charge standard and enhanced <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks and fast-track Barred List checks for COVID-19 related recruitment. Employers can choose to appoint staff based on a satisfactory Barred List check while waiting for the full <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check, if waiting would cause undue delay.</p>

<p>This offer applies to healthcare and social care workers in England and Wales, being recruited in connection with the provision of care and treatment of coronavirus, or those being recruited to backfill roles because of the impact of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Additionally, the department is continuing to offer&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/About/News/COVID-19-Essential-training.aspx">rapid online induction training to help induct and train redeployed staff, new starters, existing staff and new volunteers in social care services</a>. This training is provided free of charge when accessed through Skills for Care.</p>

<h2>Other support from the department</h2>

<p>In order to attract more people to the care sector the department ran a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/adult-social-care-campaign-to-build-bigger-and-better-workforce">national recruitment campaign</a>&nbsp; across broadcast, digital and social media. The next phase of the campaign was launched on 3 November 2021 and runs through to March 2022. Advertising will run across radio, video on demand and digital channels, with high profile bursts of TV advertising in November and January. Activity will maximise visibility of job opportunities and raise the profile of the care sector as a rewarding and stimulating place to work.</p>

<p>In 2020 to 2021, the department provided £26.3 million funding to Skills for Care to deliver strategic social care workforce priorities, and we are continuing to fund this activity in 2021 to 2022. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the Workforce Development Fund (<abbr title="Workforce Development Fund">WDF</abbr>), which provides social care employers with funding to contribute to the costs of the continuing professional development of the adult social care workforce</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rapid response training as part of the <abbr title="Workforce Development Fund">WDF</abbr>, providing induction training to support employers to recruit through the pandemic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supporting registered managers (including additional support though COVID-19)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>activity to support the department’s recruitment and retention ambitions, such as supporting our national recruitment campaign and working with the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) to promote adult social care careers to job seekers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, we are aware of the pressures currently facing the sector as a result of increased workforce capacity pressures and are working with local authorities and providers to ensure we are doing everything we can to support care services during this challenging period.</p>
