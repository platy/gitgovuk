<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This notice explains how the rules are applied to this quota and how to apply for a licence. The olive oil (originating in Tunisia) quota year is 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022. There will be an application window at the start of each month throughout the quota year until the quantity is exhausted. Details of the quantity available in the May 2022 application window are given in Annex 1 of this notice.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>To apply for a quota licence you must be established and registered for VAT in the UK. You must tell us your current VAT registration number. You can provide your VAT number on your quota licence application or send us a copy of your current VAT certificate. However, if your company is part of a group VAT registration number, we will need to see a copy of your current VAT certificate before the quota deadline.
HMRC agents or representatives cannot apply for import licences under these quota arrangements.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>Before you submit a licence application you must make sure that you are registered with the RPA. If your company is not registered, a company director or an individual legally responsible for the business must apply for a six-digit Trader Registration Number.</p>

<p>You will need to telephone our Rural Payments Helpline on 03000 200 301 and select options 3, 2, 1 and 3 and ask to be registered as a trader. (These options are correct at the time of publication, but they are liable to change without notice).</p>

<p>Your quota application must be received during the application window, the1st and 6th May 2022. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application, all additional documentation and the security are correct at the time of submission and they are received by the RPA before 5pm on the 6 May 2022.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> We will reject any applications where the security is received after 5pm on 6 May 2022.</p>

<p>You must submit your licence applications using an AGRIM import licence application form. We advise you to use the latest version of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agrim-import-licence-application-form-for-agricultural-products">application form</a>. You can submit applications either by post or by email. The email address for licence applications is <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:trader@rpa.gov.uk">trader@rpa.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>If you intend to submit your application by e-mail, please ensure that your email address is approved by the RPA. Please complete an il3 form to register e-mail addresses for approval. We recommend that your email address is approved before you send your application as this will avoid unnecessary delays.
Your application must not exceed the quantity available. You must not lodge more than one import quota licence application for the same order number.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> If you lodge more than one application for the same order number, all your applications will be rejected.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>You must lodge a security of £170 per tonne with your licence application.
You can find further information on how to lodge your security by searching for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/licence-securities-for-the-importexport-of-agricultural-products">‘Licence securities for the import/export of agricultural products’</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Completing a licence application</h3>

<p>As part of the olive oil import tariff quota, licence applications must include at least the following entries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Box 8 of your application must state the country of origin of the product and you must select this as ‘Yes’. Licences will carry an obligation to import from the country stated; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Box 20 of your application must contain the correct import tariff quota order number. You must also include “Statutory Instrument 2020/1432”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not sure of the Combined Nomenclature (CN) code for your product (box 16) you should contact HMRC by sending an email containing as much information about the product as possible to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:classification.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk.">classification.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk.</a> They will be able to provide you with the correct code and description.</p>

<h3>Issuing Licences</h3>

<p>As soon as the application window has closed, we will collate details of all valid quota applications we received and calculate the reduction coefficient applicable. Details of the reduction coefficient will be published on the gov.uk website. Licences will be issued electronically towards the end of May 2022 and will be valid from 1 June 2022 until the end of the quota year, 31 December 2022.
The reduction in duty will only be valid for the quantities shown in sections 17 and 18 of your licence.</p>

<p>As licences will only be valid for imports into the UK, your licence will be issued electronically. We no longer issue paper import licences. Where an electronic licence is issued an email can be sent to inform you of its issue. To receive this email notification, you must have already completed the appropriate sections of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/licences-for-the-importexport-of-agricultural-products">il3 form</a>.</p>
