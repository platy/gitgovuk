<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Defence Science and Technology Portfolio is a series of programmes and standalone projects designed to meet the Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>)’s capability needs and to ensure the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> armed forces remain at the cutting edge of technology.</p>

<p>This guide gives an overview of each programme and standalone project for the benefit of industry, academia, other government and non-government organisations and partners.</p>

<p>To deliver on the scale and ambition set out by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/angela-mclean"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s Chief Scientific Adviser</a> will require a whole-of-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> effort as well as collaboration and cooperation from international allies.</p>

<p>Sustaining strategic advantage through science and technology (<abbr title="science and technology">S&amp;T</abbr>) is the first objective of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy">combined security, defence, development and foreign policy</a>.</p>

<p>The coming decade will see the ability to advance and exploit science and technology as an increasingly important metric of global power and an essential driver of economic, political, and military competition.</p>

<p>Thus, sustaining the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s status of a science and technology superpower and retaining these associated advantages is crucial for our national security and prosperity.</p>

<p>Over the next 4 years, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> will invest at least £6.6 billion in research and development (<abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>) and this Science and Technology Portfolio will ensure defence sustains operational advantage, can make the right decisions, and generate prosperity for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Predominantly, the following programmes and projects will be delivered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory">Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>)</a>, but partners in industry and academia will be crucial to delivery with significant funding available and opportunities to collaborate.</p>

<p>The portfolio has been designed by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/defence-science-and-technology">Defence Science and Technology</a> in partnership with our stakeholders to ensure <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s science and technology activities:</p>

<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>Through science and technology, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has advanced options to enable resilience, reach and autonomous interoperability in its communications and networks in order to enable <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/multi-domain-integration">multi-domain integration</a> and deliver against defence’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/multi-domain-integration#how-are-we-achieving-multi-domain-integration">multi-domain <abbr title="command and control, communications and computers">C4</abbr> challenge</a>.</p>

<p>Defence is already facing the challenges of increased demand for information, with more sensors collecting more data, and increased speed of data analysis and decision-making with machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for communication resources, due to the growth in novel battlefield assets, such as remote and autonomous systems. All these systems require access to the electromagnetic spectrum for communications, for information, and for command and control.</p>

<p>The Communications and Networks programme will be investing in potential solutions to these challenges, from the novel use of the electromagnetic spectrum, alternative communications mechanisms, adaptive and autonomous networks, and novel data routing algorithms, to improve the availability of secure information to military systems and decision-makers at the time and place of need.</p>

<p>The programme is looking to grow and access a diverse community of suppliers, including universities and academics, non-traditional defence suppliers, as well as the established defence primes, in order to stimulate innovation and to accelerate potential solutions through to concept demonstration.</p>

<h3>Technical challenges</h3>

<p>We anticipate an increasing requirement for military systems to communicate and to sense, while defending against electronic and cyber-attack, and for this to be done in close proximity, if not simultaneously, in time, in the electromagnetic spectrum and using the same sub-systems. We refer to this as <abbr title="command and control, computing, communications, cyber and information">C5I</abbr> convergence (command and control, computing, communications, cyber and information).</p>

<p>To achieve this we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop and demonstrate concepts for <abbr title="command and control, computing, communications, cyber and information">C5I</abbr> convergence and integration</li>
  <li>develop and prototype architectures for resilient networks and data services</li>
  <li>develop and prototype resilient communications bearers and waveforms</li>
  <li>develop and prototype technologies for future beyond-line-of-sight communications</li>
</ul>

<h3>Capabilities</h3>

<p>The programme will invest to grow the communications and networks, and information systems capabilities, through enhanced collaboration and partnership with industry, with academia and with wider government.</p>

<h3>Benefits to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> defence and security</h3>

<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>Establishing a suite of scientific and technical demonstrators and research projects to enhance defence understanding of potential solutions to support and sustainability problems.</p>

<h3>Technical challenges</h3>

<h4>Defence, climate and sustainability</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministry-of-defence-climate-change-and-sustainability-strategic-approach"><abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Climate Change and Sustainability (<abbr title="Climate Change and Sustainability">CC&amp;S</abbr>) Strategic Approach</a> sets out the ambition, principles and methods needed for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> defence to meet the challenges of climate change.</p>

<p>If you are working on solutions that will help address the most pressing current sustainability issues and emission targets we want to hear from you to help develop an understanding of the potential options for research studies and demonstrators to enable defence to assure and sustain capabilities given climate change and meet national and departmental aspirations, including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy">Net Zero 2050</a>.</p>

<h4>Defence logistics and support</h4>

<p>Logistics and support is a critical task for <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and represents a significant proportion of defence expenditure. We want to work with you to identify future technologies and processes that can deliver a step change for defence support, and subsequently future <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, including baselining future energy requirements, future energy technologies, utilising data science, autonomy and automation, modern maintenance regimes, additive manufacturing techniques and influencing culture and behaviours.</p>

<h2>Projects:</h2>

<p>The following sections cover 4 standalone projects of the Defence Science and Technology Portfolio that have significant funding and collaborative opportunities for industry and academia.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Engineering Biology</h2>
<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Graphic of DNA" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151738/SS2022_101Engineering_biology_960x640.png"></div></figure>

<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>Synthetic biology can be defined as the design and fabrication of biological components and systems that do not already exist in the natural world, for useful purposes. Engineering biology is the process of identifying synthetic biology solutions and translating them into products, or in <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s terms, capability.</p>

<p>Engineering biology is a disruptive technology. Synthetic biology and engineering biology can provide new capability for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> defence and security, solving historically intractable defence problems.</p>

<h3>Technical challenges</h3>

<p>The top 3 challenge areas identified as potentially benefitting for engineering biology approaches have been identified as:</p>

<h4>Materials</h4>

<p>Current processes to make existing military grade materials suffer from various drawbacks: availability of raw materials, unsustainable costs, high energy consumption, handling of toxic waste, and possibly compromising on some desirable properties to meet performance requirements. For many of these problems, traditional materials approaches have made progress but are facing diminishing returns on their efforts.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Government has also made commitments to zero carbon targets in the future, which means pursuing less energy-intense approaches.</p>

<p>Consequently, availability of many military relevant materials becomes limited and poses potential supply-chain risks for these countries.</p>

<p>There is also a pressing need for novel materials to provide new or enhanced capabilities, such as functional materials, where existing traditional materials science approaches have failed to make much progress.</p>

<h4>Power and energy</h4>

<p>Engineering biology concepts could provide a step change in power and energy provision, addressing several challenges currently faced in the area.</p>

<p>High energy batteries can be flammable and explosive when abused. Approaches that can mitigate this either at the chemistry level by using novel cell materials or using engineered biology materials to prevent fire and thermal runaway as an appliqué to standard commercial off-the-shelf cells would be of interest.</p>

<p>Despite significant research and advances in batteries (and other power sources) new military capability still require higher energy rechargeable batteries in smaller weights and volumes. Next-generation rechargeable batteries promise over 400 watt-hour per kilogram and 800 watt-hours per litre but there is interest in any technology that can improve these metrics even further. Primary (non-rechargeable) batteries are used less often, but are still used where their even higher specific energy and energy density warrants it. Engineered biology approaches to produce very high specific energy (&gt;500 watt-hour per kilogram) and (1000 watt-hours per litre) single use batteries would also be of interest.</p>

<h4>Sensing</h4>

<p>Sensing is a fundamental enabler of defence and security activities. However, there is always a requirement for more sensitive sensors to a wider range of stimuli. Robustness is also necessary to avoid, for example, dazzling of sensitive sensors.</p>

<h3>Capabilities</h3>

<p>Delivery of this programme requires capabilities in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chemical, biological, and radiological</li>
  <li>human and social sciences</li>
  <li>explosives and energetics</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Human Augmentation</h2>
<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Virtual person next to soldier" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151739/SS2022_102_Human_augmentation_960x640.png"></div></figure>

<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>To&nbsp;provide a single, coherent and targeted focus for science and technology to inform the defence vision, achieve desired outcomes and lead the strategic ambition for human augmentation (<abbr title="human augmentation">HA</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Technical challenges</h3>

<p>The Human Augmentation project is collaborating with academia and industry to facilitate the generation of innovative approaches that will answer the question: ‘Where could human augmentation technologies be applied to achieve competitive advantage for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> defence and security?’</p>

<p>The project is interested in generation-after-next technologies that deliver a competitive advantage to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> defence and security by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>optimising physical and/or psychological performance</li>
  <li>enhancing physical and/or psychological performance</li>
  <li>enabling an individual to work sustainably and for longer at a desired level (at or above the normal baseline) of performance</li>
  <li>countering, or overcoming, those factors that challenge performance and delivering ways to effectively restore previously achieved performance</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of candidate human augmentation technologies include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>wearable assistive devices (such as exoskeletons, devices to enhance senses)</li>
  <li>sensory enhancement technologies</li>
  <li>nutritional supplements</li>
  <li>pharmacological interventions</li>
  <li>manipulation of the microbiomes</li>
  <li>neurotechnologies</li>
  <li>novel materials</li>
  <li>implantable devices</li>
  <li>synthetic biology</li>
  <li>cross reality (for example virtual reality, mixed reality, augmented reality)</li>
  <li>robotics</li>
</ul>

<p>Further examples can be obtained from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-technology-framework">Defence Technology Framework 2019</a>, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/human-augmentation-the-dawn-of-a-new-paradigm">Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) strategic implementation paper 2021</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to exploring novel technologies (as well as considering novel ways to use combinations of existing technologies), the project is developing tools to support the potential implementation of human augmentation technologies by informing strategies that test and evaluate potential options. This includes the development of an ethical framework for human augmentation and the use of wargaming.</p>

<p>The project is also working with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> armed forces to identify their problems, the challenges that they face (now and in the future) and their likely needs. The intent is to explore where human augmentation technologies could be applied to support the personnel who defend the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and maintain national security.</p>
