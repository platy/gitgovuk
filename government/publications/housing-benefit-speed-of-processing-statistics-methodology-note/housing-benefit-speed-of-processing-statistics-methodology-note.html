<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Context of the statistics</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> What is Housing Benefit?</h3>

<p>Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) is an income related benefit which is provided to households in order to help them meet housing costs for rented accommodation.  This is available to those who are either unemployed, on a low income or in receipt of other benefits.</p>

<p>The claimant may get help with all or part of their rent. There is no set amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> for claimants as entitlement is dependent on whether they are renting privately or from a Local Authority (<abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>) or council.</p>

<p>For claimants meeting certain conditions, <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> has been replaced by Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Eligibility requirements</h3>

<p>The eligibility requirements for making a new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are single and have reached State Pension (<abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr>) age</li>
  <li>they are living with a partner and both have reached <abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr> age</li>
  <li>they are living with a partner and one has reached <abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr> age and started claiming Pension Credit before 15 May 2019</li>
  <li>they are in supported, sheltered or temporary housing</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, people in receipt of the Severe Disability Premium (<abbr title="Severe Disability Premium">SDP</abbr>) were also included in eligibility requirements. However as of January 2021, the Severe Disability Gateway has closed, so claimants must meet one of the current eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>Existing claimants can continue to receive <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> if they were in receipt of it before 15 May 2019 and had reached <abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr> age. However, if a claimant reports a change of circumstance to an existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim and it is subsequently stopped, a claimant cannot reapply for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> unless they meet the current eligibility criteria. Instead, they may be able to apply for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> if they are eligible for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> has replaced <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> for all other eligible groups.</p>

<p>Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/housing-benefit"><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> eligibility</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> What is Housing Benefit Speed of Processing?</h3>

<p><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Speed of Processing (<abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr>) refers to how long it takes for LAs to process a new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim or a change of circumstances to an existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim.</p>

<p>It is the average time taken, calculated as the average (mean) processing time in calendar days, rounded to the nearest day.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> publication is released quarterly. Monthly, quarterly and annual statistics are provided at Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) level, as well as the regional and <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> level.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Purpose of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> statistics</h2>

<p><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> official statistics provide users with the volume of new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims and change of circumstances to existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims processed by each <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>, per month or quarter, and the associated total amount of time (in days) to process them.</p>

<p>A simple calculation is then made to determine the average time taken to process each new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim or change of circumstances to an existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim for each <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>, known as the average speed of processing.</p>

<p>Year-end figures are provided to explain trends without the impact of seasonal variation and are also rounded to the nearest day.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="#User-consultation-exercise">section 9</a> which outlines the findings from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP’s</abbr> user consultation exercise in 2019 that showed these statistics are used in debates on the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> systems.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Data source</h2>

<p>The Single Housing Benefit Extract (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>) is the most comprehensive administrative <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> dataset for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, containing individual level claims data on all <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants.</p>

<p>The data received from <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> is classified as ‘unmasked’; meaning it contains unencrypted information including national insurance number, full address and postcode.</p>

<p>In order to comply with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions/about/personal-information-charter"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP’s</abbr> personal information charter</a>, the individual level data is encrypted by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Data Delivery Team (<abbr title="Data Delivery Team">DDT</abbr>) and personal identifiers are removed and replaced with non-identifiable markers, for example, encrypted national insurance number, or census output area codes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Data collection</h3>
<p>Every month each <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> will submit an extract of all claims on their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> system. Note, submissions are not mandatory however are encouraged. This raw extract includes details of all claims live or awaiting decision on the extract date, claims closed since the previous extract, and various details of activity since the last extract (for example, records for changes of circumstance, appeals and overpayments). This information is compiled into a single, encrypted data extract by <abbr title="Data Delivery Team">DDT</abbr>.</p>

<p>For any single, reported quarter of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> statistics, 5 <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> scans are used to capture the latest <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim position and incorporate any retrospection beyond the main reference quarter.</p>

<p>This means that data from the 3 months in the publication quarter along with the 2 consecutive months following the quarter are required. This ensures that the most up to date information is included in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> calculation at the time it is made.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> excludes cases that, where <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> data indicates, have taken more than 12 months to process from all <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> statistics. Quality assurance (<abbr title="Quality assurance">QA</abbr>) work indicates that the majority of these cases are a result of processing or software errors. Therefore, their inclusion in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> statistics would distort the calculation and provide an inaccurate picture of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> performance.</p>

<p>Statistical code is then run against the individual level data to clean, link to other data sources to attach markers (including geographical) and the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> measure is calculated, before aggregating up to monthly, quarterly and annual totals.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Statistics calculations</h3>

<p>The ‘total number of processing days’ for each new claim or a change of circumstance for an existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim, is calculated by looking at the difference between the ‘date of receipt’ to the ‘date of decision’ for each claim.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> is then calculated by dividing the ‘total number of processing days’ by the ‘total volume of claims’ for a given geography (<abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>, region or <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>).</p>

<p>Quarterly average year-end calculations are also used throughout the statistical release to help describe trends. This can be thought of as a moving average and helps to smoothen any seasonality in the volume and speed of processing timeseries. Included in the following table is an example of how we calculate year-end figures.</p>

<p>The table shows how the quarterly <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> at year-end is calculated, by summing the four previous quarters of total days processed and dividing by the four previous quarters of volumes to give an average year-end <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr>. The quarterly <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> is shown as a comparison. All <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> figures have been rounded to the nearest calendar day. Note, average year-end figures for the first three quarters shown have been omitted as four quarters’ worth of data are required to produce the figure.</p>

<p>Taking the quarter 4 2019 to 2020 <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> at year-end as an example, using the figures from the table above, this is calculated as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Quarter 4 <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> at year-end = (1871211 + 1669012 + 1455059 + 1548740) / (100952 + 98623 + 90836 + 92706)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quarter 4 <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> at year-end = 17.08 = 17 days (rounded to nearest calendar day)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<span class="number">5. </span> Quality management</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Quality assurance</h3>

<p>Data are further analysed, before the population of statistical tables, using <abbr title="statistical analysis system">SAS</abbr> software by producing a 40-month historical pdf summary of each <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>’s <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> for both change of circumstances and new claims. Month 40 is the latest month in the current publication quarter.</p>

<p>Each <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> has a ‘laser’ which is just a unique identifier (number). Any LAs that <abbr title="statistical analysis system">SAS</abbr> considers to have fallen outside of an acceptable tolerance range are subject to human (manual) intervention.</p>

<p>The basic aim is to check the three latest months for each <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> and pay attention to any ‘spikes’ or anything that looks unusual, indicating an extreme high or low speed of processing. The full time series can be used as an indication of any previous anomalies or trends.</p>

<p>For any LAs identified as potentially having outliers, the underlying data can be cross-referenced and investigated alongside the data issues log provided by the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> data experts for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> for any known live issues and the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> user group.</p>

<h4>Example of the average days per case for a particular <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>
</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/133502/Figure_3.jpg"></div></figure>

<h4>Example <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> showing a sharp increase in their <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> in month 39, indicating that there may be issues with this data</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/133503/Figure_4.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Upon checking the claim <abbr title="Quality assurance">QA</abbr> outputs, this doesn’t indicate that there was an abnormally high number of cases processed by this <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> in the latest month</p>

<p>Finally, upon checking the issues log, it was identified that this <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> had severe backlogs explaining their increased <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr>. Therefore, the decision was made for this LAs data to remain in the publication as there was a valid reason for their increased <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, additional <abbr title="Quality assurance">QA</abbr> processes are in place for the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> publication that are consistent across all <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistical production processes. These include rigorous internal team and stakeholder quality checks and multiple layers of sign-off.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Exclusions</h3>

<p>For any LAs that cannot be identified as having genuine outliers, there is an option of excluding them.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> retain the right to remove any figures that are questionable and where investigation/resolution of these figures would become a proportionate burden. This is assessed on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Exclusions are made where data are not fit for purpose and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to withhold any figures that are not fit for purpose in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk" rel="external">code of practice for statistics</a>. Individual explanations for the exclusion of data in each publication is not routinely published.</p>

<p>The existing aggregation method means that quarterly data will not be available if all underlying months of that quarter are not available. Similarly, with annual data, if all underlying quarters are not available. This is to ensure that any current data are comparable with historical data.</p>

<p>When <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> analysts have agreed exclusions, a final caseload dataset is created.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> statistical outputs</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> ODS tables</h3>

<p>Here is an example of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/915040/hb-speed-of-processing-january-march-2020-tables-revised-sept-2020.ods" rel="external">ODS tables</a>.</p>

<p>After successful <abbr title="Quality assurance">QA</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> runs code that automatically populates a set of ODS tables, containing one tab for each output measure – a quarterly summary all in one table, monthly totals by <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> for total number of processing days, number of claims and the calculated average speed of processing and finally a quarterly timeseries. Furthermore, for the final quarter of each financial year, the publication includes an annual table with the monthly data aggregated to annual level for the entire financial year.</p>

<p>Within the ODS tables, monthly figures may not sum to quarterly totals, and quarterly figures may not sum to annual totals. This is because LAs may have suppressed or missing data at a monthly level that is then not included in quarterly total calculation. And similarly, suppressed or missing quarterly data may not be included in annual total calculations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> HTML statistics bulletin</h3>

<p>This is produced by firstly compiling a draft Microsoft Word version of the release. This then goes through several iterations of <abbr title="Quality assurance">QA</abbr>. Finally, it is then converted into HTML format by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> analysts and published on GOV.UK by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> content designers.

The latest quarter data is appended to the previous data in the case of the time series charts. These are at a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> level.</p>

<p>The maps are created using individual average <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> level data. If any <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> has an average <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> of zero, then their data is omitted from the maps. The map ranges (keys or bins) are created by allocating LAs to one of five bins based on an equal proportion of LAs being allocated to each bin, where possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Timeliness</h3>

<p>There is a four-month lag in data availability, due to the way the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> data source is obtained and the final aggregated analytical dataset is constructed (to provide the most up to date base data to calculate accurate <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr>).</p>

<p>Therefore, taking January’s publication for example, data would include up to the end of September of the previous year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Data revision</h3>

<p>In line with statistical protocols – revisions will be published transparently both here and on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-benefit-and-council-tax-benefit-statistics-on-speed-of-processing--2">collection page</a>.</p>

<p>Revisions due to conceptual or methodological changes will be announced at least three months before publication and this document will be updated accordingly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Confidentiality</h3>

<p>Rounding policy – the number of claims and number of processing days are unrounded in the statistical ODS tables. The average speed of processing is calculated and then presented rounded, to the nearest whole day.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Status of the statistics</h2>
<p>These official statistics are compiled following the standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value set out within the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Assessment of quality</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Relevance</h3>

<p>The statistics provide users with monthly, quarterly and annual breakdowns of <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>’s <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> performance for new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims and change of circumstances to existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Accuracy and reliability</h3>

<p>The statistical bulletin provides clear and objective commentary on <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> performance. The statistics are illustrated using charts and maps which allow users to identify trends. Data are sourced from <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> which undergoes cleansing and the statistics undergo rigorous quality assurance procedures (as detailed in section 5) to ensure statistical accuracy. A list of limitations are outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Section-12">section 12</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span> Timeliness and punctuality</h3>

<p>Statistics are released quarterly which allow sufficient time for production of the statistics. There is six-week lag in data when it is obtained from <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> before production can begin. At the point of the release, the statistics are lagged by approximately four months.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span> Accessibility and clarity</h3>

<p>The statistical bulletin and ODS tables are released in accessible format and meet the guidelines set out within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accessibility-statement-for-dwp-statistics/accessibility-statement-for-dwp-statistics"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP’s</abbr> accessibility statement</a>. Future improvements will be made to the ODS tables to further improvement accessibility. The statistics are described in an objective manner and use plain English to assist users.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span> Coherence and comparability</h3>

<p>Where possible, <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <abbr title="Speed of Processing">SoP</abbr> statistics are comparable to historical data due to the use of consistent methodology. Engagement with other internal and external statisticians around data source uses and impacts, enables consistency across <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistical products. The format of our statistics bulletins remains consistent across subject areas, where possible, to ensure ease of reading and comparability. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Section-12">section 12</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.6 </span> Trade-off between output quality components</h3>

<p>Future improvements could be made to reduce the six-week lag in data from when it is first obtained however the production process has rigorous quality checks and therefore a trade-off exists between timeliness and accuracy of the statistics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.7 </span> Assessment of user needs and perceptions</h3>

<p>There is a clear user engagement strategy in place to ensure statistics are improved through meeting increased <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dwp-statistics-user-engagement-strategy">user needs</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.8 </span> Confidentiality, transparency and security</h3>

<p>Data used is subject to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP’s</abbr> strict security standards and any individual customer identifiable data is masked. Before statistical release, only a small number of authorised internal colleagues can access the statistics, in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk" rel="external">Code of Practice protocols</a> and these cannot be shared wider.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Limitations of the statistics</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span> Known issues</h3>

<p>Users of these statistics should be aware of the following limitations of the statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the quarterly statistics are produced at a point in time, they do not include later data retrospection</li>
  <li>inconsistency across tables due to suppression or omission of data. Users are advised to pick the right set of tables for their specific needs and be aware of differences in aggregated totals. Monthly figures may not sum to quarterly totals, and quarterly figures may not sum to annual totals. This is because LAs may have suppressed or missing data at a monthly level that is not included in the reported quarterly totals. If data is supressed at quarterly level then it will always be supressed in the year-end annual table totals</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span> Coherence</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Coherence with other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> publications that use <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-benefit-and-council-tax-benefit-caseload-statistics--2"><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-benefit-recoveries-and-fraud-data"><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Debt Recovery</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/benefit-cap-statistics">Benefit Cap</a> statistics to ensure that all publications are consistent. Where approaches are used in one publication, these are also used across other publications, where appropriate. For example, the handling of missing data, the formatting of charts and data. In some instances, it is deemed in the best interests of stakeholders and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistical producers to take a different approach to other publications – this is always outlined and explained in the publication if this approach has been taken</li>
  <li>Statistical release map ranges – LAs are allocated to one of five groups (bins) based on their average speed of processing for new claims and change of circumstances to an existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim. Although we aim to allocate an equal proportion of LAs to each bin, where the range of average speed of processing (in calendar days) is small across all LAs, this becomes more difficult. When these situations arise, then the best nearest split of LAs are allocated across the bins. This is more evident with change of circumstances to an existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim</li>
  <li>Statistical release maps resolution – since the removal of interactive maps and them being replaced with JPEG images within the statistical release itself, it is difficult to see individual <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> level data from the map images themselves without referring to the underlying data</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Definitions and terminology</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span> Processing times</h3>

<p>When calculating processing times all days should be counted including weekends and public holidays, not just working days. This must include any days when there are reasons for additional processing days beyond the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>’s control, for example, a customer’s failure to provide additional information and delays between offices. Speed of processing has replaced the Right Time Indicator statistics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span> Change of circumstances</h3>

<p>A change event means any notification or information received during the course of a benefit award from the customer or third party which leads to a decision on a claim whether or not entitlement is affected.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span> Effective dates</h3>

<p>If a change is notified in advance, that is before the date from which the change takes effect, the count for the processing time will start from the implementation date. If a decision is made on the change on or before the date the change takes effect, the time taken to process the change will be one day. However, if a decision is not made on the change by the date the change comes into effect, processing time will continue until the date a decision is made.</p>

<p>The following changes are excluded from the speed of processing information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automatic uprating of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> applicable amounts and social security benefits</li>
  <li>revisions to earlier decisions, for example, following a reconsideration, appeal and accuracy/management check</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.4 </span> Accessibility</h3>

<p>The publication adheres to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accessibility-statement-for-dwp-statistics/accessibility-statement-for-dwp-statistics"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> accessibility standards</a>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> wants as many people as possible to be able to use its statistical publications.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.5 </span> National statistics</h3>

<p>This means the statistics have been assessed by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics" rel="external">Office for Statistics Regulation</a> as fully compliant with the Code of Practice for Statistics.</p>
