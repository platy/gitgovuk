<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Purpose</h2>

<p>This operations note sets out the rules on the compatibility of England Woodland Creation Offer (<abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr>) payments, and payments for ecosystem services from other sources. This operations note clarifies where it is, and is not, compatible.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Background</h2>

<p>Land managers frequently ask whether they can access other sources of ecosystem services payments alongside <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> payments for delivering environmental outcomes from woodland creation. Circumstances may vary.</p>

<p>Defra is developing a policy framework for ecosystem market development. This will present overarching principles for high integrity ecosystem service markets in the UK, including principles for combining revenue streams from different sources within a single project, land parcel or investment (‘stacking’), arrangements for monitoring and evaluating the impacts of stacking rules in individual ecosystem markets and between ecosystem service markets, and the launch of a new process to accelerate the development of robust standards for ecosystem investment projects.</p>

<p>The policy framework will signpost detailed guidance and eligibility rules for individual schemes and markets including <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> and other forestry grants. Defra will be engaging stakeholders on a draft framework document over the Summer in advance of the planned update to government’s Green Finance Strategy in late 2022.</p>

<p>Defra will continue to provide and update scheme-specific rules and guidance, as appropriate, within the context of this policy framework and associated monitoring and evaluation programme.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Rules</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Land managers may be eligible to receive <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> payments in addition to payment for ecosystem services from other sources, subject to conditions.</li>
  <li>It is the applicant’s / agreement holder’s responsibility to determine whether the conditions for accessing payments for ecosystem services can be met, while also fulfilling their obligations as set out in the supporting guidance for <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Eligibility to receive payments for ecosystem services from other sources may be constrained by various rules and tests that are established to protect environmental integrity of ecosystem markets and the value for money of publicly funded schemes. For guidance regarding the interaction with specific schemes see below:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>projects funded with <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> payments may be eligible for registration under the UK <a class="govuk-link" href="https://woodlandcarboncode.org.uk/" rel="external">Woodland Carbon Code</a> (<abbr title="Woodland Carbon Code">WCC</abbr>). This is subject to individual proposals meeting the <abbr title="Woodland Carbon Code">WCC</abbr>’s additionality tests</li>
  <li>in some cases, projects funded with <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> payments will not be eligible to be sold as biodiversity units under the Biodiversity Net Gain scheme; where the developer is required to replace the woodland on a like-for-like basis, this land is ineligible for <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> payments because it is subject to an existing legal requirement or obligation to create woodlands. There may be cases where it is possible to stack the <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> Woodland Creation Grant with Biodiversity Net Gain (<abbr title="Biodiversity Net Gain">BNG</abbr>) where landowners elect to establish woodland in situations where they are not required to do so; this position remains under review and further guidance will be forthcoming</li>
  <li>where ecosystem service markets other than <abbr title="Biodiversity Net Gain">BNG</abbr> require the creation of woodland, this should not be eligible for <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> payments</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Recipients of <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> ‘Additional Contributions’ payments for a specific ecosystem service will not be eligible to receive payments for the same service through participating in other schemes and ecosystem markets. For example, a recipient of <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> ‘Additional Contributions’ cannot sell water quality benefits if they have also received a payment for water quality as a <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> ‘Additional Contribution’.</li>
  <li>Defra plans to introduce a new policy which will permit <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> recipients to return ‘Additional Contributions’ payments that they have received, to meet eligibility requirements to receive payments from other public funding sources and / or to be eligible to sell the corresponding ecosystem services to third parties. Guidance on the process for returning Additional Contributions payments will be published in the coming months.</li>
</ol>
