<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a special edition of Chapter 4 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a>. Rather than the overall chapter being revised to incorporate the latest available evidence, summaries of 4 important papers have been included at the top of the previously published chapter.</p>

<p>We plan to return to the usual format of this chapter for the next publication.</p>

<p>This chapter presents emerging findings from UK studies of the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people (<abbr title="children and young people">CYP</abbr>) in relation to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>It presents a high-level summary of the best, recent, evidence available about the experience of children and young people of the pandemic as relevant to understanding their mental health and wellbeing. It is based on a range of evidence sources of differing methods and quality. Studies reported include longitudinal data. Some have representative samples, others have convenience samples. Study detail is included with each reference – found at the bottom of the section.</p>

<p>As such, many of the findings presented below need to be considered as indicative and not conclusive evidence of impacts at this stage due to these methodological constraints. Nevertheless, they provide an indication of the experiences of children and young people in the recent period and the groups at greater risk of experiencing poor mental health or greater impacts on their mental health.</p>

<p>Details of the method of searching and compiling evidence can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/methodology" class="govuk-link">Methodology document</a>.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>This chapter presents evidence on reported experiences, reported wellbeing and the reported symptoms of mental health. Any deterioration of mental health captured in studies and self-reported surveys and weekly reporting should not be automatically interpreted as an increase in mental illness or need for mental health services.</p>

<p>Important gaps in publicly available findings so far include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>changes in children’s mental health against a recent pre-COVID-19 baseline</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>representative evidence on the experiences and mental health of children and young people from particular sub-groups, such as young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (<abbr title="young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender">LGBT</abbr>) people and those in ethnic minority groups</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>experiences of important pandemic related risk such as illness or bereavement of close family relatives</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that this section has not been fully updated since July 2021. However, the following important new publications have been added:</p>

<h2>Summary of important new papers – from September and October 2021</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/parent-and-pupil-panel-omnibus-surveys" class="govuk-link">Department for Education: COVID-19 Parent and Pupil Panel, July 2021 findings report</a></p>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="The Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) commissioned the COVID-19 Parent and Pupil Panel (<abbr title="Parent and Pupil Panel">PPP</abbr>) to collect robust and quick turnaround research in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each round of panel questions is referred to as a ‘wave’. For each wave of the <abbr title="Parent and Pupil Panel">PPP</abbr>, parents (of primary and secondary pupils) and secondary pupils were asked a series of questions about personal wellbeing, including how happy they felt yesterday, their life satisfaction, the extent to which they feel the things they do in life were worthwhile, and their anxiousness levels. 
<abbr title="The Department for Education">DfE</abbr> are tracking these questions over time to understand how young people and their families have been coping with the pandemic. This report presents findings from surveys at 10 different time-points, between August 2020 and July 2021. The survey in July 2021 included responses from 1,537 parents of primary pupils, 1,543 parents of secondary pupils, and 1,511 secondary pupils. The data has been weighted to be representative of the pupil population.</p>

<p>The most recent results from secondary pupils suggest that wellbeing scores for happiness, life satisfaction, worthwhileness have remained relatively stable between March and July 2021. While there was some evidence of a dip in these measures between December 2020 and February 2021 when schools were closed to most pupils, reported wellbeing had recovered to levels seen before the most recent school closures by March 2021. Nonetheless, average scores for all measures remain lower than in summer 2020 (when the first panel was conducted). Consistent with previous waves, older secondary pupils and female secondary pupils continue to report poorer wellbeing scores for happiness, life satisfaction and worthwhileness. Pupil-reported anxiety broadly mirrors these findings. While anxiety appears to have increased on average between October and December 2020 among secondary pupils, reporting of it has remained relatively consistent in subsequent waves. Higher average scores for anxiety are seen for older pupils and female pupils, as with previous waves.</p>

<p>Parent responses about their children’s wellbeing are generally consistent with pupils’ self-reporting, though there are some differences for some pupil groups. According to parents, happiness levels of pupils (primary and secondary) remained consistently high and anxiety low between March and July 2021. As with pupil self-report responses, this period of consistency followed a sharp decrease in happiness and increase in anxiety scores in February 2021, during the time of the third national lockdown when schools were not open to the majority of pupils. By March, when schools had fully reopened, average happiness and anxiety scores had recovered to a similar level as was seen prior to that lockdown. Lower happiness and higher anxiety scores for children in July 2021 were reported by parents of secondary pupils (compared to primary), those eligible for free school meals (compared to those not eligible), children considered to have <abbr title="Special educational needs (and disabilities)">SEND</abbr> (compared to those who were not), and those who physically attended school most or some days in the past 2 weeks (compared to those who attended every day).</p>

<p>This report is part of a series published recently to provide data on a wide range of children and young people’s experiences of life and education across the 2020 to 2021 academic year.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2021-follow-up-to-the-2017-survey">Mental Health of Children and Young People in England 2021 – wave 2 follow up to the 2017 survey</a></p>

<p>NHS digital’s second follow up study to their 2017 Mental Health and Young People Survey (<abbr title="Mental Health of Children and Young People Survey">MHCYP</abbr>) explores the mental health of children and young people in February to March 2021, during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It also reports on changes since 2017 and, where possible, compares to the first follow-up wave findings from 2020 (Fieldwork July to August 2020). However, it is important to note that comparisons between waves may be affected by changes in survey design and methodology.</p>

<p>Overall, the results reinforce the significant increases in probable mental disorders in children and young people that were reported in the first follow up report published last year. Rates of probable mental disorders remained consistent between follow up waves 1 and 2 at one in six, having increased from one in nine in 2017. 
Nonetheless, there appears to be substantial variation in symptoms across individuals over time. While 39.2% of those aged 6 to 16 years in 2021 and 52.5% of 17 to 23 year olds had experienced deterioration in mental health since 2017, 21.8% of 6 to 16 year olds and 15.2% of 17 to 23 year olds had experienced improvement.</p>

<p>Findings from this report suggest that other factors often associated with poorer mental health and wellbeing continue to be a significant concern for many children. In particular, the report finds that the proportion of children and young people with possible eating problems increased across all age ranges between 2017 and 2021, from 6.7% to 13.0% in 11 to 16 year olds and from 44.6% to 58.2% in 17 to 19 year olds. Rates were higher in girls than boys across all age groups and were highest in young women aged 17 to 23 years, of whom about three quarters (76.4% of 17 to 19 year olds and 75.9% of 20 to 23 year olds) screened positive for possible eating problems. Further, in 2021, problems with sleep on 3 or more nights of the previous 7 affected over a quarter of 6 to 10 year olds, over a third of 11 to 16 year olds, and over half of 17 to 23 year olds, though no comparison has been made with previous waves.</p>

<p>Mental health problems appear to be higher for some children and young people than others. Symptoms of probable mental disorder among children and young people aged between 6 and 23 years old were more likely to be reported in White British and the mixed or other groups, than in the Asian/Asian British and Black/Black British groups in 2021 (although sample sizes are small so need to be treated with caution). Further, symptoms of mental disorder were higher in children aged between 6 and 16 years old with special educational needs, compared to those without. Symptoms of probable mental health disorder were also higher in boys aged 6 to 10 years than girls, however, in 17 to 23 year olds this pattern was reversed, with rates higher in young women than young men.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://cospaceoxford.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Co-Space-report-11-Changes-in-MH-symptoms_FINAL_29-07-21_updated.pdf">Co-Space Report 11: Changes in children’s mental health symptoms from March 2020 to June 2021</a></p>

<p>The Co-Space study aims to understand how families are coping during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what parents can do to help support their children’s mental health. Their most recent report extends their project, by tracking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and young people through to the summer of 2021. Survey responses from a non-representative sample of nearly 10,000 parents and carers (n = 9,161; 91% female) suggested that children had experienced fewer behavioural, emotional, and attentional difficulties since the lockdown restrictions had eased between February and April 2021 and remained relatively stable between April and June. This reduction in difficulties was particularly marked in primary school aged children.</p>

<p>The results also suggested that both the effect of the lockdown on mental health symptoms over time, as well as the post lockdown recovery from mental health symptoms may have differed across different groups of children. According to parents and carers, primary aged children were reported to have experienced increases in mental health symptoms during the lockdowns, as well as a reductions in difficulties associated with poorer mental health post-lockdown, whereas secondary pupils’ mental health remained more stable over time, including during and after lockdowns. Further, while patterns appeared similar for boys and girls for behavioural and emotional difficulties, boys appeared to show a larger reduction in attentional difficulties between February and April 2021 than girls. Despite this drop, boys continue to show more problems with attention than girls on average.</p>

<p>Finally, children with special educational needs and those from low-income households (families earning less than £16,000 per year) do not appear to show this post lockdown recovery, instead continuing to have higher rates of mental health symptoms than children without special educational needs and children from higher income households.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13490" rel="external">Raw, J., Waite, P., Pearcey, S., Creswell, C., Shum, A., &amp; Patalay, P. (2021). Examining changes in parent-reported child and adolescent mental health throughout the UK’s first COVID-19 national lockdown. The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry</a></p>

<p>This research utilised data from the Co-Space longitudinal survey of parents and carers of children and adolescents aged between 4 and 16 years (n = 2988) to understand how children and young people’s mental health changed between end March / beginning April and July 2020, and to identify some of the factors that could have protected or worsened mental health outcomes over this period. The Co-Space survey uses a non-representative sampling methodology. Respondents from the study were predominantly female parents, with higher levels of education, of White ethnicities, and from relatively affluent backgrounds. The sample was restricted to participants who had completed a first Co-Space survey in March and April 2020 and then at least one follow up survey between the period of 30 April to 31 July.</p>

<p>Overall results suggest that rates of hyperactivity and conduct problems increased over the period April to July 2020, whereas emotional symptoms remained relatively stable, though declined somewhat between June and July 2020. This coincides with changes in national restrictions which were at their greatest in April and May, and easing somewhat in June and July, although this data cannot show any causal link. Children with special educational needs (<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>) / neurodevelopmental disorders (<abbr title="neurodevelopmental disorders">ND</abbr>), those who had siblings, those with higher levels of family conflict, and those from low-income families were likely to have more conduct, hyperactivity/inattention, and emotional problems at the beginning of the pandemic compared to those without siblings, those with lower levels of family conflict, and those from higher income families. While children from these groups tended to show a slower rate of increase in symptoms over the first lockdown period, this could be partly due to their pre-existing higher levels of mental health problems.</p>

<p>Further analysis of how mental health varied between different children during the first national lockdown revealed different patterns for hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems, and emotional symptoms. Though many children maintained ‘stable low’ symptoms, some experienced elevated symptoms by July, while others may have experienced a reduction in symptoms, particularly for conduct problems. These children with elevated symptoms in July were more likely to have a parent/carer with higher levels of psychological distress, to have <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>/<abbr title="neurodevelopmental disorders">ND</abbr>, or to be younger in age. These results provide evidence for the existence of different mental health ‘trajectories’ for different children and young people during the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Important findings so far</h2>

<h3>Changes in children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing</h3>

<p>Evidence suggests that some children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing has been substantially impacted due to and during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Between March and September 2020, some children and young people coped well as life satisfaction only slightly reduced and happiness was relatively stable (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 1 to 14</a>). It was <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2020-wave-1-follow-up" rel="external" class="govuk-link">females and those with pre-existing mental health issues who experienced more negative impacts</a>, compared to pre-pandemic data. Between September 2020 and January 2021, there was a decline in wellbeing and increased anxiety was a key impact (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 15 to18</a>).</p>

<p>It is important to note that, to date, the volume of published new intelligence covering January to June 2021 has reduced. However, the evidence there is, showed an <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://cospaceoxford.org/findings/changes-in-children-mental-health-symptoms-from-march-2020-to-jan-2021/">increase in behavioural, emotional and restless/attentional difficulties in January</a>, that had subsequently decreased by March 2021. Children also appeared to have experienced <a href="https://cospaceoxford.org/findings/report-10-changes-in-childrens-mental-health-throughout-one-year-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">a reduction in mental health symptoms as restrictions eased in March 2021</a>, as seen in both parents/carers reporting and child self-reporting data.</p>

<p>Recently published evidence has concentrated more on children with special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="Special educational needs (and disabilities)">SEND</abbr>). This data has shown that from the start of the pandemic through to March 2021 there was an increase in children with <abbr title="Special educational needs (and disabilities)">SEND</abbr> experiencing worsening mental health. This includes higher levels of anxiety, feeling unhappy and being more isolated (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 19 to 22</a>).</p>

<h3>Which population groups appear to be disproportionally affected?</h3>

<h4>Special Educational Needs (and Disabilities) (<abbr title="Special educational needs (and disabilities)">SEND</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Overall, from March 2020 to February 2021 families have reported that the coronavirus pandemic has <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.familyfund.org.uk/the-impact-of-covid-19-a-year-in-the-life-of-families-raising-disabled-children">negatively affected the health and wellbeing of their children with <abbr title="Special educational needs (and disabilities)">SEND</abbr></a>, in particular, their behaviour, emotions and mental health. Parents/carers of children with <abbr title="Special educational needs (and disabilities)">SEND</abbr> were asked about their child’s wellbeing. They reported high anxiety, social isolation and were unhappy in the January to March 2021 Lockdown (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 20 to 22</a>). Parents and carers of children with <abbr title="Special educational needs (and disabilities)">SEND</abbr> have also continued to report <a rel="external" href="https://cospaceoxford.org/findings/report-10-changes-in-childrens-mental-health-throughout-one-year-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/" class="govuk-link">considerably higher levels of behavioural, emotional, and attentional difficulties</a> than those of children without in this same time period. In January 2021, more children with <abbr title="Special educational needs (and disabilities)">SEND</abbr> than children without were identified as <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://cospaceoxford.org/findings/changes-in-children-mental-health-symptoms-from-march-2020-to-jan-2021/">having possible/probable mental disorders</a>.</p>

<p>However, the lockdown period from January 2021 to February 2021 <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.familyfund.org.uk/the-impact-of-covid-19-a-year-in-the-life-of-families-raising-disabled-children">appeared to have been beneficial to some pupils with <abbr title="Special educational needs (and disabilities)">SEND</abbr></a>. Some parents/carers reported their children were better motivated, engaged and were responding well to working flexibly and independently. Moreover, some parents/carers stated that their child was less stressed during lockdown because they had not been to school and had been enjoying spending more time with their parents.</p>

<h4>Gender</h4>

<p>Evidence from across the pandemic indicates that boys and girls have had different mental health and wellbeing challenges. One <a href="https://cospaceoxford.org/findings/report-10-changes-in-childrens-mental-health-throughout-one-year-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">recent study</a> found that overall (throughout the pandemic up to March 2021), parents/carers of school aged children reported higher symptoms of behavioural and attentional difficulties for boys than girls. However, <a rel="external" href="https://cospaceoxford.org/findings/report-10-changes-in-childrens-mental-health-throughout-one-year-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/" class="govuk-link">girls had higher levels of emotional difficulties than boys (all aged 4 to 17)</a>. From May to November 2020, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://impacted.org.uk/covid-19" rel="external">girls aged 6 to 18 reported higher anxiety and poorer wellbeing than boys</a>. It is important to note that <a rel="external" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2017/2017" class="govuk-link">these gender differences are fairly typical</a>, and as this study does not have pre-pandemic data, it is not possible to determine whether this is a change during the pandemic or a continuation of pre-pandemic patterns.</p>

<h4>Disadvantaged</h4>

<p>During the pandemic, some disadvantaged young people and children, such as children in care or those who are disadvantaged financially, have reported poorer mental health and wellbeing including anxiety and loneliness (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 2 to 3, 8, 15, 24</a>). <a href="https://cospaceoxford.org/findings/report-10-changes-in-childrens-mental-health-throughout-one-year-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Parents/carers from households with lower annual incomes</a> reported their children having higher levels of symptoms of behavioural, emotional and attentional difficulties than those with higher annual income throughout the pandemic. As lockdown progressed between February and March 2021 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cospaceoxford.org/findings/report-10-changes-in-childrens-mental-health-throughout-one-year-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="external">parents/carers from higher income households</a> reported decreases in symptoms of behavioural, emotional and attentional difficulties whereas there was relatively little change for those from lower income households. There is <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2020-wave-1-follow-up" class="govuk-link" rel="external">evidence that children with a probable mental health disorder</a> were more likely to live in a household that had fallen behind with payments.</p>

<h4>Pre-existing mental health needs</h4>

<p>There is evidence to suggest that some young people with pre-existing mental health needs have found the return to school difficult. Some secondary aged pupils had struggled with pre-existing mental health issues during the lockdown and this continued into the return to school in Autumn 2020 (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 18 to 27</a>). There is qualitative evidence that the <a rel="external" href="https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/research-resources/2020/coronavirus-insight-briefing-schools" class="govuk-link">stress around going back was a trigger for some young people</a> who started to self-harm again or have suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584621000890?via%3Dihub" class="govuk-link" rel="external">study using 2 waves of data collected between January 2018 and March 2019, and May 2020</a>, finds that young people (aged 17 to 19) identified as having emotional difficulties or high symptom levels pre-pandemic also reported experiencing higher levels of stress, conflict, loneliness, and lower levels of perceived social support than other young people early in the pandemic. In the pre-pandemic data more girls were experiencing emotional problems than boys, indicating that they may have experienced more challenges during the early pandemic.</p>

<p>There is a range of data collected at different points across the pandemic from non-representative samples of children and young people with a history of mental health needs. This data indicates a range of challenges for this population, with respondents reporting increasing challenges for their mental health over the course of the pandemic. In particular respondents have indicated challenges with accessing support for their mental health needs. Recent data, collected between January and February 2021, reported that almost half of those who felt they needed mental health support during the pandemic had either not accessed or not looked for any support. Barriers to seeking support included concerns about seeking that help, for example being aware of how many people were struggling and worrying about overstretched services. Respondents also reported concerns about what family and friends might think if they sought support and it was hard to seek support without others finding out, or that they felt too busy due to education or work pressures. However, there were also barriers around the types of support available, such as concerns about only having access to online or telephone support. There was also reporting of barriers such as long waiting lists, having been discouraged from receiving further support from GPs because of waiting lists and high thresholds, and lack of money to fund private support when respondents felt they would not be able to access NHS support (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 25 to 28</a>).</p>

<h4>Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (<abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Some evidence suggests that children and young people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (<abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr>) backgrounds have experienced a higher rate of mental health and wellbeing concerns during the pandemic (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 5 to 11</a>). Other studies have not found differences in overall psychological wellbeing, subjective wellbeing and difficulties for children by ethnic groups (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 1, 8, 29</a>). However, it is important to note that this may be due to small sample sizes and the combining of ethnic groups potentially masking differences between them.</p>

<h4>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (<abbr title="young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender">LGBT+</abbr>)</h4>

<p>In a <a rel="external" href="https://www.justlikeus.org/single-post/growing-up-lgbt-just-like-us-research-report" class="govuk-link">study conducted between December 2020 and January 2021</a>, a greater proportion of LGTB+ respondents (aged 11 to 18) reported that their mental health had worsened since the start of the pandemic, compared to non <abbr title="young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender">LGBT+</abbr> respondents. <abbr title="young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender">LGBT+</abbr> respondents were also more likely to report mental health challenges such as anxiety disorder, depression and panic attacks, and suicidal thoughts and feelings. Without a pre-pandemic baseline for comparison it is not possible to know if the greater reporting of mental health challenges by <abbr title="young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender">LGBT+</abbr> respondents is an indication of specific pandemic impacts, or a continuation of pre-pandemic patterns. <abbr title="young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender">LGBT+</abbr> respondents have also experienced feeling lonely/separated from people and experienced tension in the place they live more than non-<abbr title="young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender">LGBT+</abbr> respondents during the lockdown restrictions.</p>

<h3>Risks and experiences</h3>

<h4>Family relationships</h4>

<p>In a study conducted between August and October 2020, primary school pupils reported generally feeling that their family relationships were going well, more so than secondary school pupils. They felt that lockdown had positively impacted their family relationships because they got to spend more time together (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 24, 31, 32</a>). Parents also reported this throughout the lockdown period and into the autumn term (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 15, 33 to 34</a>). Some pupils reported that <a href="https://impacted.org.uk/covid-19" class="govuk-link" rel="external">the lockdown helped communication with some of their family members</a> as they were able to have deeper conversations about mental health and reflect on shared challenges.</p>

<p>Survey evidence from March to May 2020 found that some young people (aged 11 to 16) who had a closer relationship with their parents <a rel="external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721003402?via%3Dihub" class="govuk-link">reported significantly less severe symptoms of mental health difficulties and lower levels of loneliness</a>. However, children and young people with a probable mental disorder were more likely to also have a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2020-wave-1-follow-up">parent with a higher level of psychological distress</a> and these rates were higher than seen in 2017. During the pandemic, caregivers with higher psychological distress were significantly more likely to report that their <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.revistapcna.com/">children experienced psychological distress</a>, were more likely to argue with the rest of the family, and be more dependent on their caregiver. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-018-1604-0" class="govuk-link" rel="external">link between parent’s mental health and children’s mental health is well established</a> and it is not always clear which factor causes the other. Parents/carers from single adult households reported <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cospaceoxford.org/findings/changes-in-children-mental-health-symptoms-from-march-2020-to-jan-2021/" rel="external">higher levels of all behavioural, emotional, and restless/attentional symptoms</a> than parents/carers from non-single parent households throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>Further evidence on parent and carer mental health during the pandemic can be accessed in this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-spotlights/parents-and-carers-spotlight">spotlight report</a> and important findings relevant to parent mental health are also included in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/2-important-findings-so-far">Important findings chapter</a> of this surveillance report.</p>

<h4>Loneliness</h4>

<p>There is some evidence that young people (11 to 16 years old) who have <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721003402?via%3Dihub">reported higher loneliness had significantly higher symptoms of mental health difficulties</a> during the first lockdown. Some studies have reported that between March and November 2020, there was a lack of social connectedness, mainly for primary school children and those children without access to the internet. Even after returning to school, some children and young people found it hard to reconnect with friendship groups (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 18, 31, 37</a>). Pupils of both primary and secondary age have <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/research-resources/2020/coronavirus-insight-briefing-schools">also felt like they sometimes do not have anyone to talk to or have felt left out</a>. Other evidence further suggests that it is <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2020-wave-1-follow-up">more common for children and young people with a probable mental health disorder to feel lonely</a>, however there is no comparison for this prior to the pandemic.</p>

<h4>Anxiety</h4>

<p>From the first lockdown and during the return to school in September 2020, there was an increase in reported anxiety and stress for some children who were worried about contracting and spreading COVID-19 (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 15, 18, 32, 37</a>). This was <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2020-wave-1-follow-up" rel="external">especially felt by secondary pupils who had vulnerable family members at home</a>. Some children and young people were worried and anxious about catching up with their schoolwork and uncertainty about the plans for exams (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 31, 37</a>).  Another activity which increased anxiety around COVID-19 was reading or watching the news and social media (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 31, 37</a>).</p>

<h4>Mental Health Services</h4>

<p>Some children and young people have <a rel="external" href="https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/research-resources/2020/coronavirus-insight-briefing-schools" class="govuk-link">reported that accessing counselling at school was more difficult after the first lockdown</a> due to long waiting lists, being unable to attend sessions if they were self-isolating and not being able to have regular appointments.</p>

<p>Also see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/7-children-and-young-people#Pre-existing" class="govuk-link">evidence summarised above</a> for children and young people with existing mental health needs reporting challenges with accessing support.</p>
