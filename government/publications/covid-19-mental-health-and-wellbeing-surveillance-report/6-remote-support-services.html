<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is Chapter 6 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report">COVID-19: mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a>. This chapter presents data and narrative gathered from a range of telephone and online services that have provided support in relation to mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>The report is regularly updated with the most recent information available. It follows a standard structure, to enable regular and easy use.</p>

<p>This chapter currently reflects information up to week 8 of 2021 (21 February).</p>

<p>It is about those services that are generally complementary to NHS services and does not report on any shift from face to face care to virtual care that may have been reported by some NHS mental health providers. Some of these services will be funded by NHS commissioners. NHS funded service data on secondary mental health care services can be found at <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/mental-health-services-data-set">Mental Health Services Dataset (MHSDS)</a> and on <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/improving-access-to-psychological-therapies-data-set/improving-access-to-psychological-therapies-data-set-reports" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Improving Access to Psychological Therapy services at IAPT</a>. The basis on which support services are included is detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/methodology">Methodology document</a>.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>Any deterioration of mental health captured in studies and weekly reporting should not be automatically interpreted as an increase in mental illness or need for mental health services. This is a difficult and stressful time for many, and some short term increases in psychological distress and anxiety are to be expected.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>Trends in telephone and online support service use can reflect changes in mental health needs, help-seeking behaviours and service accessibility. It is difficult to assess which of these contribute, and by how much, without further analysis.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>This chapter presents data and commentary in relation to services provided for adults. Data and commentary relating to services providing support to children, young people and parents are reported separately in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/7-children-and-young-people">Chapter 7: Children and young people</a>.</p>

<h2>Telephone and online support services</h2>

<p>Most services saw a significant drop off in contacts over the Christmas and New Year period, but demand for services remains high in the early months of 2021.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">Citizens Advice</a> offer assistance to millions of people each year. They give independent advice on benefits, work, debt and money, consumer issues, family matters, housing, law and courts, immigration and health. From the pandemic outset there has been a shift in support away from face to face and towards remote services. Initially there was a reduction in numbers of people with a mental health condition being supported. However, over recent months there has been an increase in the number of people in this group seeking support online and many have more complex problems than that were being presented prior to the pandemic.</p>

<p>The most common themes people with a mental health condition approach Citizens Advice about are debt, followed by benefits and universal credit, housing and employment. This is similar to before the pandemic.  Since November 2020, contacts in relation to utilities and communications, and financial services and capability, have increased slightly (included within ‘Other’ on the graph).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Anxiety UK</a> is a charity for those affected by anxiety, stress and anxiety-based depression. From just before the first national lockdown Anxiety UK saw a rapid increase in calls received that peaked at approaching 900 calls per week between late May and late June 2020. There was a subsequent reduction in call volumes that coincided with the easing of the first lockdown, and at this time there was also a gradual reduction in the hours of operation of their helpline. Helpline call numbers were steady across the final third of 2020, at a rate which was higher than the same period in 2019, and looks to have increased again at the beginning of 2021. Recently the most common issues that people are calling about are general anxiety disorder, COVID-19/Lockdown anxiety, parents worried about children, and vaccine/needle phobia.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.mind.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">Mind</a> provides advice and support to empower anyone experiencing a mental health problem. They campaign to improve services, raise awareness and promote understanding about mental health. Mind reported a decrease in demand for their support services immediately after the first lockdown, but this was followed by increasing demand across the course of the pandemic. Contacts via calls, texts and emails all increased after the first lockdown and then have plateaued since October 2020. Mind report that calls are generally longer than pre-COVID-19 calls. The main recent reasons for contact were suicidal thoughts, emotional support, help for others including family/friends who didn’t want support, anxiety and depression.</p>

<p>The number of users of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://togetherall.com/en-gb/" rel="external">Togetherall</a>, an online community for people who are stressed, anxious or feeling low, increased over autumn and early winter returning to levels seen between April and June 2020. Demand for services remains high in 2021. The number of new users in the 16 to 34 age group increased more than in the 35 to 54 age group over the autumn months. An internal survey conducted in the third quarter of 2020 found around 21% of new members from the education sector had joined for reasons related to COVID-19.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.koothplc.com/" class="govuk-link">Kooth PLC</a> delivers personalised digital mental health care for young people, adults, students and businesses. Kooth provide the Qwell service for adults. Although there was a dip over the Christmas and New Year period, demand for this service has continued to grow since September 2020 and is well above the same period in 2019.  Over recent weeks, the most common presenting issues were anxiety, self-harm and suicidal thoughts, sadness, self-worth and loneliness/isolation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rethink.org/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Rethink Mental Illness</a> is a charity that provides numerous mental health services, including housing, community-based services and online support services. The demand for the Advice Service line has been stable, except for one week of higher demand in August 2020. The Advice Service line was closed for 3 weeks in December 2020. Since re-opening demand has returned to levels seen before closing. After being at a constant level for some time website views of COVID-19 content have been increasing since the beginning of December 2020.  Common reasons for contact during the pandemic period were mental health care, rights and laws, carers and relatives and living with mental illness. One increasingly common issue from mental health clients has been seeking support with accessing Community Mental Health Teams and GPs.</p>
