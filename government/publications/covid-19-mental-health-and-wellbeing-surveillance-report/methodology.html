<h2>Method for data collection and analysis</h2>

<h3>Adults</h3>

<h4>Geography</h4>

<p>Covers whole of UK or England (publications in English).</p>

<h4>Eligibility</h4>

<p>16 years to adult for all groups.</p>

<p>Group 1: pre-existing ongoing longitudinal surveys with mental health and wellbeing variables, data from pre- and post-March 2020 – which capture changes between pre and during COVID-19 pandemic  (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC428525/" rel="external">good to moderate quality</a>). Survey uses validated diagnostic tool(s).</p>

<p>Group 2: longitudinal surveys established in March, April and May 2020 with mental health and wellbeing variables, with at least one follow-up point. Captures changes through the COVID-19 pandemic (good to moderate quality) (<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC428525/">good to moderate quality</a>). Surveys use validated diagnostic tool(s).</p>

<p>Group 3: additional longitudinal or cross-sectional surveys that concentrate on specific populations or topic areas and mental health and wellbeing variables. Captures data post March 2020 (<a rel="external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC428525/" class="govuk-link">good, moderate, low quality</a>).</p>

<p>Group 4: weekly public opinion survey, nationally representative sample with mental health and wellbeing variables, which captures data from March 2020, and is ongoing.</p>

<p>Group 5: national mental health and wellbeing remote service provider with weekly service use data available for publication.</p>

<h4>Search strategy</h4>

<p>One main search conducted at beginning of report production.</p>

<p>Group 1: eligible cohorts selected from <a href="https://www.cataloguementalhealth.ac.uk/?content=4" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Catalogue of Mental Health Measures</a></p>

<p>Group 2: eligible cohorts selected from <a href="https://www.covidminds.org/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">COVID-Minds</a>.</p>

<p>Group 3: eligible cohorts identified through snowball method (for example academic and professional network), ongoing search throughout reporting period.</p>

<p>Group 4: eligible surveys identified through snowball method (for example academic and professional network).</p>

<p>Group 5: snowball method - contacted Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Acts (<abbr title="Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Apps">Orcha</abbr>) accredited services and other services recommended by experts.</p>

<h4>Extraction</h4>

<p>Reviewers carry out a routine check for updates (new analyses, results or submitted data).</p>

<p>Group 1: via contact with principal investigators or checking latest results online.</p>

<p>Group 2: via contact with principal investigators or checking latest results online.</p>

<p>Group 3: as and when new cohorts are identified via principal investigators.</p>

<p>Group 4: via contact with principal investigators or statistical lead, or checking latest results online.</p>

<p>Group 5: via contact with service provider or data sent to team regularly.  Each reviewer enters data into a standard extraction template.</p>

<h4>Synthesis</h4>

<p>Results are synthesised regularly from the extraction template. Findings relating to more recent time periods are prioritised. Those relating to older time periods are included if they offer a new perspective to that which has already been covered. Findings from specific groups are allocated to appropriate sections of the report:</p>

<p>Important findings - Groups 1, 2 and 3</p>

<p>Weekly data and survey triangulation - Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4</p>

<p>Weekly data tracking of the general population - Group 4</p>

<p>Spotlight - Groups 1, 2 and 3</p>

<p>Updates from surveys - Groups 1, 2 and 3</p>

<p>Data presented in WICH tool - Groups 4 and 5</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at least one other piece of evidence supports new statement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Group 2: results are synthesised regularly from the extraction template. Findings from specific groups are allocated to appropriate sections of the report.</p>
