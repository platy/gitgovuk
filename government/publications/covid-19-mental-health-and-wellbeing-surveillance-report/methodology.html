<p>This methodology statement provides information on how the ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a>’ (the report) is produced. The information will help users to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>understand the strengths and limitations of the report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understand the methods used to create the report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide suitable uses for the report</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The report provides a summary of currently available evidence, focusing on adult and children and young people’s (<abbr title="children and young people">CYP</abbr>) mental health and wellbeing in England or the UK, during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>The aim of the report is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>locate intelligence (near to real time evidence derived from eligible studies, surveys, support services, and so on) according to specific inclusion criteria</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>summarise and provide a regularly updated report based on the intelligence related to mental health and wellbeing, and the impact of COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>monitor and report on the changes in self-reported mental health symptoms, wellbeing levels and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify and report on the determining factors associated with levels or changes in symptoms during COVID-19 based on population groups in England</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Users and uses</h2>

<p>The findings from the report may be of use to policy makers, service planners, service providers, researchers, academics, and mental health and wellbeing charities.</p>

<p>This kind of surveillance of impacts on mental health is logistically challenging, but is expected to provide value beyond conventional evidence reviews in situations where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the ability to respond to a changing environment is needed and decisions may need to be made quickly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the certainty in existing evidence is limited, posing a barrier to decision-making</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is likely to be new research evidence emerging that would inform decisions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Strengths</h2>

<p>The strengths of the report are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it includes regular and frequent updates, which provide a timely flow of intelligence for users during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on identification of near to real-time evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the content of the tracker report will improve over time, in line with the improvements in the evidence base</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the collation of a set of studies which include validated survey questionnaires (for example PHQ-9 symptoms of depression, GAD-7 symptoms of anxiety, GHQ-12 symptoms of mental distress) and self-reported experiences and impacts of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the inclusion of data prior to the COVID-19 lockdown will enable understanding of changes (where data is available)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information about vulnerable groups is included (where data is available)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>There are a number of important points and limitations which the user should consider when reading the report and these are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>some trends reported are based on repeated cross section data, that is, the survey is carried out with a new sample of participants at each successive time point, therefore, any variation seen may not reflect changes for the same group of participants</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in order to provide as close to real time surveillance as possible, studies included in the tracker report may be working papers or awaiting publication, and as such may not have been peer reviewed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is a delay in publishing more robust analytical studies due to the time it takes to collect, clean and analyse the data and then make available to the public</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the report is not exhaustive, it is the result of a pragmatic approach to the gathering, and provision, of useful evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the report is not a systematic review – see evidence assessment approach below</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>judgement about significance or accuracy of findings is not part of the review process as a light touch appraisal is carried out</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the mention of specific studies does not imply that they are endorsed or recommended by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the evidence provided within the report should not be viewed as final, definitive or authoritative</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>findings taken from the various data sources have not been verified by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the report contains information which should be classed as ‘experimental statistics’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>changes in incidence and prevalence of severe mental illness (SMI) during the pandemic are not covered in detail within the intelligence materials that this document reports on</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Structure and content of the tracker report</h2>

<p>The report is divided into distinct sections.</p>

<p>The sections include:</p>

  <li>group specific changes in mental health and wellbeing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Measures of anxiety, depression, loneliness and life satisfaction (chapter 3)</h3>

<p>To assess consistency of findings, this section triangulates weekly surveys and a number of studies, against 4 key themes.</p>

<h3>Further weekly data (chapter 4)</h3>

<p>This chapter adds to and complements chapter 3. It provides further measures of population level mental health and wellbeing on:</p>
