<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is Chapter 5 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a>. It presents summary findings from a range of ongoing academic research projects.  It is regularly updated, and currently includes analysis released up to Week 1 2021 (6 January).</p>

<p>The analysis from academic research offers a good picture of change over time and differences between groups. This intelligence is the basis for more nuanced interpretation and feeds into <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/2-important-findings-so-far">Chapter 2: Important findings</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/3-triangulation-comparison-across-surveys">Chapter 3: Measures of anxiety, depression, loneliness and life satisfaction</a>.</p>

<p>Updates from weekly data are included in other chapters of this report to serve as an early warning system for large changes.</p>

<p>Note: Any deterioration of mental health captured in studies and weekly reporting should not be automatically interpreted as an increase in mental illness or need for mental health services. This is a difficult and stressful time for many, and some short term increases in psychological distress and anxiety are to be expected.</p>

<p>Note: To enable this chapter to be as up to date as possible some pre-print (and therefore not yet peer reviewed) academic research is presented. Even with this approach there is still a time delay between data being gathered and findings reported.</p>

<p>The basis for the intelligence included is presented in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/methodology" class="govuk-link">Methodology document</a>.</p>

<h2>Survey updates</h2>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/research/publications/526376" class="govuk-link">Baumberg Geiger and colleagues, from the Welfare at a (Social) Distance study</a>.</p>

<p>Data from a weighted sample of 600 adults of working age who made an unsuccessful claim for benefits at the start of the pandemic, was compared with a similar sample of 4,700 non-claimants, interviewed during May to August 2020.  The research found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>63% of unsuccessful claimants reported poor mental health (using the GHQ-12 scale) compared with 38% reported by non-claimants</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>59% of unsuccessful claimants reported high anxiety (using the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> Scale) compared to 46% of the non-claimant population</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>most claimants were rejected because they or their partners were still earning too much or had too much in savings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>just under half of unsuccessful claimants reported more severe financial strain such as falling behind on housing costs, not keeping up with bills, not being able to afford daily fresh fruit and vegetables, or being hungry and not eating</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the authors suggest that, based on this study, there would be 290,000 adults in the UK who were unsuccessful claimants</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://psyarxiv.com/kmgzw/" rel="external">Herle and colleagues, as part of the COVID-19 Social Study</a>.</p>

<p>A sample of 22,000 UK adults weighted to be representative of the population, interviewed between March and May 2020, looking at eating behaviours found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>64% of participants did not report change in their eating habits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>participants with greater numbers of depressive symptoms were more likely to report a change in eating (either eating more or less), compared to those with fewer symptoms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adults with higher education were less likely to report change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>loneliness was linked to persistently eating more</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being single, divorced or experiencing stressful life events was associated with consistently eating less</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.25.20238766v1" class="govuk-link">Aughterson and colleagues, as part of the COVID-19 Social Study</a>.</p>

<p>Analysis of interviews with a sample of 25 frontline health and social care professionals between May and September 2020 found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>communication challenges (virtual consulting and difficult conversations) had a negative effect on their mental health and wellbeing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other work-related stressors were increased workload, fatigue of wearing PPE, fear of risk to loved ones, uncertainty in decisions about relative risks for patients, stress related to the public not following the rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support structures and increased team unity were protective for mental health and wellbeing, along with greater reflection on what matters in life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>successful strategies used to support resilience and well-being included mindfulness, hobbies, restricting news intake, virtual socialising activities</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243246v2" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Fisher and colleagues, as part of the COVID-19 Social Study</a>.</p>

<p>Analysis of interviews with a sample of 32 adults with long term health conditions during the pandemic found four key themes related to mental health and wellbeing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high levels of fear and anxiety related to perceived consequences of catching COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those having to shield experienced stress related to: being able to access essential supplies, variable support received by friends and family, differing attitudes towards social distancing rules, and struggling with being dependent on others</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stress related to concerns about reduced access to healthcare, or risks of going in person, although many reported positive experiences with virtual care</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>anxiety created by uncertainty about the future, with many reporting trying to accept the situation as the most protective coping mechanism for their mental health</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241067v1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Burton and colleagues, as part of the COVID-19 Social Study</a>.</p>

<p>Analysis of interviews with a sample of 22 adults with pre-existing mental health conditions during May to August 2020 found that:</p>

<p>Factors contributing to a deterioration in mental health included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>feeling safe but isolated at home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disruption to mental health services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cancelled plans and changed routines</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>uncertainty and lack of control</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rolling media coverage</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Five coping strategies and protective factors were identified for maintaining good mental health:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>previous experience of adversity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>feeling less accountable to others</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>engaging in hobbies and activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staying connected with others</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>perceived social support</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248238v1" rel="external">McKinley and colleagues, as part of the COVID-19 Social Study</a>.</p>

<p>Analysis of interviews with a sample of 20 older adults (aged 70+) during May to September 2020 found 2 key themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>risks to wellbeing – this included mortality concerns, fears about the virus, grief for the loss of normality, restricted access to health services and restricted access to activities that protect wellbeing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>factors protective of wellbeing – this included the slower pace of life, maintaining a routine, socialising and use of past coping skills</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Many participants drew on their resilience and life experience to self-manage fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic, using their time during lockdown to reflect or organise end-of-life affairs.</p>

<p><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/74sdr/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">May and colleagues, as part of the COVID-19 Social Study</a>.</p>

<p>Analysis of interviews with a sample of 20 freelancers in creative industries during July to November 2020 found that the pandemic is affecting the psychological wellbeing of this group through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>employment loss</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>financial instability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work dissonance due to difficulties in adapting to working from home / online, with many reporting stress related to not being able to sustain work in a field which was linked to their identity, interests and that they had spent time developing</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Data on 500 people with cancer showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an increased risk of depression observed for people with cancer of the breast, prostate and blood, but not other cancers (for example lung, melanoma)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>after controlling for other factors, experiencing loneliness during the pandemic was associated with a 4.5 fold increased risk of depression</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237909v1.full-text">Niedzwiedz and colleagues, from Understanding Society (<abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal Study">UKHLS</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>Data on over 12,000 people who reported probable COVID-19 symptoms in April 2020 compared to participants who did not, with follow up at one, two and three months.  It showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>elevated levels of psychological distress were found up to 3 months after probable COVID-19, compared to participants with no likely infection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>associations were stronger among younger adults (OR=1.50 in May, 95% CI: 1.02-2.20) and men (OR=1.54 in May, 95% CI: 1.04-2.29)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://psyarxiv.com/mjg72" class="govuk-link">Daly and Robinson, from Understanding Society (<abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal Study">UKHLS</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>Data on over 10,000 adults to assess longitudinal change in mental health.  It showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the prevalence of clinically significant psychological distress rose from pre pandemic levels of 21% in 2019 to 30% in April 2020 - it then declined significantly to pre pandemic levels by September (21%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>these trends were observed across demographic groups examined – including age, sex, race/ethnicity, income</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the recovery may reflect the influence of the easing of restrictions, and adaptation to the demands of the pandemic</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A review of open text responses from over 18,000 respondents, collected during May 2020, from 5 nationally representative cohort studies (The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) born between 2000 and 2002, Next Steps born in 1989 and 1990, 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) born in 1970, National Child Development Study (NCDS) born in 1958, and National Study of Health and Development Study (NSHD) who were born in 1946) looking at mental health during the lockdown, found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>many respondents suffered from worse mental health during the lockdown than before the lockdown</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>few respondents reported fully negative, or fully positive, experiences - most described a mix of inter-related positive and negative impacts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whereas most respondents who mentioned mental health focused on negative impacts, a small number of respondents reported that the lockdown had improved their mental wellbeing, for example by reduced social pressure</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.20239954v1">Dickerson and colleagues, from the Born in Bradford study</a>.</p>

<p>Data from questionnaires completed by 2,000 families in Bradford, with 95% mothers completing on behalf of households around the first COVID-19 UK lockdown (10th April to 30th June 2020), and compared to a similar pre pandemic cohort.  This was an ethnically diverse cohort (35% of respondents were white British) with a high proportion of participants from deprived areas. It found:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there was an increase in clinically important depression (11 to 19%) and anxiety (10 to 16%) from before to during the first COVID-19 lockdown</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>loneliness during the first lockdown was most associated with increases in depression and anxiety, followed by financial insecurity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other factors associated with depression and anxiety included food and housing insecurity, a lack of physical activity and a poor partner relationship</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mothers with Pakistani heritage were less likely than White British mothers to experience an increase in depression and anxiety</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>responses to open text highlighted a complex inter-play of health anxieties, mental load, loss of social support and coping strategies, and financial insecurity contributing to mental ill health</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>positive aspects of lockdown were also reported, including a more relaxed pace of life</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Data from questionnaires completed by 700 intensive care unit staff during June and July 2020 showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>over half of respondents reported good wellbeing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>45% of respondents met the threshold for clinically significant mental health problems including severe depression (6%), post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (40%), severe anxiety (11%) or problem drinking (7%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>13% of respondents reported frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or of hurting themselves, in the previous 2 weeks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>doctors reported better mental health than nurses across a range of measures</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-228/v1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Dickerson and colleagues, from the Born in Bradford study</a></p>

<p>Data from questionnaires completed by mothers in 2,000 families in Bradford between 10 April and 30 June 2020.  This was an ethnically diverse cohort with a high proportion of participants from deprived areas. It found:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>insecurity in relation to finance (37%), employment (37%), food (20%) and housing (10%) were common - rates were higher in people who were furloughed, self-employed and not working, or unemployed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clinically significant depression in 19% of mothers and anxiety in 16% of mothers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>symptoms of mental ill-health were more common in White British mothers and in mothers with economic insecurity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fears about self or loved ones becoming ill or dying from COVID-19, or not being able to support family or friends were common themes in free-text responses</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>First data from a national study of adults with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or associated disorders. Results from 124 participants, in a non-representative convenience sample surveyed during August to October 2020 showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>just over half people with severe mental illness said their mental health was stable during the pandemic and almost half said that their mental health had deteriorated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a quarter of people receiving support from mental health services said that they would need more support than before the pandemic, and a further quarter said that they might need more support</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Data from <abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal Study">UKHLS</abbr> and corroborated by data from four large representative cohorts of varying ages (The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) born between 2000 and 2002, Next Steps, born in 1989 and 1990,1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) born in 1970 and National Child Development Study (NCDS) born in 1958) considering the impact of the pandemic on living arrangements showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>most people (96%) did not change their living arrangements during Spring 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>young adults reported changing living arrangements more often than other groups, and the data suggests many moved to live with parents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>people whose living arrangements changed because of the pandemic are more likely to report stress and family conflict</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Surveys in April and May 2020 from a representative sample of 7,000 people in the south west of England found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>people with asthma had a 13% to 15% higher depression score, and a 14% to 16% higher anxiety score, compared with people who did not have asthma</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>proportions were similar in younger and older age groups, but the mental health of younger people with asthma declined to lower levels</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>were more likely to worry about finances, obtaining food and other essentials</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>had higher levels of depression and loneliness</p>

<p>6,000 older people in England surveyed during June and July 2020 to assess the experience of older people instructed to shield or self-isolate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results showed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>that of the participants instructed to shield or self-isolate during the pandemic, 2 in 5 did not fully adhere in April 2020 and more than 50% did not in June and July 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there were markedly higher levels of depression and anxiety among the high risk (instructed to shield or self isolate) group compared with the remainder of the study cohort</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the high risk group also reported worsening of mental health related behaviours including less physical activity, poor diet and sleep</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those who did adhere to strict social isolation were twice as likely to have severe depression and anxiety symptoms compared with average risk participants</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p>A  representative sample of over 4,000 UK adults surveyed in late August as part of series of surveys looking at emotional responses to the pandemic, the key social drivers of distress, coping mechanisms and suicidal thoughts.  Results showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>almost two thirds of people (64%) say they are coping well with the stress of the pandemic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of those who have experienced stress due to the pandemic, most (87%) are using at least one coping strategy, which is commonly going for a walk (59%), spending time in green spaces (50%), and staying connected with others (46%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some people resort to more harmful ways of coping, such as alcohol consumption (34%) and over-eating (19%)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A sample of over 30,000 UK adults, weighted to be representative of the population, surveyed between March and April 2020 found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>of people who drink alcohol, 48% reported drinking about the same as usual, 26% less than usual, and 26% more than usual</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>drinking more than usual was more likely in people who are younger, female, high socioeconomic position, have an anxiety disorder, and feel stressed about finances or COVID-19</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An sample of 26,000 UK adults weighted to be representative of the population surveyed between April and May 2020, looking specifically at coping strategies found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>people used a range of coping strategies – these include problem-focused coping (planning, seeking solutions), emotion-focused coping (positive reframing, acceptance, humour, religion), avoidant coping (behavioural avoidance, denial, substance use), and socially supported coping (emotional support, practical support, and venting)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>people who used emotion-focused coping had the fewest mental health symptoms at the beginning of the first national lockdown, and those with avoidant coping strategies the highest</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whilst all coping strategies were associated with reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression over time, supportive coping strategies were the only strategies associated with faster decreases in symptoms during the initial weeks of lockdown</p>
  </li>

<p>Data on 1,300 caregivers and 6,200 non-caregivers extracted from Understanding Society showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>caregivers had a higher risk of depressive symptoms before, and during, the pandemic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>higher levels of loneliness increased the risk of depressive symptoms in caregivers, and accessing therapy reduced risk of depressive symptoms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>60% of caregivers with symptoms of depression reported not accessing therapeutic support during the pandemic</p>

<p>Data on 4,000 working men extracted from Understanding Society, looking at wellbeing and employment, showed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of a widening gap in mental wellbeing (resulting from a widening socioeconomic gap) between immigrant and native-born working men during COVID-19 lockdowns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>employment disruption does not necessarily hurt mental wellbeing among native-born men, as long as their income is protected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for immigrants, work hour reduction is generally accompanied by psychological costs, with greater mental suffering among immigrant men who experience work hour reduction without income protection – particularly when reduced to no work hours</p>

<p>Data on over 16,000 adults during April to June 2020 extracted from Understanding Society, looking at the impact of weather on mental health during lockdown, showed that:</p>

<p>Data on over 7,000 employed adults extracted from Understanding Society, looking at employment related class and gender in April and June showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in each class women were more likely than men to experience psychological distress in both April and June 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in April, around two fifths of women in the following roles experienced psychological distress - ‘Routine and semi-routine’, ‘Management and professional’, ‘Intermediate’ and ‘Lower supervisory and technical’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proportion of women experiencing psychological distress had reduced across all groups when assessed in June, highest levels were ‘Lower supervisory and technical’ (37%) and ‘Intermediate’ (33%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for men, the group with the highest rates of psychological distress in April was ‘Intermediate’ (29%) and in June was ‘Lower supervisory and technical’ (25%) - there was little change between April and June in the ‘Management and professional’, ‘Lower supervisory and technical’ and ‘Routine and semi-routine’ groups</p>

<p>Data from a representative sample of over 3,000 adults taken from 3 survey waves looking at mental health and wellbeing outcomes found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>rates of suicidal ideation increased during the first national lockdown, with one in seven (14%) young adults reporting suicidal thoughts in the last week, higher than a past year rate amongst this age group of 11% in another study</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one in four respondents reported experiencing moderate to severe levels of depression, which remained stable over the 6 weeks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>over the 6 weeks, symptoms of anxiety, feelings of defeat or being trapped by the situation decreased, and positive wellbeing increased</p>

  <li>
    <p>females, young adults, those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and those with pre-existing mental health problems had worse mental health outcomes</p>

<p>Data from mental health services in south London, from March to June 2020 showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there were 2,561 mental health service user deaths between March and June 2020 which included 1,109 extra deaths when compared to the same period in 2019</p>

<p>Data from a prospective cohort study, between 31 January and 17 July 2020, of 50,815 individuals with psychiatric disorders and 370,233 individuals without psychiatric disorders suggest that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>adults with a psychiatric disorder were more likely to have had COVID-19 compared to those adults without a psychiatric disorder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adults with a psychiatric disorder were more likely to be hospitalised with COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adults with a psychiatric disorder were more likely to die from COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adults with a psychiatric disorder were more likely to be hospitalised for a non-COVID-19 infection</p>

<p>Data on COVID-19 testing in the UK Biobank cohort (of which 1,474 had COVID-19 test data) to compare the prevalence of COVID-19 testing and test outcomes among individuals with psychiatric disorders to those without such diagnoses showed that:</p>

<ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/covid-19-survey/findings/" rel="external">Henderson and colleagues</a>, using data from over 18,000 respondents, collected between 2 May and 31 May 2020, from four of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies’ cohorts (aged 19, 30, 50, and 62) to look at mental health during the lockdown, show that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>younger respondents reported worse mental health than older respondents pre-lockdown</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>women reported worse mental health than men during the lockdown as well as before the lockdown</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>younger respondents, as well as women respondents overall, reported larger increases in psychological distress during the lockdown</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>respondents with lower levels of education reported worse psychological distress than respondents with higher levels of education; these differences were present before and during lockdown</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a sub sample of respondents aged 62 who had also been surveyed in January 2020 reported a deterioration in life satisfaction but also a decrease in symptoms of psychological distress between January and May 2020</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From here onwards are study summaries that were included in previous releases of this chapter.</p>

<p>Data from 48,723 UK adults assessed weekly from 1 April 2020 to 12 May 2020 to examine the association between adverse experiences, worries about adverse experiences and sleep quality shows that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>both a higher number of adverse experiences and a higher number of worries were associated with lower quality sleep - adversity can relate to illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times increased odds of poor quality sleep</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times increased odds of poor quality sleep</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all worries were significantly related to poorer quality sleep, as were adverse experiences except those relating to employment and finances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having a larger social network reduced impacts of factors associated with poor sleep, but there was limited further evidence of moderation by social or psychiatric factors (such as number of close friends, loneliness or history of mental illness)</p>
  </li>

<p>Data from a representative sample of over 13,500 adult respondents with at least two responses from wave 9: 2017 to 2019 and waves 1 and 2 of the Coronavirus survey in April and May 2020 used to examine the impact of COVID-19 and associated stressors on population mental health shows that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>around 30% of respondents who did not report above threshold symptoms of a common mental disorder (<abbr title="common mental disorders">CMD</abbr>) between 2017 and 2019 reported having symptoms that meet a threshold for <abbr title="common mental disorders">CMD</abbr> in April 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>13% of respondents who did not report above threshold symptoms of a <abbr title="common mental disorders">CMD</abbr> in April reported having symptoms that meet a threshold for <abbr title="common mental disorders">CMD</abbr> in May 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prevalence of self-reported <abbr title="common mental disorders">CMD</abbr> in May 2020 (34%) was above pre-pandemic levels, but lower than April (37%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>many of the new cases of <abbr title="common mental disorders">CMD</abbr> identified between April and May 2020 were associated with an increase in feelings of loneliness, and some were associated with increasing domestic work demands (arising out of childcare and home-schooling), working from home, and the receipt of care from outside the home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as the growth in new stressors slowed (such as childcare, working from home) in May (compared to April) there was a reduction in new respondents reporting symptoms of <abbr title="common mental disorders">CMD</abbr> in May 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is some evidence that people have been able to adapt to many of these stressors over the lockdown period through to May 2020</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Data from samples of adults interviewed in four surveys between 2015 and 2020 (n=48,426; 9,748 with complete data for longitudinal analyses), used to study mental health and health behaviours before and during the pandemic shows that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>estimated prevalence of psychological distress (measured using GHQ-12) increased from 19.4% (95% CI 18.7% to 20.0%) in 2017 to 2019 to 30.3% (95% CI 29.1% to 31.6%) in April 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>women’s mental health appears to have been particularly affected, as was that of the most educated and young adults</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>loneliness remained stable overall</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>smoking and e-cigarette use fell</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the frequency of alcohol consumption and binge drinking increased</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20165415v1">Byron and others, from PROTECT</a></p>

<p>Data from 3,281 older adults aged 55 to 96 with at least one data point pre and post March 2020, looking at loneliness, physical activity and mental health during COVID-19 shows that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in 2020, average self-reported depression scores (measured using PHQ-9 screening tool) increased among respondents who also reported loneliness to 3.2 (95% CI: 3.0 to 3.4) - an increase of 1.0 on previous years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>average self-reported depression scores remained constant among respondents who did not report loneliness (1.2, 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.3)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>among people with decreased physical activity, self-reported depression scores rose to 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4 to 2.8), an increase of 0.5 on previous years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for people whose physical activity did not decrease, scores were similar to previous years (1.7, 95% CI: 1.6 to 1.8)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a similar relationship was observed for anxiety scores (using the GAD-7 screening tool) though the differences were smaller and the absolute burden of symptoms lower</p>
  </li>
</ul>
