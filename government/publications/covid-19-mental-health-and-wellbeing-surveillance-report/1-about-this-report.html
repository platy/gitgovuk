<p>This report presents close to real time intelligence on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report" class="govuk-link">mental health and wellbeing of the population in England during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>It compiles routinely updated indicators from multiple sources and summarises important recent findings from a pre-defined set of studies.</p>

<p>It aims to inform policy, planning and commissioning in health and social care and is designed to assist stakeholders at both national and local level.</p>

<p>Delivering close to real time surveillance is logistically challenging and the approach should be viewed as experimental. However, the approach is expected to provide value in situations where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the ability to respond to a changing environment is needed and decisions may need to be made quickly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the certainty in existing evidence is limited, posing a barrier to decision-making</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is likely to be new research evidence emerging that would inform decisions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The report is produced quarterly and aims to include the latest available data and intelligence. It will enable the identification and consideration of changes in mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The report includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this document, which introduces the overall report</li>
  <li>summary of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/2-important-findings-so-far" class="govuk-link">important findings</a> so far</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/3-triangulation-comparison-across-surveys">measures of anxiety, loneliness, depression and life satisfaction</a></li>
  <li>chapter dedicated to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/7-children-and-young-people" class="govuk-link">experiences of children and young people</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-spotlights" class="govuk-link">Spotlight section</a> which includes a series of reports describing different aspects of inequality.  New reports are added regularly.</p>

<p>This report should be viewed together with the <a class="govuk-link" href="#wich">Wider Impacts of COVID-19 on Health (WICH) tool</a>.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>This report does not consider or include data on referrals and access to NHS funded mental health services.</p>

<p>Two useful sources of information on this are the Mental Health Services Monthly Statistics and Psychological Therapies, Report on the use of Adult Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (<abbr title="Adult Improving Access to Psychological Therapies">IAPT</abbr>) Services.</p>

<p>This report draws upon close to real time data and evidence. This is important in the context of a rapidly evolving pandemic, but comes with strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>It is important to explain the basis for the inclusion of evidence and analysis in this report. A methodology document outlines how sources of intelligence have been identified for inclusion and the process undertaken for intelligence synthesis and presentation of findings.</p>

<p>For comments or questions, please email <a href="mailto:mhdnin@phe.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">mhdnin@phe.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3>Strengths and caveats</h3>

<p>It is important to recognise what this surveillance report can and cannot provide.</p>

<h4>Strengths</h4>

<p>The strengths of the report are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it includes regular and frequent updates, which provide a timely flow of intelligence for users during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on identification of near to real-time evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the content of the tracker report will improve over time, in line with the improvements in the evidence base</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the collation of a set of studies which include validated survey questionnaires (for example <abbr title="Patient Health Questionnaire 9">PHQ-9</abbr> symptoms of depression, GAD-7 symptoms of anxiety, GHQ-12 symptoms of mental distress) and self-reported experiences and impacts of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the inclusion of data prior to the COVID-19 lockdown enables understanding of changes (where data is available)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information about vulnerable groups is included (where data is available)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>There are a number of important points and limitations which the user should consider when reading the report, including that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>some trends reported are based on repeated cross section data, for example the survey is carried out with a new sample of participants at each successive time point, therefore, variation may not reflect changes for the same group of participants</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in order to provide as close to real time surveillance as possible, studies included in the tracker report may be working papers or awaiting publication, and as such may not have been subject to peer review</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is a delay in publishing more robust analytical studies due to the time it takes to collect, clean and analyse the data and then make available to the public</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the report is not exhaustive, it is the result of a pragmatic approach to the gathering of and provision of useful evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the report is not a systematic review â see Methodology for the evidence-assessment approach</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>judgement about significance or accuracy of findings is not part of the review process, as a light-touch appraisal is carried out</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the mention of specific studies does not imply that they are endorsed or recommended by the Office of Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) in preference to others of a similar nature that are not mentioned</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the evidence provided within the report should not be viewed as final, definitive or authoritative</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>findings taken from the various data sources have not been verified by <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the report contains information which should be classed as âexperimental statisticsâ</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>changes in incidence and prevalence of severe mental illness (<abbr title="severe mental illness">SMI</abbr>) during the pandemic are not covered in detail within the intelligence materials that this document reports on</p>
  </li>
</ul>
