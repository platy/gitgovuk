<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is chapter 4 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report">COVID-19: mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a>. The chapter presents information that is supplementary to the measures presented in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/3-triangulation-comparison-across-surveys" class="govuk-link">Chapter 3: Measures of anxiety, depression, loneliness and life satisfaction</a>.</p>

<p>The report is regularly updated with the most recent information available.</p>

<p>It is based on 2 sources of information:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>weekly data drawn from the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> COVID-19 Social Study up to Week 8 2021 (22 February)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>weekly data from public YouGov polls of around 2,000 adults up to Week 8 2021 (22 February)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Weekly data serves as an early warning system for potential large changes. It should not be used to draw conclusions about smaller changes up or down from week to week. This is because the data has not been analysed to control for any confounding factors or potential biases. The questions presented here are asked separately so individuals surveyed may report any combination of responses.</p>

<p>Analysis from academic research is included in other chapters of this report to give more nuanced and precise measures of change over time and differences between groups.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>Any deterioration of mental health captured in studies and weekly reporting should not be automatically interpreted as an increase in mental illness or need for mental health services. This is a difficult and stressful time for many, and some short term increases in psychological distress and anxiety are to be expected.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> COVID-19 Social Study concentrates on the psychological and social experiences of adults living in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is not representative of the UK population but instead was designed to have good stratification across a wide range of socio-demographic factors with data weighted to the national population.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that some of the baseline levels for the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> COVID-19 Social Study graphs use data from other countries and therefore may not be wholly representative of UK pre-COVID-19 levels.</p>

<p>The basis for the intelligence included is presented in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/methodology" class="govuk-link">Methodology document</a>.</p>

<h2>Weekly data</h2>

<p>On average, respondents to the surveys reported higher levels of stress and lower levels of wellbeing around the start of the first national lockdown compared to just before the lockdown or baseline measures. Where comparative data is not available measures of stress are high.</p>

<p>In all stress and wellbeing graphs levels appear to have generally improved in the first 3 to 4 months after the first lockdown, and in some cases returned to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>Between September and December 2020 people reported increases in some measures of stress and reduced wellbeing, as well as some increase in sadness. This worsening was not to levels seen in April 2020, though was higher than best available pre-pandemic baselines.</p>

<p>There was a mixed picture of peaks and troughs in measures across the Christmas 2020 and New Year period. This possibly reflects a widening of disparity in wellbeing and mental health across the period.</p>

<p>Since January 2021, there has been a generally positive trend in these measures - there has been some decline in COVID-19 related stress, along with a decline in scared feelings and an increase in happy feelings.</p>

<p>Although graphs show some fluctuation, population level thoughts of death or self-harm and self-reported self-harm have remained relatively stable throughout the period.</p>
