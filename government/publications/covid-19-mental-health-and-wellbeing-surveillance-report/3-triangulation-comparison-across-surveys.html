<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is chapter 3 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a>. The report is regularly updated with the most recent information available.</p>

<p>This chapter presents a comparison of some important indicators of mental health and wellbeing across different surveys and studies (triangulation) to assess consistency of findings. They appear to generally show that the different data sources are broadly in agreement, although there are some differences.</p>

<p>The chapter is composed of 2 main categories of information:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>weekly data drawn from the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> COVID-19 Social Study and <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> up to Week 8 2021 (22 February)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analysis from a range of ongoing academic research projects up to Week 7 2021 (15 February)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The 2 categories of information have separate purposes.</p>

<p>Weekly data serves as an early warning system for potential large changes. It should not be used to draw conclusions about smaller changes up or down from week to week. This is because the data has not been analysed to control for any confounding factors or potential biases.</p>

<p>The analysis from academic research offers a more precise picture of change over time and differences between groups. This intelligence is the basis for a more nuanced interpretation and feeds into the Important findings chapter. Also, please note that intelligence relating to the relative effects on different population groups is covered in more detail in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-spotlights" class="govuk-link">Spotlight chapters</a>.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>Any deterioration of mental health captured in studies and weekly reporting should not be automatically interpreted as an increase in mental illness or need for mental health services. This is a difficult and stressful time for many, and some short term increases in psychological distress and anxiety are to be expected.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>To enable this chapter to be as up to date as possible some pre-print (and therefore not yet peer reviewed) academic research is presented. Even with this approach there is still a time delay between data being gathered and findings reported.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> COVID-19 Social Study concentrates on the psychological and social experiences of adults living in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is not representative of the UK population but instead was designed to have good stratification across a wide range of socio-demographic factors with data weighted to the national population.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that some of the baseline levels for the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> COVID-19 Social Study graphs use data from other countries and therefore may not be wholly representative of UK pre-COVID-19 levels.</p>

<p>The basis for the intelligence included is presented in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/methodology">Methodology document</a></p>

<h2>Anxiety</h2>

<p>Two sources of weekly data on levels of anxiety in the general population, that use different samples and measurement, are shown in the graphs below. Both suggest an initial trend of reducing anxiety from a high point measured early in the first national lockdown. Trends then level off through late spring and summer at above the best available <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18388841/">pre-pandemic baseline</a>. There is evidence of deterioration in average levels of anxiety between August and mid-winter, but not back to the levels reported early in the first lockdown.  There are early signs of some improvement in average levels of anxiety since January 2021.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/118198/1_ucl_anxiety_triangulation_n.JPG"></div></figure>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/118199/2_ons_anxiety_triangulation_n.JPG"></div></figure>

<p>COVID-19 related academic literature supports the picture of an initial increase in anxiety levels in April 2020 followed by a subsequent reduction and then levelling off, and suggests some reasons for this. Trends seen in weekly data since September 2020, where some increase may be evident, are not yet covered by this literature.</p>

<p>A <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/mental-health-before-and-during-covid19-in-two-longitudinal-uk-population-cohorts/2BE4E04F9F7E52B2BCFD7B9FB7833052">longitudinal study with pre and post March 2020 survey responses</a> from 2 generations of people (aged around 30 and 60) residing or born in southwest England found evidence that anxiety levels were higher in April 2020 than pre-pandemic.</p>

<p>Similar results were seen in a cohort of <a href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.30.20239954" rel="external" class="govuk-link">mothers in Bradford</a> – there was a significant increase in anxiety scores during the first lockdown, compared to before the pandemic.</p>

<p>Two studies started in March 2020, one from a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://osf.io/43f2h/">representative sample (2,000 participants)</a> and the other from a <a rel="external" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/9/e040620" class="govuk-link">convenience sample (3,000 participants)</a>, found that mean scores for anxiety in April 2020 were higher than previous population estimates. Low income, loss of income, pre-existing health conditions in self and others, young age, living with children, high perceived risk of infection and being female were all associated with increased risk of anxiety in one or both studies.</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33081860/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">April 2020 average measures of anxiety</a> have improved, though <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30482-X/fulltext" class="govuk-link" rel="external">not back to the best available benchmark</a> from before the pandemic.  The groups that reported the highest levels of anxiety during the first national lockdown were also the groups more likely to report high levels of anxiety before that lockdown (based on the 2014 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey and the 2017 Mental Health of Children and Young People in England Survey, for young adults).</p>

<p>Longitudinal studies established since the onset of the pandemic cannot estimate the initial rise in anxiety because they do not have comparable data from before the pandemic. The <abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal Survey">UKHLS</abbr> does have comparable data but measures psychological distress rather than anxiety. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://osf.io/qd5z7">Analysis of this data</a> suggests that young adults and women were more likely to report larger deteriorations in psychological distress around the start of the first national lockdown.</p>

<p>Over the 20 weeks from the start of the first national lockdown women, younger adults, people with lower levels of educational attainment, and people living with children reported initially worse symptoms of anxiety. They also reported subsequent faster improvement, which narrowed but did not eliminate the gaps observed in April 2020. There was no evidence that this rate of change was related to <a rel="external" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30482-X/fulltext" class="govuk-link">ethnicity, household income or pre-existing mental health conditions</a>.</p>

<p>One study found that <a rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237909" class="govuk-link">adults who experienced probable COVID-19 symptoms</a> in April 2020 were also more likely to report increased levels of psychological distress over the subsequent 3 months than those who had not experienced probable COVID-19 symptoms.  However, <a rel="external" href="https://osf.io/w4gjr/" class="govuk-link">another study looking at the same period found</a> that people experiencing economic adversity were more likely to have general symptoms of anxiety about the pandemic, but there was no association with viral exposure.</p>

<p>The overall picture suggests that the higher risk groups have broadly remained the same since before the onset of the pandemic, but that the rise and fall has not been the same across groups. Higher risk groups have been more likely to report initial larger deteriorations followed by periods of faster recovery than lower risk groups.  There is evidence that while average population levels changed, <a rel="external" href="https://psyarxiv.com/ujwsm" class="govuk-link">most individuals reported low and stable levels of anxiety since the onset of the pandemic</a>. This suggests the changes in average level are mostly driven by higher risk groups.</p>

<h2>Depression</h2>

<p>The figure from the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> COVID-19 Social Study, shown below, suggests that whilst depression levels remain generally stable, and below those seen in April 2020, there is a suggestion of some increase since August 2020.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/118200/3_depression_triangulation_n.JPG"></div></figure>

<p>COVID-19 related academic literature provides a mixed picture of changes in depression since the first national lockdown, and suggests some key determinants associated with worsening of depressive symptoms. Trends seen in weekly data since September are not yet covered by the academic literature.</p>

<p>A <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20133116v1" class="govuk-link">longitudinal study with pre and post March 2020 survey responses</a> from 2 generations of people (aged around 30 and 60) residing or born in southwest England found no evidence that levels of depression in April 2020 were different from pre-pandemic levels. This was corroborated by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/mental-health-and-wellbeing-during-the-covid19-pandemic-longitudinal-analyses-of-adults-in-the-uk-covid19-mental-health-wellbeing-study/F7321CBF45C749C788256CFE6964B00C" rel="external">second study of a nationally representative sample</a> of over 3,000 adults which found no evidence of a change in depressive symptoms over the first 6 weeks of the first national lockdown.</p>

<p>However, 2 other studies, set up since March 2020, one from a <a href="https://osf.io/43f2h/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">representative sample (2,000 participants)</a> and the other from a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/9/e040620">convenience sample (3,000 participants)</a> found that mean scores for depression in April 2020 were worse than the best available pre-pandemic benchmarks.</p>

<p>A more recently published <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronavirusanddepressioninadultsgreatbritain/latest">longitudinal study</a> found evidence of an increase in the proportion of people with depressive symptoms, and that on average symptoms were worse in June 2020 than before the pandemic.</p>

<p>Research from a cohort of <a rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.30.20239954" class="govuk-link">mothers in Bradford</a> has also found a significant increase in depressive symptoms during the first national lockdown, compared to a pre-pandemic baseline. This was associated with loneliness and financial insecurity.</p>

<p>Two studies using data from the COVID-19 Social Study assessed change in self-reported depressive symptoms in the period following the first national lockdown. The first <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v1">suggested that levels were relatively stable</a> during the first 6 weeks. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126300v1" rel="external">second suggested</a> that this was followed by an improvement and subsequent levelling off around August.</p>

<p>At the start of the first national lockdown women, younger adults, people with lower levels of educational attainment, people from lower-income households, people with pre-existing mental health conditions and people living alone reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than the population overall. No evidence was found <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">in this study</a> that ethnicity was associated with depressive symptoms. Caregivers have also been <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131532v1">shown to have a higher risk</a> of having depressive symptoms before, and during, the pandemic.</p>

<p>One study found there was an increased risk of depression during the pandemic in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33274697/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">people with certain common cancers, which</a> was associated with loneliness.</p>

<p>There is evidence that people who provide <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.21.21250045v1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">informal care</a> showed higher levels of depressive symptoms.  <a rel="external" href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/research/publications/526564" class="govuk-link">Symptoms may have been highest</a> in those providing care for children or people with learning disabilities, and also in those who lost formal help during the first national lockdown.</p>

<p>People reporting <a rel="external" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/social-relationships-and-depression-during-the-covid19-lockdown-longitudinal-analysis-of-the-covid19-social-study/C4EC01109B848D2306416BFDC33787C5#.X_8PF2dt-F8.twitter" class="govuk-link">better social contacts</a> were shown to have less depressive symptoms.</p>

<p>The groups that reported the highest levels of depressive symptoms during the first national lockdown were also the groups more likely to report high levels of depressive symptoms before the lockdown (based on the 2014 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey and the 2017 Mental Health of Children and Young People in England Survey (for young adults).</p>

<p>Over the 20 weeks since the start of the first national lockdown women, younger adults, people with lower levels of educational attainment, and people living with children reported <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v1">faster improvements in depressive symptoms</a>. This narrowed some of the gaps observed in April 2020. People living alone experienced the same trends of depressive symptoms as people living with other adults (but no children). There was <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">no evidence that this rate of change</a> was associated with ethnicity, household income or pre-existing mental health conditions.</p>

<p>The overall picture suggests that the higher risk groups have broadly remained the same, but that the observed rise and fall has not been the same across groups. Higher risk groups have been more likely to report worse symptoms at the start of the first national lockdown, followed by faster periods of recovery than lower risk groups. The extent to which levels of depressive symptoms increased around the start of the first national lockdown is less clear than for anxiety, and the improvements in self-reported symptoms took place later than with anxiety. There is evidence that while average levels changed, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://psyarxiv.com/ujwsm">most individuals reported low and stable depressive symptoms since the onset of the pandemic</a>.  This suggests the changes in average level are mainly driven by the higher risk groups, mirroring the picture found in anxiety.</p>

<h2>Life satisfaction</h2>

<p>Two sources of data on levels of life satisfaction, using different samples with the same measure, are presented in the graphs below. Levels recorded in the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> sample are higher overall than those in the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> sample. Both graphs suggest that levels of life satisfaction were low in April 2020 but were then increasing from soon after the first national lockdown and through the summer – although remaining below the pre-pandemic baseline. Figures from recent months indicate some decrease in average levels of life satisfaction since September, with some possible improvement in January 2021.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/118201/4_ucl_lifesatisfaction_triangulation_n.JPG"></div></figure>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/118202/5_ons_life_satisfaction_triangulation_n.JPG" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>COVID-19 related literature supports a picture of an initial fall in life satisfaction early in the first national lockdown. 
Trends seen in recent weekly data have not yet been reflected in the academic literature.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20133116v1">longitudinal study with pre and post-March 2020 survey responses</a> from 2 generations of people (aged around 30 and 60) residing or born in southwest England found evidence that more people were experiencing low wellbeing in April 2020 than before the pandemic.  This study used a wellbeing measure that captured not only life satisfaction but elements of feeling good and functioning well related to mental wellbeing.</p>

<p>Data from a series of age-specific cohorts (19, 30, 50 and 62), surveyed in January and May 2020 suggest that there were increased rates of low life satisfaction in May across all age groups but that it was <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/covid-19-survey/findings/" rel="external">more common among younger adults</a> than older adults. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://11a183d6-a312-4f71-829a-79ff4e6fc618.filesusr.com/ugd/540eba_55b4e2be5ec341e48c393bdeade6a729.pdf">Older people who are shielding or self-isolating</a> have also been shown to have lower life satisfaction during the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Loneliness</h2>

<p>Two sources of data on reported loneliness are presented in the graphs below, the second figure compares to a baseline. They are not wholly consistent. The first suggests that there has been little, if any, overall change during the period since the first national lockdown, whereas the second suggests that since late summer to early autumn an increasing proportion of the population are reporting feeling lonely.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/118203/6_ucl_loneliness_triangulation_n.JPG"></div></figure>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/118204/7_loneliness_ons_triangulation_n.JPG" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>Findings from some studies suggest differing patterns of loneliness for different groups. Trends seen in recent weekly data have not yet been reflected in the academic literature.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.20116657v1">One study</a> (using data from the COVID-19 Social Study covering the first 6 weeks of the first national lockdown), found that average self-reported levels of loneliness were relatively stable overall.</p>

<p>However, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.20116657v1">those who were most lonely</a> reported increases in loneliness, and those who were least lonely reported decreases. This study and another found young adults, women, people with lower levels of educational attainment, people with low income, people who are economically inactive, people with an existing mental health condition, people living alone, and urban residents were more likely to report being lonely during the pandemic (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/3-triangulation-comparison-across-surveys#references" class="govuk-link">references 17, 18</a>). These groups at increased risk were almost identical to those at increased risk pre-lockdown. However, they were more likely to experience increasing loneliness during the pandemic (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/3-triangulation-comparison-across-surveys#references" class="govuk-link">references 17, 18</a>). Certain <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.20116657v1" class="govuk-link">social factors</a>, such as living with others, having close friends, and having strong perceived social support were protective. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/mental-health-and-wellbeing-during-the-covid19-pandemic-longitudinal-analyses-of-adults-in-the-uk-covid19-mental-health-wellbeing-study/F7321CBF45C749C788256CFE6964B00C" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Another study of over 3,000 adults representative of the UK population</a> found that over the first 6 weeks of the first national lockdown levels of loneliness did not change.</p>

<p>Evidence from <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146738v1" class="govuk-link">a longitudinal study</a> from April and May 2020 suggests that where there was an increase in mental distress between those 2 months, much of it was associated with increased feelings of loneliness. One study, analysing the same data source, found that high levels of loneliness were associated with <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131532v1">increased risk of depression among carers</a>. A second study found that women reported more close friends than men before the pandemic, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/research/publications/working-papers/iser/2020-08.pdf" rel="external">increased loneliness</a> after its onset.</p>

<p>Older people with multiple health conditions, or who are shielding or self isolating, were shown to be particularly affected by loneliness (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/3-triangulation-comparison-across-surveys#references">references 16, 21</a>).</p>
