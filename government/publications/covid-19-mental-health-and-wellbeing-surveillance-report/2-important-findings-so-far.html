<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is Chapter 2 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a>. It is a high-level summary of the main findings from a selection of ongoing academic research projects.</p>

<p>It is regularly updated, and currently includes analysis released up to Week 1 2021 (6 January).</p>

<p>Where new findings are presented, this is signalled by the label “NEW:” at the beginning of the first sentence of the new text.</p>

<p>Note: Any deterioration of mental health captured in studies and weekly reporting should not be automatically interpreted as an increase in mental illness or need for mental health services. This is a difficult and stressful time for many, and some short term increases in psychological distress and anxiety are to be expected.</p>

<p>Note: To enable this chapter to be as up to date as possible some pre-print (and therefore not yet peer reviewed) academic research is presented. Even with this approach there is still a time delay between data being gathered and findings reported.</p>

<p>The basis for the intelligence included is presented in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/methodology">Methodology document</a>.</p>

<h2>Changes in population mental health and wellbeing</h2>

<p>Available evidence indicates that self-reported mental health and wellbeing worsened during the first national lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms appeared to peak in April 2020. There is evidence of some recovery by July, perhaps back to pre-pandemic levels, which was sustained until September.</p>

<p>Weekly data (unanalysed) from one of the larger studies signals that self-reported mental health and wellbeing may have worsened again between October 2020 and January 2021. This will be monitored closely and confirmed through further analysis.</p>

<p>Many studies have analysed data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (<abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal Survey">UKHLS</abbr>). They suggest that, among adults:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14874" class="govuk-link" rel="external">average mental distress</a> (measured using GHQ-12) was 8.1% higher in April 2020 than it was between 2017 and 2019</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>after accounting for the increasing trend since 2014, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3624264" rel="external">average mental distress</a> was 0.5 points higher than expected in April 2020 (on the GHQ-12 scale)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proportion of adults who <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/mjg72/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">reported</a> a clinically significant level of psychological distress increased from 20.7% in 2019 to 29.5% in April 2020, before returning to 21.4% in July 2020 and 21.5% in September 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proportion of <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157255v1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">people experiencing sleep problems</a> increased from 16% before the pandemic to 25% in April 2020</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Although not wholly consistent, data from other longitudinal studies broadly corroborates these findings.</p>

<p>A study in southwest England found evidence of an increase in anxiety and low wellbeing during the first national lockdown compared to before the lockdown. However, it found <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/mental-health-before-and-during-covid19-in-two-longitudinal-uk-population-cohorts/2BE4E04F9F7E52B2BCFD7B9FB7833052">no evidence of a change in depressive symptoms</a>. On the other hand, a study of people surveyed between July 2019 and March 2020, and then again in June 2020, suggests that <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronavirusanddepressioninadultsgreatbritain/latest" class="govuk-link">the proportion of people reporting depressive symptoms</a> increased and that those symptoms worsened over the period.</p>

<p>Various new mental health related longitudinal studies were set up in March 2020. Two have reported that levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms and stress during the first national lockdown were higher than the best available pre-COVID-19 benchmarks (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 7,8</a>). A <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v1" class="govuk-link">third study</a> suggests that there were significant decreases in anxiety and depressive symptoms between April and August 2020.</p>

<h2>Which population groups are reporting worse mental health and wellbeing? And which groups have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic?</h2>

<p>Population measures are useful for understanding overall levels of mental health and wellbeing. However, they can hide variation within the population. There is evidence that some groups are more likely to report worse mental health and wellbeing than others. There is also evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a larger adverse impact on the mental health and wellbeing of some groups than others.</p>

<h3>Individual characteristics (age, gender and ethnicity)</h3>

<p>Young adults (aged between 18 and 34, depending on the study) and women were more likely to report worse mental health and wellbeing during the first national lockdown than older adults and men. This is similar to pre-pandemic patterns, but the differences may have increased. (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 1, 2, 5–8,10–17</a>). There is evidence that women and young adults experienced a faster recovery between April and September. This has reduced some of the differences between groups observed in April (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 9,10</a>).</p>

<p>Older adults who were recommended to shield were more likely to report higher levels of depression, anxiety and loneliness in June and July 2020 than people of a similar age but not recommended to shield. Rates were highest in <a href="https://11a183d6-a312-4f71-829a-79ff4e6fc618.filesusr.com/ugd/540eba_5e1ce6de279947e7adc0a09b23d5fe53.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">those who were recommended to shield</a> and strictly complied with that guidance. These groups were also more likely to report lower levels of happiness, life satisfaction and sense of purpose. Another <a href="https://11a183d6-a312-4f71-829a-79ff4e6fc618.filesusr.com/ugd/540eba_bb1d692cf19a4b79bf68b2c5dd9a3d1f.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">study</a> of the same cohort showed that older adults with multi-morbidities (many of whom were self-isolating) reported higher levels of depression and loneliness than older adults without multi-morbidities.</p>

<p>NEW: A <a href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248238" class="govuk-link" rel="external">qualitative study</a> has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among older adults. Risks to wellbeing include mortality concerns, fears about the virus, grief for the loss of normality, restricted access to health services and restricted access to activities that protect wellbeing. Factors that are protective of wellbeing included the slower pace of life, maintaining a routine, socialising and use of past coping skills. Many participants drew on their resilience and life experience to self-manage fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic, using their time during lockdown to reflect or organise end-of-life affairs.</p>

<p>Two studies sought to understand differences in mental distress between men and women. They show evidence that family and caring responsibilities play a role, as do social factors. Women were more likely to have made larger adjustments to manage housework and childcare during the first lockdown than men. These adjustments were associated with increased distress (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 20, 21</a>). <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/research/publications/526127" rel="external">Women also reported</a> having more close friends and a larger subsequent increase in loneliness than men during the first national lockdown.</p>

<p>Adults living with children have been more likely to <a rel="external" href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/research/publications/526249" class="govuk-link">report worsening mental health</a> than adults living without children. <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://osf.io/wzu4t">Lone mothers have been particularly vulnerable</a>. One <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronavirusanddepressioninadultsgreatbritain/latest" rel="external" class="govuk-link">study</a> has reported an increase in the proportion of parents reporting depressive symptoms. However, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">another study</a> suggests that while adults living with children have reported higher levels of anxiety than adults living without children, they have also reported lower levels of depressive symptoms.</p>

<p>One <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp13503.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">study</a> found that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (<abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr>) men (when grouped together) reported a larger deterioration in mental health than White British men during the first national lockdown. The deterioration reported among <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> women was similar to that reported among White British women. It also found that among <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> adults there was no evidence of variation in mental health deterioration by gender. This suggests that the gender gap reported across a number of studies may be a phenomenon mostly seen within the White British population.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/working-papers/2020-14.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">second study</a> analysing the same data set supported these findings for both men and women. In addition, it reported that in April and June 2020, Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani and White British men had all reported declines in mental health since before the pandemic. Bangladeshi and Pakistani men had reported larger declines than White British men.</p>

<p>A third relevant <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR220880" rel="external" class="govuk-link">study has analysed data from mothers in Bradford</a>, an ethnically diverse area with high levels of deprivation. The study found that clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety were more common among White British mothers than mothers of other ethnicities. Clinically significant symptoms were also more common among mothers with more economic insecurity. Participants who provided free text in their survey responses corroborated these findings. They also highlighted [high levels of anxiety about becoming ill or dying from COVID-19]. NEW: The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.30.20239954">two variables with the strongest association with clinically important increases in depression and anxiety</a> (greater than 5 points) were loneliness and financial insecurity. Increased household financial insecurity was associated with greater increases in depression and anxiety among White British mothers than Pakistani mothers. Decreased physical activity was associated with a larger increase in depression among White British mothers than Pakistani mothers, but the association between anxiety and physical activity was similar in both groups.</p>

<p>A fourth <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v1">study</a>, looking at changes in anxiety and depression between April and August 2020, has reported that <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> respondents (when grouped together) were more likely than White British respondents to report higher levels of depression and anxiety, but that this gap did not change over time.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the sample sizes for minority ethnicity respondents in most of these studies are relatively small. This makes the estimates less precise.  In addition, the interaction between ethnicity and potential confounding factors needs further consideration. Potential factors include income, employment as a key worker, community networks and family/caring responsibilities. Observations so far can only suggest associations.</p>

<h3>Adults with pre-existing mental health conditions</h3>

<p>Adults with pre-existing mental health conditions have reported higher levels of anxiety, depression and loneliness than adults without pre-existing mental health conditions. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this gap has changed since the start of lockdown.(<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 9, 14, 27</a>). A comparatively small but in depth survey of people using primary and secondary care with severe mental health conditions has reported preliminary findings. The majority of respondents so far have reported stable mental health during the pandemic. Around a quarter of <a rel="external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jocHbP2xsBM5LsfaewSIbOrel3pM09F9/view?usp=drive_open&amp;usp=embed_facebook" class="govuk-link">people currently receiving support from mental health services</a> said that they would need more support than they received before the pandemic restrictions, and a further quarter said that they might need additional support.</p>

<p>NEW: A <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241067">qualitative study</a> has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among adults with pre-existing mental health conditions. Feeling safe but isolated at home, disruption to mental health services, cancelled plans and changed routines, uncertainty and lack of control, and rolling media coverage were identified as potential risk factors. Five coping strategies and protective factors were also identified; previous experience of adversity, feeling less accountable to others, engaging in hobbies and activities, staying connected with others and perceived social support.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20169847v1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Data from the UK Biobank</a> suggests that people with a psychiatric disorder have been more likely to be diagnosed with, hospitalised by and die from COVID-19 than people without a psychiatric disorder. An <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.25.20219071v1">NHS Foundation Trust in London reported</a> 1,109 excess deaths among people with pre-existing mental health disorders between March and June 2020. This is out of a total of 2,561 deaths on their mental health register during the period and based on a comparison between 2019 and 2020. COVID-19 was recorded as the underlying cause in 64% of this excess. The remainder of the excess was accounted for as either unnatural/as yet unexplained or from neurodegenerative conditions. The study does not compare excess deaths among adults with severe mental illness (SMI) to that among adults with no SMI, or account for the impact of comorbidities.</p>

<p>The trust covers an ethnically diverse and urban catchment, with high levels of deprivation. They <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152710v1" class="govuk-link">report</a> a higher excess mortality ratio among their Black African, Black Caribbean and Other Ethnicity populations. High excess mortality among adults with SMI has also been reported in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, including among adults aged 40 to 60.</p>

<p>Underlying health conditions (particularly respiratory and cardiovascular) are now known to increase risk of COVID-19 mortality. A recent <a rel="external" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3731" class="govuk-link">study</a> found that SMI was associated with an increased risk of dying from COVID-19 (26% higher for women compared to women with no SMI, and 29% higher among men). However, this increased risk was relatively modest compared to some other conditions, for instance, type II diabetes was associated with a 529% increased risk for women (compared to women without this diagnosis) and 374% increased risk for men.</p>

<p>With respect to service use, the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.20193730v1_">NHS Trust in London report</a> that their Community Mental Health Teams saw relatively stable caseloads and total contact numbers between March and May. However, they saw a substantial shift from face-to-face to virtual contacts. Their Home Treatment Team saw the same shift to virtual contacts but reductions in caseloads and total contacts.  Similar patterns were observed in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395620309845" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Cambridgeshire and Peterborough</a>, followed by a return towards volumes comparable to previous years.</p>

<p>There is <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abuse-selfharm-and-suicidal-ideation-in-the-uk-during-the-covid19-pandemic/692FD08F3AEFF45036535F5E9CEBAA00">survey evidence</a> to suggest that fewer than half of adults affected by abuse, self-harm and thoughts of suicide/self-harm accessed formal or informal support during April 2020, although it is not clear whether this is more or less than before the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Employment and income</h3>

<p>A greater proportion of adults with low household income or relative socioeconomic position reported symptoms of anxiety and depression than adults with higher household income or socioeconomic position during the first national lockdown (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 7,27</a>). One <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.20101717v2" class="govuk-link" rel="external">study found that adverse experiences</a>, such as COVID-19 illness, financial difficulties or difficulty accessing food and medicine were having a larger impact on mental health and wellbeing among adults in a lower socioeconomic position. Two studies found that having a low income was associated with loneliness and increasing levels of loneliness during the lockdown (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 14,15</a>).</p>

<p>Adults who were not in employment were more likely to report worse and increasing loneliness than those in work (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 15,37</a>). Adults who experienced loss of income early in the lockdown reported higher levels of <a rel="external" href="https://osf.io/43f2h/" class="govuk-link">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33280639/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">mental distress</a>. Having some <a href="http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/57487/1/V6%20Draft%20COVID%20paper%20GHQ-12%20and%20employment%2020200629.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">paid work or continued connection to a job</a> during the pandemic was associated with better mental health than not having any work. This is complemented by research suggesting that disruptions in employment have had a smaller impact on psychological distress where income has been protected through the government’s income support programmes or sick pay. The study goes on to say that the immigrant population have been less likely to have their income protected, and are <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14616696.2020.1826557">more likely to experience higher levels of psychological distress</a> following disruptions in employment, whether or not their income is protected. There is also evidence of increasing mental distress among some employed adults, as well as among adults with more educational qualifications (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 2,11</a>).</p>

<p>Women in lower socioeconomic positions have been more likely than women in higher socioeconomic positions and men in general to be furloughed, working as a key worker or working in a person facing role. Women in lower socioeconomic positions have been slightly more likely to report higher levels of psychological distress than women in higher socioeconomic positions although <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/business/documents/research/carrying-the-work-burden-of-covid-19/briefing-note-2.pdf">this study</a> did not observe a clear socioeconomic gradient.</p>

<p>NEW: A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osf.io/74sdr" rel="external">qualitative study</a> has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among creative freelance workers (such as musicians and actors). Findings suggest the pandemic is affecting their psychological wellbeing through employment loss, financial instability and work dissonance (such as problems transitioning to online work).</p>

<p>More detail can be found in the Spotlight section relating to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-spotlights">employment and income</a>.</p>

<h3>Carers and key workers</h3>

<p>One <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://osf.io/3gcjn/">study found evidence</a> that key workers experienced worse mental health and wellbeing in April 2020 than non-key workers. A second study found <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126300v1" class="govuk-link">evidence of the opposite</a>, and two further studies found no evidence of a difference (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 2,5</a>).</p>

<p>NEW: A <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.25.20238766">qualitative study</a> has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among frontline health and social care professionals. The participants were interviewed between May and September 2020, and expressed difficulties such as communication challenges (virtual consulting and difficult conversations) and changing work conditions (longer working hours, fatigue and exhaustion), but also positive factors such as increased team unity at work and a greater reflection on what matters in life.</p>

<p>One study has found that <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131532v1" class="govuk-link">caregivers were more likely to report depressive symptoms than non caregivers</a>, both before and during the pandemic, and that this was increased when the caregiver also felt lonely.</p>

<p>NEW: A study of <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqaa220">staff working in intensive care units</a> during the pandemic has reported potentially elevated rates of clinically significant mental health problems, most notably Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. However, the same study also found that more than half of the respondents reported good wellbeing.</p>

<h3>Long term physical health conditions</h3>

<p>One study found that <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.09.20126300v1">adults with long term physical health conditions</a> reported worse levels of depressive symptoms than adults without long term physical health conditions. A study specifically looking at <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20190793v1">adults with asthma</a> found that they were more likely to report higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, particularly among young adults.</p>

<p>NEW: A recent study has observed an increased risk of depression among <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33274697/" rel="external">adults with cancer</a> of the breast, prostate and blood, but not other cancers (e.g., lung, melanoma). After controlling for prior depression and other factors, it was loneliness during COVID-19, and not previous loneliness, that was predictive.</p>

<p>NEW: A qualitative study has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among <a href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243246" rel="external" class="govuk-link">adults with long term health conditions</a>. The authors identified four overarching themes. These were high levels of fear and anxiety related to perceived consequences of catching COVID-19, the impact of shielding/isolation, the experience of healthcare during the pandemic and anxiety created by uncertainty about the future. Acceptance, support and understanding of the needs of adults with long term conditions supported coping during isolation.</p>

<h3>Experience of COVID-19</h3>

<p>One study found that <a rel="external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120317479" class="govuk-link">adults who have had COVID-19-related symptoms</a> were more likely to report high levels of mental distress and loneliness than adults who had not had such symptoms. But, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146738v1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">another study found no evidence of this</a> after controlling for other factors. NEW: A more recent study has found that <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237909">people who report a probable COVID-19 infection</a> also report higher levels of psychological distress than people who do not report a probable COVID-19 infection. This is the case up to three months after the probable infection. This association was stronger among younger age groups and men than older age groups and women.</p>

<h3>Change over time between different groups</h3>

<p>Two studies have reported on change over time since the end of the first national lockdown – one covers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osf.io/qd5z7" rel="external">April to June</a>, the other <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v3" rel="external" class="govuk-link">April to August</a>. Both find that young adults and women, after initial deteriorations, have reported greater subsequent improvements in mental health and wellbeing than older adults and men. The second study also finds that people with lower levels of education and people living with children reported greater subsequent improvement in depressive symptoms and anxiety – reducing but not eliminating some of the differences reported during the first lockdown. This <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v3">study found no evidence</a> that the rates of initial deterioration or subsequent improvement have been related to ethnicity, household income or pre-existing mental health conditions.</p>

<h3>Other findings</h3>

<p>There is mixed or limited evidence for some other associations with mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic, which make drawing conclusions on these characteristics difficult. A summary is presented below.</p>

<p>One study found <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.20116657v2" class="govuk-link">adults living in urban areas</a> reported worse and increasing loneliness. Another study found <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://osf.io/43f2h/">no evidence of a difference</a> in depression and anxiety between urban and rural areas.</p>

<p>NEW: A study analysing <a href="https://osf.io/kmgzw" class="govuk-link" rel="external">eating patterns during the pandemic</a> found that the majority of adults report not changing the amount they eat. However, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report a change (eating either more or less). Adults with higher education were less likely to report a change. Loneliness was associated with persistently eating more, whereas being single or divorced or the experience of stressful life events was associated with consistently eating less.</p>

<p>Note: Data from recent weeks that are covered in weekly data reporting have not yet been considered within the literature covered in this chapter.</p>
