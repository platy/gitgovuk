<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is chapter 2 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a>. It is a high-level summary of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the mental health and wellbeing of the population in England.</p>

<p>It is regularly updated, and currently includes evidence and analysis that was released into the public domain up to 6 September 2021.</p>

<p>To enable this chapter to be as up to date as possible some ‘pre-print’ academic research is presented. This research has not yet been peer reviewed. It is included here to enable timely reporting. Even with this approach there is still a time delay between data being gathered and findings reported.</p>

<p>The following information relates specifically to adults. The COVID-19 mental health and wellbeing surveillance report includes a separate chapter dedicated to the experiences of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/7-children-and-young-people">children and young people</a>.</p>

<p>The basis for the intelligence included is presented in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/methodology" class="govuk-link">Methodology document</a></p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>Any short-term deteriorations in self-reported mental health should not automatically be interpreted as an increase in mental illness or need for mental health services. This continues to be a difficult and stressful time for many.</p>

<h2>Changes in population mental health and wellbeing</h2>

<p>Multiple studies revealed deteriorations in mental health and wellbeing between March and May 2020, followed by a period of improvement through July, August and September 2020 to a point where levels were comparable to before the pandemic. There was a second deterioration in population mental health and wellbeing between October 2020 and February 2021, followed by another period of recovery but not to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>Analysis of data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (<abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal studies">UKHLS</abbr>) has tracked changes in levels of psychological distress during the pandemic. It suggests the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://osf.io/8mpxr">proportion of adults aged 18 and over reporting a clinically significant level of psychological distress</a> increased from 20.8% in 2019 to 29.5% in April 2020, then falling back to 21.3% by September 2020. There was a subsequent increase to 27.1% in January 2021, followed by a further decrease to 24.5% in late March 2021. This has been broadly corroborated by other studies also looking at anxiety, depressive symptoms, loneliness, sleep and stress (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 2 to 8</a>). However, the period of ‘recovery’ in summer 2020 was not observed in all studies, in particular national data from the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) looking at <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronavirusanddepressioninadultsgreatbritain/latest">depression in adults</a> and data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging considering <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.21256385v1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">mental health and wellbeing of older adults (aged over 52)</a>.</p>

<p>The ‘up and down’ nature of these changes coincides with the periods of national lockdown and high COVID-19 cases followed by easing of lockdown and reducing cases.</p>

<p>It is also important to monitor the prevalence of self-harm thoughts and behaviours. Another large study of adults aged 18 and over found that 26.1% of respondents reported self-harm thoughts and 7.9% self-harm behaviours at least once between March 2020 and May 2021. This study does not have a pre-pandemic comparison. The largest adversity contributing to <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.19.21252050v2" class="govuk-link" rel="external">increases in both self-harm thoughts and behaviours</a> was having experienced physical or psychological abuse between April and August 2021. Having had COVID-19 and financial worries were also associated with increased likelihood of both outcomes. Early on in the pandemic it was reported that fewer than half of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7360935/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">adults affected by abuse, self-harm and thoughts of suicide/self-harm</a> accessed formal or informal support.</p>

<h2>Variation within the population</h2>

<p>The overall trends summarised above mask variation within the population. Evidence shows that the mental health and wellbeing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been different for different groups of people.</p>

<p>Studies looking at mental health trajectories for individuals suggest most of the population retained stable and good levels of mental health during the pandemic.  However, some groups have been more likely to experience poor or deteriorating mental health during this period. These include women, young adults (aged between 18 and 34, depending on the study), adults with pre-existing mental or physical health conditions, adults experiencing loss of income or employment, adults in deprived neighbourhoods, some ethnic minority populations and those who experienced local lockdowns. In addition, those who felt lonely, felt a lack of control over their lives, who found uncertainty difficult or who were anxious about death were also more likely to experience worse or deteriorating mental health.  However, women and young people, people with lower levels of education and people living with children, following initial deterioration, also reported greater improvements and recoveries in mental health when case numbers had fallen and lockdowns were eased (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 6, 13 to15</a>).</p>

<p>A population <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://psyarxiv.com/42dfu/">study looking at anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms</a> found that psychological responses to the pandemic were stable for most of the population between April 2020 and May 2021. Two-thirds of the respondents were classified as ‘resilient’ (stable and low distress throughout), about 15% as ‘moderate-stable’ (continuously mid-levels of distress), roughly 6%  ‘Chronic’ (continuously high distress), 4.7% ‘increasing mental distress’ and 6.5% ‘adaptive’ (starting with high levels of distress but then decreasing).</p>

<p>Recent <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.24.21251565v1">analysis of UK Household Longitudinal Study (<abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal studies">UKHLS</abbr>) data</a> between April 2020 and May 2021 found a larger proportion of the population experienced psychological distress than previous estimates suggest. Around two fifths of the population experienced severely elevated risks of distress during the pandemic, with 8% reporting an initial increase followed by a quick recovery, 14.8% experiencing persistently elevated risks, and 24% experienced mildly elevated distress and then recovery in the first wave, then greater increases in the second wave. This suggests that some groups may experience increasing mental distress from cumulative pandemic waves.  Long-term distress was highest among younger people, women, people living without a partner, those who had no work or lost income, and those with previous health conditions or COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<p>The following text summarises further evidence to date on mental health and wellbeing variation within the population during the pandemic. For more details, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-spotlights">spotlight chapters</a> (please note spotlights are up to date at their original time of publication).</p>

<h3>Age and gender</h3>

<p>Young adults and women have been more likely to report larger fluctuations in self-reported mental health and wellbeing than older adults and men. This was especially true between March and May 2020 (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 1 to 2, 5 to 8, 12 to 19</a>).</p>

<p>Two studies sought to understand the differences in mental distress between men and women. They show evidence that family and caring responsibilities play a role, as do social factors. Women were more likely to have made larger adjustments to manage housework and childcare during the first lockdown than men. These adjustments were associated with increased distress (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 18 to 19</a>). <a href="https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/research/publications/working-papers/iser/2020-08" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Women also reported having more close friends and a larger subsequent increase in loneliness than men</a> during the first national lockdown.</p>

<p>Analysis of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34175713/" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal studies">UKHLS</abbr> data between June and November 2020</a> found that young adults (aged 18 to 25) reported decreasing then rapidly increasing levels of loneliness. There was a sharp rise in self-reported loneliness during the winter months under the national lockdown. Young adults with long-standing physical or mental health conditions, lower household incomes or who were unemployed or not in school reported higher levels of loneliness than their peers. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34271372/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Another study looking at the same age group</a> between April and November 2020 found that alcohol consumption, smoking, being female, having a lower income, and having a pre-existing mental health condition were related to experiencing worse mental health during the pandemic. For young adult females, mental distress was highest in April 2020 but gradually improved until September, when it began to increase again. Young adult males, in contrast, had a comparatively stable trajectory of mental health across the pandemic.</p>

<p>Analysis of <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.21256385v1" class="govuk-link">data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (<abbr title="English Longitudinal Study of Aging">ELSA</abbr>)</a>, which includes adults aged 52 and over, found that the prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms increased from 12.5% pre-pandemic to 22.6% in June to July 2020, with a further rise to 28.5% in November to December. This was accompanied by increased loneliness and deterioration in quality of life. A <a rel="external" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00069-4/fulltext" class="govuk-link">further study</a> using the same data identified that after taking covariates and pre-pandemic levels into account, clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly increased among people with a disability (as measured by the Activities of Daily Living scale) compared with people without a disability. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-open/article/risk-factors-for-depression-during-the-covid19-pandemic-a-longitudinal-study-in-middleaged-and-older-adults/0159DE6CF3CBBE5D57A1C2DA00B3C025#article-tab">Another study</a> of the same data found that younger age (within the sample of adults over 52), female gender, higher depression scores before the pandemic, living alone and having a long-standing illness were also significant risk factors.</p>

<p><abbr title="English Longitudinal Study of Aging">ELSA</abbr> data also suggests some <a rel="external" href="https://11a183d6-a312-4f71-829a-79ff4e6fc618.filesusr.com/ugd/540eba_078f1bd6200149f9832ea95f0ed9a7ae.pdf" class="govuk-link">changing patterns over the 2 waves of the pandemic in 2020</a> for older adults. Respondents with poor physical health were more likely to report feeling socially isolated during the first wave (June to July 2020) than the second (November to December 2020) . Conversely, respondents in the poorest wealth quintile were more likely to feel socially isolated and lonely during the second wave than the first or before the pandemic. Men experienced more social isolation in the second wave compared to the first.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://11a183d6-a312-4f71-829a-79ff4e6fc618.filesusr.com/ugd/540eba_55b4e2be5ec341e48c393bdeade6a729.pdf">Older adults who were recommended to shield</a> were more likely to report higher levels of depression, anxiety and loneliness in June and July 2020 than people of a similar age but not recommended to shield. Rates were highest in those who were recommended to shield and strictly complied with that guidance. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10111115/">Another study</a> of the same cohort showed that older adults with multi-morbidities (many of whom were self-isolating) reported higher levels of depression and loneliness than older adults without multi-morbidities.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsoc.2021.714626/full" rel="external" class="govuk-link">study focusing on adults aged over 60 in June 2020</a> observed a decline in general mental wellbeing following the outbreak of COVID-19. It also found that more frequent face-to-face contact during the pandemic was associated with better general mental wellbeing, but virtual contact, via means such as telephone and digital media, was not. Increases in loneliness following the outbreak of the pandemic were greater for older adults who reported more virtual contact.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34311710/">qualitative study of adults aged over 70</a> identified fears for mortality, grieving for normal life and concerns for the future as issues that may be impacting on mental health and wellbeing. Participants also highlighted a range of strategies they used to help and protect their mental health. These included adopting a slower pace of life, maintaining routine, socialising and drawing on resilience they had gained through life experience to manage the uncertainty and fear.</p>

<h3>Ethnicity</h3>

<p>There is mixed evidence about the impact of the pandemic on mental health and wellbeing by ethnicity. The associations between ethnicity and mental health during the pandemic are influenced by other factors, such as employment and income protection, community, gender and deprivation. Many population based studies do not have sufficient ethnic minority respondents to enable a detailed look at experiences and outcomes of specific ethnic groups.</p>

<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3784647" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Data from the <abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal studies">UKHLS</abbr></a> have highlighted that those of non-White ethnicity (when grouped together) were at higher risk of reporting deteriorations in mental health that were sustained or worsened between March and September 2020.</p>

<p>Other studies of this same data set add more detail. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/working-papers/2020-14.pdf" rel="external">Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani and White British men</a> all reported declines in mental health during the first wave and national lockdown, with Bangladeshi and Pakistani men reporting the largest declines. In addition, the deterioration reported among <a rel="external" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244419" class="govuk-link">Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (<abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr>) women</a> was similar to that reported among White British women, and among <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> adults there was no evidence of variation by gender. This suggests that the gender gap reported across a number of studies may be a phenomenon mostly seen within the White British population.</p>

<p>A separate population study, this time with a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v3">convenience sample but weighted to the population</a>, reported that <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> respondents (when grouped together) were more likely to report higher levels of depression and anxiety between April and August 2020, but that the gap did not change over that time period.</p>

<p>A study of mothers in Bradford in 2020 found that clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety were more common among White British mothers than mothers of other ethnicities, and that clinically significant symptoms were more common among mothers with more economic insecurity (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 33-47</a>).</p>

<p>For more information please read the spotlight on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-spotlights/ethnicity-covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report" class="govuk-link">ethnicity</a>.</p>

<h3>Adults with pre-existing mental health problems</h3>

<p>Adults with pre-existing mental health conditions have reported higher levels of anxiety, depression and loneliness than adults without pre-existing mental health conditions. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33308420/" rel="external">One large study</a> found no evidence that this gap changed between April and August 2020. However, <a rel="external" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3784647" class="govuk-link">another large study</a> found that adults with pre-existing mental health conditions were more likely to report steady deterioration or very poor mental health between April and October 2020 than adults without.</p>

<p>A range of analyses have found that people with severe mental illness have been more likely to die from COVID-19 than the general population (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 35 to 37</a>).</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10126587/">Recent analysis</a> has found that those suffering from psychological distress before the pandemic were more likely to experience disruptions related to healthcare, employment or loss of income. They were also more likely to experience multiple disruptions across different domains during the pandemic (such as delayed surgery and reduced working hours).</p>

<p>With respect to service use, an <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130419v1" class="govuk-link">NHS Trust in London reported</a> that their Community Mental Health Teams saw relatively stable caseloads and total contact numbers between March and May 2020. However, they saw a substantial shift from face-to-face to virtual contacts. Their Home Treatment Teams (providing more intensive support at home for acute mental health problems) saw the same shift to virtual contacts but reductions in caseloads and total contacts. <a rel="external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7508053/" class="govuk-link">Similar patterns were observed in a trust in East of England</a> between March and August 2020, followed by a return towards volumes comparable to previous years.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34323635/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">qualitative study of adults with mental health conditions</a> identified a range of themes that may contribute to deteriorations in mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. These were feeling safe but isolated at home, disruption to mental health services, cancelled plans and changed routines, uncertainty and lack of control and the rolling media coverage. The study also highlighted  strategies that were used to cope and maintain good mental health. These included drawing on resilience from previous experiences of adversity, time for reflection, engaging in hobbies and activities, staying connected with others and appreciating the social support available.</p>

<p>Data about the use of secondary mental health and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/improving-access-to-psychological-therapies-data-set">Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies</a> (<abbr title="Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies">IAPT</abbr>) is available.</p>

<p>For more information please read the spotlight on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-spotlights/pre-existing-mental-health-conditions-spotlight" class="govuk-link">adults with pre-existing mental health conditions</a>.</p>

<h3>Employment and income</h3>

<p>Unemployed adults and adults with lower incomes have reported higher levels of psychological distress, anxiety, depression and loneliness during the pandemic than adults with higher incomes (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 4, 41 to 43</a>). There is mixed evidence about whether this gap has changed since before the pandemic. One large study found <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33308420/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">no evidence that deteriorations and recoveries were associated with household income between April and August 2020</a>. Another found that <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3784647" class="govuk-link" rel="external">adults living in more deprived areas were more likely to report steadily deteriorating or very bad mental health</a> between April and October 2020.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/57487/" class="govuk-link">Loss of income and employment has been associated with worsening mental health during the pandemic</a>. On average, any connection to a job or income (even if reduced compared to before the pandemic) has been better for mental health and wellbeing than none.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.natcen.ac.uk/our-research/research/exploring-the-relationship-between-economic-security,-furlough-and-mental-distress/">Furlough has protected mental health among people with long-term insecure jobs</a>. On average, furloughed workers in long-term insecure jobs before and during the first national lockdown reported no increase in mental distress, unlike counterparts who had not been furloughed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.natcen.ac.uk/our-research/research/finances-and-mental-health-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">those who sought help from self-employment support schemes and Universal Credit</a> to cover losses in income experienced comparably large and sustained increases in mental distress during the pandemic.</p>

<p>A <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.natcen.ac.uk/our-research/research/finances-and-mental-health-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"><abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal studies">UKHLS</abbr> study (wave 6, 12,426 adults) looking at income change between May 2020 and January 2021</a> found that 43% experienced stable, undisrupted income, 29% increased income and a further 20% were able to cope with use of savings or changing spending behaviours.  4% sought external help for finances and a further 4% had multiple struggles, needing many different types of non-work-based financial support (additional benefits, borrowing and use of savings).  Around 14% of those with multiple struggles reported a new mental health diagnosis between May 2020 and January 2021, compared with 5% of those with undisrupted income and 4% of those with increased income.</p>

<p>One study found <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620307401?via%3Dihub">adults living in urban areas reported worse and increasing loneliness</a>. Another study <a href="https://osf.io/43f2h/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">found no evidence of a difference in depression and anxiety between urban and rural areas</a>.</p>

<p>Between April and June 2020 <a rel="external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34297763/" class="govuk-link">levels of hedonic (feeling good) and evaluative (life satisfaction) wellbeing  decreased</a>. However, for those living in more deprived neighbourhoods the level of hedonic wellbeing decreased more than for those living in more affluent areas. No difference for evaluative wellbeing was found.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34234704/" class="govuk-link">effect of neighbourhood social stressors on psychological distress was stronger during lockdown compared to pre-pandemic</a>. The difference in psychological distress associated with living in a neighbourhood with high numbers of social stressors (including lack of access to community resources, green space, littering, graffiti, vandalism) compared with living in a neighbourhood with a lower number of social stressors increased by 20% during the lockdown period compared to pre-pandemic.  Meanwhile, the effect of neighbourhood property crime on mental health did not change during the lockdown.</p>

<h3>Key workers</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255817v1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">study, with 21,874 participants, comparing non key workers with 4 types of key workers</a> – health and social care, teachers and childcare, public service, and essential services key workers (for example food chain or utility) found that between March 2020 and February 2021 key workers have consistently reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than non-key workers. However, there is no evidence that this gap has changed during the pandemic.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dn43c/">qualitative study has reported that key workers experienced adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, including fears of COVID-19 exposure, contagion and subsequent transmission to others, especially their families. These concerns were often experienced in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and a lack of workplace mitigation practices. Key workers also described multiple work-related challenges, including increased workload, a lack of public and organisational recognition and feelings of disempowerment.</p>

<h3>Parents and carers</h3>

<p>Adults living with children reported a rise in symptoms of anxiety, psychological distress and stress in April 2020, which subsided over the summer, but appeared to increase again over the winter and into 2021 (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 4, 9, 52</a>). Initial evidence suggests that parents and carers of children reported largest deteriorations in mental health and wellbeing during the second wave and national lockdown. There may have been an increase in the proportion of parents reporting depressive symptoms during the first national lockdown, but prevalence of this has remained lower among adults living with children than adults living alone. <a rel="external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33308420/" class="govuk-link">Adults living with children</a> have also been less likely to report feeling lonely, or increasing loneliness over time, than adults living alone. Financial and food insecurity, loneliness and increased time spent on childcare and home schooling have been associated with worsening mental health and wellbeing among parents (<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 18, 35, 53)</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.13.21256805v1" class="govuk-link">qualitative study undertaken between June and November 2020</a>, a group of 29 parents of young children described stress and exhaustion from navigating multiple pressures and conflicting responsibilities with home, schooling, and work, without their usual support networks and in the context of disrupted routines. Family roles and relationships were sometimes tested, however, many parents identified coping strategies that protected their wellbeing including access to outdoor space, spending time away from family, and avoiding conflict and pandemic-related media coverage. Data from a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/17/9119">qualitative study of parents of young children (aged under 4)</a> found that the most commonly reported worries were about financial insecurity and employment, COVID-19 health concerns and educating and caring for children. Parents also reported concerns about the wider impacts on society, child development and wellbeing, mental health and not seeing friends and family.</p>

<p>Home and informal carers have been more likely to report higher and increasing levels of psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness and depressive symptoms than non-carers throughout the pandemic. They were also more likely to report a greater sense of life being worthwhile than non-carers during the first national lockdown (<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 55 to 57</a>).</p>

<p>Long term health conditions and disabilities</p>

<p>One <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2772163">study found that during the pandemic, adults with long term physical health conditions reported worse levels of depressive symptoms</a> than adults without long term physical health conditions. A <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20190793v1" class="govuk-link">study specifically looking at adults with asthma</a> found that they were more likely to report higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, particularly among young adults.</p>

<p>Another <a rel="external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33274697/" class="govuk-link">study has observed an increased risk of depression among adults with cancer of the breast, prostate and blood</a>, but not other cancers (lung or melanoma for example). The authors also found that feelings of isolation helped to explain this risk.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243246" rel="external" class="govuk-link">qualitative study has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among adults with long term health conditions</a>. The authors identified 4 overarching themes - high levels of fear and anxiety related to perceived consequences of catching COVID-19, the impact of shielding/isolation, the experience of healthcare during the pandemic and anxiety created by uncertainty about the future. Through all this, many participants stated that they had found trying to accept the situation to be the most protective coping mechanism for their mental health.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34212443/" rel="external">study looking at differences in self-reported impacts of the pandemic on mental and physical health between people with and without intellectual impairment</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup> found no mental health related differences. A <a rel="external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34330683/" class="govuk-link">similar study looking at disability</a> found that adults with a disability were more likely than adults without to report symptoms of psychological distress and loneliness in April/May 2020.</p>

<h3>Experience of COVID-19</h3>

<p>One <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326403/">study found that adults who have had COVID-19-related symptoms were more likely to report high levels of mental distress and loneliness</a> than adults who had not had symptoms. However, another <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/mental-health-impact-of-covid19-and-lockdownrelated-stressors-among-adults-in-the-uk/C1814A3228BCDBA5A9F697C231622628" rel="external" class="govuk-link">study found no evidence of this after controlling for other factors</a>. A more recent <a class="govuk-link" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237909" rel="external">study found that people who report a probable COVID-19 infection also reported higher levels of psychological distress</a> than people who do not report a probable COVID-19 infection. This is the case up to 3 months after the probable infection. This association was stronger among younger age groups and men, than older age groups and women.</p>

<h3>Seeking support for mental health during the pandemic</h3>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.11.21249509v1.full">one of the larger ongoing studies (26,740 adults in the UK)</a> almost half of the respondents (aged over 18) reported talking to friends or family members to support their mental health during the pandemic, with 43% engaging in self-care activities (such as mindfulness and meditation). 20% of adults reported taking medication to support their mental health, 9% talking to mental health professionals, 8% talking to a GP or other health professional, and another 8% using helplines or online services. Older adults accessed fewer forms of support than younger adults. Women, people with higher educational levels, those who lived alone, those with a higher level of loneliness, those experiencing depression and anxiety, and people with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis used more approaches to support their mental health.</p>

<p>Particular groups within the population were likely to choose different mental health support strategies. Older adults and adults with less education were more likely than younger adults and adults with more education to take medication to help with their mental health, and less likely to speak to a mental health professional or use a helpline or online forum. Adults with lower incomes were also more likely to take medication. Black, Asian and minority ethnicity respondents were less likely to take medication, but more likely to use a helpline or online forum. Women were more likely than men to engage in self-care activities, or to speak to friends and family about their mental health. Adults who lived alone were also more likely to speak to health professionals, engage in self-care activities and talk to others about their mental health than adults who live with others.</p>

<p>A study <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33436126/" rel="external">analysing the link between social interaction and depressive symptoms during COVID-19</a> found that more frequent face-to-face or phone/video contact, as well as higher perceived social support, were associated with lower depressive symptoms.  More face-to-face contact had an even stronger association with lower depressive symptoms in people who demonstrated a higher tendency towards empathy.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/9/4/393">study analysed internet use in people aged 55 to 75 in June and July 2020 while social distancing measures were in place</a>.  It found that frequent internet users had lower depression symptoms and higher quality of life scores. Impacts varied with purpose of internet use: those who reported using the internet for communication purposes had a higher quality of life. However, use for health-related or Government services information searching was associated with more symptoms of depression.  It is not clear whether the mental health of individuals influenced internet use or the other way round.</p>

<p>An <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.19.21259173v1">analysis of data covering April 2020 to May 2021</a> found that increases in the quality of social support decreased the likelihood of self-harm thoughts and behaviours, whereas greater loneliness increased the likelihood.</p>

<h3>Mental health and related behaviours</h3>

<p>Experiences of anxiety, depression, loneliness or mental distress may be linked with changes in lifestyle and adopting coping behaviours.  Some of these behaviours have been studied in recent analyses. Overall, these studies suggest some association between experiencing mental distress during the pandemic and changes in diet or eating behaviours, exercise, alcohol use and sleep.  Many people have also employed positive behaviours such as engaging in creative pursuits and hobbies and ‘thinking positively’. An individual’s mental health appears to have little association with vaccination hesitancy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.13.21262002v1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Analysis of text responses from 11,000 UK adults about coping mechanisms</a> between 14 October and 26 November 2020 identified a range of common topics. ‘Thinking positively’ was the most discussed coping strategy and involved themes of gratefulness and positivity. Other strategies included engaging in activities and hobbies (such as doing DIY, exercising, walking and spending time in nature), keeping routines, and focusing on one day at a time. Some participants reported more avoidant type coping strategies, such as drinking alcohol and binge eating. Coping strategies varied by respondent characteristics including age, personality traits and sociodemographic position. Some coping strategies, such as engaging in creative activities, were associated with more positive lockdown experiences.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://osf.io/kmgzw" class="govuk-link" rel="external">study analysing eating patterns during the pandemic</a> found that most adults reported not changing the amount they eat. However, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report a change (eating either more or less). Adults with higher education were less likely to report a change. Reported loneliness was associated with persistently eating more, whereas being single or divorced or the experience of stressful life events was associated with consistently eating less.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.21256377v1.full">study looking at young adults in their 20s between May and July 2020</a> found that pre-existing disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm were all associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, even when pre-pandemic symptoms of depression and anxiety were taken into account.  Lifestyle changes and other coping behaviours did not affect these associations.</p>

<p>A <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://psyarxiv.com/xby9r/">study analysing alcohol use and its relationship to income and mental health</a> between March and July 2020, found that use of alcohol to cope was predicted by experiences of anxiety and/or depression and low resilience levels, but not by loss of income or reduced working hours.</p>

<p>Another <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254424v2">study across 4 adult UK cohorts looked at alcohol, diet, sleep and exercise</a> in May and September 2020 compared to self-reported pre-pandemic behaviours (collected in May). For the sample overall, from pre-pandemic to May, there were positive improvements in exercise, diet and alcohol, but a deterioration in sleep. In September, levels had reverted to pre-pandemic for most health behaviours, except for sleep which had deteriorated further.  This study found that poor mental health was associated with adverse health behaviours; especially in relation to sleep, but also exercise, and fruit and vegetable consumption, whereas for alcohol consumption the difference was small.  Associations were stronger for current mental health problems than mental health problems before the pandemic.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248919">study looking at experiences of adversity and related worries</a> found that the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep.  Illness with COVID-19, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety and related worries were related to poor sleep but adversity experiences relating to employment and finances were not.  Having a larger social network provided some buffer to the association between adversities and worries and sleep quality.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.21256185v1.full" rel="external" class="govuk-link">study looking at vaccine uptake intentionality</a> in November and December 2020 found that having a pre-pandemic diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or a high score on the distress symptom scale, were not related to the willingness to take up a vaccine.</p>
