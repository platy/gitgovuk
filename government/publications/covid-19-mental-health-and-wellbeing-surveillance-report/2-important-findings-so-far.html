<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is Chapter 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report">COVID-19 mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a>. It is a high-level summary of the main findings from a selection of ongoing academic research projects.</p>

<p>It is regularly updated, and currently includes analysis released up to Week 7 2021 (15 February).</p>

<p>Where new findings are presented, this is signalled by the label “NEW” at the beginning of the first sentence of the new text.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>Any deterioration of mental health captured in studies and weekly reporting should not be automatically interpreted as an increase in mental illness or need for mental health services. This is a difficult and stressful time for many, and some short term increases in psychological distress and anxiety are to be expected.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>To enable this chapter to be as up to date as possible some pre-print (and therefore not yet peer reviewed) academic research is presented. Even with this approach there is still a time delay between data being gathered and findings reported.</p>

<p>The basis for the intelligence included is presented in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/methodology" class="govuk-link">Methodology document</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Available evidence indicates that self-reported mental health and wellbeing worsened during the first national lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms appeared to peak in April 2020. There is evidence of some recovery by July, perhaps back to pre-pandemic levels, which was sustained until September.</p>

<p>Recent analyses suggest that changes in overall population mental health since the beginning of the pandemic appear to be driven by a small proportion with more ‘volatile’ trajectories.  It is important to identify the more vulnerable and the more resilient groups and the factors associated with this.</p>

<p>Weekly data (unanalysed) from <a rel="external" href="https://www.covidsocialstudy.org/results" class="govuk-link">one of the larger studies</a> signals that self-reported mental health and wellbeing may have worsened again between October 2020 and January 2021. This will be monitored closely and confirmed through further analysis.</p>

<h2>Changes in population mental health and wellbeing</h2>

<h3>Study-specific findings</h3>

<p>Many studies have analysed data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (<abbr title="UK Household Longitudinal studies">UKHLS</abbr>). They suggest that, among adults:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>average mental distress (measured using GHQ-12) <a href="https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14874" rel="external" class="govuk-link">was 8.1% higher in April 2020 than it was between 2017 and 2019</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>after accounting for the increasing trend since 2014, average mental distress <a class="govuk-link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3624264" rel="external">was 0.5 points higher than expected in April 2020</a> (on the GHQ-12 scale)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proportion of adults who <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/mjg72/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">reported a clinically significant level of psychological distress</a> increased from 20.7% in 2019 to 29.5% in April 2020, before returning to 21.4% in July 2020 and 21.5% in September 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all demographic groups examined (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income) <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://psyarxiv.com/mjg72/">experienced</a> increases in distress after the onset of the pandemic followed by decreases, but the change was larger for younger adults (aged 18 to 30), women, those identifying as ’non-white’  and those with higher income (over £50,000)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proportion of <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157255v1" class="govuk-link">people experiencing sleep problems increased</a> from 16% before the pandemic to 25% in April 2020</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20133116v1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">study</a> in southwest England found evidence of an increase in anxiety and low wellbeing during the first national lockdown. However, it found no evidence of a change in depressive symptoms. On the other hand, a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronavirusanddepressioninadultsgreatbritain/latest">study</a> of people surveyed between July 2019 and March 2020, and then again in June 2020, suggests that the proportion of people reporting depressive symptoms increased and that those symptoms worsened over the period.</p>

<p>Three mental health related longitudinal studies, launched in March 2020, have reported on change over time since.</p>

<p>Two reported that levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms and stress were higher during the first national lockdown than the available pre-COVID-19 benchmarks.(<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">reference 7, 8</a>). The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v3">third</a> found that, overall, there were slight decreases in the average anxiety and depressive symptom scores reported between April and August 2020, but that different population groups followed different trajectories.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>New: A new analysis from <a href="https://osf.io/yw9xd/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">one of these studies</a> that compared 3 time points post lockdown (late March, April and July 2020) has reported that different groups have followed different trajectories over time, but suggests more overall stability than the other studies. The word ‘trajectory’ is used to refer to a path of mental health deterioration or improvement over time. Researchers found that close to 20% of respondents reported clinical levels of anxiety or depression at all 3 time points. The majority of this study’s respondents reported stable and low levels of anxiety and depression throughout the period (57%). For anxiety and depression, just over 6% of the respondents reported stable but high levels. About 9% reported an improvement between late March and July 2020, and just under 29% reported a deterioration. Among the deteriorating group, 17% had low levels of anxiety and depression at the first time point and experienced a significant increase over time, and 12% had moderate levels to begin with and experienced smaller increases. The study also looked at mental health symptoms related to traumatic stress and found 68% were stable and remained at low levels over the time period, 13% were stable with moderate to high levels, and 4% were stable with severe levels. Around 8% saw improvement and 7% significant worsening over the period.</p>

<h2>Variation within the population</h2>

<p>Population measures are useful for understanding overall levels of mental health and wellbeing. However, they can hide variation within the population. This section presents evidence that some groups are more likely to report worse mental health and wellbeing than others, and that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a larger adverse impact on some groups.</p>

<p>The following information relates specifically to adults. The COVID-19 mental health and wellbeing surveillance report includes a separate chapter on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report/7-children-and-young-people">children and young people</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>New:  A recent study looked at <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/media/economics/documents/hedg/workingpapers/2021/2101.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">inequality in psychological distress before and after the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. It found that before the  pandemic, psychological distress was more strongly associated with chronic health conditions, employment status and housing conditions than other factors such as age and gender.</p>
</div>

<p>In April 2020, ‘age and gender’ showed the strongest associations with psychological distress (being young and female were associated with higher levels of distress), although chronic health conditions, employment status and housing conditions remained important.</p>

<p>By July 2020, soon after the first national lockdown was eased, the association between psychological distress and ‘age and gender’ had decreased to levels comparable to before the pandemic. The original 3 factors returned to having the strongest associations with variation in psychological distress. However, neighbourhood characteristics (measured by availability of local health and leisure facilities) now had a stronger association with psychological distress than before the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Individual characteristics (age, gender and ethnicity)</h3>

<p>Young adults (aged between 18 and 34, depending on the study) and women were more likely to report worse mental health and wellbeing during the first national lockdown than older adults and men. This is similar to pre-pandemic patterns, but the differences may have increased.(<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 1,2,5–8,12–19</a>). There is evidence that women and young adults experienced a faster recovery between April and September. This has reduced some of the differences between groups observed in April.(<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 12,20</a>.</p>

<p>Older adults who were recommended to shield were more likely to <a rel="external" href="https://11a183d6-a312-4f71-829a-79ff4e6fc618.filesusr.com/ugd/540eba_55b4e2be5ec341e48c393bdeade6a729.pdf" class="govuk-link">report</a> higher levels of depression, anxiety and loneliness in June and July 2020 than people of a similar age but not recommended to shield. Rates were highest in those who were recommended to shield and strictly complied with that guidance. Each group was also more likely to report lower levels of happiness, life satisfaction and sense of purpose. Another <a href="https://11a183d6-a312-4f71-829a-79ff4e6fc618.filesusr.com/ugd/540eba_bb1d692cf19a4b79bf68b2c5dd9a3d1f.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">study</a> of the same cohort showed that older adults with multi-morbidities (many of whom were self-isolating) reported higher levels of depression and loneliness than older adults without multi-morbidities.</p>

<p>A <a rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248238" class="govuk-link">qualitative study</a> has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among older adults. Risks to wellbeing include mortality concerns, fears about the virus, grief for the loss of normality, restricted access to health services and restricted access to activities that protect wellbeing. Factors that are protective of wellbeing included the slower pace of life, maintaining a routine, socialising and use of past coping skills. Many participants drew on their resilience and life experience to self-manage fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic, using their time during lockdown to reflect or organise end-of-life affairs.</p>

<p>Two studies sought to understand differences in mental distress between men and women. They show evidence that family and caring responsibilities play a role, as do social factors. Women were more likely to have made larger adjustments to manage housework and childcare during the first lockdown than men. These adjustments were associated with increased distress.(<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 24,25</a>). <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/research/publications/526127">Women also reported</a> having more close friends and a larger subsequent increase in loneliness than men during the first national lockdown.</p>

<p>Adults living with children have been more likely to <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/research/publications/526249" class="govuk-link" rel="external">report worsening mental health</a> than adults living without children. <a href="https://osf.io/wzu4t" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Lone mothers</a> have been particularly vulnerable. One study has reported <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronavirusanddepressioninadultsgreatbritain/latest" class="govuk-link">an increase in the proportion of parents reporting depressive symptoms</a>. However, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">another study suggests</a> that while adults living with children have reported higher levels of anxiety than adults living without children, they have also reported lower levels of depressive symptoms.</p>

<p>One <a rel="external" href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp13503.pdf" class="govuk-link">study</a> found that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (<abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr>) men (when grouped together) reported a larger deterioration in mental health than White British men during the first national lockdown. The deterioration reported among <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> women was similar to that reported among White British women. It also found that among <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> adults there was no evidence of variation in mental health deterioration by gender. This suggests that the gender gap reported across a number of studies may be a phenomenon mostly seen within the White British population.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/working-papers/2020-14.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">second study analysing the same data set</a> supported these findings for both men and women. In addition, it reported that in April and June 2020, Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani and White British men had all reported declines in mental health since before the pandemic. Bangladeshi and Pakistani men had reported larger declines than White British men.</p>

<p>A third relevant <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR220880" rel="external" class="govuk-link">study has analysed data from mothers in Bradford</a>, an ethnically diverse area with high levels of deprivation. The study found that clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety were more common among White British mothers than mothers of other ethnicities. Clinically significant symptoms were also more common among mothers with more economic insecurity. Participants who provided free text in their survey responses supported these findings. They also highlighted high levels of anxiety about becoming ill or dying from COVID-19. The 2 <a rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.30.20239954" class="govuk-link">variables with the strongest association with clinically important increases in depression and anxiety</a> (an increase greater than 5 points since last surveyed before the pandemic) were loneliness and financial insecurity. Increased household financial insecurity was associated with greater increases in depression and anxiety among White British mothers than Pakistani heritage mothers. <a href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.30.20239954" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Decreased physical activity was associated with a larger increase in depression</a> among White British mothers than Pakistani heritage mothers, but the association between anxiety and physical activity was similar in both groups.</p>

<p>A fourth study, looking at <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v1" class="govuk-link">changes in anxiety and depression between April and August 2020</a>, has reported that <abbr title="Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> respondents (when grouped together) were more likely to report higher levels of depression and anxiety, but that this gap did not change over time.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the sample sizes for minority ethnicity respondents in most of these studies are relatively small. This makes the estimates less precise.  In addition, the interaction between ethnicity and potential confounding factors needs further consideration. Potential factors may include income, employment as a key worker, community networks and family/caring responsibilities. Observations so far can only suggest associations.</p>

<h3>Adults with pre-existing mental health conditions</h3>

<p>Adults with pre-existing mental health conditions have reported higher levels of anxiety, depression and loneliness than adults without pre-existing mental health conditions. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this gap has changed since the start of lockdown.(<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 16,20,31</a>). A comparatively small but in depth survey of people using primary and secondary care with severe mental illness (<abbr title="Severe mental illness">SMI</abbr>) has reported preliminary findings. The <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jocHbP2xsBM5LsfaewSIbOrel3pM09F9/view?usp=drive_open&amp;usp=embed_facebook">majority of respondents so far have reported</a> stable mental health during the pandemic. Around a quarter of people currently receiving support from mental health services said that they would need more support than they received before the pandemic restrictions, and a further quarter said that they might need additional support.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.12.01.20241067" class="govuk-link" rel="external">qualitative study</a> has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among adults with pre-existing mental health conditions. Feeling safe but isolated at home, disruption to mental health services, cancelled plans and changed routines, uncertainty and lack of control, and rolling media coverage were identified as potential risk factors. Five coping strategies and protective factors were also identified, these were; previous experience of adversity, feeling less accountable to others, engaging in hobbies and activities, staying connected with others and perceived social support.</p>

<p>Data from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20169847v1" rel="external">UK Biobank</a> suggests that people with a psychiatric disorder have been more likely to be diagnosed with, hospitalised by and die from COVID-19 than people without a psychiatric disorder.</p>

<p>An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.25.20219071v1" rel="external">NHS Foundation Trust in London reported</a> 1,109 excess deaths among people with pre-existing mental health disorders between March and June 2020. This is out of a total of 2,561 deaths on their mental health register during the period and based on a comparison between 2019 and 2020. COVID-19 was recorded as the underlying cause in 64% of this excess. The remainder of the excess was accounted for as either unnatural/as yet unexplained or from neurodegenerative conditions. The study does not compare excess deaths among adults with <abbr title="Severe mental illness">SMI</abbr> to that among adults with no <abbr title="Severe mental illness">SMI</abbr>, or account for the impact of comorbidities.</p>

<p>The trust covers an ethnically diverse and urban catchment, with high levels of deprivation. They <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152710v1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">report</a> a higher excess mortality ratio among their Black African, Black Caribbean and Other Ethnicity populations. High excess mortality among adults with <abbr title="Severe mental illness">SMI</abbr> has also been <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395620309845">reported</a> in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, including among adults aged 40 to 60.</p>

<p>Underlying health conditions (particularly respiratory and cardiovascular) are now known to increase risk of COVID-19 mortality. A recent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3731" rel="external">study</a> found that <abbr title="Severe mental illness">SMI</abbr> was associated with an increased risk of dying from COVID-19 (26% for women compared to women with no <abbr title="Severe mental illness">SMI</abbr>, and 29% among men). However, this risk was relatively modest compared to some other conditions, for instance, type II diabetes was associated with a 529% increased risk for women (compared to women without this diagnosis) and 374% increased risk for men.</p>

<p>With respect to service use, the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130419v1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS Trust in London report</a> that their Community Mental Health Teams saw relatively stable caseloads and total contact numbers between March and May 2020. However, they saw a substantial shift from face-to-face to virtual contacts. Their <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130419v1" class="govuk-link">Home Treatment Teams saw</a> the same shift to virtual contacts but reductions in caseloads and total contacts in that time period.</p>

<p>There is <a rel="external" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abuse-selfharm-and-suicidal-ideation-in-the-uk-during-the-covid19-pandemic/692FD08F3AEFF45036535F5E9CEBAA00" class="govuk-link">survey evidence</a> to suggest that fewer than half of adults affected by abuse, self-harm and thoughts of suicide/self-harm accessed formal or informal support during April 2020, although it is not clear whether this is more or less than before the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Employment and income</h3>

<p>A greater proportion of adults with low household income or relative socioeconomic position reported symptoms of anxiety and depression than adults with higher household income or socioeconomic position during the first national lockdown.(<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 7,31</a>) One <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.20101717v2" rel="external">study found that adverse experiences</a>, such as COVID-19 illness, financial difficulties or difficulty accessing food and medicine were having a larger impact on mental health and wellbeing among adults in a lower socioeconomic position. Two studies found that having a low income was associated with loneliness and increasing levels of loneliness during the lockdown.(<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 16,17</a>)</p>

<p>Adults who experienced loss of income early in the first lockdown <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://osf.io/43f2h/">reported higher levels of anxiety</a> and <a href="https://11a183d6-a312-4f71-829a-79ff4e6fc618.filesusr.com/ugd/540eba_bb1d692cf19a4b79bf68b2c5dd9a3d1f.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">mental distress</a>. Having some paid work or continued connection to a job during the pandemic was <a href="http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/57487/1/V6%20Draft%20COVID%20paper%20GHQ-12%20and%20employment%2020200629.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">associated with better mental health</a> than not having any work. At the same time, adults working in ‘small employers and own account’ occupations have <a rel="external" href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp13503.pdf" class="govuk-link">reported larger increases in psychological distress</a> than previously unemployed adults and adults working in ‘managerial and professional’ occupations since the onset of the pandemic.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>New: Another study reported that financial worries related to the COVID-19 pandemic can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.25.20238766">lead to increased mental distress</a>. Reduced work has an association with increased mental distress for both self-employed and employed adults, but this association is greater among the self-employed group, which appears to be driven (or mediated) by greater likelihood of loss of income. This is consistent with a separate study’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osf.io/w4gjr/" rel="external">finding that lost income and economic worries</a> were associated with anxiety about the pandemic. Economic worries were also associated with fatigue and feelings of failure, but less consistently with depression.</p>
</div>

<p>These findings are complemented by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14616696.2020.1826557" class="govuk-link" rel="external">research suggesting that disruptions in employment</a> have had a smaller impact on psychological distress where income has been protected through the government’s income support programmes or sick pay. The study goes on to say that the immigrant population have been less likely to have their income protected, and are more likely to experience higher levels of psychological distress following disruptions in employment, whether or not their income is protected.</p>

<p>Women in lower socioeconomic positions have been more likely than women in higher socioeconomic positions and men in general to be furloughed, working as a key worker or working in a person facing role. Women in lower socioeconomic positions have been slightly more likely to report higher levels of psychological distress than women in higher socioeconomic positions although <a href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248238" class="govuk-link" rel="external">this study did not observe a clear socioeconomic gradient</a>.</p>

<p>A qualitative study has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among creative freelance workers (such as musicians and actors). Findings suggest the pandemic is <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20190793v1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">affecting psychological wellbeing</a> through employment loss, financial instability and work dissonance (such as problems transitioning to online work).</p>

<h3>Carers and key workers</h3>

<p>One <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33274697/" rel="external">study</a> found evidence that key workers experienced worse mental health and wellbeing in April 2020 than non-key workers. A <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.25.20219071v1">second study</a> found evidence that key workers experienced better mental health, and 2 further studies found no evidence of a difference between the 2 groups.(<a href="#references" class="govuk-link">references 2,5</a>)</p>

<p>Home-carers (defined as people who look after or give special care to someone who is sick, disabled or elderly within the same household) have been <a rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243246" class="govuk-link">more likely to report depressive symptoms</a> than non-caregivers, both before and early in the first national lockdown. This increases when the caregiver also feels lonely.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>New: This has since been corroborated with <a href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237909" class="govuk-link" rel="external">more recent data</a>, suggesting that the gap between carers and non-carers increased further between April and July 2020.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>New: <a href="https://osf.io/kmgzw" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Another study</a> has reported that informal carers (defined as people who had caring responsibilities for elderly relatives or friends, people with long-term conditions or disabilities, or grandchildren, not necessarily within the same home) experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety than non-carers between April and September 2020. However, during the first national lockdown these carers also experienced a higher sense of life being worthwhile.</p>
</div>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.25.20238766">qualitative study</a> has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among frontline health and social care professionals. The participants were interviewed between May and September 2020, and expressed difficulties such as communication challenges (virtual consulting and difficult conversations) and changing work conditions (longer working hours, fatigue and exhaustion), but also positive factors such as increased team unity at work and a greater reflection on what matters in life.</p>

<p>A <a rel="external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33434920/" class="govuk-link">study of staff working in intensive care units</a> during the pandemic highlighted a high prevalence of probable Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. However, the same study also found that more than half of the respondents reported good wellbeing.</p>

<h3>Long term physical health conditions</h3>

<p>One study found that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.25.20219071v1" rel="external">adults with long term physical health conditions</a> reported worse levels of depressive symptoms than adults without long term physical health conditions. A study specifically looking at <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7996219">adults with asthma</a> found that they were more likely to report higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, particularly among young adults.</p>

<p>A recent study has observed an increased risk of depression among <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33274697/">adults with cancer</a> of the breast, prostate and blood, but not other cancers (lung, melanoma for example). After controlling for prior depression and other factors, it was loneliness during COVID-19, and not previous loneliness, that was predictive.</p>

<p>A qualitative study has described aspects of the pandemic that may be impacting on mental health among <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.12.03.20243246">adults with long term health conditions</a>. The authors identified 4 overarching themes. These were high levels of fear and anxiety related to perceived consequences of catching COVID-19, the impact of shielding/isolation, the experience of healthcare during the pandemic and anxiety created by uncertainty about the future. Acceptance, support and understanding of the needs of adults with long term conditions helped people to cope better during isolation.</p>

<h3>Experience of COVID-19</h3>

<p>One study found that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.20116657v1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">adults who have had COVID-19-related symptoms</a> were more likely to report high levels of mental distress and loneliness than adults who had not had symptoms. But, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/working-papers/2020-14.pdf" rel="external">another study</a> found no evidence of this after controlling for other factors. A more recent study has found that people who report a probable COVID-19 infection also reported higher levels of psychological distress than people who did not report a probable COVID-19 infection. This was investigated up to 3 months after the probable infection. This <a href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237909" rel="external" class="govuk-link">association was stronger</a> among younger age groups and men, than older age groups and women.</p>

<h3>Change over time between different groups</h3>

<p>Four studies have reported on change over time since the end of the first national lockdown – three cover March or April through to July,(<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 9,11,12</a>) the <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146738v1" class="govuk-link">fourth</a> April to September. Three find that young adults and women, after initial deteriorations, have reported greater subsequent improvements in mental health and wellbeing than older adults and men.(<a class="govuk-link" href="#references">references 11,12,20</a>) One also found that people with lower levels of education and people living with children reported greater subsequent improvement in depressive symptoms and anxiety – reducing but not eliminating some of the differences reported during the first lockdown. It <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146738v1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">found no evidence</a> that the rates of initial deterioration or subsequent improvement have been related to ethnicity, household income or pre-existing mental health conditions.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>New: The <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923v1" class="govuk-link">fourth study</a> took a different approach and examined different mental health trajectories experienced by individuals between March and July 2020. This study found that the majority of its respondents reported low and stable levels of psychological distress throughout the time period. A small group reported stable but high levels of psychological distress. Males, adults with a low income, a chronic health condition or who reported low control over the outcome of events in their life were more likely to be in this group.  Other small groups reported either improving or deteriorating mental health over the period. Factors such as history of mental health treatment, loneliness, aversion to uncertainty, death anxiety and feeling that the outcome of life events is beyond personal control were associated with each of these non-stable trajectories (either improving or deteriorating). Factors that have been identified elsewhere as important (such as age and gender) were less clearly associated with the different trajectories identified in this study.  Whilst this study sample is representative of the population in terms of age, gender and income, the smaller sample size as well as the different approach may account for the less consistent findings in relation to age and gender compared to other studies.</p>
</div>

<h3>Use of mental health support</h3>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>New: 45% of <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/01/13/2021.01.11.21249509.full.pdf" class="govuk-link">adults reported</a> talking to friends or family members to support their mental health, with 43% engaging in self-care activities (such as mindfulness and meditation). 20% of adults reported taking medication, 9% talking to mental health professionals, 8% talking to a GP or other health professional, and another 8% using helplines or online services. Older adults accessed fewer forms of support than younger adults. On the other hand, women, people with higher educational levels, those who lived alone, those with a higher level of loneliness, those experiencing depression and anxiety, and people with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis used more approaches to support their mental health.</p>
</div>

<p>Different groups within the population were more likely to choose <a rel="external" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/01/13/2021.01.11.21249509.full.pdf" class="govuk-link">different mental health support strategies</a>. Older adults and adults with less education were more likely than younger adults and than adults with more education to take medication, and less likely to speak to a mental health professional or use a helpline or online forum. Adults with lower incomes were also more likely to take medication. Black, Asian and minority ethnicity respondents were less likely to take medication, but more likely to use a helpline or online forum. Women were more likely than men to engage in self-care activities, or to speak to friends and family about their mental health. Adults who live alone were also more likely to speak to health professionals, engage in self-care activities and talk to others about their mental health than adults who live with others.</p>

<h3>Other findings</h3>

<p>There is mixed or limited evidence for some other associations with mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic, which make drawing conclusions on these characteristics difficult. A summary is presented below.</p>

<p>One study found <a href="https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/covid-19-survey/findings/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">adults living in urban areas</a> reported worse and increasing loneliness. Another study found no evidence of a difference in depression and anxiety <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://osf.io/43f2h/">between urban and rural areas</a>.</p>

<p>A study analysing eating patterns during the pandemic found that most adults reported not changing the amount they eat. However, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report a change (eating either more or less). <a rel="external" href="https://psyarxiv.com/kmgzw/" class="govuk-link">Adults with higher education were less likely to report a change</a>. Loneliness was associated with persistently eating more, whereas being single or divorced or the experience of stressful life events was associated with consistently eating less.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>New: A study analysing <a href="https://osf.io/kmgzw" rel="external" class="govuk-link">the link between social interaction and depressive symptoms</a> has found that more frequent face-to-face or phone/video contact, as well as higher perceived social support, were associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms.  More face-to-face contact during the COVID-19 pandemic had an even stronger association with lower depressive symptoms in people who demonstrated higher tendency towards empathising with others and taking into account other people’s feelings and perspectives, and those who usually had more frequent social contacts.</p>
