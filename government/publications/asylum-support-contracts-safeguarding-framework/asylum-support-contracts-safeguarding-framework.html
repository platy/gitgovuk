<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Home Office has a statutory duty to accommodate asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute and provide for their essential living needs whilst their claim for asylum is being considered. The safety and wellbeing of those we are accommodating is of paramount importance. Not every supported asylum seeker is vulnerable, however the experience of adjusting to life in the UK and settling into their new accommodation and support arrangements is often a period of time when vulnerabilities become most apparent. It is essential that sufficient safeguarding controls are in place to ensure that all adults, children, staff and stakeholder agencies are sufficiently protected throughout our processes.</p>

<p>The Home Office meets most of its statutory duties through the Asylum Accommodation and Support Services (AASC) and the Advice, Issue Reporting and Eligibility (AIRE) which set the framework to how housing and support services for asylum seekers are provided. This framework aims to give an outline of how the Home Office, as the statutory body, will expect ourselves and our commissioned providers to ensure that procedures and processes are in place to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those we are accommodating.</p>

<p>This framework sets out a joint, overarching approach, as well as the key controls and reporting mechanisms in place, across the contracts, for safeguarding arrangements. It should be noted that the framework in no way aims to supersede or replace the statutory arrangements for the care and welfare of vulnerable adults and children that apply across the UK and which are usually the responsibility of local authorities. Asylum seekers and their children are subject to these safeguarding processes and procedures in the same way as others in the community.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the framework in no way supersedes any current legislation in regard to both Adult and Child safeguarding processes, procedures or responsibilities. It should be read in conjunction with the formal requirements within the Asylum Support Contracts.</p>

<h2>Safeguarding values</h2>

<p>We aim to conduct all of our work in an ethical and respectful manner that is underpinned by four overarching safeguarding values:</p>

<p><strong>Prevent:</strong> We aim to prevent harm through professional and responsible conduct and by taking swift and robust action.</p>

<p><strong>Protect:</strong> We take a zero-tolerance approach to harm, abuse or exploitation of any kind. All of our decisions and actions prioritise the safety and well-being of those connected with our work.</p>

<p><strong>Personify:</strong> We assume individual as well as organisational responsibility for safeguarding and ensure that all staff have training and guidance to be able to fulfil their obligations.</p>

<p><strong>Partner:</strong> We maintain best practice through open, transparent dialogue with others, including the communities where people are placed. By listening to others and sharing best practice we ensure conduct is appropriate to context and the unique needs of those we are working with.</p>

<h2>The standards</h2>

<p>This safeguarding framework consists of four standards, which articulate how each provider and Home Office undertakes its work, across the Asylum Support Contracts. These standards are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Policy/Strategy</li>
  <li>Procedures</li>
  <li>Education &amp; Training</li>
  <li>Implementation &amp; Monitoring</li>
</ol>

<h2>Policy and strategy</h2>

<p>The AASC and AIRE contracts specify that each provider should proactively identify and implement frameworks and processes relating to safeguarding and the protection of vulnerable Service Users, on an ongoing basis, across all aspects of their service delivery. They should ensure that they are aligned with the Home Office policies and guidance relating to Safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults.</p>

<p>A clear safeguarding policy or strategy document provides a vehicle for our providers to demonstrate to all what is required in relation to the protection and safeguarding of children and adults in their care. It creates a foundation for safeguarding work and demonstrates that each organisation is taking its duty of care seriously. In demonstrating that a provider has met this standard, they should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a policy/strategy document</li>
  <li>be clearly written and understandable</li>
  <li>be shared, publicised and promoted</li>
  <li>have the policy/strategy endorsed by the Authority (Home Office)</li>
  <li>have an identifiable board Strategic Review Management Board (SRMB) member with specific responsibility for safeguarding</li>
  <li>ensure the policy/strategy document is mandatory reading for all staff</li>
  <li>have the policy/strategy reviewed annually, or whenever there is a major change in policy or legislation</li>
</ul>

<p>The Home Office is committed to ensuring that any and all relevant data sharing held about the vulnerabilities or needs of a supported asylum seeker is shared in a timely manner to enable AASC providers to work with the relevant Local Authority to put appropriate care and support in place if required.</p>

<p>Where it appears that a supported asylum seeker requires referral to other key statutory agencies, for example to local authorities for assessment of a care need over and above the need for accommodation and subsistence support, the Home Office will ensure that they lead the dialogue and support the accommodation provider in resolving any  issues with statutory agencies on the handling of the referral or the actions flowing from it.</p>

<h2>Standard Operating Procedures</h2>

<p>In addition to a clear safeguarding policy/strategy, providers will also have Standard Operating Procedures which will provide clear, step-by step guidance on what staff members should do in different circumstances. They should make clear roles and responsibilities, as well as lines and methods of communication. Systems for recording information and for dealing with safeguarding matters should also be in place. In demonstrating that a provider has met this standard, they should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have clear and unambiguous procedures in place in respect adult and child protection, with step by step guidance on what action should be taken where concerns about safety and welfare are identified</li>
  <li>have SOPs that are consistent with relevant legislation, local authority practice, the AASC and AIRE contract and the providers safeguarding policy/strategy document</li>
  <li>have a designated person, with a clearly defined role within the organisation, who has overarching responsibility for safeguarding within the AASC and AIRE contracts</li>
  <li>have a clear process for recording incidents, concerns and referrals and for storing this information securely and in accordance with the contracts and GDPR</li>
  <li>adhere to the contract on matters of confidentiality and information sharing</li>
  <li>adhere to the contract on recruitment and assuring the suitability of recruits to work with supported asylum seekers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Education and training</h2>

<p>The AASC and AIRE contracts specify that the training programme for all staff involved in the delivery of the contracts must cover as a minimum the asylum and support systems, equality and diversity, data protection and safeguarding. In addition, training for those with regular face to face contact with Service Users must also cover diversity, cultural awareness, suicide and self-harm awareness and prevention, basic first aid, gender based violence, fire safety, health and safety, vicarious trauma, unconscious bias, counter terrorism, modern slavery and training to required housing standards.</p>

<p>Everyone working on the AASC and AIRE contracts has a role to play in ensuring the protection and welfare of supported asylum seekers. They can only do this if they have the necessary skills, knowledge and understanding to safeguarding supported asylum seekers effectively.</p>

<p>In demonstrating that a provider has met this standard they should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide opportunities to all staff to learn about safeguarding children and adults</li>
  <li>make training available to all staff in relation to safeguarding</li>
  <li>evidence that staff who have contact with our Service Users have additional training to enable them to develop the necessary skills and knowledge and have the opportunity to update that knowledge</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementing and monitoring</h2>

<p>The above standards and contractual requirements have to be implemented across our providers and a governance structure needs to ensure that this is happening consistently. The views of those inside and out of our organisation can help to improve their effectiveness.</p>

<p>To ensure that the framework and requirements are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>safeguarding will be a standing agenda item at both Contract Management Groups (CMG) and Strategic Review Management Boards (SRMB)</li>
  <li>the Provider Safeguarding Board for Asylum Support will oversee progress on all aspects of safeguarding quarterly</li>
  <li>an Asylum Support Contracts (ASC) Safeguarding Board will be held with Local Authorities and other key partners to discuss safeguarding across the contracts and help develop best practice</li>
  <li>local ASC safeguarding groups will be held in each contract region, bringing together Police, Health, Local Authorities and other partners to ensure safeguarding obligations are met within localities.</li>
  <li>all artefacts are reviewed regularly and via an appropriate method</li>
</ul>

<p>*staff also includes any subcontractors in the supply chain</p>

<h2>Annex 1</h2>

<p>The Asylum Senior Safeguarding Board comprises the ASC Safeguarding Board, the National LA Safeguarding Board for Asylum Support and the Health Steering Group. The Health Steering Group comprises the Mental Health Forum, the GP Registration sub group and the Maternal Health sub group.</p>
