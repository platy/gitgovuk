<p>Stephen Brien <br>
Chair <br>
Social Security Advisory Committee <br>
Caxton House <br>
Tothill Street <br>
London <br> 
SW1A 9NH</p>

<p>3 March 2021</p>

<p>Amended regulations for consideration:</p>

<p>The Social Security (Claims and Payments, Employment and Support Allowance, Personal Independence Payment, and Universal Credit) (Amendment) Regulations 2021.</p>

<p>Dear Stephen,</p>

<p>Thank you for your letter of 1 March following the Social Security Advisory Committee (<abbr title="Social Security Advisory Committee">SSAC</abbr>) meeting that took place on the 27 January.</p>

<p>As you are aware, the Department is laying regulations to reflect a multi-channel approach to health assessments, making it clear that telephony and video can be used as delivery channels in addition to paper-based and face-to-face assessments across Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>), Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (<abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>), Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>) and Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face assessments were predominantly used as a way to determine a claimant’s eligibility to benefit however since the start of the pandemic, we took the decision to safeguard our claimants and staff by suspending face-to-face assessments. These changes to the regulations make clear that a 
range of different channels can be used to assess claimants based upon their individual circumstances and allow claims to be progressed when there are restrictions on face-to-face contact.</p>

<p>I understand that, at its meeting on 27 January the Committee raised some concern over the current evidence base. I would like to provide you with assurance that officials will share our evaluation plans with the committee and then return to discuss the findings when available. We will also consult the Committee on the draft Departmental guidance once the policy and delivery of a multi-channel assessment strategy has been agreed.</p>

<p>My officials are happy to provide further information as needed.</p>

<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>Justin Tomlinson MP <br>
Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work</p>
