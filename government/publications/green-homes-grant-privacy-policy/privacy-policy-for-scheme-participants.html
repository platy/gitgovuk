<h3>If you fail to provide personal data</h3>

<p>Where we need to collect personal data for the purposes of the scheme (to determine your eligibility/register you to participate in the scheme), or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, you may not be able to participate in the scheme. We will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>

<p>This does not apply to the collection of the customer insight analysis data listed in the customer insight analysis section of the table in Section 3 above, which consists of special categories of personal data and protected characteristics collected and processed for equality monitoring and evaluation purposes. The provision of this data is entirely voluntary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Who will have access to your personal data</h2>

<p>The following parties may have access to your personal data for purposes of this scheme:</p>

<h3>Third-parties</h3>

<p>We will share your personal data with our service providers who will assist us in the administration of the scheme and with other third parties as set out below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the installer(s) (if you are an applicant)</li>
  <li>any oversight body for the scheme</li>
  <li>TrustMark</li>
  <li>Ofgem</li>
  <li>Arvato Bureau Service (customer contact and call handling centre)</li>
  <li>any relevant eligibility checking organisations appointed for this purpose, including the Department of Work and Pensions who will verify the financial status information that you provide to us (applicants only)</li>
  <li>any external evaluator appointed for the purpose of evaluating the scheme</li>
  <li>our professional service providers and advisors, including our lawyers and accountants</li>
  <li>our debt recovery partner, Indesser, Debt Collection Agencies (DCAs) and Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs)</li>
</ul>

<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. In the above circumstances, the personal data will be subject to confidentiality arrangements with these third-parties.</p>

<h3>Internal</h3>

<p>BEIS and the processors appointed by BEIS will have access to your personal data in order to administer the scheme and provide funding for the scheme. Access to your personal data will be limited to those personnel that need it in order to fulfil their role for the purposes set out in this privacy policy.</p>

<p>We will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sell or rent your personal data to third-parties</li>
  <li>share your personal data with third-parties for marketing purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>We will share your personal data if required to do so by law - for example, by court order, with competent legal authorities, or to prevent fraud or other crimes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Sources of your personal data</h2>

<h3>From you directly (either directly or via the former scheme administrator)</h3>

<p>When:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you apply for a grant</li>
  <li>you apply to register as an installer</li>
  <li>you correspond with the scheme administrator</li>
</ul>

<h3>Generated by us</h3>

<p>We create a unique reference number (‘URN’) when you apply for a grant.</p>

<h3>Generated automatically</h3>

<p>Automated technologies or interactions: As you interact with our website, we will automatically collect data about you and your device, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies. Please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help/cookies">Cookie Notice</a> for further details.</p>

<h3>From third-parties</h3>

<h4>Installer</h4>

<p>The Installer may provide us with personal data relating to applicants.</p>

<h4>Eligibility checking organisations</h4>

<p>These organisations may provide us with applicants’ personal data as part of our process for determining your eligibility.</p>

<h4>Indesser, Debt Collection Agencies (DCAs) and Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs)</h4>

<h4>Google analytics</h4>

<p>We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (‘Google’). Google Analytics works using cookies. Google Analytics cookies collect your IP address; however, because IP anonymization is used on this website, your IP address will be shortened (and therefore anonymized) as soon as technically possible and before it is stored or otherwise used in connection with Google Analytics. We use the information collected by Google Analytics cookies to find out about how visitors use our website. Google will not combine the IP address sent by your browser in connection with Google Analytics with other data. You can prevent Google Analytics cookies from being stored by setting your browser software accordingly. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at google.com.</p>

<h4>From correspondence to government departments and / or Members of Parliament and ministers</h4>

<p>BEIS will share personal data from ministerial correspondence with the scheme administrator (for example, where you may have contacted your local MP about the administration of the scheme and this has been referred on to BEIS) where sharing will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>further the interest of the party who has made contact and the parties they represent</li>
  <li>expedite the process of resolving complaints</li>
  <li>improve the customer service provided through the scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>BEIS will only share the personal data necessary for these purposes. Other information that will help identify general issues and improve the customer service for the scheme, from complaints received through these channels, will be shared in an anonymised manner to improve the service.</p>

<p>Where you use people’s data in ways they would reasonably expect and which have a minimal privacy impact, or where there is a compelling justification for the processing (legitimate interests assessment) (LIA).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> How long we will keep your personal data</h2>

<p>BEIS will only retain your personal data for as long as it is needed to fulfil the purposes set out in this privacy policy.</p>

<p>We may retain your personal data for a longer period where it is required by law, or in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe it is necessary for us to defend or pursue legal claims related to the scheme.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>

<p>All personal data will be kept for the duration of the scheme by BEIS, and for 6 months after the scheme closure.</p>

<p>Data will be kept by BEIS for the duration of the scheme, plus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 year for customer insight analysis data (including special category personal data/protected characteristics), for the purposes of monitoring and evaluation</li>
  <li>key data on measures installed will be kept by BEIS for up to 10 to 20 years in line with other BEIS schemes; this is so that BEIS can handle potential future complaints and any ombudsman enquiries as well as to measure the ongoing energy savings from the measures (the overarching aim of the policy)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Children’s privacy protection</h2>

<p>The scheme is not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children who are under 13 years of age. We may collect the names and dates of birth of children who are receiving benefits in order to assess eligibility for the ‘low income’ element of the scheme only. Otherwise, we do not intentionally collect or maintain personal data about anyone under the age of 13.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Where your personal data is processed and stored</h2>

<p>BEIS, as scheme administrator, and supporting service providers will process your personal data to the extent possible in the UK or the EEA. Your personal data will be retained on servers located in the UK.</p>

<p>As your personal data is stored on our IT infrastructure and shared with our data processors Microsoft and Amazon Web Services it may be transferred and stored securely outside the UK and EEA. Where that is the case it will be subject to equivalent legal protection through the use of model contract clauses.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> How we protect your personal data and keep it secure</h2>

<p>We are committed to doing what is necessary to keep your personal data secure. BEIS has set up systems and processes to prevent the unauthorised access to, loss of, or disclosure of your personal data.</p>

<p>BEIS enters into contractual agreements with any third-parties processing personal data on our behalf which require them to keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.</p>

<p>Please note that when transmitting information over the internet, no transmission is completely secure. We therefore cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transfer over the internet to us.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Automated decision-making</h2>

<p>For applicants, eligibility to the scheme will involve automated rules-based decision making (rather than algorithmic decision making). Determination of eligibility will be made based on the information submitted by the applicant against the Scheme rules. For example, if an applicant is not a homeowner, then they are not eligible. Applicants will be informed of any issues with their application and be able to provide further information and to discuss this with us.</p>

<p>There will be an appeals process for applicants.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Your rights</h2>

<p>You have the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>request access to personal data about you</strong> (commonly known as a ‘data subject access request’) - this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you</li>
  <li>
<strong>request rectification, correction, or updating to any of the personal data that we hold about you</strong> - this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected</li>
  <li>
<strong>request erasure of personal data</strong> - this enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain circumstances, such as where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it; you also have the right to ask us to delete or remove personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below)</li>
  <li>
<strong>request the restriction of processing of your personal data</strong> - this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you in certain circumstances (for example, if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it)</li>
  <li>
<strong>request the transfer of personal data provided by you either to you or a third party</strong> (‘data portability’)</li>
  <li>
<strong>withdraw your consent at any time</strong> (see Section 12 below)</li>
  <li>
<strong>object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>Where we are processing your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests or where it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, you can ask us to stop processing it and we must do so unless we believe we have an overriding legitimate reason to continue processing your personal data or we need to process your personal data to deal with a legal claim.</p>

<p>The exercise of these rights is not absolute and may be subject to certain pre-conditions and exemptions under data protection laws.</p>

<p>To exercise any of these rights please use the contact details provided in Section 12 below.</p>
