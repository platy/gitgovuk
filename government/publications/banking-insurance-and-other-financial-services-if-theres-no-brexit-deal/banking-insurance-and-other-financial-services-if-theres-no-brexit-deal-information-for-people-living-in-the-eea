<p>This guidance is for people or businesses that have a financial services product, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a bank account, debit or credit card or loan, such as a mortgage</li>
  <li>insurance</li>
  <li>a product that provides an income in your retirement, such as a personal pension or annuity</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect the majority of people will see limited, or no, difference after the UK leaves the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>), and will be able to use and rely on their bank accounts, insurance, personal pensions or annuities, and other services whether they are provided by a firm based in the UK, Europe or elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>For UK citizens living in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Norway, Liechtenstein or Iceland, many UK financial services firms are taking steps to ensure they will continue to be able to serve their customers after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Some <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries have also announced that they are also taking steps to ensure that UK financial services firms will be able to serve their existing customers after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>But, if you fit into any of the categories below, you may be affected by the UK leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal on 12 April 2019. Your financial services provider will be able to tell you how the UK’s exit from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will affect you.</p>

<h2 id="regardless-of-where-you-live-if-you">
<span class="number">1. </span>Regardless of where you live, if you…</h2>

<h4 id="want-to-send-or-pay-in-euros-electronically">Want to send or pay in Euros electronically</h4>

<p>You will still be able to do so, although the cost and time for Euro payments and transfers may increase depending on arrangements made by individual providers. This is also true if you want to receive or be paid in Euros electronically.</p>

<h4 id="have-a-credit-or-debit-card-issued-by-a-uk-issuer-and-want-to-use-it-to-pay-merchants-in-the-eu-norway-liechtenstein-or-iceland">Have a credit or debit card issued by a UK issuer and want to use it to pay merchants in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Norway, Liechtenstein or Iceland</h4>

<p>This will still be possible, although it may become more expensive and a surcharge may apply. This is also true if you have a credit or debit card issued by an issuer based in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Norway, Liechtenstein or Iceland and want to use it in the UK. Merchants in the UK will continue to be banned from applying surcharges to payments made by a consumer credit or debit card issued by an issuer based in the UK.</p>

<h4 id="have-a-uk-bank-account-and-want-to-use-your-card-to-pay-merchants-in-the-eea">Have a UK bank account and want to use your card to pay merchants in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>
</h4>

<p>This is unlikely to change as a result of leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>; however, it may become more expensive. This is also true if you have a bank account with a provider based in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Norway, Liechtenstein or Iceland and want to use your bank card in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-live-in-the-eu-norway-liechtenstein-or-iceland-and-you">

<h4 id="have-insurance-or-a-personal-pensionhttpswwwgovukpersonal-pensions-your-rights-or-annuity-with-a-uk-based-firm">Have insurance or a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/personal-pensions-your-rights">personal pension</a> or annuity with a UK-based firm</h4>

<p>Your firm should have made plans to make sure you can still get your insurance or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/personal-pensions-your-rights">personal pension</a> or annuity, even if the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal. Your firm should contact you if it needs to make any changes to your product or the way it provides it. However, if you have any concerns about whether you might be affected, you should contact your firm.</p>

<h4 id="have-any-other-financial-services-product-from-a-uk-based-firm-for-example-a-current-account-credit-card-or-mortgage">Have any other financial services product from a UK-based firm, for example a current account, credit card or mortgage</h4>

<p>Many firms that offer these products are planning to continue providing them after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. However, if your firm needs to make any changes to your product or the way it provides it, your firm should contact you.</p>

<h4 id="bank-with-a-local-eea-branch-of-a-uk-based-firm">Bank with a local <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> branch of a UK-based firm</h4>

<p>Your <a rel="external" href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/about-fscs/media-centre/brexit/">Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) deposit protection</a> will cease, but your deposits may instead be protected by an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> deposit protection scheme. If you have any concerns about your protections, you should contact your firm for clarification.</p>

<h2 id="financial-advice">
<span class="number">3. </span>Financial advice</h2>

<p>Before making any significant financial decisions, you may want to seek impartial information or advice. You can get free and impartial information from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/">Pensions Advisory Service</a> or the <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en">Money Advice Service</a>. You’ll usually have to pay for their services.</p>

<h2 id="staying-safe-from-scams">
<span class="number">4. </span>Staying safe from scams</h2>

<p>During this period of change there may be a greater risk of scams. You can find out more about financial fraud and scams, and how to protect yourself, with the Home Office and UK Finance’s <a rel="external" href="https://takefive-stopfraud.org.uk/">Take Five campaign</a>.</p>
