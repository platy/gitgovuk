<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>New Tree Production Capital Grant opens today for applications</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Funding support to increase the quantity, quality, diversity and biosecurity of tree seed and sapling supply.</h3>

<p>A new £8.8 million fund to support domestic tree production in England has been opened by the Forestry Commission today (Thursday 19 May), in partnership with Defra.</p>

<p>The funding will help tree nurseries and suppliers invest in projects which improve, expand, automate or mechanise their operations. This will support efforts to build nursery capacity and grow long-term tree seed and sapling supply – delivering on a commitment within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/987432/england-trees-action-plan.pdf" rel="external">England Trees Action Plan</a>, the Government’s long-term plan for the nation’s trees, woodlands and forests.</p>

<p>Successful projects will be awarded up to £175,000 in grant funding to cover up to 50% of costs, with money coming from the Tree Production Capital Grant as part of the Government’s £750 million Nature for Climate Fund. Example projects suitable for funding could include investments in machinery such as transplanting systems and grading machines, improved polytunnel infrastructure and irrigation systems, or in biosecurity through improved water treatment and refrigeration equipment. The grant is open to tree seed and sapling suppliers of all sizes, as well as new entrants looking to diversify into the sector.</p>

<p>For more information on eligibility and how to apply see our GOV.UK page: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-production-capital-grant">Tree Production Capital Grant</a>, you can also contact us at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:tpcg@forestrycommission.gov.uk">tpcg@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a> or read our latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forestrycommission.blog.gov.uk/2022/05/19/introducing-the-new-tree-production-capital-grant/" rel="external">blog</a>.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>State-of-the-art tree health laboratory opens to help protect UK forests</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>The £5.8 million Holt Laboratory will study known and emerging threats from tree pests and diseases to ensure a robust and rapid response to outbreaks.</h3>

<p>A state-of-the-art laboratory conducting innovative research into tree pests and diseases has been officially opened on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/state-of-the-art-tree-health-laboratory-opens-to-help-protect-uk-forests">Friday 13 May</a> by Defra and the Forestry Commission, as part of National Plant Health Week.</p>

<p>The Forest Research Holt Laboratory, located within the Alice Holt Forest in Surrey, will bring together leading scientists to undertake research on pests and pathogens which could be detrimental or seriously damaging to our forests. This will inform UK-wide efforts to combat ongoing pest and disease outbreaks.</p>

<p>New statistics released by Forest Research today show a record number of tree pests and diseases are being reported. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/fthr/tree-alert/" rel="external">TreeAlert</a> service received 3790 reports from the public over the past year (April 2021 – March 2022) – a nearly 25% increase on the previous year. The most commonly reported pest and disease were Oak processionary moth and Ash dieback, respectively.</p>

<p>Minister for Biosecurity, Lord Benyon said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This is a significant moment and important expansion of the UK’s capacity to overcome tree pests and diseases – and protect our forests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Public vigilance is a key part of the fight against tree disease. You can look out for any unusual symptoms – like leaf discolouration or ‘bleeding’ lesions – on trees and report any sightings via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/fthr/tree-alert/" rel="external">TreeAlert, the Forestry Commission’s online tree pest and disease reporting tool</a>. The call to report diseases is being made as part of the third annual National Plant Health Week (9-15 May).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>New guide on how to help adapt woodlands for climate change</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>A new guide setting out how landowners and managers can adapt their woodlands in the face of climate change has been published on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-guide-for-forest-managers-to-help-adapt-woodlands-for-climate-change">Saturday 14 May</a> by the Forestry Commission, Scottish Forestry, Natural Resources Wales and the Northern Ireland Forest Service, as National Plant Health Week draws to a close.</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-forestry-standard">UK Forestry Standard</a> Practice Guide <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/publications/adapting-forest-and-woodland-management-to-the-changing-climate/" rel="external">‘Adapting forest and woodland management to the changing climate’</a> outlines the steps that can be taken to foster woodlands which will be resilient to current and future threats as a result of climate change, such as drought, changing weather patterns and more frequent, severe weather events.</p>

<p>The guide presents a range of such measures, including diversifying the different types of trees planted across a landscape – such as changing the dominant species – to increase biodiversity. It also advises choosing seeds best suited for the local site and climate to reduce the risks associated with drought, frost, and pests and diseases. It also recommended more natural regeneration.</p>

<p>Chair of the Forestry Commission, Sir William Worsley said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The woodlands of the future need to be planted and managed differently if they are to be resilient to our changing climate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By planting a more diverse range of tree species in the right place and in accordance with the UK Forestry Standard, we can foster healthy and thriving treescapes across the country. This new Guide will help land managers protect our precious woodlands and ensure their resilience for years to come.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>New fund for local communities to protect trees against pest Oak processionary moth</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Covering the costs of survey and group facilitators.</h3>

<p>A new funding initiative to support the long-term management of the tree pest Oak processionary moth (OPM) in local communities will be announced by government on Wednesday 18 May. The oak processionary moth is a species of moth with caterpillars that nest on oak trees, leaving them vulnerable. OPM caterpillars and their nests are a hazard to human and animal health, with the greatest risk period between May to July when the caterpillars emerge and feed.</p>

<p>The Oak processionary moth Groups grant scheme is available through the Forestry Commission-led Tree Health Pilot and aims to establish better coordination between landowners and managers at a local level to help tackle the hazardous pest. The grant will support a lead facilitator to form a group (of owners and managers of oak trees) in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mailchi.mp/forestry/ealert-grants-and-regulations-forestry-commission-1231908" rel="external">OPM Established Area</a> in London and South East. It will cover costs for a survey to be carried out of the groups oak trees, and pay the facilitator to form the group and create a management plan, helping local communities understand the risks associated and advising them on what they can do to successfully manage those trees. The fund is open for applications now.
