Some pages cannot be output as related links, these include pages that might be deemed sensitive or inappropriate such as Air Accidents Investigation Branch reports. A curated deny list is in place, which was compiled using content designer expertise and feedback. The deny list is revisited and can be updated if inappropriate recommendations are observed.</td>
