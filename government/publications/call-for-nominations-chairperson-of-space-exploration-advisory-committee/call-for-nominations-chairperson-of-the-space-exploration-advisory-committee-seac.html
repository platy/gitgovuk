<p>The UK Space Agency seeks nominations for the Chair of&nbsp;its Space Exploration Advisory Committee (SEAC).</p>

<p>Space exploration has an exciting few years ahead. There is strong UK interest, both academic and industrial, in programmes such as Lunar Gateway and Mars Sample Return. The term of the next SEAC Chair will cover a pivotal period as UK ambitions for the next phase of exploration are defined. SEAC has an important role to advise the UK on its strategy and priorities for space exploration, especially ahead of the ESA Council of Ministers in 2022. We are looking for a person with an understanding of human and robotic exploration, the UK’s activities in this field, both nationally and through ESA, and these fit within the wider National Space Strategy and the government’s science and technology ambitions.</p>

<p>The SEAC is responsible for advising the Agency on matters relating to robotic and human space exploration programmes. The Committee’s remit includes advising on UK participation in ESA’s Exploration programmes, other bilateral collaborations and national activities in support of these programmes. The programmes include enabling missions that explore the Moon and Mars, as well as research on the International Space Station.</p>

<p>Membership of the SEAC&nbsp;consists of representatives of the academic and industrial communities from across the breadth of relevant subject areas, including biomedicine, fundamental physics, robotics and autonomy, and&nbsp;space science.</p>

<p>The Chair of the group plays an important role in guiding discussions, tasking members with specific activities and reporting to the Agency’s senior leadership.</p>
