<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Since 2019, the vast majority of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses with a taxable turnover above the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold (£85,000) have been mandated to keep digital <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> records and send returns using Making Tax Digital (<abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>)-compatible software.</p>

<p>From April 2022 these requirements will apply to all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses.</p>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for Income Tax Self Assessment (<abbr title="Income Tax Self Assessment">ITSA</abbr>) will apply to individuals from April 2024, if their total gross income from self-employment and property exceeds £10,000 in a tax year. Most businesses will have 2 years to prepare and test the service voluntarily prior to its introduction.</p>

<p>This communication pack supports our partnership working arrangements with stakeholders, who can use the contents to inform their own communications activity and key messages for their clients, customers or members.
<abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> — the service is available to for all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> businesses and their agents. We explain more about how to join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> in the pack.</p>

<p>Find out how to get ready for Making Tax Digital for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. If you’re:</p>

<ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for Income Tax — this pilot is available for those with income from one source of self-employment and landlords (except those with furnished holiday lettings). We explain more about how to join in this pack.</p>

<h2>How to use this pack</h2>

<p>This pack is intended to provide source material and information to help inform stakeholder’s <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> communications for both Income Tax and <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>

<p>We would like stakeholders to continue to help their clients, customers or members to prepare for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> by encouraging businesses and their agents to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep their business records digitally</li>
  <li>sign up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>sign up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for Income Tax (if they are eligible)</li>
</ul>

<p>The pack can be used to support any letters, articles, presentations, social media activity or web content planned by stakeholders.</p>

<p>If you need more information about something not found in this pack or if you want to discuss your own plans for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> communications, <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:%20makingtaxdigital.mailbox@hmrc.gov.uk">please write to us</a>.</p>

<h2>The background to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Increasingly, businesses and agents see the benefits of digitisation. Millions of businesses are already banking, paying bills and interacting with their customers or suppliers online, and many are already using accounting software.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s ambition is to become one of the most digitally advanced tax administrations in the world and <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> is making fundamental changes to the way the tax system works — transforming tax administration so that it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more effective</li>
  <li>more efficient</li>
  <li>easier for taxpayers to get their tax right</li>
</ul>

<p>The move to digital integration will eliminate many of the existing paper-based processes, reducing errors and allowing businesses and their agents to devote more time to running their business. Many businesses use an agent and <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> allows agents to continue to provide a full service in supporting their clients.</p>

<p>We know that the majority of customers want to get their tax right but recent tax gap figures (2018 to 2019) show too many find this hard, with avoidable mistakes costing the Exchequer almost £8.5 billion a year. The improved accuracy that digital records provide, along with the help built into many software products and the fact that information is sent directly to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> from the digital records avoiding transposition errors, reduces the amount of tax lost to these avoidable errors.</p>

<p>We have engaged with stakeholders consistently throughout the development of <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>. Since 2019, <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses with a taxable turnover above the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold (£85,000) have been mandated to keep digital <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> records and send returns using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software.</p>

<p>The next step is to extend <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> to all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registered businesses from April 2022. Over 280,000 businesses under the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> turnover threshold have already joined voluntarily and are experiencing the wider benefits <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> can bring.</p>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Income Tax Self Assessment">ITSA</abbr> will apply to individuals from April 2024, if their total gross income from self-employment and property exceeds £10,000 in a tax year. Most businesses will have 2 years to prepare and test the service voluntarily prior to its introduction.</p>

<h2>Important facts about <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Businesses and landlords who join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> must keep their business records digitally and send tax information to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> directly from those records.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></h3>

<p>Since 2019, all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses with a taxable turnover above the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold (£85,000) have been required to keep their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> business records digitally and send their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software. From April 2022 all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses will be mandated to keep digital <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> records and send returns using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software.</p>

<p>The deadlines for sending <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns and making payments have not changed.</p>

<p>Businesses need to use software to keep their business records digitally. This may include dedicated record-keeping software or a combination of software packages or spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Since 1 April 2019, software that prepares a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return to send to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> must be <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible for those mandated to use <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>. Data must also be exchanged digitally between all software used by a business for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. The information contained with the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return is generated by pulling information from the digital records. This information is the 9 boxes required for the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return.</p>

<p>In the case of spreadsheets, this means that the software must be capable of taking the relevant information from the spreadsheet electronically and sending it to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Income Tax</h3>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Income Tax Self Assessment">ITSA</abbr> will apply to individuals from April 2024, if their total gross income from self-employment and property exceeds £10,000 in a tax year. Most businesses will have over 2 years to prepare and test the service voluntarily prior to its introduction.</p>

<p>Businesses and landlords who join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for Income Tax will need to send a quarterly summary of their business income and expenses to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software. In response they will receive an estimated tax calculation based on the information provided to help them budget for their tax. At the end of the year, they can add any non-business information and finalise their tax affairs using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software. This replaces the need for a Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<p>The deadlines for finalising tax affairs and making payments are not changing. Businesses and landlords will  be able to use their software to send all of the information that they need to under Self Assessment, not just their business or rental income. This includes employment income, bank and building society interest, dividends, pension contributions, student loan repayment etc. Software developers will need to continue to build this additional functionality into their products, resulting in a richer experience for customers as <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> continues to develop.</p>

<p>You can join the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> pilot for Income Tax now if you meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-software-to-send-income-tax-updates">current eligibility criteria</a>. We will widen eligibility over time and the pilot will support the vast majority of sole traders and landlords by April 2022.</p>

<p>We will block a customer from joining <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for Income Tax if their last Self Assessment tax return suggests that they do not meet the current eligibility criteria.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>When we refer to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software, we mean software that can integrate with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> systems to send updates to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is not offering its own software products but has provided the Application Programming Interfaces (<abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>) that commercial software developers are using to develop a range of applications that enable businesses to keep their records digitally and integrate with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> systems. An <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> is software that links 2 or more software programmes together, allowing them to exchange data.</p>

<p>The benefit of this approach is that commercial software developers can offer a more flexible and tailored range of options, functionality and technical support that can cater not just to the requirements of the general business population but also specific businesses and sectors like agriculture, construction, landlords and freelancers.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is working closely with software developers to enable them to bring new and more sophisticated products to the market. We will continue to publish <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> with richer capabilities. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-third-party-tax-software-and-api-strategy">read more about our <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> strategy</a>.</p>

<p>Details of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax"><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software products for Income Tax</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-vat"><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software products for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></a> are available on GOV.UK and this information will be updated as and when new products become available.</p>

<h2>The advantages of digital record-keeping</h2>

<p>Businesses, regardless of turnover, can benefit from using software to keep digital records. Software not only helps the effective running of a business but also reduces avoidable errors in business records that can occur when manual calculations are performed, or information is transposed by hand.</p>

<p>By keeping up to date digital records in real time, businesses can also reduce the risk of errors due to lost or incorrectly recorded invoices.</p>

<p>Going digital makes managing business finances more straightforward. Millions are already banking, paying bills and interacting online — going digital with business records and taxes is the next step, giving business more control and better capability to forward plan with their finances.</p>

<p>We know that many businesses are severely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation and we are committed to supporting businesses during this time.  However, <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> makes it easier to get things right, digital record keeping will reduce the risk of unwelcome and costly <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> compliance interventions and help businesses to manage their cash flow more effectively.</p>

<p>Keeping business records digitally means that it’s easier for a business to share their records with their agent, saving both time and costs, and allowing agents to focus on more value-added activity.</p>

<h2>Key messages for agents</h2>

<p>We continue to deliver <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for agents at the same time as we are delivering for businesses, so you can see what you need to do to act for your clients and be able to do it.</p>

<p>Since 2019, <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered clients with a taxable turnover above the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold (£85,000) have been required to keep digital <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> records and this will apply to all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered clients from April 2022.</p>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Income Tax Self Assessment">ITSA</abbr> will apply to individuals from April 2024, if their total gross income from self-employment and property exceeds £10,000 in a tax year.</p>

<p>It’s important that your clients are aware of their obligations if they join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for Income Tax or <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. They must keep digital business records and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, submit their returns to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software</li>
  <li>for Income Tax, provide summary updates of income and expenses to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> every quarter and finalise their tax affairs using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software</li>
</ul>

<p>The deadlines for sending <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns and making payments have not changed, including for monthly, quarterly and annual <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return schemes, but businesses have to keep digital records and send the returns to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting periods that started on or after 1 April 2019 (for most above the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold), or 1 April 2022 (below <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold). This also applies to businesses that operate the Flat Rate Scheme for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Joining the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> pilot for Income Tax</h3>

<p>By joining the pilot with eligible clients now, you can get a head start in familiarising yourself with your software and this new way of working. For <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, many agents used this early experience to present their firm as an expert on <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=wxAAP1m29uc&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="external">Learn the top Income Tax Self Assessment tips</a> from agents who are already submitting digitally.</p>

<p>You can leave the pilot if you decide it’s not for you or remain in the pilot and still send a Self Assessment tax return as normal.</p>

<p>The timing of the quarterly updates is determined by the beginning of the tax year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>6 April to 5 July</li>
  <li>6 July to 5 October</li>
  <li>6 October to 5 January</li>
  <li>6 January to 5 April</li>
</ul>

<h4>Qualification</h4>

<p>Who qualifies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sole traders with income from one business and landlords who rent out UK property</li>
  <li>provided Self Assessment tax returns and payments are up to date and you’re a resident in the UK for tax</li>
  <li>you cannot currently join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for Income Tax if you have income from any other source or if you have other payments you make that are taxable or that you claim tax relief on</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to sign up your clients for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> services</h3>

<p>It’s easy to sign up a client to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> either for Income Tax or for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. You will need an Agent Services Account (<abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr>). You may already have an <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr> if you’ve signed up for the Trust Registration Service (<abbr title="Trust Registration Service">TRS</abbr>) or signed clients up for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. You do not need to create a new one if that is the case — a firm should only have one <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are already using commercial accounting software, and before you have signed up your clients, you should speak to your software provider to find out when it will be <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible, either for Income Tax or <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and what you need to do to enable the new features once you have signed up your clients.</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h4>

<p>You’ll need your client’s <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Registration Number (VRN), Company Registration Number (CRN) and National Insurance number depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Be prepared — for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> once your client is signed up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>, their returns must be submitted using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> compatible software, so don’t sign them up unless they are ready.</p>

<p>Businesses that currently pay <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> by direct debit cannot sign up in the 7 working days leading up to, or the 5 working days after, their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return is due. Businesses should make sure that their last direct debit has come out of their bank account before signing up.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>

<p>talking to your clients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check when your client will have to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-when-a-business-must-follow-the-rules-for-making-tax-digital-for-vat">rules for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>use this pack to make your clients aware of what <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> is and what they need to do</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<p>getting the right software:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before signing a client up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-vat">make sure you/they have compatible software</a>
</li>
  <li>if using existing software, you need to make sure it is <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible and that its <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> capabilities have been enabled — contact your provider to discuss</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<p>Creating an <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before signing clients up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> you must first create an <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-hmrc-agent-services-account">read guidance and create an account</a>
</li>
  <li>you can only create an <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr> if your business has either registered with a money laundering supervisory body or has a pending application with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr> is currently only used for the <abbr title="Trust Registration Service">TRS</abbr>, the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> service and the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> Income Tax service</li>
  <li>you will use your current Government Gateway ID to create your <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr>, and as part of signing up will receive new credentials. It is these new credentials that you will use to access <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> services</li>
  <li>you will still need your current Government Gateway IDs to access other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> online services</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

<p>Copying existing clients across:</p>

<p>Your existing clients will already be authorised in your <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> online services for agents account. You do not need to set up new authorisations for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> but you do need to copy these authorisations to your <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr>.</p>

<p>To copy existing clients across to your <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sign-in-to-your-agent-services-account">sign in using the Government Gateway user ID and password</a> you got when you created <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmrc-online-services-for-agents#agent-services-account">your <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>select ‘Copy across your existing Self Assessment and <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> clients to this account’</li>
  <li>enter the Government Gateway user ID and password you use to access <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmrc-online-services-for-agents#hmrc-online-services-for-agents-account"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> online services for agents</a> and follow the steps</li>
</ul>

<p>Your clients will be authorised on both of your accounts.</p>

<p>Important: a client list cannot be viewed from within the <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr> but you can see how many clients are attached to each Government Gateway ID that you copy over.</p>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<p>Sign business up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using the new Government Gateway ID created for your <abbr title="Agent Services Account">ASA</abbr> you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agents-use-software-to-submit-vat-returns">sign up clients for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> or for Income Tax</a>
</li>
  <li>each client needs to be signed up individually, or the client can sign themselves up 
for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>: you will receive confirmation that the client’s information has been received. We will email you (usually within 72 hours) confirming you can start using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> software to submit the client’s return</li>
  <li>for Income Tax, you will receive confirmation immediately and can start using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> software straight away</li>
  <li>you should tell your client you are now submitting returns through <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 6:</h4>

<p>Authorising <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you must delegate authority to the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> compatible software after you have signed up</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important that businesses are aware of their obligations if they join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for Income Tax or <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. They must keep digital business records and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, submit their returns to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software</li>
  <li>for Income Tax, provide summary updates of income and expenses to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> quarterly (or more often if they choose) through <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software</li>
</ul>

<p>The deadlines for sending <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns and making payments have not changed, including for monthly, quarterly and annual <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return schemes, but businesses have to keep digital records and send the returns to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software.</p>

<p>This applies for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting periods that started on or after 1 April 2019 (for most above <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold), or 1 April 2022 (below <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold). This also applies to businesses that operate the Flat Rate Scheme for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Businesses that currently pay <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> by direct debit cannot sign up in the 7 working days leading up to, or the 5 working days after, their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return is due. Businesses should make sure that their last direct debit has come out of their bank account before signing up.</p>

<p>If you have an agent, speak to them about joining the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> service.</p>

<p>If you already use software, you should speak to your software provider to find out when it will be <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible and what you have to do. A list of software developers that have produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-vat"><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-compatible software</a> is available on GOV.UK and we will continue to add to this as more products become available.</p>

<p>You do not need to keep any additional business records because of <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>. However, business records must be kept digitally to be compliant. If you use spreadsheets, the spreadsheets must be able to submit the required data to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> digitally, for example, by using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible bridging software.</p>

<p>Bridging software allows relevant data to be digitally exchanged from the spreadsheet or other source where the digital records are kept, directly to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. The summary information must not be physically re-typed into another software package.</p>

<p>For larger businesses using bespoke in-house software solutions, make sure your IT team is aware of the new <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> technical standards as they may want to link in-house solutions directly to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>. <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:%20SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk">For more information contact: SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>: frequently asked questions</h2>

<p>We’ve answered the most frequently asked questions that businesses and agents have about signing up for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> and starting to use software to keep digital records. We will continue to update this information.</p>

<h3>Questions and answers</h3>

<h4>What is <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>?</h4>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> is a key part of the government’s plans to make it easier for businesses to get their tax right and keep on top of their tax affairs. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s ambition is to be one of the most digitally-advanced tax administrations in the world, modernising the tax system to make it more effective, more efficient and easier for customers to comply.</p>

<p>Businesses need to keep digital records and use compatible software to send their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns or Income Tax updates to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and receive information.</p>

<p>Keeping digital records and providing updates to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> directly through <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software helps reduce errors, cost, uncertainty and worry. This streamlined digital experience integrates tax into day-to-day business record-keeping, so that businesses can view their tax position in-year and be confident that they have got their taxes right.</p>

<h4>What do businesses need to do to be ready to sign up for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>?</h4>

<p>You must start keeping your business records digitally before you can sign up for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>. If you already use software to keep your business records, check with your software provider for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> compatibility. If you don’t use software yet, or your software is not <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible then you’ll need to consider what software, or bridging software, is most suitable for you.</p>

<p>You can find out what <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> software is available for the Income Tax and <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> service by visiting the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax">software choices page on GOV.UK</a> and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will continue to add to this in the coming months as more products become available.</p>

<p>If you have an agent, you should speak to them first about when it would be best to sign up for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>.</p>

<p>There’s more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-tax-digital-for-vat">how businesses can join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h4>What do agents need to do to get ready for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>?</h4>

<p>If you have not already done so, you will need to create a new Agent Services Account. Once you have done that you can copy over your existing agent-client relationships.</p>

<p>If you are already using commercial accounting software, you should speak to your software provider to find out when it will be <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible, either for Income Tax or <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and what you need to do to enable the new features once you have signed up your clients.</p>

<p>Check that your clients are keeping digital records and have signed up for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>.</p>

<h4>What records do I need to keep digitally for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>?</h4>

<h4>For <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h4>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> does not require you to keep additional records for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, but to record them digitally.</p>

<p>Your digital records should include, for each supply, the time of supply (tax point), the value of the supply (net excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) and the rate of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> charged.</p>

<p>They should also include information about the business, including business name and principle business address as well as your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Registration Number and details of any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting schemes you use.</p>

<p>Customers who currently record daily totals can continue to do so, but they have to be captured digitally.</p>

<p>If you use spreadsheets to keep business records you’ll need <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software so that you can send <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> your quarterly <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns and receive information back from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Bridging software may be required to make spreadsheets <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible.</p>

<p>You can find more detailed information about <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70022-making-tax-digital-for-vat"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 700/22: Making Tax Digital for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></a>.</p>

<h4>For Income Tax</h4>

<p>You’ll have to use software to capture details of all your business income and expenditure for the entirety of your accounting period.</p>

<p>Your business records will include details from invoices and receipts for purchases and as a minimum should include the date, the amount and the category.</p>

<p>Many businesses already use record keeping software and it’s important to check when this software is <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible or find out whether it integrates with other software that can make quarterly submissions (bridging software). If you are unsure about how to enter information into your software, you should speak to your software provider.</p>

<p>If you use spreadsheets to keep business records you’ll need <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software so that you can send <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> your quarterly updates.</p>

<h4>I’m an agent, do my clients need to use the same software that I do?</h4>

<p>Your clients do not necessarily need to use the same software that you do. For example, some agent software can interact with a wide range of different types of business software. A number of software providers already provide for their products to link with other software.</p>

<p>The important thing is that the movement of information between client, agent and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> must be digital, with submissions to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> made through the new <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> service.</p>

<p>If you are in any doubt, speak to your software provider.</p>

<h4>What do you mean by <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software?</h4>

<p>Compatible software is a software product or set of software products, that between them support the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> obligations of keeping digital records and exchanging data digitally with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> through the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> service. If more than one application is being used then data that flows between those applications must also be exchanged digitally.</p>

<p>Digital records can be kept in a range of compatible digital formats. They do not all have to be held in the same place or on one piece of software. For example, a spreadsheet can be a component of digital record keeping provided the product that consolidates records, or summary records from the spreadsheet is digital.</p>

<p>Businesses should discuss with their agent or software provider if in doubt.</p>

<h4>What is bridging software?</h4>

<p>Bridging software is how <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> describes the digital tool that can take information from other applications, for example, a spreadsheet or an in-house record keeping system and then lets the user send the required information digitally to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> in the correct format.</p>

<h4>Can I still use spreadsheets for my business records?</h4>

<p>Spreadsheets may be used to record and store business transactions digitally. However, those spreadsheets must be able to submit the required data to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> digitally, for example, using bridging software or an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> enabled spreadsheet that can integrate directly with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> systems.</p>

<p>The bridging software must be capable of extracting or receiving the information from the spreadsheet digitally and then sending it to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> systems.</p>

<p>The summary information must not be physically re-typed into another software package.</p>

<h4>Can I still use spreadsheets for my tax calculations?</h4>

<p>A spreadsheet can be used to calculate or summarise detailed <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> transactions to arrive at the summary information you are obliged to send <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, those spreadsheets must be able to submit the required data to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> digitally, for example, using bridging software.</p>

<p>The bridging software must be capable of extracting or receiving the information from the spreadsheet digitally and then sending it to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> systems.</p>

<p>The summary information must not be physically re-typed into another software package.</p>

<h4>How do I find out what software is available for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>?</h4>

<p>You can find out which <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax"><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software products are available for Income Tax</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-vat"><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software products are available for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></a> on GOV.UK
New products will be listed on this page as they become available.</p>

<h4>Will free software be available for businesses?</h4>

<p>Free software is available and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is working very closely with the software industry to ensure the availability of a wide range of products for businesses at a variety of different price points. There are no plans for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to offer its own software products.</p>

<p>Many existing software packages have been updated for existing subscribers to provide compatibility with <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>. In many cases, software will be updated as part of a regular update cycle to include security updates and new functionality like <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>.</p>

<h4>When will <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> be mandatory for my business?</h4>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> has been mandatory for all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses with a taxable turnover above the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold since 1 April 2019 (or 1 October 2019 for deferred businesses), and it will become mandatory for all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses from April 2022.</p>

<h4>When will <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Income Tax Self Assessment">ITSA</abbr> become mandatory?</h4>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Income Tax Self Assessment">ITSA</abbr> will apply to individuals from April 2024, if their total gross income from self-employment and property exceeds £10,000 in a tax year. Most businesses will have 2 years to prepare and test the service voluntarily prior to its introduction.</p>

<h4>How many <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns will I have to send under <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>?</h4>

<p>For <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> doesn’t change how often businesses have to send information to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, but rather how they do it.
Under <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>, records of business transactions must be kept digitally, and businesses (or their agents) will submit their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return through <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software. <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses do not need to provide more information, or more regularly, than they do now and payment deadlines are unchanged.</p>

<h4>What if my taxable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> turnover is below the threshold?</h4>

<p>Businesses already have to check their turnover for the last 12 months at the end of each month to see if it exceeds the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold. If it does, then <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> applies from the first day of the following month.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> taxable turnover subsequently falls below the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registration threshold businesses must continue to follow the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> rules.</p>

<p><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registered businesses with turnover below the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold can voluntarily join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and will be required to join from April 2022.</p>

<h4>How have submissions of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns changed?</h4>

<p>Businesses within the scope of <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> are required to send their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software. They are no longer able to submit <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns using the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> portal. Businesses who already record their transactions digitally, and then file using <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s online service using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software will speed up the submissions process and reduce the likelihood of errors, especially transposition errors.</p>

<h4>Who can sign up for the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> Income Tax pilot?</h4>

<p>Businesses that are already registered for Income Tax with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> can sign up for the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> pilot. They can do that if they’re a sole trader with income from one business and/or a landlord.</p>

<p>A new business that wants to join the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> Income Tax pilot must first register for Income Tax with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h4>What will I need to do if I join the <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> Income Tax pilot?</h4>

<p>You will need to keep records of your business transactions digitally and send a summary update to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> using your software quarterly (or your agent can do this on your behalf). At the end of the year you may also have to send a final report to confirm your income and expenses at the end of your accounting year. If you need to claim allowances and reliefs, you can do this within that final report.</p>

<h4>Many businesses are submitting information digitally- what’s in it for them?</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> programme is much broader than just keeping records digitally and updating <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> electronically from those records.</p>

<p>It brings with it a whole new way of interacting with government and <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> is the necessary technological first step to achieve this.</p>

<p>If you are already recording your business transactions digitally using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software you will be able to send information to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> at the click of a button, rather than logging on to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s portal and typing in data to submit returns as a separate activity.</p>

<p>Software helps you to stay on top of your record keeping, allowing you or your agent, and those who represent them, to better understand how your business is performing.</p>

<p>You can view an estimate of the tax you might owe at the end of your accounting year, based on the information you have provided so far in your business tax account as well as through your software.</p>

<p>You can also choose to send an update to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> more often, for example, if you want to see a more up-to-date estimate of the tax you might owe and you can pay your bill as you go, if it makes it easier for you to manage your budget.</p>

<p>You can also ask your agent to send updates for you.</p>

<h4>Where do I get help to sign up for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>?</h4>

<p>Go to GOV.UK for details of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/help-and-support-for-making-tax-digital">how to get help and support for Making Tax Digital</a>.</p>

<h4>What if a business doesn’t have internet access or can’t use it?</h4>

<p>Since 2019, <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses with taxable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> turnover above the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold have been required to keep digital records and send returns to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> using compatible software. These requirements apply to all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses from April 2022.</p>

<p>However, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> recognises that not everyone will be able to do this. Where for example a business is run entirely by practicing members of a religious society whose beliefs are incompatible with the requirements of the regulations (for example, those religious beliefs prevent them from using computers) they may be exempted.</p>

<p>Additionally, if it is not reasonably practicable for you to use digital tools to keep your business records or submit your returns, for reasons of age, disability, remoteness of location or for any other reason, you may be exempted. You should contact the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> helpline if you think this applies to you. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> also provides digital assistance if an exemption is not appropriate.</p>

<p>Businesses subject to insolvency procedures do not have to use <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>.</p>

<h4>What if I am already exempt from online filing for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>?</h4>

<p>Exemptions from <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> are the same as those that are already in place for online filing for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. Some examples are given above. If you are already exempt from filing your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return online, you will continue to be treated as exempt for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>
