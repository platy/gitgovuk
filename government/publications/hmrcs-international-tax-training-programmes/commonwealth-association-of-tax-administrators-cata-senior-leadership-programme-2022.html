<h2>
<abbr title="Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators">CATA</abbr> Senior Leadership Programme 2022</h2>

<p>Each year HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) delivers a senior-level leadership development programme on behalf of the Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators (<abbr title="Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators">CATA</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators">CATA</abbr> Senior Leadership Programme (<abbr title="CATA Senior Leadership Programme">CATA SLP</abbr>) is a unique opportunity for senior leaders in tax administrations to develop the leadership skills required to navigate their organisations in a dynamic and complex landscape.</p>

<p>In 2022, the <abbr title="CATA Senior Leadership Programme">CATA SLP</abbr> combines residential phases in India and the UK, virtual sessions, and work within your tax administration.</p>

<p>Today’s tax administrations face unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Good leadership is essential to delivering results whilst securing transformational change.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="CATA Senior Leadership Programme">CATA SLP</abbr> offers a multi-disciplinary approach to learning in a highly interactive and engaging environment.

<h2>Programme structure</h2>

<p>The programme is composed of residential and virtual elements outlined below:</p>

<h3>Preliminary phase</h3>

<p>This phase is self-directed and will be completed in your home country. During this phase you will complete essential preparation tasks ahead of the programme.</p>

<p>As part of this you will be asked to provide a personal profile and reflect on your aims and expectations for the programme. You will begin thinking about challenges you are experiencing in your organisation that would benefit from your leadership development and participation on the programme.</p>

<p>You will be guided through this by the <abbr title="CATA Senior Leadership Programme">CATA SLP</abbr> team in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Phase 1 – Nagpur, India (5 to 16 September 2022)</h3>

<p>This phase takes place in Nagpur, India and is hosted by the National Academy of Direct Taxes (<abbr title="National Academy of Direct Taxes">NADT</abbr>) and the Central Board of Direct Taxes (<abbr title="Central Board of Direct Taxes">CBDT</abbr>).</p>

<p>We will focus on leadership development as part of the Leading Self and Leading Others themes. You will have opportunities to reflect on your own leadership strengths and goals and share your experiences of being a leader. You will work as a cohort, in smaller groups and individually in interactive and engaging sessions.</p>

<p>You will be introduced to the concept of Action Learning and start working on your Reflective Journals, where you will identify goals and reflect on how you will apply learning from the programme within your organisation.</p>

<h3>Phase 2 – Virtual (October 2022 to January 2023)</h3>

<p>This phase takes place after you return to your home country and forms a crucial part of the programme.</p>

<p>You will work on consolidating and implementing the ideas and learning from the first residential stage in your home working environment. Specifically, you will work on your Reflective Journals, attend several virtual sessions and participate in your Action Learning Sets.</p>

<p>You will have regular contact with the <abbr title="CATA Senior Leadership Programme">CATA SLP</abbr> team, who will be available to guide and support you.</p>

<h3>Phase 3 – UK (6 to 17 March 2023)</h3>

<p>Hosted by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and delivered in the UK, this phase will concentrate on your leadership development as part of the Leading Organisations and Leading in the Current and Future Tax Landscape themes. This will include inputs from <abbr title="Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators">CATA</abbr> senior leaders, subject-matter experts and external speakers.</p>

<p>You will feedback and reflect on the virtual phase of the programme. You will continue to work with your Action Learning Sets and use your Reflective Journals to make a personal plan to apply learning from the programme.</p>

<p>Phase 3 will culminate in an event at Marlborough House, the headquarters of <abbr title="Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators">CATA</abbr> in London.</p>

<h3>Post programme delivery</h3>

<p>This phase involves further home country-based work where you will continue to apply and embed the learning and ideas gained during the programme. You will finalise work on your Reflective Journals, as well as feedback on the programme to submit to the <abbr title="CATA Senior Leadership Programme">CATA SLP</abbr> team.</p>

<p>These activities ensure you, your immediate working team colleagues, and your organisation back home reap direct and long-term benefits from your participation in the programme.</p>

<p>You and your organisation will also be contacted periodically after this time for programme evaluation purposes.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="CATA Senior Leadership Programme">CATA SLP</abbr> Alumni Network</h3>

<p>After the end of the programme, you will be contacted from time to time to request an update on your progress on future iterations of the <abbr title="CATA Senior Leadership Programme">CATA SLP</abbr> and join virtual events with the Alumni Network to continue the relationships built on the programme.</p>

<h2>How you will work during the programme</h2>

<p>Sessions will be highly interactive and include presentations, case studies and activities. They will require you to fully participate, working as a group, in smaller teams and by yourself.</p>

<p>Time for discussion and reflection will be built into the programme and you will be encouraged to build mutual support networks with other delegates that will continue after the formal programme has ended.</p>

<p>During the home country-based phases of the programme you will be required to complete various assignments including your reflective journals. You will have support and guidance from the <abbr title="CATA Senior Leadership Programme">CATA SLP</abbr> team and fellow programme participants.</p>

<h2>Your personal commitment</h2>

<p>We aim to make the <abbr title="Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators">CATA</abbr> Senior Leadership Programme a useful, rewarding and enjoyable experience. Applicants should be aware that the programme is very demanding and will require your full commitment.</p>

<p>Delegates should be prepared to complete work to a high standard and meet the required deadlines both for completing work and providing feedback.</p>

<p>The face-to-face phases can include some long days and on occasion, you will be required to dedicate time outside of normal working hours. During the non-residential phases, there may be challenges fitting the programme around the demands of your everyday work, family and other commitments.</p>

<p>In addition, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or third-party organisations may contact you or your organisation for feedback to evaluate the short and long-term impacts of the programme.</p>

<p>You are therefore advised to think seriously about whether you and your organisation are able to fully commit to the programme prior to submitting your application.</p>

<h2>What previous alumni have said about the SLP:</h2>

<p>‘The virtual sessions were intensive and interactive. The senior leaders take time to know each other and share deeply about their lives and professional work. They engaged in conversations with senior tax leaders of UK, Canada, Australia and Mauritius. The programme provided a unique opportunity for senior tax leaders of Commonwealth to present their leadership style and developed skills and capabilities required to meet the challenges of modern leadership’.</p>
