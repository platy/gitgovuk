<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 07-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Imports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>0700<br>
0721<br>
0751<br>
0753<br>
0754<br>
0771<br>
0778</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>Procedure Codes from this series may only be used where an Excise Registered Consignor has started the movement of the goods under excise duty suspense on the Excise Movement and Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>) (as required).</p>

<p>Additional Information (<abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr>) code ECONR (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2) and Additional Procedure Code F06 (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) must be entered on the declaration unless all the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The goods are being removed from a customs warehouse</li>
  <li>For entry to an excise warehouse</li>
  <li>Where the excise and customs warehouse premises are co-located.</li>
</ul>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes:</h2>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes contain different instruction from the main Declaration Completion Guide or other Appendices, the completion instructions in Appendix 1 take precedence Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">0700: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release of goods for free circulation simultaneously placed under a warehousing procedure other than customs warehousing (placed in an excise warehouse), where neither excise nor (when applicable) VAT, has been paid, and where the goods have not been subject to any previous procedure. The law which governs the storage of goods in an excise warehouse may be found in section 17 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197#the-law">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used where the goods are released for free circulation but where excise duties (and where applicable VAT) are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse.</p>

<p>Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved excise warehouse, registered tobacco store or other registered premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, with suspension of excise duty and where applicable, VAT.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F or Y authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods.  This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The use of this requested procedure is dependent on the payment of any customs duties.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Procedure Codes on a Customs declaration must all be in the same declaration category e.g.<abbr title="Declaration for release for free circulation and special procedure: specific use (end use)">H1</abbr>.</p>

<p>All items on the customs declaration must be being entered to the same excise warehouse and have the requested procedure code of 07 (as the first and second digit) in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 (Procedure Code).</p>

<p>Entry under this procedure code is an undertaking by the importer/agent to pay to the Commissioners of HMRC immediately on demand any duties or other charges due in respect of the goods in question if the conditions of the relief arenât met.</p>

<p>Entry under this Customs Procedure is a declaration that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The goods are eligible for excise warehousing.</li>
  <li>The goods will be deposited without delay and in the same state and conditions as at importation in the warehouse stated in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse).</li>
  <li>Any additional security which may be needed will be provided and</li>
  <li>All other conditions and requirements associated with entry to the excise warehouse procedure will be met.</li>
</ul>

<h3>VAT:</h3>

<p>Use of this procedure code gives relief from VAT which must be accounted for, if applicable, upon removal from the Excise Warehouse.</p>

<h3>Excise:</h3>

<p>Excise goods may only be moved under excise duty suspension when a registered consignor has started the movement via <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> following release of the goods to free circulation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement code ECONR must be included in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 (Additional Information) and code F06 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 (Additional Procedure Code).</p>

<h2><span class="number">0721: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release of goods for free circulation after temporary export for outward processing with simultaneous placement under a warehousing procedure other than customs warehousing (placed in an excise warehouse), where neither excise nor (when applicable) VAT, has been paid (Articles 259 â 262 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)). The law which governs the storage of goods in an excise warehouse may be found in section 17 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197#the-law">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim customs duty relief on goods re-imported under the outward processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure with simultaneous release for free circulation but where excise duties (and where applicable VAT) are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse.</p>

<p>Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation, valid at the time of export, is needed to use this customs procedure.  This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<p>Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the person who originally exported the goods under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>VAT relief cannot be claimed if the goods were sold while outside the European Union.</p>

<p>See conditions for use detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved excise warehouse, registered tobacco store or other registered premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, with suspension of excise duty and where applicable, VAT.</p>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure must be held.  A duty calculation worksheet to verify any duty override calculations will be required (see <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 Document Codes).</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were exported under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Goods temporarily exported for processing under VAT only <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 B53 or B54 at export) may not be re-imported using this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F or Y authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Additional declaration types (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2): C, F or Y cannot be used where use of the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration. If the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with codes A and D in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 on this declaration.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods.  This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.  These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release of goods for free circulation after inward processing with simultaneous placement under a warehousing procedure other than customs warehousing (placed in an excise warehouse), where excise duties only are suspended (Article 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)). The law which governs the storage of goods in an excise warehouse may be found in section 17 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197#the-law">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation with the payment of any customs duties and import VAT, on goods that have previously been entered to Inward Processing, but where excise duties are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse.</p>

<p>Any customs duties and import VAT must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>An Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved excise warehouse, registered tobacco store or other registered premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, with suspension of excise duty.</p>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) procedure must be held. A duty calculation worksheet to verify any duty override calculations will be required (see <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 Document Codes).</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<h3>Additional declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2):</h3>

<p>C cannot be used where use of the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration. If the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with code A in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 on this declaration.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

  <li>Any additional security which may be needed will be provided and</li>
  <li>All other conditions and requirements associated with entry to the excise warehouse procedure will be met.</li>
</ul>

<p>Procedure Codes on a Customs declaration must all be in the same declaration category e.g.<abbr title="Declaration for release for free circulation and special procedure: specific use (end use)">H1</abbr>.</p>

<p>Code F44 may not be used on the diversion to Free Circulation unless F44 was also quoted on the original declaration (in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 (Additional Procedure Code) placing the goods under <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Entry under this procedure code is an undertaking by the importer/agent to pay to the Commissioners of HMRC immediately on demand any duties or other charges due in respect of the goods in question if the conditions of the relief arenât met.</p>

<p>All items on the customs declaration must be being entered to the same excise warehouse and have the requested procedure code of 07 (as the first and second digit) in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 (Procedure Code).</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release of goods for free circulation after temporary admission with simultaneous placement under a warehousing procedure other than customs warehousing (placed in an excise warehouse), where excise duties only are suspended (Article 250 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)). The law which governs the storage of goods in an excise warehouse may be found in section 17 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197#the-law">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation with the payment of any customs duties and import VAT, on goods that were previously entered to temporary admission (<abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>) but where excise duties are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse.</p>

<p>Any customs duties and import VAT must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>A Temporary Admission (<abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved excise warehouse, registered tobacco store or other registered premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, with suspension of excise duty.</p>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Temporary Admission (<abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>) procedure must be held.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<h3>Additional declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2):</h3>

<p>C cannot be used where use of the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration.  If the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with code A in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 on this declaration.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibition or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used for Hydrocarbon Oils.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<p>1CD, 1CG.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The use of this requested procedure is dependent on the payment of any customs duties.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Entry under this Customs Procedure is a declaration that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The goods are eligible for excise warehousing.</li>
  <li>The goods will be deposited without delay and in the same state and conditions as at importation in the warehouse stated in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse).</li>
  <li>Any additional security which may be needed will be provided and</li>
  <li>All other conditions and requirements associated with entry to the excise warehouse procedure will be met.</li>
</ul>

<p>Procedure Codes on a Customs declaration must all be in the same declaration category e.g.<abbr title="Declaration for release for free circulation and special procedure: specific use (end use)">H1</abbr>.</p>

<p>Entry under this procedure code is an undertaking by the importer/agent to pay to the Commissioners of HMRC immediately on demand any duties or other charges due in respect of the goods in question if the conditions of the relief arenât met.</p>

<p>All items on the customs declaration must be being entered to the same excise warehouse and have the requested procedure code of 07 (as the first and second digit) in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 (Procedure Code).</p>

<p>Where the authorisation was granted at the time of entry to <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr> under the Authorisation by Customs Declaration a copy of the authorisation letter issued by NTAS must be provided to Customs (on request) unless the <abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr> details of the declaration have been declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 (Previous Documents).</p>

<p>Agents must have prior written approval from the authorisation holder to enter goods to <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr> on their behalf and ensure a copy of the declaration is returned to the holder.</p>

<h3>VAT:</h3>

<p>Use of this procedure code does not give relief from VAT which must be accounted for, if applicable, upon entry to the Excise Warehouse.</p>

<h3>Excise:</h3>

<p>Excise goods may only be moved under excise duty suspension when a registered consignor has started the movement via <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> following release of the goods to free circulation. <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement code ECONR must be included in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 (Additional Information) and code F06 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 (Additional Procedure Code).</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release of goods for free circulation after inward processing in another Member State with simultaneous placement under a warehousing procedure other than customs warehousing (placed in an excise warehouse), where excise duties only are suspended (Articles 211(1) and 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).  The law which governs the storage of goods in an excise warehouse may be found in section 17 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197#the-law">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation with the payment of any customs duties, on goods which have previously been entered to Inward Processing in another member state, with simultaneous release for free circulation but where excise duties are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse.</p>

<p>Any customs duties and import VAT must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>A full, multi-state Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved excise warehouse, registered tobacco store or other registered premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, with suspension of excise duty.</p>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) procedure must be held. A duty calculation worksheet to verify any duty override calculations will be required (see <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 Document Codes).</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full multi-state authorisation being held for <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration cannot be used with this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation of goods after removal from a customs warehouse with simultaneous placement  under a warehousing procedure other than a customs warehousing (placed in an excise warehouse), where neither excise nor (when applicable) VAT, has been paid (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)). The law which governs the storage of goods in an excise warehouse may be found in section 17 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197#the-law">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation with the payment of any customs duties, but where excise duties (and where applicable VAT) are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse for goods that are being released from a Customs Warehouse (CW).</p>

<p>Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>A Customs Warehousing (CW) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr> of this declaration must be provided to the customs warehousekeeper for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a customs procedure. The customs warehousekeeper must also be provided with confirmation of receipt of the goods into the Excise Warehouse.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved excise warehouse, registered tobacco store or other registered premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, with suspension of excise duty and where applicable, VAT.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation being held for CW.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation of goods following removal from a free zone with simultaneous placement under a warehousing procedure other than a customs warehousing (placed in an excise warehouse), where neither excise nor (when applicable) VAT, has been paid (Article 243 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).  The law which governs the storage of goods in an excise warehouse may be found in section 17 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197#the-law">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation with the payment of any customs duties, but where excise duties (and where applicable VAT) are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse for goods which are being released from a Free Zone (<abbr title="free zone">FZ</abbr>).</p>

<p>Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>A Free Zone (<abbr title="free zone">FZ</abbr>) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr> of this declaration must be provided to the Free Zone Operator for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a customs procedure. The Free Zone Operator must also be provided with confirmation of receipt of the goods into the Excise Warehouse.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved excise warehouse, registered tobacco store or other registered premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, with suspension of excise duty and where applicable, VAT.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation being held for <abbr title="free zone">FZ</abbr>.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C or Y authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>
