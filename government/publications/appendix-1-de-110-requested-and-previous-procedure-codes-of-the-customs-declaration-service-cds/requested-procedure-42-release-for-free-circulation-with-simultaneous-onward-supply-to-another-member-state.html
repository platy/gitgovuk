<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 42-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Imports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>4200<br>
4221<br>
4251<br>
4253<br>
4254<br>
4271<br>
4278<br></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes:</h2>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes contain different instruction from the main Declaration Completion Guide or other Appendices, the completion instructions in Appendix 1 take precedence Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">4200: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation of goods simultaneously onward supplied to another Member State which are the subject of a VAT exempt (and where applicable excise duty-suspension) onward supply (Article 143(2) of Directive 2006/112 and/or Article 17(1)(b) of Directive 2008/118/EC), and where the goods have not been subject to any previous procedure.</p>

<h3>Permitted Import Movements:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code may be used to declare goods moving from:</p>

<p>Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) to Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>)<br>
Rest of the World (<abbr title="Rest of the World">RoW</abbr>) to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr></p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim release for free circulation with the payment of any customs duties for non-Union Goods (<abbr title="Declaration for release for free circulation and special procedure: specific use (end use)">H1</abbr>), with simultaneous VAT-exempt onward supply to another Member State with, when applicable, an excise-duty suspension.</p>

<p>Or a request for VAT-exempt onward supply in the context of trade between the Union and the territories with which it has formed a customs union of goods (<abbr title="Declaration for the introduction of goods in the context of trade with Special Fiscal Territories or Territories with which the EU has formed a Customs Union">H5</abbr>). Excise duties, where applicable will be suspended. The VAT and any applicable excise duty will be due in the Member State of final destination.</p>

<p>In order to use this procedure, the declarant must meet the conditions listed in in Article 143(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC and, where applicable, the conditions listed in Article 17(1)(b) of Directive 2008/118/EC. The information required by Article 143 (2) of Directive 2006/112/EC shall be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/40 Additional fiscal references identification no.</p>

<p>Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Goods must be intended for onward supply to another Member State at the time this procedure is requested. The goods must be onward supplied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Within 30 days of the goods release to this procedure</li>
  <li>In an unaltered state from the time of release to this procedure</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of an onward shipment contract must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes).</p>

<p>The importer must be UK VAT registered or appoint a tax representative VAT registered in the UK to act on their behalf. The tax representative must meet the conditions of a tax representative as defined in sections 2.7 and 2.8 of Notice 702. The tax representative details should be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/20. The non-UK supplier who appointed the tax representative must be declared as the Seller in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/24 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/25.</p>

<p>OSR cannot be claimed if the UK importer or their UK appointed tax representative does not have a VAT registration number and an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>).</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C or Y authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in the Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation of goods, after temporary export under outward processing, with simultaneous onward supply to another Member State which are the subject of a VAT exempt (and where applicable excise duty-suspension) (Article 143(2) of Directive 2006/112 and/or Article 17(1)(b) of Directive 2008/118/EC) (Articles 259 - 262 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may be used to declare goods moving from:</p>

<p><abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr><br>
Rest of the World (<abbr title="Rest of the World">RoW</abbr>) to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr></p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim release for free circulation  with simultaneous VAT-exempt onward supply to another Member State with, when applicable, an excise duty suspension for Union goods re-imported after temporarily export outside the Customs Union under outward processing (<abbr title="Declaration for release for free circulation and special procedure: specific use (end use)">H1</abbr>),</p>

<p>Request for a VAT-exempt and, when applicable, an excise-duty suspension, onward supply to another Member States for goods re-imported after outward processing from a Special Fiscal Territory or Territory with which the EU has formed a customs union (<abbr title="Declaration for the introduction of goods in the context of trade with Special Fiscal Territories or Territories with which the EU has formed a Customs Union">H5</abbr>). The goods must have been temporarily exported to the Special Fiscal Territory or Territory with which the EU has formed a customs union under Procedure Code 2200.</p>

<p>Any customs duties not relieved under Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) must be paid or secured prior to the release of the goods.</p>

<p>The VAT and any applicable excise duty will be due in the Member State of final destination.</p>

<p>In order to use this procedure, the declarant must meet the conditions listed in in Article 143(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC and, where applicable, the conditions listed in Article 17(1)(b) of Directive 2008/118/EC. The information required by Article 143 (2) of Directive 2006/112/EC shall be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/40 Additional fiscal references identification no.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were exported under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>, unless the declaration is for âVAT onlyâ relief (see Conditions above).</p>

<p>This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the person who originally exported the goods under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>See <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> conditions for use detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pay-less-or-no-duty-on-goods-you-store-process-repair-or-temporarily-use">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Goods must be intended for onward supply to another Member State at the time this procedure is requested. The goods must be onward supplied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Within 30 days of the goods release to this customs procedure</li>
  <li>In an unaltered state from the time of release to this customs procedure</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of an onward shipment contract must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes).</p>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure must be held. A duty calculation worksheet to verify any duty override calculations will be required (see <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 Document Codes).</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were exported under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>, unless the declaration is for âVAT onlyâ relief (see Conditions above).</p>

<p>Where the Additional Declaration Type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F or Y, authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Additional Declaration Types (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2): C, F or Y cannot be used where use of the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration. If the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with codes A and D in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 on this declaration.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>The importer must be UK VAT registered or appoint a tax representative VAT registered in the UK to act on their behalf. The tax representative must meet the conditions of a tax representative as defined in sections 2.7 and 2.8 of Notice 702.

The non-UK supplier who appointed the tax representative must be declared as the Seller in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/24 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/25.</p>

<p>OSR cannot be claimed if the UK importer or their UK appointed tax representative does not have a VAT registration number and an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim release for free circulation after inward processing with the payment of any customs duties for non-Union goods (<abbr title="Declaration for release for free circulation and special procedure: specific use (end use)">H1</abbr>),with simultaneous VAT-exempt onward supply to another Member State.</p>

<p>Request for VAT-exempt onward supply for goods diverted from inward processing in the context of trade between the Union and the territories with which it has formed a customs union for goods (<abbr title="Declaration for the introduction of goods in the context of trade with Special Fiscal Territories or Territories with which the EU has formed a Customs Union">H5</abbr>). Excise duties, where applicable will be suspended. The VAT and any applicable excise duty will be due in the Member State of final destination.</p>

<p>In order to use this procedure, the declarant must meet the conditions listed in in Article 143(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC and, where applicable, the conditions listed in Article 17(1)(b) of Directive 2008/118/EC. The information required by Article 143 (2) of Directive 2006/112/EC shall be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/40 Additional fiscal references identification no.</p>

<p>Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>An Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Goods must be intended for onward supply to another Member State at the time this procedure is requested. The goods must be onward supplied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Within 30 days of the goods release to this procedure;</li>
  <li>In an unaltered state from the time of release to this customs procedure. Where the goods are diverted from <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, the goods subject to the onward supply must have been diverted unprocessed. Where the goods were processed under <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> they are not eligible for onward supply relief.</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of an onward shipment contract must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes).</p>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) procedure must be held. A duty calculation worksheet to verify any duty override calculations will be required (see <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 Document Codes).</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Additional declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2): C cannot be used where use of the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration. If the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with code A in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 on this declaration.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>The importer must be UK VAT registered or appoint a tax representative VAT registered in the UK to act on their behalf. The tax representative must meet the conditions of a tax representative as defined in sections 2.7 and 2.8 of Notice 702. The tax representative details should be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/20. The non-UK supplier who appointed the tax representative must be declared as the Seller in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/24 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/25.</p>

<p>OSR cannot be claimed if the UK importer or their UK appointed tax representative does not have a VAT registration number and an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in the Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr><br>
Rest of the World (<abbr title="Rest of the World">RoW</abbr>) to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr></p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim release for free circulation after customs warehousing with the payment of any customs duties for non-Union goods (<abbr title="Declaration for release for free circulation and special procedure: specific use (end use)">H1</abbr>),with simultaneous VAT-exempt onward supply to another Member State.</p>

<p>Request for VAT-exempt onward supply for goods released from a customs warehouse in the context of trade between the Union and the territories with which it has formed a customs union for goods (<abbr title="Declaration for the introduction of goods in the context of trade with Special Fiscal Territories or Territories with which the EU has formed a Customs Union">H5</abbr>). Excise duties, where applicable will be suspended. The VAT and applicable excise duty will be due in the Member State of final destination.</p>

<p>In order to use this procedure, the declarant must meet the conditions listed in in Article 143(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC and, where applicable, the conditions listed in Article 17(1)(b) of Directive 2008/118/EC. The information required by Article 143 (2) of Directive 2006/112/EC shall be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/40 Additional fiscal references identification no.</p>

<p>Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>A Customs Warehousing (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr> of this declaration must be provided to the warehousekeeper for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a customs procedure.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Goods must be intended for onward supply to another Member State at the time this procedure is requested: The goods must be onward supplied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Within 30 days of the goods release to this procedure;</li>
  <li>In an unaltered state from the time of entry to the customs warehouse, other than those necessary to preserve them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of an onward shipment contract must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes).</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation being held for <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>.</p>

<p>The importer must be UK VAT registered or appoint a tax representative VAT registered in the UK to act on their behalf. The tax representative must meet the conditions of a tax representative as defined in sections 2.7 and 2.8 of Notice 702.

<p>OSR cannot be claimed if the UK importer or their UK appointed tax representative does not have a VAT registration number and an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>
