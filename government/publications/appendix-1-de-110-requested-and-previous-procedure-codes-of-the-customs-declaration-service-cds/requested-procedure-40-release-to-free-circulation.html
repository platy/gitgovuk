<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 40-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Imports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>4000<br>
4051<br>
4053<br>
4054<br>
4071<br>
4078</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cds-uk-trade-tariff-volume-3-import-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports</a>.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes:</h2>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes contain different instruction from the main Declaration Completion Guide or other Appendices, the completion instructions in Appendix 1 take precedence. Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">4000: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cds-uk-trade-tariff-volume-3-import-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports</a>. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Entry for free-circulation and home use of non-Union goods (<abbr title="Declaration for release for free circulation and special procedure: specific use (end use)">H1</abbr>).</p>

<p>Entry for home use in the context of trade between the Union and any Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union (<abbr title="Declaration for the introduction of goods in the context of trade with Special Fiscal Territories or Territories with which the EU has formed a Customs Union">H5</abbr>) (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) and where the goods have not been subject to any previous procedure.</p>

<p>Entry for release for free circulation and home use in respect of a consignment which benefits from a relief from import duty in accordance with Article 23(1) or Article 25(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009 (H7).</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation and home use with the payment of any customs duties and other charges due, or entry for home use in the context of trade between the Union and the countries with which it has formed a customs union of goods.</p>

<p>Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Goods cannot be released to free circulation and home use using the H7 data set where customs duties or other charges are payable prior to release.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J, K, Y or Z authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p><abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>H7 data set may only be used where Additional Procedure Code 1H7 is declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<h3>Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1):</h3>

<p>Enter code: IM or CO*.</p>

<p>For goods released to free circulation that have Customs Union status (for example, they originate in a Special Fiscal Territory, or were sent from a Territory that forms part of a customs union with the EU), the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should reflect the customs status of the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the goods have Customs Union status, then the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should be completed with code âCOâ. Code F15 must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 (Additional Procedure Code).</li>
  <li>If the goods do not have Customs Union status, then the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should be completed with code âIMâ.</li>
</ul>

<p>*Only code IM may be declared when Declaration Category H7 is used.</p>

<h3>Additional Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2):</h3>

<p>The following codes may be entered for this Procedure Code: A*, B**, C, D*, E**, F, J, K, Y or Z.</p>

<p>*Only codes A and D may be declared when Declaration Category H7 is used.</p>

<p>**Additional Declaration Type B or E may only be used where the Additional Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) notes specifically allow. Where additional declaration types B or E are used, a simplified declaration should be submitted, as per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-21-import-declaration-category-data-sets/appendix-21g-declaration-category-data-sets-i1-be">Appendix 21G: Declaration Category data set: Import Simplified Declaration on an occasional basis (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 Codes B&amp;E)</a> for the data set to be used). In these instances, a subsequent supplementary declaration is not required.</p>

<p>Where additional declaration types C or F are used, a simplified declaration should be submitted, as per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-21-import-declaration-category-data-sets/appendix-21f-declaration-category-data-sets-i1-cf">Appendix 21F: Declaration Category Data Sets: Import Simplified Declaration with regular use (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 Codes C&amp;F)</a>, and a supplementary declaration must be submitted where required.</p>

<h3>Simplified Declaration/Previous Document (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1):</h3>

<p>The list below details the Previous Document reference types to be used in specific circumstances for this Procedure Code. Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/previous-document-codes-for-data-element-21-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 3: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 Previous Document Codes</a> for alternative codes which may be used if the circumstances below do not apply:</p>

<p>Entry for free-circulation and home use of non-Union goods (<abbr title="Declaration for release for free circulation and special procedure: specific use (end use)">H1</abbr>) where the goods have been previously entered to inward processing (Article 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Entry for home use in the context of trade between the Union and any Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union (<abbr title="Declaration for the introduction of goods in the context of trade with Special Fiscal Territories or Territories with which the EU has formed a Customs Union">H5</abbr>) where the goods have been previously entered to inward processing (Article 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation and home use with the payment of any customs duties, or entry for home use in the context of trade between the Union and the countries with which it has formed a customs union of goods for goods which were previously entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>An Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>
