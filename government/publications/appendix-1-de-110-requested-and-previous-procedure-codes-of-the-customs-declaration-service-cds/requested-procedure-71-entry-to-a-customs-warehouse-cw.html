<p>Requested Procedure 71: Entry to a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>)</p>

<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 71-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Imports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>7100<br>	
7110<br>
7121<br>
7122<br>
7123<br>
7151<br>
7153<br>
7154<br>
7171<br>
7178</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main UK Trade Tariff, <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Volume 3 Import Declaration Completion Guide.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">7100 </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main UK Trade Tariff, <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Volume 3 Import Declaration Completion Guide. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release to a Customs Warehouse where the goods have not been subject to any previous procedure (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim a suspension from customs duties and other charges for goods entered to a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>).</p>

<p>A Customs Warehousing (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure. See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>A Customs Comprehensive Guarantee (<abbr title="Customs Comprehensive Guarantee">CCG</abbr>) is required to be authorised for Customs Warehousing (Articles 95 and 195 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Goods liable to customs duty and/or other charges, may be entered to an approved customs warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) in order to suspend the payment of any customs duty or charges.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation for a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) being held for the premises declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse).</p>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, in order to suspend the import duties and other charges.</p>

<p>Goods can only be entered to <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> where the <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> is specifically authorised to receive them.</p>

<p>Where the Additional Declaration Type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J or K authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarantâs Recordâs (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Where a C21i <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> NOP is used to enter the goods an authorisation for Entry in Declarants Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) must be held.</p>

<p><abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Entry in Declarantâs Recordâs (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) may not be used to both enter and remove the goods from the customs warehousing procedure. Declarantâs intending to use <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> to remove the goods from the warehouse at a later date should use an alternative method to enter them using this Procedure Code.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Customs special procedures for the Union Customs Code (Notice 3001)</a></p>

<h3>Declaration category:</h3>

<p><abbr title="Special procedure: storage (customs warehousing)">H2</abbr>, <abbr title="Import simplified declaration C&amp;F (with regular use)">I1 C&amp;F</abbr> or C21i <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> NOP.</p>

<h3>Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1):</h3>

<p>Enter code: IM or CO</p>

<p>For goods released to a customs warehouse that have Customs Union status (for example, they originate in a Special Fiscal Territory, or were sent from a Territory that forms part of a customs union with the EU), the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should reflect the customs status of the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the goods have Customs Union status, then the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should be completed with code âCOâ. Code F15 must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 (Additional Procedure Code).</li>
  <li>If the goods do not have Customs Union status, then the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should be completed with code âIMâ.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2):</h3>

<p>The following codes may be entered for this Procedure Code: A, C, D, F, J or K.</p>

<p>The obligation to lodge a supplementary declaration shall be waived where the goods are placed under a customs warehousing procedure (Article 167 (2)(a) EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)). There is therefore no requirement to submit a supplementary declaration using Additional Declaration Types Y or Z for this Procedure Code.</p>

<h3>Simplified Declaration/Previous Document (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1):</h3>

<p>The list below details the Previous Document reference types to be used in specific circumstances for this Procedure Code.

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Re-import of goods, previously declared for permanent export to a third country, to a Customs Warehouse (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) on their return, pending their release to free circulation. The goods may only be warehoused where their release to free circulation is prohibited until the necessary documentation is obtained.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to suspend the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods for free circulation. This includes the suspension of the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) whilst the goods are held in the Customs Warehouse. These formalities must be completed on their eventual removal from the warehouse.</p>

<p>A suitable warehousing authorisation is required to cover any special storage requirements relating to the nature of the goods.</p>

<p>A Customs Warehousing (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure.  See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>A Customs Comprehensive Guarantee (<abbr title="Customs Comprehensive Guarantee">CCG</abbr>) is required to be authorised for Customs Warehousing (Articles 95 and 195 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Goods liable to customs duty and/or other charges, may be entered to an approved customs warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) in order to suspend the payment of any customs duty or charges.</p>

<p>Evidence must be available to demonstrate the status of the goods at their original export.  The MRN of the export declaration must be declared as a previous document in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation for a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) being held for the premises declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse).</p>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, in order to suspend the import duties and other charges.</p>

<p>Goods can only be entered to <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> where the <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> is specifically authorised to receive them.</p>

<p>Where the Additional Declaration Type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J or K authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarantâs Recordâs (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Where a C21i <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> NOP is used to enter the goods an authorisation for Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) must be held. <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) may not be used to both enter and remove the goods from the customs warehousing procedure.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code should only be used to suspend the application of customs formalities relating to the release of goods to free circulation following their re-importation from a third country or Terrority with which the EU has formed a customs union,</p>

<p>For example: Canned milk from Lithuania returned from Russia, after previously being exported to Russia, and is put in the customs warehouse. This is undertaken while waiting for necessary documents proving that the goods have not benefited from measures laid down under the common agricultural policy, and Article 204 of the <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> should not be applicable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entry under this procedure code is an undertaking by the importer/agent to pay to the Commissioners of HMRC immediately on demand any duties or other charges due in respect of the goods in question if the conditions of the relief arenât met.</li>
  <li>Procedure Codes on a single Customs declaration must all be in the same declaration category e.g. <abbr title="Special procedure: storage (customs warehousing)">H2</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Agents must have prior written approval from the authorisation holder to enter goods to customs warehousing on their behalf and ensure a copy of the declaration is returned to the holder.</li>
  <li>Entry under this Customs Procedure is a declaration that:
    <ul>
      <li>The goods are eligible for warehousing.</li>
      <li>The goods will be entered to the warehouse stated in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) without delay and in the same state and condition as at importation.</li>
      <li>Any additional security which may be needed will be provided.</li>
      <li>All other conditions and requirements associated with entry of the goods to the customs warehouse procedure will be met.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All items on the customs declaration must be entered to the same warehouse and have the requested procedure code of 71 (as the first and second digit) in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 (Procedure Code).</li>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main UK Trade Tariff, <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Volume 3 Import Declaration Completion Guide. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Re-importation of goods temporarily exported, under the Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure, to a Customs Warehouse (Articles 240, 259 and 262 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) for goods not covered by Procedure Code 7121.</p>

<p>This procedure covers goods reimported after process, adaptation, reworking or making up outside the Union, (other than under the procedures referred to under code 7121). This code covers the following situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The simultaneous application to textile products of the outward processing procedure and the economic outward processing procedure (Regulation (EC) No. 3036/94).</li>
  <li>Temporary export of goods from the Union for repair, processing, adaptation, making up or re-working where no customs duties will be due at re-importation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim suspension from any customs duties and other charges on goods re-imported under the outward processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure with simultaneous entry to a customs warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) for goods not covered by Procedure Code 7121 (Articles 240, 259 and 262 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>A Customs Warehousing (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure. See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>A Customs Comprehensive Guarantee (<abbr title="Customs Comprehensive Guarantee">CCG</abbr>) is required to be authorised for Customs Warehousing (Articles 95 and 195 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>An <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation, valid at the time of export, is needed to use this customs procedure, unless Additional Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) B53 or B54 was used on the previous export declaration, and B06 is declared on this re-import declaration to signify âVAT onlyâ relief is being applied.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation, where required, may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the person who originally exported the goods under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Goods liable to customs duty and/or other charges, may be entered to an approved customs warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) in order to suspend the payment of any customs duty or charges.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure and the duty calculations to be applied to the goods must be provided to the depositor for use on the goods subsequent release to free circulation.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were exported under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>, unless the declaration is for âVAT onlyâ relief (see Conditions above).</p>

<p>Use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation for a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) being held for the premises declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse).</p>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, in order to suspend the import duties and other charges.</p>

<p>Goods can only be entered to <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> where the <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> is specifically authorised to receive them.</p>

<p>Where the Additional Declaration Type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C or F, authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Additional declaration types (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2): C, F or Y cannot be used where Authorisation by Customs Declaration is being claimed. AI code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with codes A and D in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<p>Enter code: IM or CO.</p>

<p>For goods released to free circulation that have Customs Union status (for example, they originate in a Special Fiscal Territory, or were sent from a Territory that forms part of a customs union with the EU), the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should reflect the customs status of the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the goods have Customs Union status, then the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should be completed with code âCOâ. Code F15 must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 (Additional Procedure Code).</li>
  <li>If you are unable to provide evidence of Customs Union status at the time of entry to the customs warehouse, then the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should be completed with code âIMâ.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2):</h3>

<p>The following codes may be entered for this Procedure Code: A, C, D or F.</p>

<p>The obligation to lodge a supplementary declaration shall be waived where the goods are placed under a customs warehousing procedure (Article 167 (2)(a) EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)). There is therefore no requirement to submit a supplementary declaration using the Additional Declaration Type Y for this Procedure Code.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Where âVAT onlyâ relief will be applied for on the subsequent declaration to release goods to home use and free circulation, with use of Additional Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) B06, a prior authorisation for <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> is not required. However, to benefit from this relief Additional Procedure Code B53 or B54 must have also been entered on the previous export declaration. In addition, the export declaration must have been made under the appropriate export Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10) in the â22xxâ series.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entry under this procedure code is an undertaking by the importer/agent to pay to the Commissioners of HMRC immediately on demand any duties or other charges due in respect of the goods in question if the conditions of the relief are not met.</li>
  <li>Procedure Codes on a single Customs declaration must all be in the same declaration category e.g. <abbr title="Special procedure: storage (customs warehousing)">H2</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Agents must have prior written approval from the authorisation holder to enter goods to customs warehousing on their behalf and ensure a copy of the declaration is returned to the holder.</li>
  <li>Entry under this Customs Procedure is a declaration that:
    <ul>
      <li>The goods are eligible for warehousing.</li>
      <li>The goods are eligible to claim outward processing relief on their eventual removal from the customs warehouse.</li>
      <li>The goods will be entered to the warehouse stated in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) without delay and in the same state and condition as at importation.</li>
      <li>Any additional security which may be needed will be provided.</li>
      <li>All other conditions and requirements associated with entry of the goods to the customs warehouse procedure will be met.</li>
      <li>All other conditions and requirements associated with claiming outward processing relief will be met on their eventual removal from the customs warehouse.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All items on the customs declaration must be entered to the same warehouse and have the requested procedure code of 71 (as the first and second digit) in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 (Procedure Code).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional documents needed:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A copy of the export entry and/or a copy of the departure message, clearly showing the MRN is needed.</li>
  <li>Form INF2 is available to support claim to outward processing.</li>
  <li>A C&amp;E1154 has been provided to the depositor to use as evidence the duty calculations used on the eventual removal of the goods from the customs warehouse.</li>

  <li>Evidence of repair costs where applicable.</li>
  <li>Copy of warranty document or other evidence, where applicable if any repair is free of charge.</li>
  <li>Where OPT requirements are met, a DIT import licence is not needed for the processed goods on their eventual removal from the customs warehouse.</li>
  <li>If the OPT requirements are not met, the processed goods may only be released from the warehouse under the authority of a DIT licence.</li>
  <li>If the exported goods are imported into the UK without having been processed they may need a DIT import licence on their eventual removal from the customs warehouse unless they are EU origin goods.</li>
  <li>Documentary proof of origin (DPO) will be needed for certain goods falling within Chapters 51 to 63 of the UK Trade Tariff. The appropriate document code for the DPO is required in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes)</li>
  <li>Where the <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation was granted at the time of export under the Authorisation by Customs Declaration a copy of the authorisation letter issued by NIRU must be provided to Customs (on request) unless the MRN details of the export declaration have been declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 (Previous Documents).</li>

No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) for goods being re-imported in an unaltered state following their  temporary export to a third country.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to register a claim to relief under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> (on the goods subsequent removal to free circulation) with simultaneous release to a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) for goods re-imported in an unaltered state following their temporary export to a third country (Article 203 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>A Customs Comprehensive Guarantee (<abbr title="Customs Comprehensive Guarantee">CCG</abbr>) is required to be authorised for Customs Warehousing (Articles 95 and 195 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Goods liable to customs duty and/or other charges, may be entered to an approved customs warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) in order to suspend the payment of any customs duty or charges.</p>

<p>Goods must return in an un-altered state, to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted). A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods that will increase the value or upgrade the specification.</p>

<p>Please see Notice 236 for additional conditions for eligibility for Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>).</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> must be available on their subsequent release from the customs warehouse to free circulation.</p>

<p>Goods must not have been exported for the purpose of repair or process.</p>

<p>Use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation for a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) being held for the premises declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse).</p>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, in order to suspend the import duties and other charges.</p>

<p>Goods can only be entered to <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> where the <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> is specifically authorised to receive them.</p>

<p>Where the Additional Declaration Type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J or K authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarantâs Recordâs (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Where the INF document codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 are declared, Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) may not be used.</p>

<p>Where a C21i <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> NOP is used to enter the goods an authorisation for Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) must be held.</p>

<p><abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) may not be used to both enter and remove the goods from the customs warehousing procedure. Declarantâs intending to use <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> to remove the goods from the warehouse at a later date should use an alternative method to enter them using this Procedure Code.</p>

<h3>Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1):</h3>

<p>Enter code: IM or CO</p>

<p>For goods released to a customs warehouse that have Customs Union status (for example, they originate in a Special Fiscal Territory, or were sent from a Territory that forms part of a customs union with the EU), the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should reflect the customs status of the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the goods have Customs Union status, then the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should be completed with code âCOâ. Code F15 must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 (Additional Procedure Code).</li>
  <li>If you are unable to provide evidence of Customs Union status at the time of entry to the customs warehouse, then the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should be completed with code âIMâ.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2):</h3>

<p>The following codes may be entered for this Procedure Code: A, C, D, F, J or K.</p>

<p>The obligation to lodge a supplementary declaration shall be waived where the goods are placed under a customs warehousing procedure (Article 167 (2)(a) EU Reg.

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main UK Trade Tariff, <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Volume 3 Import Declaration Completion Guide. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release to a Customs Warehouse (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) where the goods have been previously entered to inward processing (Article 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim a suspension from customs duties and other charges for goods entered to a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) which were previously entered to inward processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>).</p>

<p>A Customs Warehousing (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure. See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>A Customs Comprehensive Guarantee (<abbr title="Customs Comprehensive Guarantee">CCG</abbr>) is required to be authorised for Customs Warehousing (Articles 95 and 195 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>An Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Goods liable to customs duty and/or other charges, may be entered to an approved customs warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) in order to suspend the payment of any customs duty or charges.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) procedure and the duty calculations to be applied to the goods must be provided to the depositor for use on the goods subsequent release to free circulation.</p>

<p>Use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation for a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) being held for the premises declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse).</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, in order to suspend the import duties and other charges.</p>

<p>Goods can only be entered to <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> where the <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> is specifically authorised to receive them.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) may not be used to both enter and remove the goods from the customs warehousing procedure. Declarantâs intending to use <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> to remove the goods from the warehouse at a later date should use a standard declaration (Additional Declaration Type A) to enter the goods to the customs warehouse.</p>

<p>Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) may only be used to enter the goods to this procedure where the conditions below for the supplementary declaration waiver are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A full inward processing authorisation was held at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</li>
  <li>The obligation to lodge a supplementary declaration shall be waived where the goods are placed under a customs warehousing procedure (Article 167 (2)(a) EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</li>
  <li>The obligation to lodge a supplementary declaration under <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> shall also be waived for goods for which a special procedure (other than transit) has been discharged by placing them under a subsequent special procedure other than transit, provided that all of the following conditions are fulfilled (Article 183 (a) â (c) EU Reg. No 2015/2446):<br>
(a) the holder of the authorisation of the first and subsequent special procedure is the same person;<br>
(b) the customs declaration for the first special procedure was lodged in the standard form, or the declarant has lodged a supplementary declaration in accordance with the first sub-paragraph of Article 167(1) of the Code in respect of the first special procedure;<br>
(c) the first special procedure is discharged by the placement of goods under a subsequent special procedure other than End-Use or Inward Processing, following the lodging of a customs declaration in the form of an Entry In the Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</li>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim a suspension from customs duties and other charges for goods entered to a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>), which were previously entered to temporary admission (<abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>).</p>

<p>A Customs Warehousing (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure.  See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>A Customs Comprehensive Guarantee (<abbr title="Customs Comprehensive Guarantee">CCG</abbr>) is required to be authorised for Customs Warehousing (Articles 95 and 195 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>A Temporary Admission (<abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Goods liable to customs duty and/or other charges, may be entered to an approved Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) in order to suspend the payment of any customs duty or charges.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Temporary Admission (<abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>) procedure must be provided to the depositor for use on the goods subsequent release to free circulation.</p>

<p>Use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation for a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) being held for the premises declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse).</p>

<p>The goods must be entered to an approved <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> premises, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) of the declaration, in order to suspend the import duties and other charges.</p>

<p>Goods can only be entered to <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> where the <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr> is specifically authorised to receive them.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) may not be used to both enter and remove the goods from the customs warehousing procedure. Declarantâs intending to use <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> to remove the goods from the warehouse at a later date should use a standard declaration (Additional Declaration Type A) to enter the goods to the customs warehouse.</p>

<p>Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) may only be used to enter the goods to this procedure where the conditions below for the supplementary declaration waiver are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A full Temporary Admission authorisation was held at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>.</li>
  <li>The obligation to lodge a supplementary declaration shall be waived where the goods are placed under a customs warehousing procedure (Article 167 (2)(a) EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</li>
  <li>The obligation to lodge a supplementary declaration under <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> shall also be waived for goods for which a special procedure (other than transit) has been discharged by placing them under a subsequent special procedure other than transit, provided that all of the following conditions are fulfilled (Article 183 (a) â (c) EU Reg. No 2015/2446):<br>
(a) the holder of the authorisation of the first and subsequent special procedure is the same person;<br>
(b) the customs declaration for the first special procedure was lodged in the standard form, or the declarant has lodged a supplementary declaration in accordance with the first sub-paragraph of Article 167(1) of the Code in respect of the first special procedure;<br>
(c) the first special procedure is discharged by the placement of goods under a subsequent special procedure other than End-Use or Inward Processing, following the lodging of a customs declaration in the form of an Entry In the Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</li>
