<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 53-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Imports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>5300<br>5351<br>5353<br>5354<br>5371<br>5378</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The importer (declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/15 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16) must be the authorisation holder for Temporary Admission (<abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>). The authorisation holder must also be the user of the goods unless an exemption is allowed for the specific Additional Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11). This will be indicated by the inclusion of a GEN Additional Information (<abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr>) Statement Code in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 (Additional Information). The appropriate GEN Code must be declared on the declaration according to the type of authorisation held (full or Authorisation by Customs Declaration).</p>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">5300: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Entry of goods to Temporary Admission (<abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>) (Article 250 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)), where the goods have not been subject to any previous procedure.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim a full or partial suspension from customs duty (and where applicable excise duty and VAT) for goods entered to <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>, where the goods have not been subject to any previous procedure.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr> authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Codes used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr> procedure must be held.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held for <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J, K, Y or Z, authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Additional declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2): C, F, J, K, Y or Z cannot be used where Authorisation by Customs Declaration is being claimed on this declaration. <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with code A or D in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2.</p>

<p><abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr> and <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be claimed where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<h3>Declaration category:</h3>

<p><abbr title="Special procedure: specific use (temporary admission)">H3</abbr>, <abbr title="Import simplified declaration C&amp;F (with regular use)">I1 C&amp;F</abbr> or C21i <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> NOP</p>

<h3>Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1):</h3>

<p>Enter code: IM or CO.</p>

<p>For goods released to <abbr title="temporary admission">TA</abbr> that have Customs Union status (for example, they originate in a Special Fiscal Territory, or were sent from a Territory that forms part of a customs union with the EU), the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should reflect the customs status of the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the goods have Customs Union status, then the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should be completed with code âCOâ. Code F15 must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 (Additional Procedure Code).</li>
  <li>If the goods do not have Customs Union status, then the declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/1) should be completed with code âIMâ.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2):</h3>

<p>The following codes may be used for this Procedure Code: A, C, D, F, J, K, Y or Z</p>

<h3>Simplified Declaration/Previous Document (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1):</h3>

<p>The list below details the Previous Document reference types to be used in specific circumstances for this Procedure Code.
