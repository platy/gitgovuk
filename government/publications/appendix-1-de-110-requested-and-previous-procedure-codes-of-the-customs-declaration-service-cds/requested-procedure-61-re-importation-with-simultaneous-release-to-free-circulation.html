<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 61-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Imports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>6110<br>
6111<br>
6121<br>
6122<br>
6123<br>
6131<br></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2>Declarations for goods removed from a customs warehouse</h2>

<p>A single customs declaration may not include warehouse and non-warehouse removals.</p>

<h2><span class="number">6110: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release of goods from a customs warehouse for free circulation, after re-import in an unaltered state, now claiming <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> upon payment of any customs duties and other charges, where the goods were previously declared for permanent export to a third country (<abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>, Article 203 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), Customs warehouse (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>))</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> with simultaneous release for free circulation of goods re-imported in an unaltered state, where the goods were previously declared for permanent export whether or not being removed from a customs warehouse.(Articles 203 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) Customs Warehouse (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Any customs duties or other charges previously refunded at export must be repaid prior to the release of the goods.</p>

<p>Any customs duties not relieved under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>Evidence must be available to demonstrate the Union status of the goods at their original export. The MRN of the export declaration or customs clearance request must be declared as a previous document in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 using previous document code MRN.</p>

<p>Where alternative evidence is provided in lieu of an export declaration/ C21e MRN, the evidence used must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a reference number declared against code ZZZ in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1</li>

<p>The MRN of this declaration must be provided to the warehousekeeper for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a customs procedure.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Codes used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> must be held.</p>

<p>When a Customs Warehouse identification number is declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 all items on the declaration must be removed from that warehouse. No non-warehoused goods may be declared on the same declaration.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J, K, Y or Z, authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Where the INF document codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 are declared, <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> may not be used.</p>

<p><abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> with simultaneous release for free circulation of <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> equivalence goods re-imported in an unaltered state, where the <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> equivalence goods were previously declared for permanent export whether or not being removed from a customs warehouse (Articles 203, 223(2)(c) and 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) Customs Warehouse (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>A full, <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> authorisation, valid at the time the equivalent goods were exported under <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Any customs duties or other charges previously refunded at export must be repaid prior to the release of the goods.</p>

<p>Any customs duties not relieved under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure. The revenue calculations will be based on the exported <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> equivalent goods.</p>

<p>Evidence must be available to demonstrate the Union status of the goods at their original export.  Use of this procedure code is dependent on the prior export of equivalent goods having taken place.</p>

<p>The MRN of the prior export declaration must be included as a previous document reference in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1.</p>

<p>The equivalent goods must return in an un-altered state, to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted).</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods that will increase the value or upgrade the specification.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for VAT relief at re-import, the legal declarant at export and re-import must be the same entity (the Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number or named person shown in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/2 at export and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/15 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16 at import must be the same).</p>

No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), Customs warehouse (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief, where the goods are being re-imported following temporary export under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> whether or not being removed from a customs warehouse (Articles 259 â 262 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) Customs warehouse (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Any customs duties not relieved under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation, valid at the time of export, is needed to use this customs procedure.  This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the person who originally exported the goods under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>VAT relief cannot be claimed if the goods were sold while outside the European Union.
See <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> conditions for use detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Where goods are being released from a customs warehouse with a simultaneous claim to <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, 2/7 and 3/39 should be completed with the relevant customs warehouse details.</p>

<p>The MRN of this declaration must be provided to the warehousekeeper for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a customs procedure.</p>

<p>Where goods are being released from a customs warehouse, a Customs Warehousing (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Codes used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Where goods are being released to <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> from a customs warehouse, the use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation being held for <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>.</p>

<p>When a Customs Warehouse identification number is declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 all items on the declaration must be removed from that warehouse. No non-warehoused goods may be declared on the same declaration. Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> procedure must be held. A duty calculation worksheet to verify any duty override calculations will be required (see <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 Document Codes).</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were exported under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Goods temporarily exported for processing under VAT only <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 B53 or B54 at export) may not be re-imported using this Procedure Code</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F or Y authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Additional declaration types (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2): C, F or Y cannot be used where Authorisation by Customs Declaration was claimed at export.  <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with codes A and D in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 on this declaration.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibition or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<p>Where âVAT onlyâ relief is being applied for on the declaration, with use of Additional Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) B06, a prior authorisation for <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> is not required. However, to benefit from this relief Additional Procedure Code B53 or B54 must have also been entered on the previous export declaration. In addition, the export declaration must have been made under the appropriate export Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10) in the â22xxâ series.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entry under this procedure code is an undertaking by the importer/agent to pay to the Commissioners of HMRC immediately on demand any duties or other charges due in respect of the goods in question if the conditions of the relief arenât met.</li>
  <li>Procedure Codes on a Customs declaration must all be in the same declaration category e.g. <abbr title="Declaration for release for free circulation and special procedure: specific use (end use)">H1</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Agents must have prior written approval from the authorisation holder to enter goods to <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> on their behalf and ensure a copy of the declaration is returned to the holder.</li>
  <li>Entry under this Procedure Code is a declaration that:
    <ul>
      <li>The goods are eligible to claim <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> relief.</li>
      <li>Any additional security which may be needed will be provided.</li>
      <li>All other conditions and requirements associated with claiming <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> relief will be met.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where goods are removed from a customs warehouse, entry under this Procedure Code is a declaration that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The goods are eligible for removal from warehousing.</li>
  <li>The goods will be removed from the warehouse stated in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (identification of warehouse) without delay and in the same state and conditions as declared.</li>
  <li>Any additional security which may be needed will be provided.</li>
  <li>Any duties and VAT due must be accounted for unless otherwise suspended.</li>
  <li>All other conditions and requirements associated with removal from the customs warehouse procedure will be met.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional documents needed:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A copy of the export entry and/or a copy of the departure message, clearly showing the MRN is needed.</li>
  <li>Where delivery is needed before production of the certificate of posting or details of the previous export entry have not been entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 (Previous Documents), security for potential charges on the full value must be provided by deposit or guarantee.</li>
  <li>Form INF 2 is available to support claim to <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</li>

  <li>Documentary evidence of the identity and value of the temporary exported goods.</li>
  <li>Evidence of repair costs where applicable.</li>
  <li>Copy of warranty document or other evidence, where applicable if any repair is free of charge.</li>
  <li>Where OPT requirements are met, a DIT import licence is not needed for the processed goods.</li>
  <li>If the OPT requirements are not met, the processed goods may only be imported under the authority of a DIT licence.</li>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation of re-imported Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) compensating products returning in an unaltered state simultaneously claiming Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>, Articles 203, 223(2)(c) and 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) upon payment of any customs duties and other charges, where the <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> compensating products were previously declared for re-export to a third country.</p>

<p>Release of <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> compensating products from a customs warehouse for free circulation, after re-import in an unaltered state, now claiming <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> upon payment of any customs duties and other charges, where the goods were previously declared for re-export to a third country (<abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>, Articles 203, 223(2)(c) and 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), Customs warehouse (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> with simultaneous release for free circulation of <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> compensating products re-imported in an unaltered state, where the <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> compensating products were previously declared for re-export whether or not being removed from a customs warehouse (Articles 203, 223(2)(c) and 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>An <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> authorisation, valid at the time the compensating products were exported, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration). See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Any customs duties or other charges previously refunded at export must be repaid prior to the release of the goods.</p>

<p>Any customs duties not relieved under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure. The revenue calculations will be based on the re-exported <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> compensating products.</p>

<p>Evidence must be available to demonstrate the Union status of the goods at their original export.  Use of this procedure code is dependent on the prior export of compensating products having taken place. The MRN of the prior export declaration must be included as a previous document reference in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1.</p>

<p>The compensating products must return in an un-altered state, to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted).</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods that will increase the value or upgrade the specification.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for VAT relief at re-import, the legal declarant at re-export and re-import must be the same entity (the Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number or named person shown in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/2 at re-export and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/15 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16 at import must be the same).</p>

<p>VAT relief cannot be claimed if the goods were sold while outside the European Union unless the specific conditions in Notice 236 are met.</p>

<p>Please see Notice 236 for additional conditions for eligibility for <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where goods are being released from a customs warehouse with a simultaneous claim to <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, 2/7 and  3/397 should be completed with the relevant customs warehouse details.</p>

<p>The MRN of this declaration must be provided to the warehousekeeper for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a customs procedure.</p>

<p>Where goods are being released from a customs warehouse, a Customs Warehousing (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Codes used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Where goods are being released from a customs warehouse, the use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation being held for <abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>.</p>

<p>When a Customs Warehouse identification number is declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 all items on the declaration must be removed from that warehouse. No non-warehoused goods may be declared on the same declaration.</p>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> must be held.</p>

<p>Goods must not have been exported for the purpose of repair or process.</p>

<p>Any revenue re-claimed at export must be re-paid at import (for example, VAT zero-rated for export must be paid at re-import).</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held for <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> at the time the compensating products were exported.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J, K, Y or Z authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Where the INF document codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 are declared, <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> may not be used.</p>

<p><abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p><abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> may not be used to release the goods to this procedure code where it was previously used to enter the goods to the Customs Warehouse</p>
