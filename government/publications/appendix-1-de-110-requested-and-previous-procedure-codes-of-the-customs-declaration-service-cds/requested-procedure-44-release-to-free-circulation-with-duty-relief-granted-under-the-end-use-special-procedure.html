<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 44-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Imports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>4400:<br>
4421:<br>
4422:<br>
4451:<br>
4453:<br>
4454:<br>
4471:<br>
4478:<br></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main UK Trade Tariff, <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Volume 3 Import Declaration Completion Guide.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes:</h2>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes contain different instruction from the main Declaration Completion Guide or other Appendices, the completion instructions in Appendix 1 take precedence Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">4400: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main UK Trade Tariff, <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Volume 3 Import Declaration Completion Guide. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation and home use of goods simultaneously claiming customs duty and (where applicable) VAT relief granted under End Use (Article 254, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)), where the goods have not been subject to any previous procedure.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under end use with simultaneous release for free circulation and home use.</p>

<p>Any customs duties not relieved under end use, must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>An end use authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under end use must be held.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J, K, Y or Z, authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarantâs Record (<abbr title="Entry in the Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>Additional declaration types (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2): C, F, J, K, Y or Z cannot be used where Authorisation by Customs Declaration is being claimed.  AI code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with codes A and D in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2.</p>

<p><abbr title="Entry in the Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr> cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>For Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation), the annual usage allowed is 3 per calendar year. Each individual transaction claiming the Authorisation by Customs Declaration is subject to a goods item value limit (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14) of Â£500,000.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be claimed where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)), where the goods have been previously entered to inward processing (Article 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under end use with simultaneous release for free circulation and home use for goods which were previously entered to inward processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>).</p>

<p>Any customs duties not relieved under end use, must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>An end use authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>An Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under end use must be held.</p>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) procedure must be held.  A duty calculation worksheet to verify any duty override calculations will be required (see <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 Document Codes).</p>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation and home use of goods simultaneously claiming customs duty and (where applicable) VAT relief granted under End Use (Article 254, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)), where the goods are being released from a Customs Warehouse (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under end use with simultaneous release for free circulation and home use for goods which are being released from a Customs Warehouse (<abbr title="customs warehouse">CW</abbr>).</p>

<p>An end use authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>A Free Zone (<abbr title="free zone">FZ</abbr>) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>The MRN of this declaration must be provided to the Free Zone Operator for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a customs procedure.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under end use must be held.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held for end use.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation being held for <abbr title="free zone">FZ</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C or Y authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedures">SDP</abbr>) must also be held.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Recordâs (<abbr title="Entry in the Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<p>Additional declaration types (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2): C or Y cannot be used where Authorisation by Customs Declaration is being claimed on this declaration. AI code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with code A in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2.</p>

<p>For end use Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation) the annual usage allowed is 3 per calendar year. Each individual transaction claiming end use  Authorisation by Customs Declaration is subject to a goods item value limit (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14) of Â£500,000. Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be claimed where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>
