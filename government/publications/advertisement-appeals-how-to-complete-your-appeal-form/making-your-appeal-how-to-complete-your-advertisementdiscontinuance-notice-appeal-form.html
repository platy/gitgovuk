<p>This guide shows you how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an account</li>
  <li>Complete your form</li>
  <li>Submit your form</li>
  <li>Contact us</li>
  <li>Troubleshoot problems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before you start</h2>

<p>Before you make your appeal, you should enter into discussions with the local planning authority (LPA). If you think that making changes to your proposal could resolve the LPA’s reasons for refusal, you should discuss these with the LPA rather than appealing to us. A further application to the LPA may be your best route.</p>

<p>You should make your appeal only when all else has failed.</p>

<h3>System Availability</h3>

<p>Our online facilities will usually be available 24 hours a day. We will sometimes need to take the system out of service for a while to implement upgrades. Wherever possible, we will do this outside of usual office hours.</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>Before you start, you should ensure that you have the following system requirements -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adobe Acrobat (Version 9 or higher recommended);</li>
  <li>an internet browser (Internet Explorer/Chrome/Firefox recommended);</li>
  <li>an email account.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>You need to create an account with us in order to make an appeal or make representations on an appeal. Registering will enable you to access our full range of electronic services, including a personal homepage.</p>

</div>

<h3>Your account</h3>

<h4>Personal homepage</h4>

<p>From this page you are able to –</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a new appeal;</li>
  <li>view your submitted appeal forms through ‘My cases’. These will not be editable as they have already been submitted to us. You will have been emailed a PDF version of any appeal form you have submitted;</li>
  <li>search for a case using either the quick search facility (using the 7 digit case reference number) or, alternatively, you can search using other criteria (such as site address) with our advanced search;</li>
  <li>access any of your appeals or representations which you are still working on via the ‘Awaiting submissions’ facility. Please note that any appeals or representations which are still awaiting submission after 180 days will be automatically deleted;</li>
  <li>view submitted representations through ‘My representations’. This will include any representations you have submitted for your own case(s) and any representations which you may have submitted for other cases which you are interested in (for example, as an interested party). These will not be editable as they have already been submitted to us. You will have been emailed a PDF version of the form upon submission;</li>
  <li>watch any cases which are of interest to you. Once you have found a case which you want to follow, you can click the ‘Watch case’ button on the Case Summary screen and the case will then be added to your ‘Watched cases’ list. If at any time you want to remove the case from your list, simply click the ‘Stop watching’ button on the Case Summary screen or click the red ‘x’ button on your homepage and the case will be removed from your list.</li>
</ul>

<h4>My Details</h4>

<p>This is where all the details you entered when creating your account are held. If at any time your details change, you should make amendments to them through this page, but please note you cannot change your name once your account has been created. It is your responsibility to ensure that your details are kept up to date.</p>

<p>If you make a change to your address details, telephone number or fax number then these details will be updated instantly on your account. If you change your email address, you will be sent an email confirming this change and asking you to verify the new email address. Once verified, your account will be updated.</p>

<p>You can change your password using the ‘Change Password’ button. You will be sent an email confirming that a change has been made. You will then need to log into your account again, using your new password.</p>

<h2>Making your appeal</h2>

<h3>Deadlines</h3>

<p>The LPA should decide your application for advertisement consent within 8 weeks of the date it accepted it as valid. 
You <strong>must</strong> send your appeal and essential supporting documents to us <strong>and</strong> to the LPA so that they are received:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within 8 weeks of the date you received the LPA’s decision notice; or</li>
  <li>for non-determination (‘failure’) appeals, within 8 weeks of the date by which the LPA should have decided the application. If you have agreed with the LPA, in writing, a period longer than the 8 weeks, but it has failed to decide your application within that period we must receive your appeal within 8 weeks of the end of that extended period; or</li>
  <li>if the LPA has sent you a discontinuance notice, before the date that the notice will come into effect. This date is given in the notice.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If we do not receive your appeal and documents within the time limit, we will not accept your appeal.</strong></p>

<h3>Who can appeal?</h3>

<p>Only the person who made the application can make an appeal. For appeals against a discontinuance notice only people with an interest in the site can make an appeal.</p>

<h3>Openness and transparency</h3>

<p>Hearings are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people. Provided that it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media. Inspectors will advise people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, they should contact us and the local planning authority in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h3>Has the land/site owner’s consent been obtained?</h3>

<p>You may be are aware that Schedule 2, part 1 of the Regulations, states that “no advertisement is to be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission”. Therefore, even if the Inspector were to allow the appeal and grant permission for the erection of the advertisement(s), the advertisement(s) could not lawfully be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site. If that is the case, there would be little point in proceeding with an appeal.</p>

<h2>Guidelines for submitting documents</h2>

<h3>Acceptable file formats</h3>

<p>PDF .pdf</p>

<p>Microsoft Word .doc or.docx</p>

<p>TIF .tif or .tiff</p>

<p>JPEG .jpg or .jpeg</p>

<p>PNG .png</p>

<p>ZIP .zip</p>

<h3>File sizes</h3>

<p>Documents submitted may be no bigger than 15mb each. It is your responsibility to keep your documents to a manageable size.</p>

<p>If you have documents that are larger than this, you can try the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Break long documents into several files, but note the document naming conventions below.</li>
  <li>Try and use black and white wherever possible (unless submitting photographs).</li>
  <li>If submitting images, your software may have file/image compression facilities to make them smaller.</li>
  <li>Note scanned documents are usually bigger than non-scanned versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Provided you are using the acceptable file types above, you can use ZIP files to compress documents.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Remove any document security and enable macros if necessary. Documents should not be password protected, they should not be formatted as ‘read only’ and printing should be enabled.</p>

<h3>Copyright</h3>

<p>Ensure you have the owner’s permission and have paid any copyright licence fee before sending in documents.</p>

<h3>File names</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure all documents have descriptive names, including the type of document you are sending, eg ‘Proposed plan 1 March 2014’.</li>
  <li>Number appendices and submit them as separate documents. Ensure the first page includes the appendix number. Name them to indicate what they form part of, and their sequence eg ‘Appeal statement Appendix 2 Traffic census.’</li>
  <li>Use ‘Part 1’, ‘Part 2’ etc in the file name if you have split up a large document eg ‘Appeal statement in Appendix 1 Environmental Assessment Part 1 of 3’.</li>
  <li>Include the required paper size in the document name for plans and drawings eg ‘Proposed plan A3 size 1 March 2014’.</li>
  <li>Include scale bar(s) on all plans and drawings.</li>
  <li>Do not use a colon ‘:’ in any file names.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scanning</h3>

<p>Ensure documents are complete and legible and avoid scanning more than one document into a single file. Use black and white unless colour is essential.</p>

<h3>Ordnance Survey</h3>

<p>People may only scan an Ordnance Survey map if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an annual licence to make copies; or</li>
  <li>Have purchased a bulk copy arrangement; or</li>
  <li>Are using a local planning authority supplied map under the ‘map return scheme’ (for which a fee is normally payable at the local planning authority’s discretion), or</li>
  <li>Have purchased the site-specific map for the purposes of attaching to a planning application, appeal or representation.</li>
</ul>

<p>More information on map licensing is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/support/licensing.html" rel="external">Ordnance Survey website</a>.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>Send pictures, photographs, plans, maps or drawings as individual files. Avoid the use of bitmap images as they are very large.</p>

<h3>Hyperlinks</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You should not use hyperlinks within documents you send to us. Instead, you should download such documents yourself and attach them separately.</li>
  <li>You should not use hyperlinks to a website page containing multiple documents or links.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sending emails</h3>

<p>If you send anything by email you should get an automatic acknowledgement, provided it is sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:appeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">appeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a> or to a team email address (which can be found at the top of letters from us about the appeal). If you do not get an automatic acknowledgement, then you should contact us.</p>

<p>For any correspondence which you send to us via email, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quote the appeal reference and/or appellant’s name, site address and local planning authority name in the subject line or in the body of your email.</li>
  <li>If you are attaching more than one document, please list them in the covering email.</li>
  <li>If you are sending a series of emails, include ‘1 of 5’, ‘2 of 5’ etc in the subject line of the email, so we know how many to expect and can check with you if any appear to be missing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Formatting</h3>

<p>You should ensure that you number all pages accordingly.</p>

<h2>Application for appeal costs</h2>

<p>You and the LPA normally have to meet your own appeal expenses, whether we decide it by the written procedure or a hearing.</p>

<p>If a party does not behave reasonably they leave themselves open to costs being awarded against them. This would be on the basis that the behaviour had directly caus##ed another party to incur expenses that would not otherwise have been necessary.</p>

<p>Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also the Inspector may make an award of costs even if neither of the parties has made an application.</p>

<p>There is guidance about costs awards in the <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/appeals">Department for Communities and Local Government’s planning practice guidance</a>
It is important that you read this guidance because it explains how, when and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>The onus is on you to ensure that a properly substantiated claim for costs is made at the appropriate time. Providing notice of intent does not justify a late application for costs.</p>

<p>However if you are appealing against the LPA <strong>refusal</strong> of your application for advertisement consent you must make any cost application <strong>at the time you make your appeal</strong>.</p>

<p>There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/apply-for-an-award-of-appeal-costs-application-form">model costs application form on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Selecting the correct appeal form</h2>

<p>Once you have logged into your account, start the appeal process by clicking on the ‘Make a new appeal’ button.</p>

<h3>Enter the name of your local planning authority</h3>

<p>Here you should type in the name of your local planning authority. As you type, possible matches will be returned. You can then select the correct one from the list. Note you cannot change your local authority once you are in the appeal form.</p>

<h3>Selecting your appeal form</h3>

<p>You will be asked a series of questions about your appeal, with each answer you give determining the next question. You may need to consult your application documents, including any decision issued from your LPA.</p>

<p>If you want to make an appeal in relation to more than one application eg in relation to an application for planning permission or an application for listed building consent, you must make a separate appeal for each.</p>

<p>If you believe that you may have selected the wrong from, please select the ‘Restart’ button to begin the appeals process again</p>

<h3>Meaningful name</h3>

<p>This name will be used to identify this appeal on your personal homepage. Please use a name that clearly identifies the appeal to you, for example, the first line of the site address. This is of particular importance if you are an agent who may be dealing with multiple cases.</p>

<h2>Completing the appeal form</h2>

<p>In this guidance, we use the same section headers as within the advertisement appeal form.</p>

<h3>Appellant Details</h3>

<h4>Name</h4>

<p>Only the person who made the application can make an appeal. If you are the appellant, by responding ‘Yes’, the details registered to your account will be displayed on the form. Select ‘No’ and you will be deemed to be acting as an agent for the appellant and so you should provide the appellant’s details.</p>

<h4>Preferred contact method</h4>

<p>If you are an unrepresented appellant and you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<p>If for any reason your details have changed since you created your account, you should change them through the My Details link at the top of the page.</p>

<h3>Agent Details</h3>

<p>You do not have to employ an agent to handle your advertisement appeal. If you decide to employ an agent he or she will probably complete the appeal form for you.</p>

<p>If you have an agent we will send all of our communications to them. We will not send a copy to you. You should ensure that you keep in touch with your agent about the appeal arrangements particularly if an “access required” site visit is arranged.</p>

<h4>Preferred contact method</h4>

<p>If you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<p>If you are the agent completing the form, by selecting ‘No’ to the question ‘Are you the appellant?’ the details registered to your account will be displayed on the Agent Details section of the form.</p>

<h3>Local Planning Authority Details</h3>

<p>This information will usually be in the letter you received from the LPA confirming that your advertisement consent application was valid and on the decision notice if one was issued.</p>

<p>If the LPA did not validate or register your application, you should send us any relevant correspondence it sent to you.</p>

<p>Alternatively, this information would usually have been provided when the LPA served the discontinuance notice.</p>

<p>The date the discontinuance notice was served and the effective date will both be on the discontinuance notice.</p>

<p>The name of the LPA will have transferred through to the form from when you entered it at the start of the process. If you need to change the LPA you will need to restart from your homepage.</p>

<h3>Appeal Site Details</h3>

<p>The appeal site must be the same as the site given in the advertisement consent application or as given on the discontinuance notice.</p>

<p>If you confirm that the address of the affected land is the same as the appellant’s address then this information will transfer over from the Appellant Details section (provided you have completed the Appellant Details section before the Appeal Site Details section).</p>

<h4>Does the appeal relate to an existing property?</h4>

<p>If the address of the affected building is not the same as the appellant’s address you will be asked an additional question as to whether the appeal relates to an existing property. If it does, you can use the address finder to complete your details quickly.</p>

<h4>Health and safety at the site</h4>

<p>The site is likely to be inspected during the course of the appeal and the Inspector needs to be made aware of any potential problems. The following questions indicate the type of information we need about the appeal site such as the condition of the land or any building to be entered.</p>

<p>We take seriously our duties with regard to the health and safety of our employees and those affected by our work. Inspectors may abort the site visit if the conditions on site are unsatisfactory. Failure to provide the necessary information may therefore result in a delay to your appeal.</p>

<p>The following questions indicate the type of information we need about the appeal site, such as the condition of the land or any building to be entered. Please note that the questions do not actually feature on the appeal form. The information should be supplied within the free text field underneath the Health and Safety question.</p>

<p>1) Will the Inspector be expected to wear Personal Protection Equipment? Please give details.</p>

<p>2) Are any building works or other operations taking place on the site? If it is a workplace, is there a risk assessment in place for visitors?</p>

<p>3) Are there any animals (eg pets or livestock) within the site? If so, you <strong>must</strong> ensure that <strong>all</strong> animals (both livestock or pets) will be kept away from the area to be visited.</p>

<p>4) Is the site remote or in an area likely to have a poor mobile phone signal?</p>

<p>5) Are there any areas that require specialist equipment or training for access e.g. confined spaces or use of ladders / scaffolding? If a ladder will be used, you must explain why and give details of the heights involved and arrangements for securing the ladder.</p>

<p>6) Does the Inspector need to be aware of specific dangers within the site? This would include uneven surfaces, equipment or substances kept at the site, risk of exposure to chemicals, asbestos or radiation.</p>

<p>7) Will it be necessary to view the site from a height, e.g. roof, balcony? Are any railings or guards in place?</p>

<p>8) Are there any site specific safety arrangements in place?</p>

<p>9) Is the site accessible for persons with limited mobility?</p>

<p>10) Is there any overgrown vegetation that could restrict access to the site? If so, you will need to ensure that the site is made accessible to our Inspector and any other people accompanying him or her.</p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> also inform us of any relevant changes to the site which occur in the period leading up to the planned site visit date, hearing or inquiry.</p>

<h3>Description of Advertisement(s)</h3>

<h4>Advertisement appeals</h4>

<p>You need to provide details of the proposed advertisement. This should normally be precisely as you described it on the application form. However, if during the consideration of your application you have agreed a revised description of the advertisement with the LPA, you should use that. Please provide the documents which give details of the revision and which confirm your agreement and the LPA’s agreement to the revision.</p>

<h4>Discontinuance notice appeals</h4>

<p>You need to provide details of the existing advertisement. This will normally be as it is described in the discontinuance notice.</p>

<h3>Reason for the Appeal</h3>

<p>The reason for the appeal will already be selected as you did this at the start of the process. You will be unable to edit this section as it will be locked down.</p>

<h3>Choice of Procedure</h3>

<p>There are 2 possible procedures for the determination of an appeal: written representations or a hearing. We will decide which procedure your appeal should follow. The vast majority of advertisement and discontinuance notice appeals are likely to be most suited to the written representations procedure. Our decision will be based on the criteria which are set out in Annexe 1. We will also take into account any views you have expressed about which procedure would be most suitable for your case and the views of the LPA.</p>

<p>You should note if we decide at the initial stage that the appeal should proceed as a hearing, the appointed Inspector will also subsequently consider, whether a ‘combined procedure’ would be appropriate, such as a hearing with some elements dealt with written representations on the basis of the criteria.</p>

<p>We will keep the determined procedure, including any combined procedure, under review during the appeal and may change it at any point before a decision on the appeal is made.</p>

<h4>The written representations procedure</h4>

<p>This is the simplest, quickest and most straightforward way of making an appeal. The Inspector will consider the LPA’s reasons for refusal, or reasons for issuing the discontinuance notice, your grounds of appeal and any representations received from interested people. The Inspector will visit the site, usually unaccompanied.</p>

<p>Where the appeal is against the LPA’s refusal of an application for express advertisement consent it will follow the shorter procedure detailed in Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (Appeals) (Written Representations) (England) Regulations 2009, as amended by the Town and Country Planning (Appeals) (Written Representations Procedure and Advertisements) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 Statutory Instrument 2013/2114.</p>

<p>Appeals against the failure of the LPA to determine an application for express advertisement consent, the conditional grant of consent or the service of a discontinuance notice will follow the procedure in Part 2 of the above regulations.</p>

<h4>The hearing procedure</h4>

<p>This procedure is likely to be suited to cases which require testing of evidence or clarification through questioning in order to establish the facts. If you have chosen a hearing you should explain on the appeal form (or in a separate document if necessary) why you think a hearing is necessary.</p>

<h3>Grounds of Appeal</h3>

<p>If the local planning authority <strong>refused</strong> your application for advertisement consent and you are making an application for costs you should indicate as the first line of your grounds of appeal that you have sent your costs application, supported by a full statement of why you think an award is justified.</p>

<p>The Inspector will look at the planning merits of your proposed/existing advertisement afresh and so there is no need to give a detailed history such as discussions with LPA officers.</p>

<p>It is extremely important that you set out all your grounds of appeal when making the appeal. For appeals that follow the Part 1 written procedure there is <strong>no</strong> opportunity to add to these at a later stage. In all cases, the grounds of appeal should respond directly to the reasons for refusal set out in the LPA’s decision notice or the reasons for issuing the discontinuance notice.</p>

<p>Do not repeat the LPA’s reasons, but you should include a clear explanation of why you disagree with each of them. It is not enough to say that you do not accept them – this will not help the Inspector decide your appeal.</p>

<p>You should avoid repetition and information that does not relate to the issues involved. The grounds of appeal should be clear and concise and should not normally exceed 3,000 words.</p>

<p>Where the effect on the neighbours is a reason for refusal, with their agreement to access, you should include measurements (in metric units) of the distances between your and your neighbours’ properties, particularly the distances to any of their windows. If your neighbours do not allow you access to their property you should provide approximate measurements.</p>

<p>If you consider it essential to provide email trails to support your ground of appeal, you should consider if the final email in a trail contains the key points – so you would only need to provide that. If this is not possible cross through any repetition in related emails so that the key points can be clearly picked up.</p>

<p>You may include details of similar developments in the immediate area if you think these are relevant to what you are proposing. You should identify them on a street map and supply their addresses and, where possible, photographs of them. Where you are aware of the history of any such development you should set it out briefly in your grounds of appeal or in a separate annexe.</p>

<p>The reason(s) for refusal may refer to policies in the Development Plan and/or supplementary planning documents as found in the Local Development Framework. Do not describe any local policies in full. Simply give the number and the name of the relevant development plan or supplementary planning document and give paragraph numbers if appropriate. The LPA will provide copies of the policies to which it has referred so you do not need to.</p>

<p>If you think there are other relevant policies, not referred to in the LPA’s decision but on which you intend to rely, you should attach the relevant extracts to your appeal, indicating their status, ie whether they have been adopted by the LPA and, where appropriate, whether they have been saved by a direction of the Secretary of State and form part of the Local Development Framework.</p>

<p>There is no need to set out national policy (such as the National Planning Policy Framework) as Inspectors have these documents. However, you should refer to any paragraphs by number that you think are relevant.</p>

<h4>Supporting documentation</h4>

<p>Any supporting documentation other than that listed in Section I should be kept to a minimum and be essential and directly relevant to the appeal. Such documentation should be clearly cross-referenced in the grounds of appeal.</p>

<p>You may provide appendices to your grounds of appeal. These can include reports and information that relate directly to the LPA’s reasons and any issues that are in dispute. Appendices should be used sparingly. Do not send copies of the Delegated Officer’s Report, or the Committee Report, and other documents sent to the LPA, such as consultation responses and letters from interested people, as the LPA will provide these.</p>

<p>You may use photographs (preferably in colour) to illustrate your grounds of appeal – eg the position of the advertisement and its relationship to its neighbours. If you send photographs you must give details of where they were taken, on a map showing the viewpoints, and when and what they show. If you take photographs in public places please take reasonable care to respect the privacy of individuals whose images you may inadvertently capture.</p>

<h4>Planning conditions</h4>

<p>You should indicate if you wish to accept or can suggest a planning condition(s) that you think would mitigate the impact of the proposal.
You should look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the national planning practice guidance on the use of planning conditions:</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/appeals">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appeals</a> and</li>
  <li>Appendix A – “Suggested Models of Acceptable Conditions for Use in Appropriate Circumstances” (which is still in existence) to Circular 11/95: Use of conditions in planning permission (which has been cancelled).</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that conditions are suggested does not mean that the appeal will be allowed and planning permission granted or that, if allowed, conditions will be imposed.</p>

<h4>Failure to determine</h4>

<p>If you are appealing against the LPA’s failure to determine your application, it will be helpful to tell us why you think that permission should be granted. If possible, you should also refer to relevant policies in the development plan and/or any supplementary planning documents published by the LPA.</p>

<h3>Supporting Documents</h3>

<p>We have listed the documents currently required on the appeal form. If we do not receive all your essential appeal documents by the end of the appeal period we will not be able to proceed with it and you will lose your right to appeal. We do not ‘chase’ missing documents and so please make sure that you have sent us everything; if not your appeal will be delayed or possibly turned away.</p>

<p>Please ensure that you have listed all the plans/drawings that you are sending to us and that they include reference to the scale, orientation, and paper size. You should send us copies of <strong>all</strong> plans sent to the LPA with your application (including plans which have been superseded, you should clearly mark these “superseded”).</p>

<p>You should not send new material when you make your appeal that was not considered by the LPA as part of the advertisement consent application. Therefore, any documents sent during the appeal should be directly relevant and essential to the case and in response to the LPA’s reasons (if any). Revised proposals which seek to overcome the LPA’s reasons for refusal should normally be sent to the LPA as a new application.</p>

<p>There is limited scope to consider revised proposals at appeal stage. If you want to put forward revised proposals at the appeal stage, you should send them with the appeal documents. Late submission can cause delays and lead to a claim for costs. If you send revised plans, the Inspector will decide whether or not to consider them in line with the tests laid down by the Courts in <strong>Wheatcroft v SSE</strong> [Journal of Planning Law, 1982, P37]. These require that any amendments do not materially alter the nature of the application, and that no one who would normally have been consulted would be prejudiced by the lack of opportunity to comment on the revised plans. These tests would not normally be met by conducting informal consultation exercises.</p>

<h3>Audio/Video</h3>

<p>We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us. We cannot accept audio or video evidence, as we cannot be sure that everyone involved has exactly the same version or that they have the equipment needed to access the evidence.</p>

<p>However, you may send a written summary which you should attach.</p>

<p>If the appeal will proceed by a hearing, you may ask the Inspector at the event if they are willing to accept the audio/video evidence and allow it to be played at the hearing.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to contact the LPA to find out whether it has suitable equipment at the venue to access the evidence, or if it will allow you to use your own. The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector it will become part of the hearing/inquiry evidence and will be retained by the Inspector. You will need to have additional copies of the audio/video evidence available as if the Inspector allows it to be played these copies will be given to the main parties Our Case Officer will be able to tell you how many copies you will need to provide.</p>

<h3>Other Appeals</h3>

<p>If you have made any other related appeals which have not yet been decided on 
this site or for nearby sites please supply the reference numbers. Where practical, and depending on the relevant timescales, we may consider related cases together.</p>

<h2>Annexe 1: Criteria for determining the procedure for planning, listed buildings, enforcement, hazardous substances, advertisement and discontinuance notice appeals</h2>

<p><strong>The criteria for each procedure cannot be fully prescriptive or entirely determinative: they require judgement to be applied using common sense. More than one criterion may apply.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Written representations</strong> - written representations would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the planning issues raised or, in an enforcement appeal, the grounds of appeal, can be clearly understood from the appeal documents and a site inspection (if required - A small number of appeals do not require a site visit and can be dealt with solely on the basis of the appeal documents); or</li>
  <li>the issues are not complex and the Inspector is not likely to need to test the evidence by questioning or to clarify any other matters; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal the alleged breach, and the requirements of the notice, are clear.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hearing</strong> - a hearing would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Inspector is likely to need to test the evidence by questioning or to clarify matters (For example, where detailed evidence on housing land supply needs to be tested by questioning); or</li>
  <li>the status or personal circumstances of the appellant are at issue (For example whether in traveller appeals the definition in Annex 1 of DLUHC’s planning policy for traveller sites is met); or</li>
  <li>there is no need for evidence to be tested through formal questioning by an advocate or given on oath; or</li>
  <li>the case has generated a level of local interest such as to warrant a hearing; or</li>
  <li>it can reasonably be expected that the parties will be able to present their own cases (supported by professional witnesses if required) without the need for an advocate to represent them; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, the grounds of appeal, the alleged breach, and the requirements of the notice, are relatively straightforward.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inquiry</strong> - an inquiry would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a clearly explained need for the evidence to be tested through formal questioning by an advocate (This does not preclude an appellant representing themselves as an advocate); or</li>
  <li>the issues are complex (For example, where large amounts of highly technical data are likely to be provided in evidence); or</li>
  <li>the appeal has generated substantial local interest to warrant an inquiry as opposed to dealing with the case by a hearing; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, evidence needs to be given on oath (For example where witnesses are giving factual evidence about how long the alleged unauthorised use has been taking place); or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, the alleged breach, or the requirements of the notice, are unusual and particularly contentious.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - It is considered that the prospect of legal submissions being made is not, on its own, a reason why a case would need to be conducted by inquiry. Where a party considers that legal submissions will be required (and are considered to be complex such as to warrant being made orally), the Inspectorate requires that the matters on which submissions will be made are fully explained – including why they may require an inquiry - at the outset of the appeal or otherwise at the earliest opportunity.</p>
