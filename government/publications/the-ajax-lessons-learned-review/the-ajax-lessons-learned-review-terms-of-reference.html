<h2>To: Clive Sheldon QC</h2>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>In light of the delay to date in delivering the Armoured Cavalry programme (<abbr title="Armoured Cavalry programme">Ajax</abbr>), you are to conduct an independent focused review into the programme. You should identify lessons and make recommendations to help Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) deliver major programmes more effectively in future, with a particular focus on how <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> shares and elevates issues across the Department and the commands.</p>

<p>In order to encourage openness, evidence given during the course of the review will not be used in disciplinary proceedings unless there is evidence of gross misconduct, in which case, individuals will be subject to appropriate sanction.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>The review should examine the following areas in light of the experience with the <abbr title="Armoured Cavalry programme">Ajax</abbr> programme, identifying any lessons that can be applied more broadly across defence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how should the leadership, culture and governance in <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> (including in the armed forces and relevant arms-length bodies) relating to the delivery of future major programmes be improved to ensure timely and appropriate elevation of problems to the right levels within the department (including to ministers) and the commands</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you should focus on systemic and process issues as well as individual action and inaction. This should include looking at whether individuals are aware of how to elevate problems – informally and formally – and whether senior personnel are given appropriate training on acting upon the information received</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The review should not examine or make findings on the accuracy of any complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the existence of noise and vibration problems on armoured fighting vehicles</li>
  <li>military communication systems used in armoured fighting vehicles</li>
</ul>

<p>The review should not consider the ongoing delivery of the <abbr title="Armoured Cavalry programme">Ajax</abbr> programme. It is the responsibility of General Dynamics Land Systems-UK to deliver a vehicle that is fit for purpose and meets the contractual specification.</p>

<p>The review should seek to avoid making findings on issues which in due course may fall to be determined by other bodies, for example, contractual disputes and personal injury claims.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>Dedicated secretariat support will be provided for the review. You should familiarise yourself with key documents setting out the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s operating model and acquisition processes and evidence that informed major decision points on the programme.</p>

<h3>Schedule/Reporting</h3>

<p>You will report to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> ministers through the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Second Permanent Secretary and provide regular updates on progress. You should advise ministers of the likely duration of your review within one month of starting.</p>
