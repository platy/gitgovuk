<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Effectiveness of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> in protection against <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> transmission</h2>

<p>In September 2020, we performed a rapid literature search to investigate the effectiveness of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> in reducing the transmission of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> initially for unpaid carers. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> In May 2021 we updated this to consider people working in health and social care settings as part of a fuller paper on mitigations for residential care in the post vaccination risk landscape.  <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup> Here we update that paper to bring it up to date for December 2021 in the light of the identification of the Omicron variant. It should be noted that all literature reported below predates identification of this variant of concern. Whilst our previous searches found no direct evidence regarding the use of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> directly related to residential social care in our most recent search we did find reviews related to <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measure in residential care setting. Nonetheless because of the focus, and quality, of that work we still depend primarily on literature about the effectiveness of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> when used by healthcare workers. Our updated rapid literature search (Appendix A) reveals that studies reporting on <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> in health care workers are predominantly based in hospital settings with a focus on nurses and physicians. We have now also identified research on mask use in the general population and have drawn on the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health and Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) October 2021 review of the effectiveness of face coverings in reducing community transmission of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.  <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> In addition the living review on coronavirus infection epidemiology and risk factors in health care workers based on cross-sectional, cohort, and case series studies and first published in 2020 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 4]</a></sup> has been updated twice since we used update 8 (118 studies) in our May 2021 version of this briefing.  Update 9 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> adds 21 new studies and update 10 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> has 20 new studies. Data from these two updates are thus included herein. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link">[footnote 7]</a></sup> To date no meta-analysis of results has been undertaken because of heterogeneity of outcomes and continued methodological differences and limitations in the included studies. Update 10 presents a summary evidence table of risk factors and mitigations for <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> infection amongst healthcare workers reproduced in Appendix B.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>
<abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> Use in Healthcare Workers</h3>

<p>Up-to-date evidence on the effectiveness of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> in healthcare workers is available in the living rapid review. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">[footnote 6]</a></sup> We have searched each update for results in relation to:</p>

<p>(a) mask use;</p>

<p>(b) full use of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> compared to partial use;</p>

<p>(c) frequency and consistency of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use; and</p>

<p>(d) infection control training and education.</p>

<p>The review provides a narrative summary of findings in relation to coronavirus exposure and <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use and results are consistent across all updates. A notable finding from update 10 is that seven studies consistently found that exposure to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in a household or private setting is associated with increased risk of infection in <abbr title="healthcare workers">HCWs</abbr> (adjusted odds ratios [<abbr title="odds ratios">ORs</abbr>] range from 2.55 to 8.98 and in most studies, <strong>household or private setting exposure is a stronger risk factor than work exposure.</strong></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Masks  <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>
</h3>

<p>The living review continues to report <strong>consistent and robust evidence for the association between mask use and decreased infection risk from <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr></strong> in healthcare workers (<abbr title="odds ratios">ORs</abbr> from 0.002 to 0.71 for significant studies, or 1.7 including non-significant studies <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:9">[footnote 9]</a></sup> ). While the initial review in 2020 extrapolated from results of studies on non-<abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> specific data, the more recent updates have focused on data from studies of <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection only. Results are thus likely to be relevant to the current situation. <strong>However, all results relate to variants earlier than Omicron.</strong> Studies also suggest that <strong><abbr title="a type of respiratory mask or filtering face piece">N95</abbr> (<abbr title="filtering face piece 2">FFP2</abbr>) respirators are associated with decreased risk compared with surgical masks (<abbr title="odds ratios">ORs</abbr> in the region of 0.75 in most cases).</strong> These studies are confounded by factors such as <abbr title="a type of respiratory mask or filtering face piece">N95</abbr> being used in higher risk areas or during higher risk procedures (for example <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>).  No meta-analysis was conducted, but summary tables can be found in the update supplementary materials. The evidence remains clear for consistency of use of masks, with <strong>consistent use providing better protection than inconsistent use.</strong></p>

<p>UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health and Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) updated the review of the effectiveness of face coverings in reducing community transmission of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in October 2021 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> , drawing on evidence reviews up until 14 September 2021. The review includes 25 studies (23 observational studies, two <abbr title="randomized controlled trials">RCTs</abbr>). The report suggests that <strong>face coverings reduce the spread of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in the community,</strong> through source control, wearer protection, and universal masking, but draws no conclusions as to face coverings are more effective as source control or wearer protection. <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> evidence (medium quality) from one <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> provides direct evidence that face coverings <strong>(surgical and cloth face coverings) are effective when used as universal masking, particularly for surgical masks and for older people,</strong> and that the interventions to increase face covering use also increased social distancing. The other <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> was inconclusive, reporting a non-significant reduction in <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> infections from wearer protection using surgical masks. Relatively few participants in this study developed <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> and thus the study lacked precision. Contact tracing studies (n=8) that analysed face covering use suggest that <strong>contacts of primary cases were less likely to develop <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> if either or both wore a face covering.</strong> Further, (mostly low quality) observational studies (n=15) had mixed results for the effectiveness of face coverings. For all these observational studies confounding factors such as differences between wearers and non-wearers of masks, and mitigation measures such as hand washing and social distancing could have impacted on the results.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health and Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> conclude that the results are broadly in line with the previous review; but that addition of <abbr title="randomized controlled trials">RCTs</abbr> and substantially more individual-level observational studies increase the certainty of the results and strengthens the evidence for the effectiveness of face coverings in reducing transmission in community settings.  The authors of the large cluster <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> estimated that an increase from 0 per cent to 100 per cent of people wearing face coverings over the nose and mouth would be associated with 32 per cent decrease in symptomatic <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> seroprevalence.</p>

<p>A narrative systematic review <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10">[footnote 10]</a></sup> identified by our updated search (Appendix A) focuses on aerosol particle size, transmission in the air and filtering and barrier properties of masks and reports that factors determining mask effectiveness are filter efficiency, facemask fit and proper use. Cloth masks provide marginal protection and surgical offer 30 to 50 per cent against particles meeting aerosol definition. <abbr title="a type of respiratory mask or filtering face piece">N95</abbr> masks provide better protection but effectiveness is still dependent on fit and proper use.  Perhaps uncontroversially they conclude mask wearing “should only be considered a measure of protection rather than a complete control method”. A modelling study suggests that differences in variations in mask efficacy can be explained by differences in virus abundance in the environment. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 11]</a></sup> Most environments and contacts are in conditions of low viral abundance, and surgical masks are effective, but virus rich environments require masks with greater filtering and barrier properties and overall masks are particularly effective in combination with other preventive measures.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, findings are overall consistent with research reported to <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> on 10 September 2020 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:12" class="govuk-link">[footnote 12]</a></sup> that <abbr title="a type of respiratory mask or filtering face piece">N95</abbr> or <abbr title="filtering face piece 2">FFP2</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> mask (penetration by contaminants &lt; 0.01 per cent) is better than medical mask (penetration 44 per cent) which is better than general cloth mask (penetration 97 per cent). The latter thus may offer the wearer reassurance, but little or no real protection. A rapid review by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> (1 October 2020) of factors associated with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in care homes and interventions to prevent ingress and transmission identified only weak observational evidence for universal mask wearing in residential care as part of fuller package of interventions and identifies the need for further research on all interventions including <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> and mask use in residential care settings.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Other <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> – gloves, gowns, eye protection</h3>

<p>The living review also reports associations between use of gloves, gowns, eye protection, shoe covers, and decreased risk of transmission (29 studies included in update 10). Studies are reasonably consistent in that <strong>full <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use (gloves, mask, gown, and eye protection) was associated with decreased risk of infection compared to partial or no <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use</strong> (<abbr title="odds ratios">ORs</abbr> from 0.03 to 0.68). Some studies however find association between <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use (including glove use) and increased risks.  These findings likely relate to <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use being a marker of exposure risk, inadequate training and inconsistent use (for example findings of staff not wearing <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> in staff rooms during breaks), and methodological issues in the studies.</p>

<p>The Cochrane review (version 15 May 2020 as reported in September 2020) on <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup> with infectious diseases included 24 studies, (22 simulation studies, 14 randomised). The review evaluates which types of full-body <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>, and which donning and doffing methods, have the least risk of contamination, and which training methods increase compliance. Overall, the authors found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering larger areas of the body results in better protection. Gowns may provide better protection against contamination than aprons. <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> made of breathable material, which is associated with greater user satisfaction, was not demonstrated to be worse than water repellent material. The evidence is limited, based on small sample simulation studies. The review also highlights low-certainty evidence from one <abbr title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome">SARS</abbr>-related study and two simulation studies that more active training (video and computer simulation or face-to-face training) in <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use decreases noncompliance with donning and doffing guidelines to a greater extent than passive training (lectures only). At December 2021 there has been no update on this review since May 2020.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> report <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup> on aprons, gowns and eye protection draws on the Cochrane review as providing core evidence and concludes that aprons and gowns are suitable, but points to pros and cons during donning, use and doffing. <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> also point out the lack of evidence on the effectiveness of goggles or face shields. No evidence is identified that directly relates to residential social care settings.</p>

<p>Our updated search identified one new review of direct relevance since June 2021. This review <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:16" class="govuk-link">[footnote 16]</a></sup> assesses the utility of face shields as protection from coronavirus transmission for healthcare workers, with seven studies fulfilling their inclusion criteria. The use of a face shield alone as protection against <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> is insufficient. They conclude <strong>face shields should not be used for respiratory protection, much less replace it,</strong> and should be used simultaneously with other forms of protection including masks, other <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> and <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures. <abbr title="a type of respiratory mask or filtering face piece">N95</abbr> should be used when there is risk of aerosol. They highlight that there are no industry standards for face shields, with numerous different models on the market, requiring rigorous evaluation of both their protective and usability properties.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>
<abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> in Social Care Settings</h3>

<p>A review by Khunti et al. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17">[footnote 17]</a></sup> (August 2020) highlights that most of the guidance surrounding <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use focuses on emergency or inpatient care settings and it is often assumed that primary or community care settings (which may include social care) are at low risk in comparison. The reality is likely much more nuanced, as community care may often expose healthcare workers and those they care for to a high degree of risk through close prolonged contact (see below, <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18">[footnote 18]</a></sup> ) . The Khunti <em>et al</em> review found little direct evidence for the effectiveness of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> in primary or community care. However, indirect evidence from single-centre experimental studies supports the appropriate use of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> in community and social care settings according to <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 18]</a></sup> and <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>guidelines in order to protect against <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. The reviews discussed above on community use of masks strongly reinforces this view.</p>

<p>One study, new to the living review update 10, reports on <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use in nursing homes in the USA finding increased risk related to <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use (<abbr title="odds ratios">OR</abbr> =2.18 (1.26 to 3.80)). The authors of that study <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup> were at pains to point out the higher rates of infection in nursing home personnel in their study compared to hospital personnel (13.1 per cent, (11.5 to 14.9 per cent) compared to 3.1 per cent, (2.7 to 3.5 per cent)).  They point to the use of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> in nursing homes as being a marker of the infection risk related of where staff were working (such as on a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> unit), potentially exacerbated by staffing shortages, poor training, and artefacts related to staff workplace allocations and seropositivity from earlier infection.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Training <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>
</h3>

<p>The living review reports a consistent association across studies between infection control training and decreased infection risk, with not being trained being associated with higher risk. However only one study reports a significant relationship. The evidence is limited as risk factor studies are retrospective, with the possibility of recall bias regarding use of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>. None of the studies used an <abbr title="randomized controlled trial">RCT</abbr> design, some studies did not control for confounders, and those that did were limited in their ability to control for exposure.  <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> launched an <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> toolkit in July 2021 for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:22">[footnote 22]</a></sup>  It follows a conventional booklet format available online, but has not been formally evaluated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>Behaviour</h3>

<p>Behavioural measures to support proper <strong>doffing and donning</strong> and general infection control measures should be promoted in tandem with <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23">[footnote 23]</a></sup> Research from healthcare settings emphasises the importance of training staff in correct donning and doffing procedures and safe disposal of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> after use. However, none of the associations in the living review between infection and donning/doffing procedures or with training in donning/doffing are significant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span>Hand hygiene</h3>

<p>Handwashing is also considered in the living rapid review with four studies reporting on association with risk of <abbr title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome">SARS</abbr>-CoV-1 infection, generally with poor practice being associated with increased risk. However only one study reports significant results with poor handwashing practice having <abbr title="odds ratios">OR</abbr> =2.64 (1.04 to 6.71). As a key intervention of known effectiveness, handwashing recommendations should be applied across the board for all healthcare workers. Hand hygiene guidelines are generally informed by the <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr>’s “five moments for hand hygiene” <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup> which recommend that healthcare workers clean their hands:</p>

<p>1) before touching a patient;</p>

<p>2) before clean and aseptic procedures;</p>

<p>3) after body fluid exposure or risk;</p>

<p>4) after touching a patient; and</p>

<p>5) after touching patient surroundings.</p>

<p>Hand hygiene is a behaviour very amenable to behavioural intervention and use of behaviour change techniques, and more effort is needed in this regard. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span>Use of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>It is highly likely that correct and comprehensive use of masks, gloves, gowns, eye protection, and so on, together with behavioural infection control measures, such as hand washing and physical distancing, will result in a decreased risk of coronavirus transmission. Handwashing is an intervention available in all healthcare settings. However, a major caveat relating to <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> is that these procedures must be properly instigated (including donning and doffing) and consistently followed if they are to be effective. Standard precautions should be taken where risk is low (such as handwashing and use of masks). Contact and droplet precautions should be taken for suspected or confirmed cases of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> (such as handwashing, mask, gown, googles, and gloves). <strong>To date the literature related to <abbr title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome">SARS</abbr>-COV-2 and training in use of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> suggests that far more needs to be done to ensure social care staff are properly trained.</strong></p>

<p>Our updated search (Appendix A) identified a further review of training in use of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> focussing on donning and doffing. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 26]</a></sup> Although <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> skills can be mastered in a controlled learning environment, maintaining the integrity of the procedure during critical situations is challenging.  The review highlights the opportunities for e-learning and other technology solutions to provide training and education under pandemic conditions but that much more work is required, especially in terms of clinical benefits to patients.  We also identified a review and meta-analysis of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures in general workplace settings. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:27">[footnote 27]</a></sup><strong>Meta-analyses revealed lower <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> positivity estimates in workplace settings that implemented combined measures compared with settings that applied single measures.</strong> Combinations of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>, timely and thorough outbreak investigation (contact tracing and isolation), syndromic surveillance and testing, and staff zoning emerge as important considerations. They also highlight that these measures should be paired with improved building ventilation and indoor air quality.</p>

<p>Two reviews identified by our updated search identify adverse effects to <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use amongst healthcare workers, including dermatological reactions to <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:28">[footnote 28]</a></sup> and headaches related to <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup> Perhaps not surprisingly mask use is associated with adverse skin reactions around the mouth, cheeks and nose (mask wearing median 57 per cent adverse reactions). Duration of wearing is associated with occurrence and severity. The evidence on type of mask is unclear but <abbr title="a type of respiratory mask or filtering face piece">N95</abbr> masks appear to be associated with more problems. Many reactions are relatively minor, if uncomfortable, and wearers benefit from prophylactic use of hydrocolloid dressing on pressure areas.  There is widespread self-report of headache related to mask or goggle use (26 to 91 per cent). Type of mask (surgical compared to <abbr title="a type of respiratory mask or filtering face piece">N95</abbr>) and how long the mask is worn during a shift are important variables for headache generation.</p>

<p>Another potential factor to consider in relation to frail or older people is the risk of falls from long gowns or other ill-fitting <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>, although currently there is no literature reporting on <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> trip hazards. Providing care for people with communication issues relating to deafness or cognitive impairment can provide additional challenges when it comes to <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> use. For people with hearing loss, mask use results in reduced acoustic transmission and prevents lip reading, and may also be uncomfortable for those wearing hearing devices. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:30">[footnote 30]</a></sup> Furthermore, mask use is not suitable for those with severely compromised respiratory systems <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:31">[footnote 31]</a></sup> or those who cannot remove or adjust their own masks. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:32">[footnote 32]</a></sup> Many residents will fall into these categories and hence mask use is more often observed amongst staff and visitors rather than residents themselves.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9 </span>Apps</h3>

<p>In May 2020, an <abbr title="application for mobile devices">app</abbr> was launched by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> to support social care workers during the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33">[footnote 33]</a></sup> The <abbr title="application for mobile devices">app</abbr> provided care workers in England with guidance and learning resources on crucial areas such as infection control, as well as wellbeing toolkits to support staff through the pandemic. <strong>The <abbr title="application for mobile devices">app</abbr> was closed down on 31 March 2021.</strong> The Social Care Institute for Excellence (<abbr title="Social Care Institute for Excellence">SCIE</abbr>) has set up <a rel="external" href="https://www.scie.org.uk/e-learning/infection-control" class="govuk-link">online hygiene training</a> in response to the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic for care providers. This course covers the basics of infection control (how infections spread and how to prevent spread, hand hygiene, managing the care environment, laundry safely, use of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>, and waste disposal) and is reported as taking about 30 minutes to complete online.  As far as we know, the effectiveness of the course has not been evaluated.  An existing evidence-based <a rel="external" href="https://germdefence.org/" class="govuk-link">digital intervention</a> was adapted for the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic with recent evidence for change in intentions to improve infection control behaviours. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:34">[footnote 34]</a></sup> Whilst Germ Defence was designed for the public it is relevant to social care workers, both in their home lives and their work lives and should be promoted. <abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr> have recently funded an initial study to modify Germ Defence for residential care settings.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The evidence reviewed in this briefing is all based on studies undertaken before the identification of the Omicron variant, and indeed in populations that did not have the levels of vaccination currently observed in UK social care staff, residents or the UK general public.  That said there is no obvious reason to reject the evidence presented herein.  Overall there is likely to be an intersection between high risk, high exposure and low resource, which needs to be addressed when considering how best to reduce transmission across different health and social care settings. <strong>It is highly likely that the use of masks, gloves, gowns and other <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> together with behavioural infection control measures, such as hand washing, will result in a decreased risk of coronavirus transmission in social care.</strong> However the major caveat here is that these procedures must be properly instigated (including donning, doffing, and disposal of used <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>) and consistently followed if they are to be effective. There is little direct evidence for the effectiveness of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> in social care, but we recommend that infection control measures are implemented based on the <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr> risk classification. Standard precautions should be taken where risk is low (such as handwashing and use of masks). Contact and droplet precautions should be taken for suspected or confirmed cases of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> (such as handwashing, mask, gown, googles, and gloves). Situations in which there is likely to be aerosol generation require further measures.</p>

      <p>Chou et al initially updated the living review monthly, then changed to a bi-monthly schedule. As evidence shows little change month-on-month in June 2021 the review moved to a bi-annual update schedule. The initial review in 2020 extrapolated from results of studies on non-<abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> specific data. The more recent updates have focused on data from studies of <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection. This, and slight changes to the search and inclusion criteria, has resulted in changes in the numbers of papers included over time.
