<h3>Contains mandatory instructions</h3>

<p>For action: Supplier staff in immigration removal centres (<abbr title="immigration removal centre">IRC</abbr>), Gatwick pre-departure accommodation (<abbr title="pre-departure accommodation">PDA</abbr>) and residential short-term holding facilities (<abbr title="residential short-term holding facility">RSTHF</abbr>).</p>

<p>Author and unit: Runa Miah, Corporate Operations and Oversight Team</p>

<p>Owner: Head of Operations, Detention and Escorting Services</p>

<p>Contact point: Shadia Ali, Corporate Operations and Oversight Team</p>

<p>Processes affected: This <abbr title="Detention Services Order">DSO</abbr> sets out instructions on the reporting of cash amounts of  £1000 that are identified in the detention estate.</p>

<p>Assumptions: All staff will have the necessary knowledge to follow these procedures.</p>

<p>Notes: N/A</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1. This Detention Services Order (<abbr title="Detention Services Order">DSO</abbr>) provides guidance for staff on managing cash amounts of at least £1000 (or equivalent value in any other currency).</p>

<p>2. Referrals for port cases are the responsibility of Border Force and will be dealt with separately. This <abbr title="Detention Services Order">DSO</abbr> does not apply to cash recovery from people arriving at an <abbr title="immigration removal centre">IRC</abbr> or <abbr title="residential short-term holding facilities">RSTHFs</abbr> directly from an airport.</p>

<p>3. For the purpose of this instruction, all references to “Centre” include <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>, <abbr title="residential short-term holding facilities">RSTHFs</abbr> and Gatwick <abbr title="pre-departure accommodation">PDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>4. Two different Home Office teams operate in <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Immigration Enforcement Compliance team (Compliance team)</li>
  <li>Immigration Enforcement Detention Engagement team (<abbr title="Detention Engagement team">DET</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>5. The Compliance team are responsible for all on-site commercial and contract monitoring work. The <abbr title="Detention Engagement teams">DETs</abbr> interact with detained individuals face-to-face within the <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>, on behalf of responsible officers within the removal centres. They focus on communicating and engaging with people detained at <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>, helping them to understand their cases and reasons for detention.</p>

<p>6. There are no <abbr title="Detention Engagement teams">DETs</abbr> at <abbr title="residential short-term holding facilities">RSTHFs</abbr>, functions which are the responsibility of the <abbr title="Detention Engagement team">DET</abbr> in <abbr title="residential short-term holding facilities">RSTHFs</abbr> are carried out by the supplier and overseen by the Escorting Contract Monitoring Team (<abbr title="Escorting Contract Monitoring Team">ECMT</abbr>). In the Gatwick <abbr title="pre-departure accommodation">PDA</abbr> the role of engagement with detained individuals is covered by the local Compliance Team.</p>

<h2>Policy framework</h2>

<p>7. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (<abbr title="Proceeds of Crime Act 2002">POCA</abbr>) provides powers for the civil seizure,  detention and forfeiture of cash which on reasonable grounds is suspected and is satisfied on a balance of probabilities to derive from or be intended for use in crime (a ‘cash recovery ’). The purpose of these powers is to remove cash from the criminal economy, to deprive criminals of the proceeds of their criminality and reduce the pool of funds available for future criminal activities.</p>

<p>8. Under <abbr title="Proceeds of Crime Act 2002">POCA</abbr>, cash is defined as notes and coins in any currency, postal orders, cheques of any kind (including travellers’ cheques), banker’s drafts, bearer bonds and bearer shares, gaming vouchers, fixed-value casino tokens and betting receipts. It can be recovered where it is £1000 or more (or of a value equivalent to £1000 or more).</p>

<p>9. The recovery  of cash under Chapter 3 Part 5 of <abbr title="Proceeds of Crime Act 2002">POCA</abbr> is a civil power, and although cash recovery is often linked to a criminal investigation and/or immigration offence, there does not need to be an arrest or associated criminal investigation in order to recover cash.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>10. This <abbr title="Detention Services Order">DSO</abbr> will ensure that all staff in <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>, <abbr title="residential short-term holding facilities">RSTHFs</abbr> and <abbr title="pre-departure accommodation">PDA</abbr> are aware of <abbr title="Proceeds of Crime Act 2002">POCA</abbr> and how it applies to managing cash amounts of £1000 or more that are found within the detention estate.</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p>11. All cash that is equivalent to £1000 or more (or the equivalent in any other currency) found in the possession of a detained individual - either handed in on a visit from friends and family, sent in through the post or found in their possession when entering the detention estate - must be referred  by the supplier as soon as possible (see paragraphs 12-15) to the Criminal and Financial Investigation (<abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr>) on-call Officer or the Financial Investigation Unit (<abbr title="Financial Investigation Unit">FIU</abbr>) FI inbox. This can include either a single amount of £1000 or smaller amounts of cash being received by a detained individual that together total £1000 or more.</p>

<h3>Telephone referrals – contact numbers</h3>

<p>12. The contact details for the on-call <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr>  Officer is on the Detention and Escorting Services on-call list. The <abbr title="Financial Investigation Unit">FIU</abbr> email address is <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FIInbox@homeoffice.gov.uk">fiinbox@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> .</p>

<p>13. Weekdays (office hours) between the hours of 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday a referral must be made by phone to the <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr> (Crime Team) in the region where the removal centre is located. The <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr> Officer taking the referral will provide their email address. The referral form must be sent to the email address provided. The <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr> and <abbr title="Financial Investigation Unit">FIU</abbr> team will record all the referrals made to them on CLUE and CID/Atlas.</p>

<h3>Weekdays and weekends (out of hours)</h3>

<p>14. Outside office hours, referrals must be made by email to the FI inbox. This inbox is manned by <abbr title="Financial Investigation Unit">FIU</abbr> on call Officers.</p>

<h3>Written referrals</h3>

<p>15. Immediately following the referral process  above, a cash referral form (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-detainees-cash-exceeding-1000">Annex A</a>) must be completed and sent to the <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr> Officer  the referral was made to (office hours) or the FI Inbox (out of hours and weekends). Where needed, the on-call <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr> Officer will provide contact details. The Annex A referral must include all details of the cash find and both telephone and email contacts of the centre’s security team, so they can be contacted as soon as possible during office hours.</p>

<p>16. All finds of cash of  £1000 or more must also be reported by centre supplier staff by completing a Security Information Report (<abbr title="Security Information Report">SIR</abbr>) – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/767572/DSO_11_2014__SIRs_.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Detention Services Order">DSO</abbr> 11/2014 ‘Security information reports’</a>.</p>

<h3>Securing cash sums following referral (<abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>, residential STHFs &amp; <abbr title="pre-departure accommodation">PDA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>17. When a referral is made, all cash in the detained individual’s possession must be secured in an evidence bag. However, the  individual must be allowed to keep any allowances received while detained or cash earned through engaging in paid activities in the centre (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paid-activities-for-detainees"><abbr title="Detention Services Order">DSO</abbr> 01/2013 ‘Paid Activities’</a>).</p>

<p>18.  Where detained individuals arrive from another <abbr title="immigration removal centre">IRC</abbr> with £1000 or more, the receiving centre must make a referral to the <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr>/<abbr title="Financial Investigation Unit">FIU</abbr> team. Where detained individuals are transferred from prison, the receiving centre must seek to establish whether the cash was earned through paid work in prison, if the cash was earned through paid work, then no referral is required. There is no requirement to establish evidence regarding cash which the detained individual arrives with or is brought into the centre by friends and family after the individual is detained. Cash brought into the centre by friends or relatives subsequently (amounts less than £1000) is not to be added to the original amount and may be spent by the individual. The <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr>/<abbr title="Financial Investigation Unit">FIU</abbr> team will investigate the referral.</p>

<p>19. It is the centre manager’s responsibility to ensure all cash sums being referred are kept securely until <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr> or <abbr title="Financial Investigation Unit">FIU</abbr> have determined whether the cash will be recovered. A clear audit trail must be kept of the date and time the cash was secured, where it was kept and the reference number of the evidence bag. Details of any cash being secured must be recorded in the detained individual’s property log.</p>

<p>20. Following a referral being made, the <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr> or <abbr title="Financial Investigation Unit">FIU</abbr> must provide written confirmation by email to the centre’s security team (see paragraph 13 ) of whether an investigation under <abbr title="Proceeds of Crime Act 2002">POCA</abbr> will be conducted or if the cash can be returned to the detained individual. This confirmation must be provided as quickly as possible and no later than two working days from the time of the referral.</p>

<p>21. Unless the centre has been provided with written confirmation from the Financial Investigation Unit that they will attend the centre to recover the cash,  no detained individual can be released, or otherwise permanently discharged from a centre, without all cash sums being returned to his or her property. Such cases must be notified to the Financial Investigation Unit in accordance with paragraphs 12 – 14.</p>

<p>22. When any cash sums are recovered by <abbr title="Criminal and Financial Investigation">CFI</abbr> or the <abbr title="Financial Investigation Unit">FIU</abbr>, details of the recovery must be updated on the detained individual’s property log and records of any cash recovered kept within the detained person’s individual <abbr title="immigration removal centre">IRC</abbr> records and CID/Atlas.</p>

<h2>Annual self-audit</h2>

<p>23. An annual self-audit of this <abbr title="Detention Services Order">DSO</abbr> is required by centre suppliers to ensure that the processes are being followed. This audit should be made available to the Home Office on request.</p>

<p>24. Both the <abbr title="Detention Engagement team">DET</abbr> and Compliance Teams must also conduct annual audits against their respective responsibilities stated within this <abbr title="Detention Services Order">DSO</abbr> for the same purpose.</p>
