<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What is the FMU</h2>

<p>The FMU was set up in 2005 as a joint HO-FCDO unit in recognition of the fact that forced marriage is an abuse that cuts across jurisdictions, and acts as the hub for advice, outreach and policy relating to forced marriage.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What data we process and why</h2>

<p>The FMU provides information and support to victims and potential victims of forced marriage in the UK – and to British nationals overseas, including dual nationals - and to professionals (most commonly police officers and social workers, education professionals and sometimes NGOs) working to safeguard them.</p>

<p>It does this through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a telephone helpline and</li>
  <li>an email inbox</li>
</ul>

<p>Through the helpline and email inbox FMU collects data relating to victims and potential victims of forced marriage.  This includes in particular a person’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>contact details including mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and social media profiles</li>
  <li>date and place of birth</li>
  <li>passport number</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>nationality</li>
  <li>in the course of providing assistance to a victim or potential victim of forced marriage, the FMU may also collect relevant data about other family members, including siblings, parents, and extended family, their prospective spouse, and, where concerns are reported by a third-party, details of the individual reporting a concern</li>
  <li>the country where the forced marriage is due to happen</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Legal basis for the processing</h2>

<p>The lawful basis for processing personal data by the FCDO and HO is that it is necessary to do so in order to perform their official functions as the FMU such that Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR applies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Special category and criminal data</h2>

<p>Special category data may also be processed including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(if proactively disclosed) sexual orientation</li>
  <li>(if proactively disclosed) disability</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the nature of their work the FMU may also occasionally process criminal data including information concerning alleged criminality.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Additional condition for the processing of special category data</h2>

<p>The processing of special category data requires an additional legitimising processing condition under Article 9 of the GDPR to be met to ensure lawful processing.</p>

<p>In this regard where special category data is processed this is done on the basis that it is necessary for reasons of  substantial public interest under Article 9(2)(g) in connection with the exercise of the official functions of the FCDO and HO (paragraph 6 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018) or for preventing or detecting unlawful acts (paragraph 10, Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018) or safeguarding of children and individuals at risk (paragraph 18, Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018)</p>

<p>In a relatively small number of cases the special category data will be processed on the basis that it is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject (Article 9(2)(c) GDPR).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Additional condition for the processing of criminal data</h2>

<p>Where criminal data is processed this is done on the basis that it is necessary in connection with the exercise of the official functions of the FCDO and HO and is in the substantial public interest (paragraph 6 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018), on the basis that it is necessary for preventing or detecting unlawful acts (paragraph 10 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018) or because it is necessary for safeguarding children and individuals at risk (paragraph 18 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018).</p>

<p>In a relatively small number of cases it may be done on the basis that it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of an individual and the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent (paragraph 30, Part 3 of Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Security of your data</h2>

<p>We take data security very seriously and we take every step to ensure that your data remains private and secure. We use SSL in order to encrypt all data transferred to and received from our server.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Data sharing between the FCDO and HO</h2>

<p>Personal data is shared between the FCDO and the HO as part of running the FMU.</p>

<p>There is a need to share this data because FMU is a joint unit. This joint access to data helps to ensure effective decision-making and safeguarding of individuals. The overall benefit of such sharing is to provide a better service to the victims and potential victims of forced marriage and professionals, and to improve the safeguarding response.</p>

<p>All such data is shared securely.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Data sharing with third parties</h2>

<p>FMU may share data on a case by case basis with the following organisations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Police and social services in the case of minors at risk of forced marriage and in relation to adults when required, either with consent or if there is an imminent risk of harm to their life or when one of the other lawful bases set out above applies</li>
  <li>parts of the Home Office which deal with the processing of immigration applications. FMU shares data when there are concerns that an individual who is the victim of forced marriage may be unwillingly sponsoring a visa application. Those parts of the Home Office may send data to FMU when it has such concerns about a sponsor, and FMU may share data in return to either confirm or refute the suspicions</li>
  <li>relevant NGOs/funded partners to allow them to offer specialist services</li>
  <li>when a victim of forced marriage is overseas and consents to a referral to an NGO or other local organisation / provider who can offer safe accommodation or other services in that country. Sharing information allows the provider to contact the victim to offer assistance and organise logistics</li>
</ul>

<p>Where such sharing takes place it is pursuant to one of the lawful bases set out above.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Client feedback</h2>

<p>The FMU also asks that those who make contact with it who are calling in their capacity as a member of a statutory or other professional organisation (e.g. police officers, social workers, NGO staff) to complete (following the closure of their case) a short survey about their experience of contacting the FMU, to enable continuous improvement. No personal data is collected through this process, and completion is voluntary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Published statistics</h2>

<p>FMU also publishes annual anonymised statistics on the cases which it has dealt with and sometimes provides high-level anonymised data to the police and others on the nature of the cases which it has dealt with.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>How long data are retained</h2>

<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal or reporting requirements. Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal information are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-commonwealth-development-office-fcdo-retention-schedule">in our retention policy</a>. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we will use such information without further notice to you.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Your rights</h2>

<p>You have the right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to object to the processing of your data (ie. to request that your data is not processed for certain purposes) where we process it on the basis that it is necessary for the exercise of our official functions</li>
