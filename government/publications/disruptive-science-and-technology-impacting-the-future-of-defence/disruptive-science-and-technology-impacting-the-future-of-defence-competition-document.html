<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) competition, run on behalf of the Defence Science and Technology Futures (DSTF) programme, aims to identify and develop novel, early stage research ideas that may have a significant and disruptive impact on the future of Defence. A disruptive impact is something that radically alters how we do things – this can be positive (e.g. a new capability becomes available) or negative (e.g. a new type of threat arises).</p>

<p><b>This competition is funded by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl).</b></p>

<p>The outcome of this competition is anticipated to be a pool of novel Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ideas / concepts that may be disruptive. These ideas / concepts may then be used as the basis for further research within the DSTF Programme.</p>

<h4>Dial-in session</h4>

<p><b>Friday 16th September 2022</b> - A dial-in session providing further detail on the problem space and a chance to ask questions in an open forum. If you would like to participate, please register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/disruptive-st-impacting-the-future-of-defence-qa-session-tickets-407999065187" rel="external">Eventbrite page</a> . To get the most out of this session, we strongly advise that you attend with a good knowledge of the competition document.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Competition Scope</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Background: Defence Science and Technology Futures</h3>

<p>The Defence Science and Technology Futures (DSTF) Programme identifies novel early stage research which may have a significant game-changing or disruptive impact on future military capability, concepts of operation, threats or other areas of relevance to Defence. We are looking for ideas that may underpin generation-after-next technology, concepts or approaches and could disrupt traditional technologies or ways of thinking. The intention of this competition is to maximise the opportunities for exploiting innovation and reduce the likelihood of technological surprises caused by changes to the science and technology landscape. The programme is not about identifying incremental changes.</p>

<p>The ideas sought for this competition may not fulfil any current Defence requirement. Geo-politics, environmental issues, economics and many other factors will shape future scenarios and Defence requirements. The DSTF Programme has to consider what various futures might look like and speculate on how current novel Science and Technology (S&amp;T) might develop and impact on what Defence needs to do in those various futures. This will enable Defence to better understand and plan for the future, helping to combat threats and take advantage of opportunities.</p>

<p>The DSTF Programme recognises the need to look beyond the current, developed science and technology landscape and beyond the traditional defence enterprise to explore emerging ideas and evaluate their future value. This DASA competition has been launched to support this need.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Scope: Evaluating Disruptive S&amp;T ideas and their impact on the Future of Defence</h3>

<p>The aim of this competition is to identify new ideas and ways of doing things that are potentially disruptive to Defence and then to further develop the understanding of the ideas and their future impact. It is likely that further research will be required to develop the understanding of the ideas. It may be necessary to consider multiple capability areas and multiple future scenarios to assess where the developed idea could have the most impact in future Defence. The outcome of the work should be an exciting flavour of what might be possible and what the affects might be, rather than a detailed study developing the understanding of the science.</p>

<p>We are interested in low <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance#what-dasa-funds">Technology Readiness Level</a> (TRL) ideas (TRL 1-2) from any discipline that you believe  may, in the future, disrupt the current ways of innovating and have the potential to lead to radical change<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Proposals may derive from horizon scanning or technology watching, the bidders own internal research activities or via any other mechanism. Ideas need to have theoretical basis, supported by reasoned explanation.</p>

<p>DASA provides fixed funding of £50k per project to advance these ideas and to assess how they might impact on the future of Defence.</p>

<p>The DSTF programme recognises that investigation of low TRL S&amp;T has a high risk of failure. This is accepted. Should it be discovered during the work that the original concept is not likely to be valid or an alternative low TRL idea / concept / technology would likely be more important, this would be considered to be a valid outcome of the work. However, we would still expect the work that led to this conclusion to be comprehensive, described in detail in the report and the findings to be presented, as described below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Competition Requirements</h2>

<p>This competition has 1 requirement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Requirement 1: Evaluating Disruptive S&amp;T ideas and their impact on the Future of Defence</h3>

<p>This DASA competition will award each successful bidder £50k to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take one or more novel very low TRL idea, as identified in the proposal, and further develop them to better understand the science behind them and their potential to form a disruptive technology in the future  -  this might be through laboratory research, modelling, or other approaches</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develop concepts of how the idea might be deployed in the future - for example, could it only be used in particular circumstances or could it have impact across Defence?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>describe the circumstances in which the idea might be disruptive and the potential impact on the future of Defence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The intention of this requirement is to develop an understanding of ideas to help determine their potential to be disruptive. Bidders should think about how the idea / concept / technology may fit within the future Defence landscape, and the technological landscape of the world in general, rather than the confines of contemporary technologies and capabilities.</p>

<p>Please note, the awarded amount, contract length, deliverables and milestone payments have all been set as part of this requirement.</p>

<p>Ideas that might help solve this requirement include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your own very early stage science and technology that you did not initially see as having a Defence application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ideas identified through your own horizon scanning or technology watch, that you believe could be disruptive and should be investigated further</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ideas that you have developed through brainstorming or other workshopping approaches that you believe have the potential to disrupt the future Defence landscape but are at a very low TRL level (TRL 1-2)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Any ideas submitted to this requirement must have a theoretical basis supported by reasoned explanation.</b></p>

<p>Your proposal should provide an outline description of the idea or ideas and their potential significance to Defence. The proposal should describe how the project funding of £50k would be used to expand upon the idea(s) and further develop an understanding of their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fundamental scientific or theoretical basis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>future viability and the potential development paths</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>potentially disruptive impacts and use cases (both positive and negative, opportunity and threat) within future Defence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Deliverables</h3>

<p>The following deliverables are required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a 2 page ‘executive summary’ to present the findings of your research to date. This must be submitted by 31st March 2023</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a short report describing the low TRL S&amp;T, the further development work you have undertaken and how this has improved the understanding of the potential impact of the idea on Defence in the future. If more in-depth research is required to further develop Defence’s understanding of the disruptive potential of the S&amp;T, this should be described. The report should comprise 5000-7000 words excluding the title page, contents list and reference list. It should be written in plain English and the use of specialist terminology should be minimised. The extensive use of images and figures is encouraged where they will aid in readability of the document. This mandatory report must be delivered before the 24th April 2023.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a 20 minute briefing to an MOD Board, describing the outputs of the research and highlighting what you believe the MOD could do to further understand the potential of the low TRL ideas or concepts. It is the intention that this Board will identify the topics of most interest to be taken forward for further investigation by the MOD research programme<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. Dstl would prefer that the presentation is given in person. However, an option to present virtually will be made available if attendance in person is not possible. The event will be held in London on 3rd or 4th May 2023. A confirmed date and time will be provided to you in April 2023. Note, the costs of attending the presentation should be included in the £50k budget for funded ideas; no further funding with be provided for travel and subsistence.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Clarification of what we want</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>We are interested in…</h3>

<p>We are interested in novel, very low TRL S&amp;T ideas which could either benefit Defence in the future or form the basis of a threat. We would like you to provide us with an exciting flavour of what might be possible and be disruptive. Your proposal should include evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>creative ideas / concepts / technology that have the potential to cause a significant game-changing or disruptive impact on Defence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ideas which are at an early stage of development (equivalent to TRL 1-2)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ideas that have a theoretical basis supported by reasoned explanation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the development of those ideas through research to understand their potential to be disruptive in the future</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>development of concepts of how the ideas might be deployed in the future to become either an opportunity or threat to Defence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clear demonstration of how the proposed work applies to Defence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>We are not interested in…</h3>

<p>We are not interested in proposals that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>include innovation that is TRL 3 and above. Any proposed ideas that are judged to be TRL 3 and above will be viewed as non-compliant and sifted out. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance#what-dasa-funds">TRL guide</a> or contact a DASA Innovation Partner for guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-a-dasa-innovation-partner">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>suggest ideas that are not likely to be disruptive, are likely to only lead to incremental change and/or offer no real prospect of out-competing existing technological solutions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>suggest ideas that cannot apply to Defence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include ideas that have no form of theoretical basis which can be described by reasoned explanation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>constitute consultancy, paper-based studies or literature reviews which just summarise the existing literature without further development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an unsolicited resubmission of a previous DASA proposal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do not include an evaluation of how the ideas could be disruptive in the future and impact on Defence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Your proposal would not be expected to deliver a proof of concept capable of validation in a laboratory-style environment.<b></b></b></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Further research</h2>

<p>The deliverables of this competition should indicate if more research should enable Defence to gain the greatest benefit.</p>

<p>It is the intention that the MOD Board, discussed above, will identify the topics of most interest to be taken forward for further investigation by the MOD research programme. However, it is not guaranteed that any idea will be picked up and developed further. Any decisions on research programme content, structure and funding at that stage would be independent of this DASA call. Further research at that stage may be placed through competition.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>What your resourcing plan should include</h3>

<p>Your resourcing plan must identify, where possible, the nationalities of proposed employees that you intend to work on the project.</p>

<h4>If your proposal is recommended for funding</h4>

<p>In the event of a proposal being recommended for funding, the DASA reserves the right to undertake due diligence checks including the clearance of proposed employees. Please note that this process will take as long as necessary and could take up to 6 weeks in some cases for non-UK nationals. This will take place during November and December to allow for contracts to start on 03 January.</p>

<p>As contracts are of 4 months is duration, any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-ethical-legal-and-regulatory-guidance">ethical / legal / regulatory factors</a> identified within your proposal will not be accepted.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-ethical-legal-and-regulatory-guidance#mod-research-ethics-committee">MODREC</a> approvals can take up to 5 months therefore any proposals identifying the need for MODREC approval will be sifted out as non-compliant. Please contact your Innovation Partner for further guidance.</p>

<p>Requirements for access to Government Furnished Assets (GFA), for example, information, equipment, materials and facilities, may not be included in your proposal. Given the timescales and nature of the competition, no GFA will be available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Export control for overseas partners</h3>

<p>All relevant export control regulations will apply if a company ultimately wants to sell a developed solution to a foreign entity. All innovators must ensure that they can obtain, if required, the necessary export licences for their proposals and developments, such that they can be supplied to the UK and other countries. If you cannot confirm that you can gain the requisite licences, your proposal will be sifted out of the competition.</p>

<p>Additionally, if we believe that you will not be able to obtain export clearance, additional checks may be conducted, which may also result in your proposal being sifted out of the competition.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>Cyber risk assessment</h3>

<p>On receipt of a ‘Fund’ decision, suppliers must submit a Supplier Assurance Questionnaire (SAQ). The SAQ allows suppliers to demonstrate compliance with the specified risk level and the corresponding profile in&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-for-defence-suppliers-def-stan-05-138">Def Stan 05-138</a>, the levels of controls required will depend on this risk level.</p>

<p>Successful suppliers will be emailed a Risk Assessment Reference (RAR) number and corresponding risk level, and must use this to&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=7WB3vlNZS0iuldChbfoJ5Tv4OR9pb0BHial1Ag-WKXVUOFk3Sk9SS0JDQ0FRWjhYNDhTVldHUDJaNy4u" rel="external">complete a SAQ here</a>. The completed SAQ form and resulting email response from Defence Cyber Protection Partnership (DCPP) must be downloaded and returned to&nbsp;DASA. Further guidance can be found at:&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcpp-cyber-security-model-industry-buyer-and-supplier-guide">DCPP: Cyber Security Model industry buyer and supplier guide</a>.</p>

<p>If the SAQ reveals deficiencies then a Cyber Implementation Plan (CIP) is needed and requires approval before a contract can be awarded.</p>
