<h4>Desirable</h4>

<p>DASA&nbsp;funds innovations that solve defence and security challenges. You should look out for things like the proposal’s alignment with a strategic need or challenge and who would benefit from the innovation. Ideas that are useful for both defence and security should be acknowledged.</p>

<p>Under this category, proposals should be assessed on:</p>

<p>Defence compatibility</p>

<ul>
  <li>the proposal shows benefit across a range of relevant future defence scenarios</li>
</ul>

<p>Disruptive potential</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal is clear on the technological challenge or future scenario (opportunity or threat) driving the innovation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal describes how the impact for defence is disruptive or game changing in terms of performance, time and cost</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>End user interest</p>

<ul>
  <li>the proposal identifies who could benefit from the innovation, if successful</li>
</ul>

<h4>Feasible</h4>

<p>You are asked to consider whether the proposal is scientifically, technically and practically feasible within reason, how innovative the idea is, and how it compares with potential alternatives. A clear and logical plan, backed by relevant expertise, capability and appropriate resources needs to be present.</p>

<p>Under this category, proposals should be assessed on:</p>

<p>Technical approach</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal is scientifically, technically and practically feasible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal has a method for measuring progress and performance to improve the assessment of potential disruptiveness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal outlines how it will assess how future geopolitical, economic and environmental changes may impact on the evaluation of the concept / idea</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Innovation and risk</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal assesses how the solution compares to alternative ideas / concepts in terms of time, cost and performance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal assesses and provides mitigations for technical risks</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Expertise and capability</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal provides evidence of the team’s relevant expertise and experience in the technical area of the innovation, including background research and projects completed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal provides evidence of the resources available to the team to deliver the project including facilities and labour</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Viable</h4>

<p>You should assess for evidence that the idea can be delivered within the project scope and timelines.</p>

<p>Look for evidence of a robust project plan which identifies any links or dependencies between work packages and milestones, and which clearly identifies measurable deliverables. We are looking at overall costs and value for money.</p>

<p>Under this category, proposals should be assessed on:</p>

<p>Project delivery</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal has a project plan in sufficient detail and identifies any links or dependencies between work packages and/or milestones</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal identifies any project risks or dependencies and has identified appropriate mitigations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Costs and value for money</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal provides detail on the total project cost, and the profiling of spend across milestones as outlined in the deliverables section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disruptive-science-and-technology-impacting-the-future-of-defence/disruptive-science-and-technology-impacting-the-future-of-defence-competition-document#competition-requirements#5.2-deliverables">competition document</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal provides information on any additional funding or in-kind support that has been or is being provided by anyone other than the proposer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal explains what would happen to the innovation if it were not publicly funded</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal describes the benefit and value for money for government, and also explains any wider value to the UK economy</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Plan beyond the project</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal explains what tests, accreditation, trials would be necessary to take the project forward on completion of the project</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proposal considers how the outcomes could be integrated into future systems and capabilities or outlines the solution that it would  be replacing and why</p>
  </li>
</ul>
