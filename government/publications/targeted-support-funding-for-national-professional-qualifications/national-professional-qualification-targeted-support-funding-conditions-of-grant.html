<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Funding will be available from the autumn term 2022 to support teachers and leaders working in small settings to participate in the national professional qualifications (NPQs).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Expiry date</h3>

<p>Funding will be paid in a single arrears payment at the end of each respective academic year for 2022 to 2023 and 2023 to 2024.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Eligibility</h2>

<p>State-funded schools and state-funded 16 to 19 organisations with between 1 and 600 pupils will be eligible for this funding. They will receive payment for every teacher and leader they employ taking an <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> participant must also meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms">eligibility criteria</a> for the department funded <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> scholarships.</p>

<p>Schools can check how many pupils they have recorded on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Search?SelectedTab=Establishments" rel="external">Get Information About Schools (<abbr title="Get Information About Schools">GIAS</abbr>) database</a>.</p>

<p>Eligibility for state-funded 16 to 19 organisations is based on pupil data from the Individualised Learner Record (ILR).</p>

<p>Where sixth-form colleges are attached to schools their eligibility is based on the whole school’s pupil data.</p>

<p>Other settings are not eligible for this funding, even though employees may be in receipt of scholarship funding. This includes young offenders’ institutions, virtual schools, local authorities, non-school based early years settings, and hospital schools (unless otherwise listed as a publicly funded school on the <abbr title="Get Information About Schools">GIAS</abbr> database),</p>

<p>This funding applies to all <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> courses but does not apply to the Early Headship Coaching Offer.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Payments</h2>

<p>Eligible schools and organisations will receive £200 per participant to support teachers and leaders participating in the <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> programme.</p>

<p>There is no need to apply for this funding. It will be paid as part of normal payments from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Payments will be made in arrears during the summer term following when the <abbr title="national professional qualification">NPQ</abbr> participants began their course. For example, if a participant began in October 2022 or February 2023, their school would receive the £200 payment in Summer 2023.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the school or 16 to 19 organisation to decide how this funding will be managed. This may include, for example, contributing to: the costs of covering a teacher’s time out of school, travel costs, or technology that supports engagement in the course.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Assurance</h2>

<p><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> have a responsibility to make sure that public funds are properly managed in line with these grant conditions.</p>

<p>As payment will be made in arrears, we reserve the right to ask schools to confirm that the money has been or will be spent in the way intended. Acceptance of the funding will be taken as confirmation.</p>

<p>In advance of accepting any funding, schools will have the opportunity to let us know they do not want to receive this funding or notify us of any changes, for example, the teacher moves to a different school before they start the course. You can notify us of any changes by emailing: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk">continuing-professional-development@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Schools should keep some record of this expenditure, such as evidence of classroom cover, or a timetable for the&nbsp;participant involved, but we will not mandate what form this record should take, and trust school leaders to use their judgement.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to conduct proportionate assurance such as spot checks with individual schools, asking for sight of such records.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Further information</h2>

<p>Books, other documents and records relating to the recipient’s accounts shall be open to inspection by the Secretary of State and by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General may, under section 6 of the National Audit Act 1983, carry out examinations into the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the recipient has used its resources in discharging its grant-aided activities.</p>

<p>Schools, colleges and local authorities shall provide information as may be required by the Secretary of State to determine whether it has complied with these conditions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Variation</h2>

<p>These conditions of grant may be altered at any time. Participating institutions will be notified of this through existing channels.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Recovery of funding</h2>

<p>This funding is being provided under section 14 to 16 of the Education Act 2002 and we reserve the right to audit the expenditure.</p>

<p>We will seek to recover funding that has been paid in error.</p>

<p>Recoveries will be made by invoice or by offsetting the amount against subsequent payments due from&nbsp;the department.</p>

<p>The recipient must notify&nbsp;<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>&nbsp;immediately through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Education_and_Skills_Funding_Agency__ESFA__enquiry_form" rel="external"><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> enquiry form</a> if it becomes aware of any instance of error, suspected fraud or financial irregularity in the use of the funds.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Enquiries</h2>
