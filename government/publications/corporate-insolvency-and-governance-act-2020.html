<p>The automatic extensions granted by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act will come to an end for filing deadlines that fall after 5 April 2021.</p>

<p>Read more in our news story <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/automatic-filing-extensions-granted-by-the-corporate-insolvency-and-governance-act-due-to-come-to-an-end">Automatic filing extensions granted by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act due to come to an end</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>On 25 June 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the Act) received royal assent. It came into force on 26 June 2020.</p>

<p>The measures introduced by the Act will relieve the burden on businesses during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and allow them to focus all their efforts on continuing to operate.</p>

<p>This guidance outlines how the measures introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act will affect public limited companies (PLCs) and Societas Europaea (SEs) filing accounts with Companies House.</p>

<p>The Act will also introduce changes to the insolvency regime.</p>

<h2>Accounts</h2>

<p>Companies and other types of business registered at Companies House will get more time to file accounts.</p>

<p>If your company is eligible, weâ€™ll update your filing deadline automatically. You do not need to apply for an extension.</p>

<p>There are changes for public companies with a filing deadline between 26 March 2020 and 29 September 2020.</p>

<h2>Insolvency</h2>

<p>The Bill will introduce a new moratorium to give companies breathing space from their creditors while they seek a rescue. It will also introduce a new restructuring plan sanctioned by the court that will bind creditors to the plan.</p>

<p>Directors will still need to meet their filing obligations with Companies House. Late filing penalties will still be applied if accounts are filed late.</p>

<p>The Monitor is appointed to oversee the moratorium. They will need to file notices with Companies House during the moratorium.</p>

<p>See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liquidation-and-insolvency">liquidation and insolvency guidance</a>.</p>

<p>A restructuring plan does not take effect until a copy of the court order has been delivered to Companies House. It will then be registered against the company.</p>
