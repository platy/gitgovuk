<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This guide is for British citizens, British Overseas Territories citizens, British 
Overseas citizens, British subjects and British Nationals (Overseas) who wish to 
renounce (give up) their citizenship or status.</p>

<p>This guide will help you to decide whether you can renounce your citizenship or 
status, and tells you how to do it.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The law covering renunciation is contained in the British Nationality Act 1981 and the 
Regulations made under it. Renunciation of British National (Overseas) status is 
covered by the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986. The information in this 
guide is meant only as a brief guide to the law and to the Home Secretary’s policy. It 
is not a comprehensive statement of either the law or the policy.</p>

<h2>Who can renounce British nationality?</h2>

<p>If you are a British citizen, a British Overseas Territories citizen, a British Overseas 
citizen, a British subject or a British National (Overseas), you may renounce your 
citizenship or status if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EITHER you already have some citizenship or nationality other than the British 
nationality that you wish to renounce.
    <ul>
      <li>OR you can satisfy the Home Secretary, or Governor (if you wish to 
renounce British Overseas Territories citizenship), that you will acquire 
another citizenship or nationality after renouncing, and</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you are of full age (aged 18 or over). If you are under 18 and have been 
married or in a civil partnership, you are treated as being of full age for this 
purpose), and</li>
  <li>you are of full capacity. The British Nationality Act 1981 defines full capacity as 
being “not of unsound mind”. We consider this requirement met if you have 
some understanding of the meaning and consequences of renunciation.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should check whether you also need to renounce any other form of British 
nationality or citizenship of any other country.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State or Governor has discretion to waive the requirement to be of 
full capacity if they think it is in the applicant’s best interests to do so. If you are 
applying on behalf of someone else who is not of full capacity and for whom you are 
responsible you will need to explain why it would be in the applicant’s best interests 
for them to renounce their citizenship, despite their inability to understand fully what 
is involved. This should be supported by confirmation of the applicant’s mental 
condition and of the fact that they are in your care.</p>

<h3>For British Nationals (Overseas) and former British Dependent Territories citizens by connection with Hong Kong.</h3>

<p>If you were a British Dependent Territories citizen by virtue only of a connection with 
Hong Kong, you ceased to be a British Dependent Territories citizen on 1 July 1997. 
If you had no other nationality or citizenship on that date, you automatically became 
a British Overseas citizen.</p>

<p>A person who became a British National (Overseas) can only now be a British 
Overseas Territories citizen if they have that citizenship by a connection with a 
British Overseas Territory other than the former dependent territory of Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The British Overseas Territories are currently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anguilla</li>
  <li>Bermuda</li>
  <li>British Antarctic Territory</li>
  <li>British Indian Ocean Territory</li>
  <li>Cayman Islands</li>
  <li>Falkland Islands</li>
  <li>Gibraltar</li>
  <li>Montserrat</li>
  <li>Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands</li>
  <li>St. Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha</li>
  <li>South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands</li>
  <li>the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia</li>
  <li>Turks and Caicos Islands</li>
  <li>British Virgin Islands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before 26 February 2002, British Overseas Territories and British Overseas 
Territories citizenship were called British Dependent Territories and British 
Dependent Territories citizenship respectively.</p>

<h2>How to renounce British nationality</h2>

<p>You can renounce your British citizenship, British Overseas Territories citizenship, 
British Overseas citizenship, British subject or British National (Overseas) status by 
completing the declaration of renunciation. If you hold more than one of these 
citizenships or status, apart from British Overseas Territories citizenship, you can 
renounce them all on one declaration. If you wish to renounce British Overseas 
Territories citizenship and another citizenship or status, you will need to complete 
two declarations. This is because the application to renounce British Overseas 
territories citizenship needs to be made to the Governor of the territory but all other 
renunciations are made to the Home Secretary.</p>

<p>You will cease to be a British citizen, a British Overseas Territories citizen, a British 
Overseas citizen, a British subject or a British National (Overseas) on the date your 
declaration of renunciation is registered by the Home Secretary (or Governor if you 
are renouncing British Overseas Territories citizenship). In war time the Home 
Secretary or Governor can withhold registration.</p>

<p>If your declaration is registered in the expectation of your acquiring another 
citizenship, but you do not do so within 6 months of the registration, the renunciation 
will not take effect, and you will be considered to have remained a British national as 
before.</p>

<p>A declaration of renunciation affects only the status of the person making the 
declaration and does not affect the current status of any other member of his or her 
existing family.</p>

<p>A person who renounces British citizenship or British Overseas Territories citizenship 
has a right (once only) to resume that citizenship if the renunciation was necessary 
to enable him or her to keep or obtain some other citizenship. A person who 
renounces British citizenship or British Overseas Territories citizenship more than 
once, or for any other reason, may be allowed to resume that citizenship if the Home 
Secretary or Governor thinks it fit. A person who renounces British Overseas 
citizenship, British subject or British National (Overseas) status cannot later resume 
that citizenship or status.</p>

<p>A person who renounces their British citizenship will lose their right of abode in the 
United Kingdom, unless they also have that right as a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/commonwealth-citizens">Commonwealth citizen</a>. If you renounce British 
citizenship and want to live in the UK you will need to apply under the Immigration 
Rules.</p>

<h3>Documents you should supply</h3>

<p>You should send:</p>

<ul>
  <li>documentary evidence that you are a British citizen, a British Overseas 
Territories citizen, a British Overseas citizen, a British subject or a British 
National (Overseas) (depending upon which citizenship or status you wish to 
renounce). Normally a passport will establish your citizenship or status. If you 
do not have one, you should send a birth certificate or a certificate of 
naturalisation or registration. If you have your citizenship or status through 
descent from a parent or grandparent, you should send documents proving that 
person’s citizenship or status and your relationship to him or her.</li>
  <li>EITHER that you have, or will have on making the declaration of renunciation, 
another citizenship or nationality.
    <ul>
      <li>a passport issued to you by the other country of which you are a national, or 
a statement by the authorities of that country that you are one of their 
nationals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>OR that you are about to become a citizen of another country.
    <ul>
      <li>You should send a letter from the authorities of the country concerned 
confirming that you will be granted citizenship of that country when you have 
renounced British citizenship, British Overseas Territories citizenship, British 
Overseas citizenship, British subject status or British National (Overseas)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Send your marriage or civil partnership certificate if you are under 18 years are 
married or in a civil partnership.</li>
</ul>

<p>Information you give us will be treated in confidence but may be disclosed to other 
Government Departments and agencies and local authorities to enable them to carry 
out their functions.</p>

<h2>What happens afterwards?</h2>

<p>After the declaration has been registered, the declaration officially signed and 
stamped, will be sent to you, together with the documents that you sent. This copy 
will be formal evidence that your declaration of renunciation has become effective.</p>

<p>If your declaration was registered in the expectation of your acquiring another 
citizenship, but you do not do so within 6 months of the registration, you should send 
your ‘Applicant’s Copy’ of the declaration, together with a letter from the authorities 
of the other country concerned confirming that you have not acquired that country’s 
citizenship to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Department 1 
<br>UKVI 
<br>The Capital 
<br>New Hall Place 
<br>Liverpool 
<br>L3 9PP
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Your declaration will then be forwarded to the UK Visas and Immigration, or to the 
Governor of the relevant territory (if appropriate), and endorsed to show that your 
renunciation never took effect.</p>
