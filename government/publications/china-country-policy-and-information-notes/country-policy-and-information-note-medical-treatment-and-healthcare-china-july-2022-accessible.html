<span class="number">2. </span> The healthcare system</h2>

<p>2.1.1 The study paper, What can we learn from China’s health system reform?, published by the British Medical Journal in June 2019, stated:</p>

<p>‘China has implemented a comprehensive health system reform over the past decade which focused on strengthening the capacity of primary care, extending and improving social health insurance coverage, providing basic public health services to everyone, reforming public hospitals, and improving medicines policies.</p>

<p>‘Both central and local governments have mobilised substantial political and financial resources to implement the reform. Almost everyone has been covered by the social health insurance system and basic public health service package. Mark-up of drug prices has been stopped in public hospitals and primary healthcare providers. Unmet health needs and inequities in some health indicators have decreased.</p>

<p>‘Some challenges remain. The quality of care in primary healthcare has not improved greatly, mostly because of the inadequate training of the healthcare providers. The cost of medical care is still increasing as a result of incomplete reform of public hospitals including ineffective utilisation of the payment system. Inefficient use of health resources is prevalent mainly because of overuse of healthcare and uneven distribution of health resources. Healthcare delivery and financing systems are fragmented because of constraints in the governance structure.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">2.1 </span> Public health insurance</h3>

<p>2.1.1 The publication Towards universal health coverage: lessons from 10 years of healthcare reform in China, published in 2020 by British Medical Journal (BMJ) Global Health, noted that in 2018: ‘…more than 95% of the population were covered by social health insurance schemes [and]…a total of ¥42.46billion [£5.12 billion] was spent from medical assistance funds nationwide to subsidise 76.739 million people to participate in basic medical insurance…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.1.2 The Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Centre (CFIHPC) report about the Chinese healthcare system, dated 5 June 2020, stated:</p>

<p>‘China achieves near-universal [healthcare] coverage through the provision of publicly funded basic medical insurance. The urban employed are required to enroll in an employment-based program, which is funded primarily via employer and employee payroll taxes. Other residents can voluntarily enroll in Urban-Rural Resident Basic Medical Insurance, financed primarily by central and local governments through individual premium subsidies. Local health commissions organize public and private health care organizations to deliver services. The basic medical insurance plans cover primary, specialty, hospital, and mental health care, as well as prescription drugs and traditional Chinese medicine. Deductibles, copayments, and reimbursement ceilings apply.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.1.3 The study paper, An overview of the Chinese healthcare system, published on the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (United States) website in January 2021, stated:</p>

<p>‘The national medical security system in China is a multilevel system, with the basic medical insurance (BMI) as the pillar and medical aid as the backup, and commercial health insurance, charitable donations, and medical mutual aid activities as supplementary services.</p>

<p>‘The BMI system serves two groups of people: employees and residents. Employees are enrolled in the employee basic medical insurance (EBMI) program, and non-working residents are enrolled in the residents basic medical insurance (RBMI) program…As of September 2020, more than 1.35 billion people (over 95% of China’s population) are covered by one of the BMI programs, making it the world’s largest healthcare security network…</p>

<p>‘Medical aid ensures all citizens have fair access to basic medical services by supporting the section of the low-income populace to participate in the BMI by subsidizing the medical expenses that they cannot afford. Since 2018, medical aid has benefited 480 million low-income citizens, helped reduce their medical burden by approximately CNY ¥330 billion [£39.6 billion], implemented targeted poverty reduction measures for 10 million people in need who were impoverished due to illnesses, and ensured their basic medical security.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Private health insurance</h3>

<p>2.2.1 The CFIHPC report, in relation to private health insurance, stated:</p>

<p>‘Purchased primarily by higher-income individuals and by employers for their workers, private insurance can be used to cover deductibles, copayments, and other cost-sharing, as well as to provide coverage for expensive services not paid for by public insurance.</p>

<p>‘No statistics are available on the percentage of the population with private coverage. Private health insurance is provided mainly by for-profit commercial insurance companies…</p>

<p>‘Services covered: The benefit package is often defined by the local governments. Publicly financed basic medical insurance typically covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inpatient hospital care (selected provinces and cities)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Primary and specialist care</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
    <p>Emergency care</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>‘A few dental services (such as tooth extraction, but not cleaning) and optometry services are covered, but most are paid out-of-pocket. Home care and hospice care are often not included either. Durable medical equipment, such as wheelchairs and hearing aids, is often not covered.</p>

<p>‘Preventive services, such as immunization and disease screening, are included in a separate public-health benefit package funded by the central and local governments; every resident is entitled to these without copayments or deductibles. Coverage is person-specific; there are no family or household benefit arrangements.</p>

<p>‘Maternity care is also covered by a separate insurance program; it is currently being merged into the basic medical insurance plan.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Organisation and provision of healthcare</h3>

<p>2.3.1 The Bain and Company (global consultancy) article, How the Coronavirus Will Transform Healthcare in China, dated 4 March 2020, stated:</p>

<p>‘China’s tiered healthcare system – in which smaller community health centers (CHCs) and Class I institutions provide first-contact care, and larger Class II and III institutions provide specialist referral services – is designed to distribute patients based on need, freeing up resources at big, congested facilities…While Beijing and other cities have made some headway with recent decreases in Class III visits, patients still habitually seek treatment from large hospitals…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.3.2 The CFIHPC report stated:</p>

<p>‘China’s central government has overall responsibility for national health legislation, policy, and administration. It is guided by the principle that every citizen is entitled to receive basic health care services. Local governments — provinces, prefectures, cities, counties, and towns — are responsible for organizing and providing these services.</p>

<p>‘Both national and local health agencies and authorities have comprehensive responsibilities for health quality and safety, cost control, provider fee schedules, health information technology, clinical guidelines, and health equity.’9</p>

<p>2.3.3 The CFIHPC report also stated: ‘Primary care is delivered primarily by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Village doctors and community health workers in rural clinics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General practitioners (GPs) or family doctors in rural township and urban community hospitals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medical professionals (doctors and nurses) in secondary and tertiary hospitals…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>‘Hospitals can be public or private, nonprofit or for-profit. Most township hospitals and community hospitals are public, but both public and private secondary and tertiary hospitals exist in urban areas.</p>

<p>‘Rural township hospitals and urban community hospitals are often regarded as primary care facilities, more like village clinics than actual hospitals.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.3.4 The CFIHPC report further stated:</p>

<p>‘The National Health Commission directly owns some hospitals in Beijing, and national universities (directly administrated by the Ministry of Education) also own affiliated hospitals. Local government health agencies in each province may have a similar structure and often own provincial hospitals.</p>

<p>‘Hospitals are paid through a combination of out-of-pocket payments, health insurance compensation, and, in the case of public hospitals, government subsidies.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Number of facilities and personnel</h3>

<p>2.4.1 OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] data indicates that there were 2.24 doctors per 1,000 of the population in 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>, and there were 3.1 nurses per 1,000 of the population in 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>2.4.2 The CFIHPC report stated: ‘In 2018, there were approximately 12,000 public hospitals and 21,000 private hospitals (excluding township hospitals and community hospitals), of which about 20,500 were nonprofit and 12,600 were for-profit.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.4.3 The CFIHPC report also stated:</p>

<p>‘In 2018, there were 506,003 public primary care facilities and 437,636 private village clinics. Village doctors, who are not licensed GPs, can work only in village clinics. In 2018, there were 907,098 village doctors and health workers. Village clinics in rural areas receive technical support from township hospitals…</p>

<p>‘In 2018, China had 308,740 licensed and assistant GPs, representing 8.6 percent of all licensed physicians and assistant physicians.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.5.1 A number of NGOs have been active in China – constructing hospitals<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>, providing access to medical care services<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>, and helping vulnerable persons<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>2.5.2 The CFIHPC report stated:</p>

<p>‘Safety nets: For individuals who are not able to afford individual premiums for publicly financed health insurance or cannot cover out-of-pocket spending, a medical financial assistance program, funded by local governments and social donations, serves as a safety net in both urban and rural areas.</p>

<p>‘The medical financial assistance program prioritizes catastrophic care expenses, with some coverage of emergency department costs and other expenses. Funds are used mainly to pay for individual deductibles, copayments, and medical spending exceeding annual benefit caps, as well as individual premiums for publicly financed health insurance. In 2018, 76.7 million people (approximately 5.5% of the population) received such assistance for health insurance enrollment, and 53.6 million people (3.8% of the population) received funds for direct health expenses.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Availability and accessibility to medical treatment and drugs</h3>

<p>2.6.1 The publication, Towards universal health coverage: lessons from 10 years of healthcare reform in China, published in 2020 by British Medical Journal (BMJ) Global Health, noted that:</p>

<p>‘As the base of drug supply and security system, the national essential medicines system reform is comprehensive and includes but is not limited to the following: the selection, production and distribution of essential medicines; quality assurance; reasonable pricing; tendering and procurement; a zero mark-up policy on sales; rational use and reimbursement; and monitoring and evaluation. The government issued a revision of the National Essential Medicines List (NEML) in 2009 including a list of 307 essential medicines, and constantly expands the list to fully meet the needs of basic healthcare. These on-list medicines should be available at all primary care institutions. To improve access to medicines, China boosted the research and development of generic drugs, and required the evaluation of generics to prove they are equivalent to the originator products in terms of quality and efficacy. A ‘two invoice policy’ tendering system was developed to avoid higher mark-up and reduce circulation during the process of distribution. All medicines in the NEML are included in health insurance reimbursement lists, which are reimbursed at higher rates compared with non-essential medicines.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.6.2 The study paper, An overview of the Chinese healthcare system, published on the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website in January 2021, stated:</p>

<p>‘The NHSA [National Healthcare Security Administration] has implemented dynamic adjustments to the catalog of medicines covered by the national health security system and issued the Interim Measures on the administration of Medicines under the Basic Medical Insurance…</p>

<p>‘An example of this has been in the management of hepatitis-related drugs. In recent years, with the continuous efforts of the government, the price of drugs for viral hepatitis has been reduced substantially. In 2015, the annual treatment cost of hepatitis B antiviral drugs, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and entecavir, was about CNY ¥20,000 [£2,396] and CNY ¥9,000 per [£1,078] person, respectively. In 2018, after the “4+7” Pilot Program was launched, the annual treatment cost of TDF and entecavir was decreased to CNY ¥210–240 [£25.16 - £28.75] per person. In 2019, after more cities were included in the pilot program, the cost of the two drugs was further decreased to CNY ¥70 [£8.38].’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.6.3 The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (US-C ESRC) Staff Research Report, China’s Healthcare System: Addressing Capacity Shortfalls before and after COVID-19, published in March 2021, stated:</p>

<p>‘China’s healthcare system is underequipped to handle the growing burden of chronic disease. It is over-reliant on urban hospitals to provide basic care, and the primary care system, which should play a significant role in chronic disease management, is underutilized. Beijing’s healthcare policies have long tried to foster preventative and primary care as the most cost-effective way to provide healthcare services to China’s large population. However, primary care physicians, particularly those in rural areas, typically receive less training and are consequently less trusted by patients, who prefer to visit urban hospitals even for relatively minor conditions such as fevers and headaches. Moreover, the expansion of healthcare coverage has enabled more patients to self-refer to facilities with a higher quality of care, leading to overcrowding at urban hospitals.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.6.4 The US-C ESRC Staff Research Report, China’s Healthcare System: Addressing Capacity Shortfalls before and after COVID-19, also stated:</p>

<p>‘Although the Chinese government claims to provide universal health insurance to its population, many Chinese people still struggle to afford quality healthcare. About 95 percent of the population receive some form of public health insurance, but the level of coverage varies significantly with geography and rural residents tend to receive less coverage than their urban compatriots…</p>

<p>‘In theory, healthcare is less expensive in rural areas, but since rural residents seeking higher quality care travel to visit physicians at urban hospitals, the cost of treatment is disproportionately high for the rural population…</p>

<p>‘The financial burden for those with serious illnesses is considerably higher. For example, the average cost of a hospitalization in 2019 was $1,389 (RMB 9,848) [£1,170.23]<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup>, or 12.6 percent of the average annual wage. To fill the gap, Chinese insurance giants like Ping An and China Life offer commercial products that cover critical illness, medical reimbursement, disability income, and long-term care.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.6.5 The US-C ESRC Staff Research Report also stated:</p>

<p>‘Corruption among China’s hospitals and doctors is a widely acknowledged problem…In many cases, doctors accept illicit payments, known as hongbao, from patients in exchange for a higher quality of care…</p>

<p>‘In addition to accepting these payments from patients, doctors and hospital officials also receive kickbacks for purchasing certain types of medical equipment or pharmaceutical products, a practice that has been described as “endemic” in China…</p>

<p>‘Corruption in China’s healthcare system is driven by persistent funding shortfalls that have created strong incentives for hospital systems and doctors to accept bribes…</p>

<p>‘Hospitals in China have similarly struggled with resource shortfalls. In 2018, only 10 percent of funding for public hospitals came from government subsidies. The majority of funding comes from service charges and drug sales; however, Chinese regulations place ceilings on the markups that may be charged on many medical treatments and drugs. These price controls cut down on an important potential revenue stream and lead many hospitals to seek funds through illicit payments.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.6.6 The Australian government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) Country Information Report – People’s Republic of China, published on 22 December 2021, noted: ‘Bribery in healthcare is also reported, for example offering cash for prioritised procedures’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>2.6.7 The DFAT Country Information Report – People’s Republic of China, also stated: ‘Health care varies significantly between urban and rural areas. Urban centres have better quality healthcare, but only for those with the relevant urban hukou (household registration).’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.6.8 The Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) on its website designed to provide British nationals with an overview of medical treatment in China, noted: ‘…medical care is generally good in major cities in China, though some hospitals can be very crowded and have long waiting times… Outside major cities, the standard of healthcare is variable; it can sometimes be poor and disorganised. With the exception of clinics oriented towards foreign patients, GP clinics are an uncommon phenomenon.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">2.7 </span> Emergency healthcare</h3>

<p>2.7.1 The Allianz Care article, Healthcare in China, undated, stated: ‘Some rural areas have very limited emergency services, but urban areas are generally well serviced…Emergency response personnel are well trained and professional…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.7.2 The HMP Global Learning Network article, EMS Around the World: China Prioritizes Better EMS, published in January 2020, stated:</p>

<p>‘Despite a significant increase in investment by the government in the national EMS [emergency medical services] sector in recent years, the quality of services provided in China remains generally low, even compared with other emerging nations…</p>

<p>‘According to experts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong—a leading institution of research and higher education located in Shatin, Hong Kong— the biggest problems of Chinese EMS are an acute shortage of ambulances in the country and existing services that can’t meet the needs of the country’s nearly 1.4 billion people.</p>

<p>‘Those problems remain pressing despite an order last year from the Ministry of Health that specified every city should have at least one ambulance for every 50,000 people. The majority of Chinese cities and provinces do not meet these requirements.</p>

<p>‘The situation is slightly better in large industrial cities of the country, such as Beijing and Shanghai, where official responses can be supplemented by unofficial services for those who can pay. However, in rural, remote areas of the country, the levels of accessible EMS are close to catastrophic. In rural areas and smaller cities, prehospital emergency services—accessed in China through the emergency number 1-2-0—may not be available at all…</p>

<p>‘Currently the Chinese EMS system is divided into three parts: prehospital emergency services, emergency departments, and intensive care units.</p>

<p>Prehospital emergency services include ambulance services and prehospital care funded primarily by provincial and city bureaus of public health…</p>

<p>‘The cost of emergency treatment is usually covered by patients themselves, although roughly 25% of the urban population has medical insurance.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.7.3 The West China Hospital of Sichuan University (Chengdu) (WCHSU) website stated:</p>

</div>

<p>4.1.1 The Biomedcentral report, COVID-19 and healthcare system in China: challenges and progression for a sustainable future, published in January 2021, stated:</p>

<p>‘Physical hospitals failed to efficiently function both for patients infected with COVID-19 and those with other diseases during the epidemic.</p>

<p>‘In some of the hardest-hit cities, medical resources were not available for every COVID-19 patient…</p>

<p>‘A considerably wider hospital-related transmission of the virus was reported in physical hospitals. Patients with atypical clinical manifestations were also contagious during the incubation period. Similarly, frontline healthcare workers were exposed to a high risk of infection, increasing the transmission to patients hospitalized for other diseases. To control the nosocomial spread of the virus, a large number of physical hospitals postponed or canceled outpatient appointments…</p>

<p>‘As the epidemic progressed, almost all tertiary and secondary hospitals across the country experienced a serious dearth of medical resources… The number of beds available in the hospitals designated for treating coronavirus patients was insufficient. The scarce supply of qualified medical resources further aggravated the healthcare burden…</p>

<p>‘To solve the dilemma between the demand for medical care and the inaccessibility of medical services, the Chinese government has issued a series of policies, such as the incorporation of online medical services and long-term prescription into medical insurance, to empower Internet hospitals and thereby address public health emergencies…</p>

<p>‘Most Internet hospitals are based on physical hospitals where patients receive almost the same medical services as those in physical hospitals, such as prescriptions and health insurance programs. The COVID-19 epidemic is the first instance in which Internet hospitals were involved in a public health emergency caused by an infectious disease.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.2 The Blavatnik School Working Paper, Chinese Provincial Government Responses to COVID-19, dated 25 January 2022, stated:</p>

<p>‘Five major waves of COVID-19 outbreaks have hit China since the beginning of 2021, tied to imported sources. The second, third, and fourth surges were caused by the Delta variant, two of which spread to more than ten provinces, and both the Delta and Omicron variants spread across provinces during the latest wave.</p>

<p>‘In coping with the Delta variant, China has maintained the policy target of “dynamic clearance”, aiming to halt all community transmission of COVID- 19, while the response patterns have gradually transitioned along five stages through 2021 and into 2022: 1) widespread preventative measures in January 2021 in anticipation of greater mixing during the Chinese New Year season, 2) A relatively low baseline level of prevention and control measures from March to June, 3) A reactive response in July to the Delta variant, 4) relatively high baseline prevention and control measures from August to October, and 5) more targeted measures in November and December…</p>

<p>‘Apart from Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), China has fully vaccinated more than 85% of people, and more than 0.33 bn (23%) people have received booster shots by 6 January 2022. The government is now working to promote booster shots further.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup></p>

<p>‘In response to its biggest outbreak in two years, China has continued to enforce what it calls the “dynamic zero-COVID” approach…</p>

<p>‘That requires lockdowns and mass testing, with close contacts often being quarantined at home or in a central government facility. The strategy focuses on eradicating community transmission of the virus as quickly as possible, sometimes by locking down entire cities…</p>

<p>‘National data released earlier this month showed that over 52 million people aged 60 and older have yet to be vaccinated with any COVID-19 vaccine. Booster rates are also low, with only 56.4% of people between 60-69 having received a booster shot, and 48.4% of people between 70-79 having received one.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup></p>

<p>‘Hong Kong has been in the grip of a spiralling outbreak of the Omicron variant of Covid, with a fifth wave sweeping the city since December end last year, overwhelming healthcare facilities. Hospitals have been swamped with an influx of Covid patients and morgues are at breaking point.</p>

<p>‘Researchers at the University of Hong Kong have estimated that about 3.6 million residents of Hong Kong – out of a total population of 7.4 million – have been infected with Covid through 14 March [2022]…</p>

<p>7.1.1 The BMC Oral Health November 2020 research paper, Dentists’ entrepreneurial intention and associated factors in public hospitals in major cities in Guangdong (South China): a cross-sectional study, stated:</p>

<p>‘It is estimated that over 85% of the dental costs have to be paid out of pocket. Many urban middle-class residents, especially those in central cities, prefer to choose private dental clinics because they are willing to and can afford to pay for the better patient experience provided by private dental clinics. These private clinics can provide a facility with a patient-friendly environment, patient communications with patients, advanced diagnostic and treatment equipment, a short or no waiting time, flexibility in appointments, and so on.</p>

<p>‘At the current stage, the dental care supply in China is still insufficient to meet the rising demand. By 2018, there were 314,347 trained dentistry personnel in mainland China, among whom 171,587 (54.6%) were dentists, 37.8% were dental nurses and 7.6% were dental technicians. The density of dentistry personnel (per 1000 population) was about 0.129 in 2018, while the WHO standard is 0.2. There were in total 75,399 dental service units among all healthcare providers in mainland China. By institution number, 73.8% of these service units exist as dental departments of general hospitals.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:99" rel="footnote">[footnote 99]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.1.3 The scientific research report, Socio–Economic Disparities in Dental Health and Dental Care Utilisation Among Older Chinese, published in the International Dental Journal in February 2021, stated:</p>

<p>‘Dental care services have improved in China from the 1990s to date…New health-policy developments in China are redefining dental care to align with the standard of oral health found in developed countries in Europe. First, related to the supply side, private dental clinics are in a phase of rapid growth as a result of sustained policy support of private health care. Twenty years ago, dental services were only available in dental hospitals and in some tertiary and secondary general hospitals in major cities. Dental care services are now provided by both hospitals and standalone clinics throughout the country…</p>

<p>‘Dental hygiene, oral examinations, X-rays, root canal treatment, treatments for gum disease and provision of crowns are not covered by the social medical insurance. Moreover, from the supply side, most dental hospitals and dental departments in general hospitals are owned by local governments but have a high level of market orientation that focuses on meeting the needs of clients. Most standalone dental clinics are privately owned and managed.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:101" rel="footnote">[footnote 101]</a></sup></p>

<p>24.1.1 The National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (United States) study paper, Geriatric medicine in China: The past, present, and future, published in June 2018, stated:</p>

<p>‘As a result of the impressive achievements made in the last 30 years, geriatric medicine in China now serves as an integral part of the nation’s medical profession…</p>

<p>‘On close examination, however, a number of weaknesses still persist. In chronic care management, levels of awareness, treatment, and control for common diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia among the elderly are very low. This is because the healthcare network is insufficient and fails to provide basic services to seniors, especially those in the countryside. Even at major hospitals, the principles of geriatric care have not been incorporated into clinical procedures. The prevailing practice is single‐disease–based management, while little thought is given to multimorbidity and comprehensive geriatric assessment is not routinely conducted. Another notable problem is a deficiency in the long‐term care structure, specifically the severe shortage of nursing homes and well‐trained personnel. Consequently, transitions between healthcare settings are often impractical.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:167" rel="footnote">[footnote 167]</a></sup></p>

<p>24.1.2 A MedCOI response, dated 14 April 2020, noted that homecare/assistance nursing, orthopaedic devices, and 24/7 care in a nursing home for vulnerable elderly persons were available in China<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:168" rel="footnote">[footnote 168]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>24.1.3 The Voice of America report, In Fast-Aging China, Elder Care Costs Loom Large, dated 23 May 2021, stated:</p>

<p>‘According to the latest official census data, those 60 and over now make up 18.7% of the population, or 264 million people…Those 65 and above accounted for 13.5% of the population in 2020…</p>

<p>‘As the demand for elder care increases in China, so does the shortage of affordable assisted living facilities and nursing homes…According to The Rooth Law Firm of Chicago, in 2014, less than 3% of China’s aged population could find accommodation in nursing homes.</p>

<p>‘In cities such as Shanghai or Beijing, the cost of a nursing home ranges from $310 (2,000 RMB) (£236)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:169" rel="footnote">[footnote 169]</a></sup> per month to $3,100 (20,000 RMB per month) (£2,360)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:170" rel="footnote">[footnote 170]</a></sup>, with the requirement of purchasing at least a one-year lease.</p>

<p>‘In Shanghai, according to China Daily, only 3% of the city’s elderly population is cared for in nursing homes. The majority — 90% — remain at home, and they or their families hire a caregiver to provide some form of assistance at a monthly cost of $450-$700 (3,000-4,500 RMB) (£354 -£531)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:171" rel="footnote">[footnote 171]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>‘”Obtaining a spot in a nursing home has become incredibly competitive,” the law firm said, “The top social welfare home in Beijing has a waiting list of more than 10,000 applicants, and only approximately 1,100 beds in the facility, with only about 12 spots opening up annually.”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:172" rel="footnote">[footnote 172]</a></sup></p>

<p>24.1.4 The World Health Organisation report, Caring for the health of the elderly in China, dated 28 May 2021, stated:</p>

<p>‘China has been innovating for improved access of older people to integrated care, by means of a community-based social and health care system that covers also chronic disease control and prevention, strengthened health services and is staffed with a large health workforce.</p>

<p>‘In March 2015, the former National Health and Family Planning Commission officially approved the establishment of the National Center for Gerontology. This made it possible to integrate scientific research, clinical care, rehabilitation services, public health policies and health management into one.</p>

<p>‘The Center is based at Beijing Hospital, an institution with long experience in gerontological research, training and care, networked with more than 60 medical institutions across the country.</p>

<p>‘The Center is responsible for the prevention and control of ageing-related poor health in China, primarily through: developing national strategies, leading critical research, promoting the health of older people in remote areas, training of health professionals, and international exchange of knowledge and ideas in the area of ageing.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:173" rel="footnote">[footnote 173]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">25.1 </span> Overview</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Section 25 updated: 4 February 2022</p>
</div>

<p>25.1.1 The Consortium Psychiatricum 2020 report, Promotion of Mental Health Rehabilitation in China: Community-Based Mental-Health Services, stated:</p>

<p>‘Mental health services are mainly provided by psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, social workers and clinical psychologists in mental health centres, by general practitioners and community nurses in community health centres and by social workers, clinical psychologists, rehabilitation therapists and occupational therapists in other government or social organizations. These services cover inpatient and outpatient treatment, hospital and community rehabilitation, health education, psychotherapy and vocational rehabilitation. Patients with mental illnesses can seek mental health services both in mental health centres and community health centres…Psychiatric hospitals are mainly in charge of medical treatment for severe mental disorders, through inpatient and outpatient treatment, hospital-based rehabilitation and health education. When a patient’s condition has stabilized, they are referred to CHCs, which are responsible for rehabilitation and health education. If the patient is willing to accept follow-up services, mental health service providers will provide patients and their guardians advice on how to maintain stability. If the patient is relatively stable, they may attend community-based rehabilitation facilities. These facilities provide services including antipsychotic maintenance therapy, behaviour therapy, social skills training, vocational rehabilitation and family education. If the patient relapses, they are referred to hospital…</p>

<p>‘The quality and coverage of mental health services have been greatly improved.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:174" rel="footnote">[footnote 174]</a></sup></p>

<p>25.1.2 The China Daily report, Experts call for increased mental health funding, dated 7 October 2021, stated:</p>

<p>‘Health experts have called for increasing investment in mental health services in China, as a recent study has revealed that only 0.5 percent of people suffering depressive disorders received adequate treatment.</p>

<p>‘It is estimated that 9.5 percent of individuals diagnosed with different degrees of depressive symptoms used mental health services, much lower than about 57.3 percent in the United States and other high-income countries, according to a study led by Chinese researchers and published on the online version of The Lancet Psychiatry on Sept 21.</p>

<p>‘An even lower 3.6 percent of patients sought treatment from psychiatric specialists. About 7 percent visited healthcare institutions or took psychotropic drugs, 0.3 percent enlisted help from social services, and 2.7 percent turned to traditional Chinese medicine or other alternative therapies, the study said.</p>

<p>‘The findings were based on a survey conducted on the Chinese mainland from 2013 to 2015 involving more than 32,500 people aged 18 or above.</p>

<p>‘Researchers from the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Peking University Sixth Hospital’s Institute of Mental Health and several other institutions analyzed data from the survey and co-authored the paper.</p>

<p>‘”Our study showed that only a small percentage of people with a depressive disorder accessed treatment and very few received adequate treatment,” it said.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:175" rel="footnote">[footnote 175]</a></sup></p>

<p>25.1.3 The Australian government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) Country Information Report – People’s Republic of China, published on 22 December 2021, stated:</p>

<p>‘The government has increased investments in mental health services over the last decade but services remain inadequate. A 2019 article by Chinese academics published in the BMJ General Psychiatry journal found a 17.5 per cent prevalence of mood disorders. It found that, despite the high prevalence of disorders, the rate of people receiving treatment was low, in part due to social stigma, and a lack of funding, mental health beds and mental health professionals. Most of those resources were found in provincial capitals in the more developed east coast of the country.</p>

<p>‘Although demand for mental health services is growing, many people remain reluctant to seek help due to stigma associated with mental illness.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:176" rel="footnote">[footnote 176]</a></sup></p>

<p>A ‘Terms of Reference’ (ToR) is a broad outline of what the country information note (CIN) seeks to cover. They form the basis for the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Country_information">country information section</a>. The Home Office’s Country Policy and Information Team uses some standardised ToRs, depending on the subject, and these are then adapted depending on the country concerned.</p>
