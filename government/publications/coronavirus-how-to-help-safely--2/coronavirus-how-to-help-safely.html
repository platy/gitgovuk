<p>This guidance is for volunteers in England.</p>
</div>

<p>The most important thing you can do to fight coronavirus is to follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">social distancing guidance</a>. This will help control the virus and save lives.</p>

<p>Whether you choose to volunteer will depend on the type of activities you would like to do, and the risks associated with that for you as an individual. We recommend that you check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/volunteering/coronavirus-volunteering">guidance on how to manage the risk of coronavirus</a> before you volunteer. If you volunteer via an organisation you should also contact them for advice on if it is safe for you to volunteer.</p>

<p>When volunteering you should follow <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/voluntary/index.htm" class="govuk-link">health and safety guidance</a>, using safety measures appropriate to the risk.</p>

<p>This guidance is for people who are volunteering to help others during the coronavirus pandemic. It also includes advice for people who are receiving help from a volunteer. It applies in England only.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Stay safe as a volunteer</h2>

<p>You can leave home to provide voluntary or charitable services. You must volunteer from home unless it is not reasonably possible for you to do so. You can read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/volunteering/coronavirus-volunteering">coronavirus volunteering guidance</a> on how restrictions apply to volunteering and how to stay safe while undertaking your role.</p>

<p>This also covers information for volunteers on accessing vaccines and coronavirus testing.</p>

<p>If you are volunteering through a voluntary or community group, contact that organisation for advice on how you can stay safe.</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus-volunteer-local" class="govuk-link">local authority</a> can support you to help others. You can also find tips and guidance from <a rel="external" href="https://www.ncvo.org.uk/ncvo-volunteering/i-want-to-volunteer/volunteering-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">NCVO</a>.</p>

<p>Further guidelines on staying safe can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">staying safe outside your home</a>.</p>

<p>If you have symptoms of COVID-19 — a high temperature, new and persistent cough or anosmia, however mild — you should self-isolate immediately from when your symptoms started and for at least 10 full days following OR if you are not experiencing symptoms but have tested positive for COVID-19 you should self-isolate immediately starting from the day the test was taken and for at least 10 full days following.</p>

<p>If you have tested positive whilst not experiencing symptoms but develop symptoms during the isolation period, you should restart the 10 day isolation period from the day you develop symptoms and isolate for a further 10 full days.</p>

<p>You can find information on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works#how-the-nhs-test-and-trace-service-works" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace service guidance page</a>, including what happens if you test positive for COVID-19 or have had close contact with someone who has tested positive.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>If you’re worried about someone’s health</h3>

<p>Contact the NHS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Online: <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/">NHS 111 online Coronavirus service</a> (for help and advice)</li>
  <li>Phone: 111 (if symptoms get worse)</li>
  <li>Phone: 999 (if someone’s life is at risk)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are worried about someone’s mental health, tell them to get help and support from <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/urgent-support/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Every Mind Matters</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Helping someone who is shielding</h3>

<p>If you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">helping someone who is being advised to shield</a>, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus-shielding-support">register them</a> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>request priority access to a supermarket delivery slot</li>
  <li>tell their council if they need support to follow shielding guidance</li>
  <li>make sure their details, such as their address, are up to date</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Stay safe if a volunteer is helping you</h2>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing">guidance on staying alert and safe (social distancing)</a>. Your safety is important and must come first.</p>

<p>The below are recommendations you should follow when a volunteer is helping you, especially if the volunteer is unknown to you.</p>

<p>If a volunteer is helping you while you stay at home:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not give them your credit or debit card numbers or other financial information</li>
  <li>ask for ID if someone you do not know calls at your home</li>
  <li>only share your phone number or address if you need to</li>
  <li>only give your information on a need-to-know basis</li>
  <li>do not let them pressure you into giving information</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that volunteers should not enter your home, unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>If you have serious concerns about the behaviour of someone who is helping you, report this to the police.</p>
