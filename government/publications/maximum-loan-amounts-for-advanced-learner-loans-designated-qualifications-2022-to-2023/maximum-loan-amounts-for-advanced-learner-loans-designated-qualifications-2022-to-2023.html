<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State, acting through the Department for Education (DfE) approves the qualifications eligible for funding with Advanced Learner Loans (Loans). An approved qualification is one that has been through the DfE  nomination process and meets the criteria detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualification-funding-approval">2022 to 2023 qualifications funding approval manual</a>.</p>

<p>This document describes the methodology for establishing maximum loan amounts for approved loans qualifications. It confirms what the maximum loan amounts are for all approved loans qualifications, where learners start these qualifications in the funding year; between 1 August 2022 to 31 July 2023 (inclusive). These maximum loan amounts will not change throughout the funding year and will apply for the full duration of an approved loans qualification, including if it extends into the 2023 to 2024 funding year or beyond.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Understanding the terminology</h2>

<p>The term ‘we’ refers to the Education and Skills Funding Agency. When we refer to ‘you’ or ‘providers’, this includes colleges, higher education (HE) institutions, training organisations, local authorities and employers that receive funding from us to deliver education and training.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Establishing the maximum loan amount</h2>

<p>There is a single set of maximum loan amounts for all approved loans qualifications, no matter how you deliver these qualifications.</p>

<p>We use a ‘matrix’ (table) to set maximum loan amounts. The matrix contains 2 criteria to decide the appropriate amount for each qualification:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type of qualification or the size of the qualification in guided learning hours (GLH)</li>
  <li>the programme weighting for the qualification</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the following exceptions, where we set the maximum loan amounts as a matter of policy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GCE AS-levels</li>
  <li>GCE A-levels</li>
  <li>Access to HE Diplomas</li>
  <li>5 specialist Dance and Drama Diplomas</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Size and type of the qualification</h2>

<p>We use Ofqual’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://register.ofqual.gov.uk/" rel="external">Register of regulated qualifications</a> (RRQ) to define the size of the qualifications by their GLH, or if this is not available, the minimum GLH.</p>

<p>We have maintained the same maximum loan amounts for qualifications that we designated for loans in 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>The minimum loan amount is £300.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Programme weightings</h2>

<p>Programme weightings recognise the relative costs of providing training in different sectors and subjects and are included within maximum loan amounts.</p>

<p>To set programme weightings, we refer to the sector subject area (SSA) detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex">annex to this document</a>. We have also set a limited number of exceptions. The awarding organisation decides the SSA for all qualifications as part of the regulation process. For further information, please refer to Ofqual’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://register.ofqual.gov.uk/" rel="external">RRQ</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ava.accesstohe.ac.uk/SubSites/PublicSearch/search.aspx" rel="external">Quality Assurance Agency</a> website.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>The matrix</h2>

<p>The ‘matrix’ in tables 1 and 2 show the maximum loan amounts for designated qualifications in 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The ‘Qualification size’ column in table 1 is for some qualifications that we set a maximum loan amount for in 2015 to 2016 and are still available in 2022 to 2023. It is for information only. We have not used it for setting maximum loan amounts for new qualifications since 2016 to 2017.</p>
