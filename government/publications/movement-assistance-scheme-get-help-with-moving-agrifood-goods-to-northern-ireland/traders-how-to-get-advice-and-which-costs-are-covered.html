<p>The Movement Assistance Scheme (MAS) means that if you’re a trader moving agri-food goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, you do not need to pay for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some inspections</li>
  <li>some certificates</li>
  <li>the full cost of <a class="govuk-link" href="#scrapie-disease">testing for scrapie disease</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme will close at the end of December 2023.</p>

<p>The following types of goods are included in the scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#live-animals">live animals and animal products</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#plants">plants and plant products</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#high-risk">some categories of high risk food and feed not of animal origin (<abbr title="High risk food and feed not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr>)</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>There is separate guidance if you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/movement-assistance-scheme-get-help-with-moving-agrifood-goods-to-northern-ireland/certifiers-claim-money-for-inspecting-and-certifying-goods">inspect and certify these goods, for example if you’re an official veterinarian (OV)</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The scheme also covers movements to Northern Ireland through the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<h2>Live animals and animal products</h2>

<p>If you move live animals or animal products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, you do not need to pay the full amount for export health certificates (<abbr title="export health certificates">EHCs</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Support attestations</h3>

<p>If you’re a trader and have been told by your certifying officer to get a support attestation (SA) you can get reimbursed for some of the costs.</p>

<p>You’ll need to pay the invoice and then apply to MAS to be reimbursed. The government will reimburse you up to £150 excluding VAT for each SA.  Follow guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/support-attestations-get-reimbursed-to-move-goods-from-great-britain-to-northern-ireland">how to get reimbursed for support attestations</a>.</p>

<h3>If you need help with costs of SAs</h3>

<p>For queries related to SAs, please contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> by email or phone.</p>

<p>Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MAS_SAinvoices@apha.gov.uk">MAS_SAinvoices@apha.gov.uk</a><br>
Telephone: 0208 026 5644</p>

<h3>Test for scrapie disease</h3>

<p>To get an <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> for sheep, you must carry out the test for scrapie disease. The official vet (<abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr>) will need to see the results of the tests before they can authorise the certification. You do not need to pay the full cost of the scrapie genotype test.</p>

<p>OVs and other official certifiers will not charge you for inspecting and certifying your sheep. Instead, they can invoice the government for the costs of the certificate and scrapie test, up to a set amount.</p>

<h4>If you have scrapie qualifying status</h4>

<p>Some of the costs of scrapie qualifying status (SQS) are covered by MAS. These include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>annual membership fee paid to Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC)</li>
  <li>cost of vet providing annual flock inspection up to £150 excluding VAT</li>
  <li>costs associated with fallen stock, including scrapie testing, carcass collection and carcass disposal</li>
</ul>

<p>You must pay the company that collects the fallen stock and the processing site. You can claim the money back from the government using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reimbursement-of-scrapie-qualifying-status-costs-application">SQS reimbursement application form</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Plants or plant products</h2>

<p>If your business is moving plants or plant products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, you do not need to pay for the phytosanitary certificates (PCs). Government inspectors will not charge you for inspecting and certifying your goods.</p>

<p>If you move fruit, vegetables or cut flowers from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, you may be eligible for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/resources/pheats-hompage/" rel="external">plant health exports audited trader scheme (<abbr title="plant health exports audited trader scheme">PHEATS</abbr>)</a>. This means you’ll be able to do your own inspections and apply for phytosanitary certificates to be issued.</p>

<p>You do not need to pay for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an inspection fee when you first register with <abbr title="plant health exports audited trader scheme">PHEATS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>auditing or monitoring fees (charged per audit)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get financial support for International Seed Testing Association (<abbr title="International Seed Testing Association">ISTA</abbr>) sample testing and certification. You need both of these to move individual seed lots from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Read guidance on what you need to do to move <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-plants-and-plant-products-from-great-britain-and-northern-ireland#temporary-operational-measures-for-movement-of-some-goods-from-gb-to-ni">plants and plant products</a>.</p>

<h2>Organic products</h2>

<p>If your business moves organic products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, you do not need to pay for a certificate of inspection (<abbr title="certificate of inspection">COI</abbr>). Organic control bodies will not charge you for inspecting and certifying the goods. Instead, they can invoice the government for the costs.</p>

<p>Use the Trade Control and Expert System NT (Traces NT) to apply for COIs.</p>

<p>You’ll pay a registration fee when you register with an organic control body that’s based in the UK. If you intend to move goods outside of Great Britain, you’ll need to pay for an exporter licence. If you’re a business based in Northern Ireland and you receive goods from Great Britain, you’ll need to pay for an importer licence.</p>

<p>You may receive financial help from the government for importer and exporter licensing costs you incur to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>move organics from Great Britain solely to Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>receive organics in Northern Ireland solely from Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because before the UK and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> implemented the Northern Ireland Protocol, you would not have incurred these costs.</p>

<p>You’ll need to pay the full registration fee to an organic control body and then claim back the importer and exporter cost one year after you paid your registration fee.</p>

<p>Read guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-and-exporting-organic-food#moving-organic-food-from-gb-to-ni">requirements you need to meet when moving organic products</a>.</p>

<h3>If you need help moving organic products</h3>

<p>If you’re moving organic products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-defra">contact Defra</a> or your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/organic-food-uk-approved-control-bodies">organic control body</a>.</p>

<h2><abbr title="High risk food and feed not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr></h2>

<p>If your business moves the following categories of high risk food and feed not of animal origin from Great Britain to Northern Ireland you do not need to pay for a certificate or lab sampling costs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2019/1793/oj#d1e32-108-1" rel="external">Annex 2 of regulation 2019/1793</a></li>
  <li>products originating from countries listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2020.257.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ%3AL%3A2020%3A257%3ATOC#d1e32-8-1" rel="external">Annex 1 of regulation 2020/1158</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities will not charge you for inspecting and certifying the goods.</p>
