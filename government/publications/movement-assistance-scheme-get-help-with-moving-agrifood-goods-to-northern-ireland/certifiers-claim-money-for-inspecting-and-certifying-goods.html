<p>The Movement Assistance Scheme means that if you’re a certifier you must not charge for inspecting and certifying some agrifood goods or scrapie tests to issue export health certificates (<abbr title="export health certificates">EHCs</abbr>). You can claim back costs up to a set amount.</p>

<p>The following types of goods are included in the Movement Assistance Scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#live-animals">live animals and animal products</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#plants">plants and plant products</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#organics">organic products</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#high-risk">some categories of high risk food and feed not of animal origin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme also covers movements to Northern Ireland via the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<p>The scheme will close at the end of December 2023.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>There is separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/movement-assistance-scheme-get-help-with-moving-agrifood-goods-to-northern-ireland/traders-how-to-get-advice-and-which-costs-are-covered">guidance for traders</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Live animals and animal products</h2>

<p>If you’re an official veterinarian or other certifying officer, you need to invoice the government for some of the costs of the certification service you provide. You must register on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-export-health-certificate-ehc-online">Export Health Certificate (<abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr>) Online</a> to claim back your costs.</p>

<p>The government will reimburse:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to £150 excluding VAT for each non-equine <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>up to £500 excluding VAT for each equine <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can include time you spend on travel on your invoice, based on your charge out rates.</p>

<p>You can invoice the trader for the remaining amount if the total cost is more than these limits.</p>

<p>If you complete multiple <abbr title="export health certificates">EHCs</abbr> on one site visit, you can only charge once for time spent on travel.</p>

<p>You can also claim up to £150 (excluding VAT) for the costs relating to testing sheep for scrapie disease. You must do this test to get an <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> if a trader does not have scrapie qualifying status.</p>

<p>The certifying official veterinarian will invoice the government, not the trader, for the costs of the test.</p>

<p>The government is considering options to cover costs relating to support attestations - an assurance certificate of the various stages of production before you move goods to Northern Ireland - and will announce details when they’re confirmed.</p>

<h3>Get started and carry out checks</h3>

<p>You need to register on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-export-health-certificate-ehc-online"><abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> Online</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll be notified of new certification requests on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-export-health-certificate-ehc-online"><abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> Online</a>.</p>

<p>After your first request, you’ll be contacted by Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) with details of how to receive payment. You’ll then be given a purchase order number by email, which you can use when raising invoices.</p>

<p>Follow the current inspection process to perform an <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> check. If the goods pass inspection, you can sign the certificate as you do now.</p>

<p>You’ll need to sign in to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-export-health-certificate-ehc-online"><abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> Online</a> after the inspection to confirm that the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>checks have been completed</li>
  <li>details are in line with the certification you’ve provided on the <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get a reimbursement</h3>

<p>For Great Britain to Northern Ireland certificates, you should consolidate your invoices into regular batches, at least monthly.</p>

<p>You need to make sure the invoices include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individual Great Britain to Northern Ireland <abbr title="export health certificates">EHCs</abbr> which have been certified</li>
  <li>cost of each certificate</li>
  <li>purchase order number provided to you by <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to email the invoices to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ServiceDeliveryVetandExportInvoices@apha.gov.uk">ServiceDeliveryVetandExportInvoices@apha.gov.uk</a> for reimbursement.</p>

<p>You’ll receive a payment in your bank account held on file.</p>

<h2>Plants and plant products</h2>

<p>Government inspectors must not charge for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inspecting and certifying goods</li>
  <li>some of the costs incurred in getting a certificate to move plant and plant products</li>
  <li>an inspection fee when you first register with plant health exports audited trader scheme (<abbr title="plant health exports audited trader scheme">PHEATS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>auditing or monitoring fees for exporting fruit, vegetables and cut flowers from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>International Seed Testing Association (<abbr title="International Seed Testing Association">ISTA</abbr>) sample testing and certification for all individual seed lots moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h2>Organic products</h2>

<p>Organic control bodies must not charge for inspecting and certifying the goods. Instead, you can invoice the government for the costs.</p>

<p>Organic control bodies can continue to charge traders for importer and exporter licensing. If traders move goods outside of Great Britain, they’ll need to pay for an exporter licence. Businesses based in Northern Ireland that receive goods from Great Britain will need to pay for an importer licence.</p>

<p>Traders can claim these costs back if they have only moved organic goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Traders can claim the costs back one year after they paid their registration fee.</p>

<h2>High risk food and feed not of animal origin (<abbr title="high risk food and feed not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Local authorities must not charge for inspecting and certifying <abbr title="high risk food and feed not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr> products:</p>

<ul>
  <li>listed on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2019/1793/oj#d1e32-108-1" rel="external">Annex 2 of regulation 2019/1793</a>
</li>
  <li>originating from countries listed on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2020.257.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ%3AL%3A2020%3A257%3ATOC#d1e32-8-1" rel="external">Annex 1 of regulation 2020/1158</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Certifying goods to be exported from Great Britain to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries</h2>

<p>You should continue to invoice traders for certificates for Great Britain to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and Great Britain to non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries as normal.</p>
