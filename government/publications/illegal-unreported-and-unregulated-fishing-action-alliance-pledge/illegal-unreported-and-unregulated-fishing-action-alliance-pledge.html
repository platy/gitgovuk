<p>Illegal, unreported and unregulated (<abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr>) fishing is one of the biggest threats to our ocean.</p>

<p>While international, regional and national rules exist, application and implementation allows <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing to continue. Through concerted and committed political effort <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing can be ended.</p>

<p>At the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.un.org/en/conferences/ocean2022" rel="external">UN Ocean in Lisbon 2022</a>, a collection of states and non-state actors came together and committed to tackle <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing by supporting the <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> Fishing Action Alliance Pledge.</p>

<h2>Overview of the pledge</h2>

<p>The pledge commits members to:</p>

<h3>Implement international agreements</h3>

<p>International agreements to prevent <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing are already in place but membership is not complete and enforcement is varied. The alliance has committed to encourage new members to join the agreements and support existing parties to enforce measures to stop <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing.</p>

<h3>Promote active monitoring control and surveillance</h3>

<p>Effective implementation requires effective monitoring, control and surveillance (<abbr title="monitoring, control and surveillance">MCS</abbr>). The technology to do this exists but access to it remains difficult, particularly for developing states. Alliance members recognise the importance of these technologies to support <abbr title="monitoring, control and surveillance">MCS</abbr>, in particular new partnerships between state and non-state actions to enable states to access them.</p>

<h3>Encourage transparency and data sharing</h3>

<p>To maximise the effectiveness of these new technologies, access and transparency of fishery data is needed. The alliance wants all parties to promote access and sharing of data with key partners, both state and non-state.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> Fishing Action Alliance will lead international efforts to stop <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing over the coming years, and will be expanded and deepened at key upcoming international events.</p>

<h2>The pledge</h2>

<p><abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> Fishing Action Alliance Pledge:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>UNDERSTANDING the crucial role of our ocean for life on earth, that it is home to 80 percent of the planet’s biodiversity and fundamental to the food security and livelihoods of billions of people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>EMPHASISING that cooperation between States, consistent with the UN Convention on Law of the Sea and the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and well-managed and well-monitored fisheries are an essential component of healthy oceans, resilient coastal communities, and food security.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RECOGNISING that <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing threatens these ocean ecosystems, coastal communities, and global food supply by undermining fisheries management efforts and distorting trade.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CONCERNED that climate change is exacerbating these pressures on our ocean and is having a catastrophic impact on its health, including through loss of biodiversity and habitats, ocean acidification, deoxygenation and increased competition for resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FURTHER RECOGNISING that <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing can be interconnected with other troubling maritime security challenges, like forced labour, trade in illicit goods, criminal activity, and violations of global rule of law.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HIGHLIGHTING the vital importance of increasing global backing and implementation of key international agreements that address the fight against <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing and these related maritime challenges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RECALLING that countries have acknowledged the importance of combating <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing, including through Sustainable Development Goal 14.4 and 14.6, and the 2001 UN Food and Agriculture Organisation International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> Fishing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NOTING that coordination and partnerships across government agencies, between and among coastal, flag, port and market states, and with non-governmental organisations, civil society, and the private sector can assist in the fight against <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FURTHER NOTHING that data sharing and transparency play a key role in this fight by exposing bad actors and empowering governments and their stakeholders to identify and deter illegal activities, and that technological advances can support a robust <abbr title="monitoring, control and surveillance">MCS</abbr> and enforcement landscape.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Proactive measures by the alliance</h2>

<p>We, the Participants of the <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> Fishing Action Alliance commit to taking proactive measures – together and individually – to prevent, deter, and eliminate <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing, by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>SUPPORTING the effective regulation and sustainable management of fisheries in all parts of our ocean, including through the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) in which they participate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>URGING all flag States to effectively monitor and regulate their fishing vessels wherever they operate, including by maintaining and making public through appropriate means, records of those that operate beyond their national jurisdiction, and cooperate with coastal and port states to support the sustainable management of all fisheries and reduce the likelihood of illicit activities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ENCOURAGING international fisheries organisations, multilateral bodies, and States to expand existing efforts to address <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing, including through improved transparency and technology, and joint enforcement efforts that support comprehensive fisheries <abbr title="monitoring, control and surveillance">MCS</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IMPLEMENTING AND BUILDING SUPPORT for key international agreements, arrangements, and frameworks for combating <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing, including the 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WELCOMING the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies agreed at the 12th Ministerial Conference on 17 June 2022 as a step forward in curbing harmful fisheries subsidies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STRENGHENING the regulation of transshipment activities, including by adopting national and multilateral measures consistent with the FAO Voluntary Guidelines on Transshipment, when adopted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FULLY UTILISING the FAO Global Record of Fishing Vessels, Refrigerated Transport Vessels and Supply Vessels and the Global Information Exchange System as flagship fisheries transparency initiatives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ADVANCING information sharing and the interoperability of differently sourced data to enable greater international collaboration efforts and data sharing efforts worldwide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DEMONSTRATING AND PROMOTING transparency and traceability throughout the seafood supply chain, enabling market-based and import control tools and eliminating the flow of profits to <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing perpetrators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WELCOMING AND ENCOURAGING support for technology and capacity building that strengthens fisheries <abbr title="monitoring, control and surveillance">MCS</abbr>, particularly in developing countries, including but not limited to leveraging public private-partnerships, the FAO Global Capacity Development Programme and PSMA Part VI Assistance Fund, and initiatives that conduct targeted personnel training to bolster fisheries enforcement capacities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IMPROVING data collection on harmful fishing practices related to <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing, including labour abuses in the seafood supply chain, and increasing collaboration to better identify and address forced labour, unsafe working conditions, and other labour abuses in the fishing industry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ADVANCING the implementation of international instruments that address these interlinked maritime challenges, such as the 2012 International Maritime Organisation Cape Town Agreement and the 2007 International Labour Organisation Work in Fishing Convention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ACKNOWLEDGING AND SUPPORTING existing cooperative efforts to deter <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing, particularly successful collaborative approaches that occur with and between developing countries and non-governmental partners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RAISING <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing via high-level international fora and during ministerial and other high-level bilateral meetings with countries that should take additional steps to combat <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CALLING on others to join the <abbr title="iIlegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> Fishing Action Alliance by signing on to this Pledge.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
