<p>The Adding Value (<abbr title="Adding Value">AV</abbr>) grant is a competitive scheme, and you will not automatically get a grant.</p>

<p>You must receive a funding agreement offering you an <abbr title="Adding Value">AV</abbr> grant before you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>start work</li>
  <li>commit to any costs (including paying deposits)</li>
  <li>enter into any legal contracts</li>
  <li>place an order</li>
</ul>

<p>Any costs you incur before that date are at your own risk, and may make your whole project ineligible if it is considered to have been started.</p>

<p>The application process is a 2-stage process.</p>

<h2>Stage 1: check you’re eligible</h2>

<p>The online checker closed at midnight on 21 July 2022.</p>

<h2>Stage 2: make a full application</h2>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will invite you to make a full application and send you an application form if your Stage 1 online application scores highly enough.</p>

<p>You will need to complete a full application form and send this with your supporting documents to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>. You should email your completed application form to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ftf@rpa.gov.uk">ftf@rpa.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>You must email your application and all supporting documents before midnight 31 January 2024.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will assess value for money alongside the funding priorities. This may affect your overall project score.</p>

<p>You will be competing for funding so the success of your full application will also depend on the number and value of other applications received. You will not automatically get a grant.</p>

<h3>What you’ll need for your full application</h3>

<p>You will need to provide more details about your project in your full application. 
Use the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>same project that you used in your Stage 1: online application</li>
  <li>project number provided by <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> in your invitation to apply for a full application email</li>
</ul>

<p>We know that some minor project details may change since the online application was completed, for example, changes to project costs as they are finalised. However, the main details of your project should not be significantly different to your online application.</p>

<p>You should contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> by email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ftf@rpa.gov.uk">ftf@rpa.gov.uk</a> before you submit your full application if you need to discuss significant changes to your online application.</p>

<h2>What information you need to provide</h2>

<p>The full application is in 2 parts: a Word form and a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>You’ll need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information about you, your business and project</li>
  <li>a breakdown of project costs</li>
  <li>supplier details</li>
  <li>project milestones</li>
  <li>proposed throughput volumes and outputs for the project</li>
  <li>financial impact forecast</li>
  <li>an explanation of how the project will be funded</li>
  <li>details of how the project will add value to agricultural products</li>
  <li>details of previous similar grants to your business</li>
  <li>evidence of market opportunity for your project including demand for the products and impact on competitors of your project</li>
</ul>

<h3>Planning permission requirements</h3>

<p>You must submit a copy of the planning permission approval for your project with your full application.</p>

<h3>Other supporting documents</h3>

<p>You will need to provide the following supporting documents, if relevant to your project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of a signed and dated tenancy agreement with the owner(s) of the land or buildings at the project location - if the applicant business does not own them</li>
  <li>financial accounts for the most recent 3 years of trading</li>
  <li>latest tax returns, management accounts or a statement of income and expenses from an accountant (if you are a new business or self-employed)</li>
  <li>financial and production projections</li>
  <li>relevant permissions and consents - in addition to planning permission</li>
  <li>3 quotes, references to catalogue listings or formal tenders for each item valued at £5,000 or more</li>
  <li>1 quote for any item valued up to £4,999.99</li>
  <li>evidence of project funding</li>
  <li>confirmation from the supplier of any second-hand item that it is expected to last for at least 5 years, is fit for purpose and has not received previous grant funding</li>
  <li>details and draft agreement between parties where a joint venture is proposed</li>
  <li>evidence where you are eligible to, and intend to, include irrecoverable VAT in your project costs (such as a letter from a Chartered Accountant or HMRC)</li>
  <li>evidence of market demand including letters of support from third parties, or forward orders from potential customers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Volume of agricultural products processed</h3>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will monitor the volume of eligible agricultural products that are processed as a result of the <abbr title="Adding Value">AV</abbr> grant. You’ll be asked to tell us about your current (baseline) and future (post-project) processing volumes.</p>

<h2>How your application is assessed</h2>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will make sure the project is still eligible for a grant at the full application stage. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will assess your application based on the following criteria.</p>

<h3>Funding priorities</h3>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will score how well the project meets the funding priorities. These are projects that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase or improve processing</li>
  <li>grow your business</li>
  <li>process products for the first time</li>
  <li>shorten supply chains</li>
  <li>encourage collaboration and partnerships</li>
  <li>improve the environment</li>
</ul>

<p>You will have a stronger application the more you meet the grant’s funding priorities.</p>

<h3>Value for money</h3>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will score how well the project costs represent value for money. This includes the amount of grant required to deliver the following outputs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>benefits to businesses</li>
  <li>adopting new production techniques or processes</li>
  <li>creating new added value products</li>
  <li>additional turnover</li>
</ul>

<h3>Need and demand</h3>

<p>Your application needs to provide an analysis of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>business need for the project</li>
  <li>market and potential customer demand</li>
</ul>

<p>You should provide evidence to show your market research and support your conclusions.</p>

<h3>Competition</h3>

<p>You will need to provide an analysis of the potential competition of your project and evidence of your research, identifying local, regional, national or online competitors. This will help support your conclusions on demand and identify any displacement risks.</p>

<h3>Environmental benefits</h3>

<p>Tell us about any environmental benefits of the project, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using energy efficient machinery or equipment</li>
  <li>using renewable energy sources</li>
  <li>reducing food waste</li>
  <li>efficiencies in water use</li>
  <li>managing non-food waste</li>
  <li>using sustainable packaging, e.g. reducing or removing single-use plastics</li>
  <li>reducing harmful emissions or pollutants</li>
  <li>contributing to ‘Net Zero’ carbon targets</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to provide annual monitoring of any environmental benefits you declare in your full application, measuring progress against your project starting baseline.</p>

<h3>Financial viability</h3>

<p>Your project will be assessed to make sure that it is viable. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will assess:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the current financial viability of your business</li>
  <li>how the project may impact on your existing business operations</li>
  <li>how you will fund the project until the grant is claimed</li>
  <li>how the business will benefit from the project financially</li>
</ul>

<h3>Delivery and sustainability</h3>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will assess how you’ll:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the project deadline</li>
  <li>mitigate any risks to project delivery</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you’ll find out if you’re successful</h2>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> aims to give you a decision on your application within 60 working days from receipt of a complete full application.</p>

<p>If you are offered a grant, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will send a grant funding agreement (<abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr>) for you to sign and return. This will set out the legal terms and conditions of the grant, including the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amount of the grant</li>
  <li>outputs we have agreed for your project</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to change anything in the <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr> over the course of the project, you must get written agreement from <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> first. If you do not, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> could end your agreement and reclaim any grant we have already paid. You’ll get more information and help with this if you are offered a grant.</p>

<h3>If your application is unsuccessful</h3>

<p>If your application is unsuccessful, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will write to you to tell you why. If you’re unhappy with the decision, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rural-payments-agency/about/complaints-procedure">complain or appeal</a> to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> in writing, by email or by telephone.</p>
