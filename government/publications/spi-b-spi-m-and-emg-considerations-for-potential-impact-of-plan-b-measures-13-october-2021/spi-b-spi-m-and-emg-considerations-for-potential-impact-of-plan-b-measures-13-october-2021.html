<p>This paper considers the potential impact of several measures described by government as Plan B: reintroduction of working from home guidance, legally mandating face coverings in some settings, and vaccine-only certification in some limited settings. This paper should be read in conjunction with <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr>: ‘Behavioural considerations for maintaining or reintroducing behavioural interventions and introducing new measures in Autumn 2021’, which also considers increasing communication of risk, and <abbr title="Environmental Modelling Group">EMG</abbr>-<abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr>: ‘Update on transmission and environmental and behavioural mitigation strategies including in the context of Delta.’</p>

<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Plan B interventions are likely to be <strong>most effective in combination</strong> [High confidence]. Measures are not likely to be simply additive but may have complementary interactions that result in a greater cumulative impact on transmission [High confidence].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reintroduction of <strong>working from home guidance</strong>, for those who can, may have the <strong>largest impact</strong> on transmission out of the potential Plan B measures. The impact of reintroducing working from home guidance would likely largely depend on what proportion of workers are attending their workplaces at that time and the behavioural response – that is, adherence by employers and employees [Medium confidence]. There are, however, associated harms and unequal impacts that should be considered prior to implementation [High confidence].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The version of <strong>certification</strong> proposed in Plan B differs significantly from versions implemented in most other countries (both in being vaccine only and the relatively narrow range of settings in which it would apply). This absence of comparators means there is little direct evidence for the likely impact [High confidence].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vaccine-only certification</strong> as proposed may only have a very small direct impact on transmission [Medium confidence] but has potential to improve vaccine uptake in certain groups, particularly young adults [High confidence]. However, there are potential harms and inequalities that should be considered prior to implementation [High confidence].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing the range of applicable settings, time-limiting certificates based on last vaccination date, and including a requirement for proof of a negative test, could all be considered to increase the potential impact on transmission and vaccine uptake. Clear and consistent communications (with sufficient notice and positive framing) are also likely to influence outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view of the impact on transmission of <strong>face coverings</strong> remains consistent with previous <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> advice: face coverings are likely to reduce transmission through all routes by partially reducing emission of and or exposure to the full range of aerosol and droplets that carry the virus, including those that remain airborne and those that deposit on surfaces [High confidence]. Face coverings are likely to be more effective when they are manufactured from high quality materials and fit well on the face, covering the nose and the mouth [High confidence]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Face coverings are only effective if they are worn (and worn correctly). Mandating the use of face coverings in appropriate situations is likely to increase usage, which has declined significantly in England since July 2021 when it ceased to be a legal requirement [High confidence].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether Plan B will be required will depend on a range of factors, in particular <strong>vaccine and booster uptake</strong>. Increasing vaccine uptake (including boosters) continues to be the most important measure to mitigate the health impacts of the <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> epidemic in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other measures are available which, if introduced, could also make Plan B (or more stringent measures) less likely (and could potentially offer better efficiency or effectiveness) for example encouraging wider use of rapid antigen <strong>testing</strong> in workplaces and the community, and <strong>ensuring self-isolation</strong> of those who test positive by providing sufficient support [High confidence].</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1. The UK government has recently set out its plan for autumn to winter 2021 which included the possibility of reintroduction of several non-pharmaceutical interventions (<abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr>) as part of a Plan B - if data suggests the NHS is likely to come under unsustainable pressure <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Potential <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr> included a limited period of asking people to work from home where able, vaccine-only certification, legally mandating use of face coverings in certain settings and increasing communication of risk.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> has previously advised on the potential and estimated impacts of <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr> on transmission, including working from home, use of face coverings, and certification <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. However, in recent months the context in the UK has changed with the emergence of the more transmissible Delta variant, more of the adult population being vaccinated and infected, emerging evidence of waning vaccine-induced immunity, relaxation of other <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr> (including increased international travel), and currently consistently high prevalence of infection in the community.</p>

<p>3. This note discusses the available evidence for the potential impact on transmission of introduction of Plan B measures this autumn and winter, including working from home guidance, vaccine-only certification, and use of face coverings – setting out important factors and considerations that are expected to influence potential impact.</p>

<p>4. Estimating the potential impact of different measures is challenging and there are some important caveats to consider.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The impact of different measures is highly dependent on a complex network of physical, biological, and behavioural factors influenced by:
    <ul>
      <li>the epidemiological context in which measures are introduced (for example community infection rates)</li>
      <li>how measures are implemented</li>
      <li>the capability of, motivation to, and opportunities for individuals to adhere to <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>
</li>
      <li>the interactions between different measures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Evidence for the effectiveness of individual interventions is underpinned by a degree of uncertainty and challenging to collect as there are often multiple interventions in place at one time and adherence may be heterogenous, poorly understood, and difficult to measure <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. As set out in previous advice, different measures do not generally have a simple additive effect but will interact in a non-linear fashion <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Although the primary purpose of this paper is to consider the Plan B package, it should be noted that increasing vaccine uptake (including boosters) continues to be the most important measure to mitigating the health impacts of the <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> epidemic in the UK. Coverage is high in older ages, but decreases with age, and unvaccinated are clustered within areas and communities.</p>

<p>6. In addition, encouraging and supporting uptake and adherence to existing symptomatic isolation and testing policies, as well as workplaces undertaking regular rapid testing, could help to mitigate against the need to adopt additional measures over the winter, and might be more efficient or effective than the interventions proposed. Reducing ‘presenteeism’ and encouraging working from home where possible among individuals experiencing symptoms of any infectious illness would not only widen the net around <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> cases whose onwards transmission could be reduced but would also reduce the healthcare burden of other infections of concern over the winter (such as influenza, other respiratory infections). Preventing the transmission of infections within workplaces could also reduce the numbers of staff overall who are absent due to illness.</p>

<p>7. This paper should be read in conjunction with <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr>: ‘Behavioural considerations for maintaining or reintroducing behavioural interventions and introducing new measures in Autumn 2021’ <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> and <abbr title="Environmental Modelling Group">EMG</abbr>-<abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr>: ‘Update on transmission and environmental and behavioural mitigation strategies including in the context of Delta’ <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Working from home</h2>

<p>8. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> has previously advised with high confidence that working from home can reduce transmission significantly <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. Working from home reduces the risk of infection primarily by reducing the average number of contacts an individual has. The risk of infection from attending the workplace is a combination of infection risk at the workplace (which is also a combination of different risks affected by, for example, the ability to socially distance at the workplace and ventilation measures in place), risk from travelling to or from the workplace, and the risk from additional activities that would not otherwise be engaged in if working from home such as socialising with colleagues outside of the workplace.</p>

<p>9. Working from home also provides a benefit to those unable to work from home by reducing their average number of contacts and risk of exposure through reducing occupancy of settings such as public transport.</p>

<p>10. The likelihood of an individual becoming infected in a given environment will also depend on their level of immunity, whether from infection or vaccination. Factors outside of the workplace such as socioeconomic inequalities, household size, and barriers to self-isolation may also contribute to increased risk of infection for those unable to work from home.</p>

<p>11. While working from home can reduce transmission at the individual and population level, the impact of working from home <strong>guidance</strong> will depend on behaviour - the adherence to the guidance by employers and employees – which is difficult to estimate (see accompanying <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr> paper).</p>

<p>12. Estimates vary for the increased risk of infection associated with not working from home. Study findings will be affected by the state of the epidemic at the time as well as the other <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr> in place, which could have affected work attendance, crowding and contact rates (for example: school closures; the availability of support; hospitality sector shut preventing socialising; social distancing measures). <strong>Many studies are from periods of low occupancy of many workplaces and public transport when significant <abbr title="Non-pharmaceutical interventions">NPIs</abbr> were in place, and vaccination rates were also lower</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Virus Watch: Analysis of a subset (N = 10,808) of a community cohort study during the second wave of the epidemic in England and Wales estimated those leaving for work or education during this period had a 15% risk of being infected, compared to 9% for those who did not (<abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr> 1.70, <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 1.50 to 1.92) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. Controlling for the impact of travelling to work on public transport reduced this increased risk of infection, although it remained significantly higher than for those not leaving the house for work or education.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Council">JBC</abbr>: Modelling considering available mobility, contact, and behavioural data suggests an approximate 10 percentage point increase in workplace mobility alone could lead to an approximate 0.1 increase in <abbr title="Effective reproduction number – the average number of secondary cases per infectious case in a population of susceptible and non-susceptible individuals">Rti</abbr>, although this may underestimate the total effect if there are concurrent increases in transport use and out of work contacts (which is expected) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1">REACT-1</abbr>: Interim analysis of rounds 5 to 10 of <abbr title="Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1">REACT-1</abbr> (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research-and-impact/groups/react-study/" rel="external">survey of more than 150,000 individuals in England each month</a>) suggests those working outside of the home have consistently been more likely to test positive, indicating a reduced risk of infection for those not working outside the home (<abbr title="odds ratio">OR</abbr> 0.73, <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> 0.68 to 0.79) [^10].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> <abbr title="COVID-19 Infection Survey">CIS</abbr>: Multiple analyses of data from the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> Coronavirus Infection Survey have indicated an increased risk of infection for those not working from home.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interim analysis from <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> of the <abbr title="COVID-19 Infection Survey">CIS</abbr> suggests working outside of the home remains a predictor of positivity, although this increased risk (compared to those working from home) is currently not as pronounced compared to the period October 2020 to March 2021 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>. For example, in the fortnight from 14 March to 27 March 2021 people working outside of the home were 1.61 times more likely to test positive than those working from home, while in the fortnight 29 August to 11 September, they were 1.26 times more likely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> analysis of swab positivity rates of individuals (16 to 74 years old) between September 2020 and May 2021 suggests those in patient facing roles in healthcare were more likely to test positive than those in non-patient facing roles over this period <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>. However, this analysis did not differentiate by age or vaccination status and the comparatively low number of patient-facing roles means there is a larger degree of uncertainty for this group. More recent analysis from late June to early September 2021 found no statistical evidence of a difference for test positivity in those in patient facing roles and all other adults (including those not working).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independent analysis of <abbr title="COVID-19 Infection Survey">CIS</abbr> data from May 2020 to February 2021 (N = 409,000 in 72,866 households) found that the highest infection rates were in those under the age of 25, living in larger households, and those who were unable to work from home and had to use public transport <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>13. <strong>Risk at the workplace is highly variable across sectors and across job types</strong>, although it is extremely difficult to determine how much transmission takes place within the workplace, and how much is associated with related activities <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup>. Mitigation measures implemented across similar workplaces are also highly variable. Smaller work teams and asynchronous work patterns have been suggested to reduce the infection risk <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup> and there is literature to suggest reductions in risk can be achieved through staggering shifts and bubbling of staff <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>14. Analysis of workplace outbreaks and modelling of factors which influence transmission in the workplaces is ongoing as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/covid19-national-project/" rel="external">PROTECT National Core Study</a>. Outbreak studies suggests that workplace interactions can be complex and that settings such as break rooms, locker rooms, canteens, and shared vehicles, particularly where they are less supervised, could be as or more important than the main office or factory workspaces for exposure. Modelling suggests that reducing the number of employees in a workplace is likely to be the most successful strategy to minimise the size of an outbreak associated with a workplace.</p>

<p>15. <strong>Current average contact levels remain significantly below pre-pandemic levels and those going into the workplace have on average had fewer contacts in the workplace than before the pandemic – which is likely to change if work from home levels continue to decrease.</strong> Prior to the pandemic most daily contacts made by adults were in the workplace.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="a behavioural survey launched on 24 March 2020">CoMix</abbr>: The <abbr title="a behavioural survey launched on 24 March 2020">CoMix</abbr> social contact survey has consistently reported low average contacts for employed adults who are able to work from home (approximately 2.5 contacts per day compared to 7.5 per day for those attending their workplace) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>, although those attending their workplace are currently reporting far fewer contacts than in Autumn 2020 (7.5 compared to 11). The proportion of employees attending work if their workplace is open is comparable to Autumn 2020. The difference in reported contacts may be in part due to changes in those attending workplaces (for example more white-collar or office-based, increased hybrid working patterns) although this is unlikely to fully explain this effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>16. Continued use of occupancy limits in some workplaces and mixed working patterns may lower risk at and travelling to or from the workplace, and subsequently the potential impact of reintroduction of a form of working from home guidance. It is very difficult to quantify the potential for reduction in transmission from reintroduction of working from home guidance without understanding what proportion of the workforce that can work from home have returned to their workplace, and in what working pattern. <strong>However, current behaviours and contact patterns remain significantly different to pre-pandemic and there remains potential for a rapid worsening of the epidemiological situation if contact levels increase significantly.</strong></p>

<p>17. Similarly, vaccine effectiveness estimates are highly contextual and are currently derived from periods with contact rates below pre-pandemic norms. <strong>As contact rates increase (and particularly while prevalence remains high), vaccinated individuals are likely to be challenged more regularly and at higher doses through exposure to infectious individuals.</strong></p>

<p>18. The relationship between average contacts and risk of infection resulting from attending a workplace is not likely to be linear. <strong>It is likely that as workplace and public transport occupancy increases along with overall contact levels and changes in behavioural norms, the risk of infection from leaving the house for work will increase more so.</strong></p>

<p>19. <strong>Working from home is not an option for around half of the UK population (only around 47% are estimated to have been able to do so during the first lockdown in April 2020 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup> and the impact of reintroducing a form of working from home guidance would likely largely depend on what proportion of workers are attending their workplace at that time and subsequently are able to not continue to do so.</strong></p>

<p>20. Even when able to work from home there is evidence that not all have done so. The impact of reintroducing guidance for some to work from home where possible is highly likely to be heterogenous across age, socioeconomic groups, employment sector or job type (for example, in April 2020 occupations requiring higher qualifications or experience were much more likely to be working from home <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>, and regions.</p>

<p>21. Recent increases in workplace attendance have varied from region to region, with higher levels of attendance in areas with increased tourism and manufacturing sectors. London and the South East of England, where working from home rates have been reportedly higher than other regions <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>, has seen the slowest rate of return. In Scotland and Wales, the guidance on working from home has not yet been withdrawn.</p>

<p>22. Regions of persistent high prevalence in 2020 have been associated with several risk factors – including the reduced ability of individuals to work from home, as well as various factors that may influence the risk of attending work such as an increased proportion of the workforce attending settings associated with higher outbreak occurrence rates, mobility trends such as increased car sharing, and an increased proportion of low paid and insecure employment that may indicate a barrier to self-isolation <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>. Modelling has suggested that a higher number of people in routine occupations unable to work from home likely contributed towards persistent transmission in some <abbr title="Lower Tier Local Authorities">LTLAs</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>23. The impact of increasing rates of working from home on transmission is likely to increase over time, and the immediate impact may be small. This is likely to depend on multiple factors such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rates of working from home at the time of implementation and wider behavioural norms that affect the average number of close contacts an individual has</li>
  <li>employee expectations and behaviours in response to the perception of a worsening epidemic situation (noting that the ability to work from home is usually not within control of individual employees and even if able to according to employer policy, lower socioeconomic groups have lower adoption due to factors such as housing)</li>
  <li>employer preference, and employer interpretation of the situation and guidance</li>
  <li>prevalence and effectiveness of workplace mitigations such as regular testing or ventilation that reduce the risk of infection at the workplace.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Considerations for implementation</h3>

<p>24. Working from home is not necessarily a binary option, with many reporting a desire to work in a hybrid way with some days in the office and some at home <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>. All options with some home working will have the benefit of reducing the risk of infection for both those able to work from home and those unable to do so. The scale of benefits and harms of the different options should be considered.</p>

<p>25. With heterogenous and potentially unequal impacts, if reintroducing guidance to increase rates of working from home, consideration should be given to other measures to support and protect those unable to work from home (particularly those most affected such as deprived and ethnic minority populations). This could include wider provision of regular rapid antigen testing at workplaces for those unable to work from home, as discussed in more detail below.</p>

<h3>Mitigating workplace risk</h3>

<p>26. Policies that are effective in identifying and preventing the presence of infectious individuals at the workplace will mitigate against the need to take stronger measures. Current policies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>isolation upon onset of core <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms and <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing (with isolation for 10 days if positive)</li>
  <li>availability of asymptomatic testing using rapid antigen tests, with 10-day isolation on positive test with availability of a confirmatory <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
</ul>

<p>27. However, there is evidence that adherence to isolation has reduced over time <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup> and that there are significant barriers to isolation, such as poor symptom recognition and awareness of the requirement to take a test if symptomatic <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. Surveys have reported various reasons for non-uptake of isolation including the need to attend workplaces and lack of income support <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. Broadening the symptom criteria for taking a test could include a greater proportion of cases, potentially improving detection of infected and infectious individuals, potentially reducing the probability of infectious individuals attending a workplace.</p>

<p>28. Continuing to attend a workplace while ill with a respiratory illness was common prior to the <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> pandemic. Only 34% of working adult participants (40% overall) in the Flu Watch study (2006 to 2011) took time off work or education for their illness with <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>-confirmed influenza A infection, although symptoms lasted 9.6 days on average (in whole cohort). Note, this included cases that neither consulted for care nor met the symptom definition of an influenza-like illness. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>29. Encouraging individuals with a wider set of symptoms of respiratory illness to work from home if possible would likely isolate additional cases of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> (not identified by the core symptomatic isolation and testing criteria) but also have a wider benefit of reducing transmission of non-<abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infections in the workplace (with potential to reduce population transmission and resultant hospitalisations from other infections). This may also result in fewer employees being infected at their workplace with other respiratory illnesses and reduced work absences <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>30. The current testing policy is highly unlikely to eliminate the presence of all <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> infections in the workplace. With 100% adherence (and no delays between symptom onset and isolation) it is estimated that the current symptomatic testing policy would prevent only 71% (95% <abbr title="uncertainty interval">UI</abbr>: 35, 88%) of an individual’s infectivity, due to pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>31. Regular asymptomatic rapid antigen testing at workplaces could be an effective measure alongside other mitigations to reduce the infection risk in workplaces, for example ventilation and social distancing. Similarly, ensuring sufficient support (financial and otherwise) for effective self-isolation of those testing positive may reduce attendance of infectious individuals at their workplace – reducing the risk to those unable to work from home. It is important to ensure that there is also sufficient awareness of the availability of support, in advance of it being required.</p>

<p>32. Effectiveness of regular testing for those attending their workplace is dependent on frequency of testing, communication of good testing procedures and result comprehension, provision of tests and the ability for individuals to take up and adhere to the policy over time (and the extent to which this is correlated with vaccination and household transmission risks) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>. In the UK, rapid antigen testing has been found to be acceptable and feasible in the context of daily contact testing <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup> including among staff and students at secondary schools <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup>. However, studies of mass asymptomatic testing in Liverpool have shown that uptake varies by sociodemographic characteristics including neighbourhood deprivation level, ethnicity, and gender <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>33. Rapid antigen testing is highly complementary to physical interventions such as masks, ventilation, and distancing. Rapid antigen test sensitivity is correlated to viral load at time of testing (expected to correlate in part to infectiousness - infectiousness among working age adults varies across individuals and by viral load at time of testing, vaccination status, time since vaccination, and symptom status.). As such, rapid antigen testing and subsequent isolation is likely to be effective at removing high viral load infections from a setting, while physical interventions are most effective with lower viral load infections.</p>

<h2>Vaccine-only certification</h2>

<h3>Potential impact on transmission</h3>

<p>34. Certification requiring a negative test decreases the probability that an individual entering an applicable setting is infectious <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. Proof of vaccination may reduce the likelihood that an individual entering a setting is infected, as well as the likelihood of those present becoming infected if exposed and suffering severe symptoms if infected. <strong>There are only a few examples in comparator countries of certification policy that required proof of vaccination status that did not also allow certification with proof of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> recovery or a negative test result</strong> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup>. These have been introduced very recently and as such there is very limited comparative evidence to estimate the potential impact of a vaccination-only policy on transmission.</p>

<p>35. Countries that have implemented certification policies have generally done so in a wide range of settings (such as indoor hospitality, leisure facilities, events, gyms) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup>. Even under these circumstances, there is <strong>limited evidence for the direct impact of certification on population level rates of infection and or severe disease.</strong> Pilot studies from earlier in the pandemic produced mixed results and often included use of additional measures such as face coverings.</p>

<p>36. Several important considerations may affect the impact of vaccine-only certification on transmission including vaccine effectiveness, timing of vaccine-induced protection (including time to develop immunity and waning), vaccine uptake, the range of applicable settings, implementation and enforcement (including the use of fake certificates), and the prevalence of infection in the community (when prevalence is high, it is more likely that vaccinated individuals entering a setting will be infected <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vaccine effectiveness.</strong> The impact of vaccine-only certification on transmission within a setting will be reduced if vaccine effectiveness against infection or onward transmission is lower. Although there is evidence that vaccination reduces onward transmission of the Delta variant, this may be less than for the Alpha variant <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote">[footnote 37]</a></sup>. Future variants may also have an impact on vaccine effectiveness against infection and onward transmission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Waning immunity.</strong> Waning of vaccine-derived immunity, reducing effectiveness against infection and symptomatic disease, is apparent 10 weeks after the second dose, particularly in elderly and vulnerable groups <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote">[footnote 38]</a></sup>. Time limiting the validity of vaccine-only certificates according to the date of last vaccination could be considered.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Potential impact on vaccine uptake</h3>

<p>37. Evidence from other countries of the impact of certification policies on vaccine uptake is mixed but suggests that there is potential for a positive impact, particularly in younger age groups.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analysis of 7 comparator countries found that in the majority there was little or no increase in vaccine uptake following announcement of certification. Israel was the exception, who observed a marked increase over the 10 days post-announcement <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup>. Although this may have largely resulted from vaccine eligibility changes and increased communications <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>Analyses looking at vaccine uptake in younger age groups (most likely to be affected by the policy and to be unvaccinated) in France (where passports were required in wide range of settings), demonstrated an increase immediately after the announcement <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>Analysis of 6 countries that introduced mandatory <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> certification between May and August 2021 (with a control group of 20) found increased vaccine uptake prior to and after implementation. This was dependent on prior levels of vaccine uptake, with those countries with lower uptake prior to implementation exhibiting greater uptake afterwards but no significant effect seen in those countries that already had high uptake. Analysis by age showed the impact on uptake was highest in those younger than 20 and between 20 to 29 years old. Specific access restrictions to settings such as nightclubs were associated with higher uptake in younger age groups, and when extended to broader settings, higher age groups <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>38. The impact vaccine-only certification may have on vaccine uptake is likely to depend upon the current state of vaccine rollout (and uptake across age groups), ease of access to vaccination, degree of vaccine hesitancy or complacency (with uptake only likely to be affected among the least hesitant or most complacent <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>), which groups are likely to be most affected, the scope of the proposed policy (such as settings and activities affected), and how the policy introduction is communicated to those likely to be affected.</p>

<h3>Considerations for implementation</h3>

<p>39. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> have previously noted certification has the potential for harms as well as benefits, noting the potential for adverse behavioural responses and unequal impacts <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>40. <strong>There are difficult practical and ethical issues to be considered to minimise disproportionate impacts (ensuring equity and accessibility of certification and vaccination) and allow for effective implementation – which is highly likely to affect the overall impact on vaccine uptake and transmission.</strong> Examples of relatively robust certification policies (such as QR passes in Netherlands) have been hampered by loopholes, use of counterfeit certificates, and likely heterogenous enforcement across venues. This is thought to have contributed to chains of transmission linked directly to venues using and enforcing this certification approach <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup>. <strong>Implementation and approach to enforcement is highly likely to influence the potential impact on reducing transmission within an affected setting</strong> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>41. Effective implementation is likely to require public support, particularly in those groups most likely to be affected. Public support for certification is generally high for large-scale events but declines for retail settings and workplaces <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup>. Certification may also reduce trust in some communities and entrench negative views about vaccination (in some instances certification has been associated with decreased self-reported willingness to be vaccinated in the most hesitant populations <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup>. Public support may be increased by ensuring clear communication that set out positively the potential for an impact of increased vaccine uptake and enabling activities, rather than restricting them.</p>

<p>42. Care should also be paid to consistency of messaging around certification and unintended impacts on other aspects of vaccination policy, such as uptake of booster doses. Specifically requiring two doses for certification could inadvertently confuse messaging around the need for boosters and disincentivise uptake. Similarly, consideration should be given to emerging evidence on waning of vaccine-induced protection and to time limiting certificate validity from date of last dose.</p>

<p>43. Overall, vaccine-only certification may only have a very small direct impact on transmission but has potential to improve vaccine uptake in certain groups, particularly young adults. However, there are potential associated harms and inequalities that should be considered prior to implementation. Increasing the range of applicable settings, time-limiting certificates based on last vaccination date, and including a requirement for proof of a negative test, could all be considered to increase the potential impact on transmission and vaccine uptake. Clear and consistent communications (with sufficient notice and positive framing) are also likely to influence outcomes.</p>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>44. The prevailing <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> view on face coverings remains consistent with previous advice <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>, that face coverings are likely to reduce transmission through all routes by partially reducing emission of and or exposure to the full range of aerosol and droplets that carry the virus <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup>, including those that remain airborne and those that deposit on surfaces [high confidence]. <strong>The full consensus statement from <abbr title="Environmental Modelling Group">EMG</abbr> on face coverings is included in Annex 1.</strong></p>

<p>45. Face coverings are effective at reducing spread of virus from an infected individual and, to a lesser extent, providing protection to the wearer <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:45" rel="footnote">[footnote 45]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote">[footnote 46]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:47" rel="footnote">[footnote 47]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:48" rel="footnote">[footnote 48]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:49" rel="footnote">[footnote 49]</a></sup> [high confidence]. The effectiveness of a face covering in protecting a susceptible individual from infection is dependent on the material from which the face covering is made, the extent to which it excludes infected particles, closeness of fit on the face and whether they cover both the nose and mouth <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote">[footnote 50]</a></sup> [high confidence]. Plastic face shields are not a suitable alternative to a fabric face covering and are unlikely to provide much benefit in reducing emission of the virus or exposure to the virus when worn without a face covering [high confidence] <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. Efficacy of face coverings in reducing transmission is dependent on the proportion and frequency of face covering wearing within the population, as well as material quality and fit <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. The wider and more frequent the use, the more likely it is that an infected person will be wearing a face covering when they are sharing an environment with others [high confidence].</p>

<p>46. Face coverings can reduce the risk of transmission when people are in close proximity or small spaces even for short durations of time <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> [medium confidence]. They cannot compensate for poor ventilation but may further reduce risks of longer-range airborne transmission when people are in shared air for longer periods of time, and this effect may be more important in poorly ventilated spaces [low confidence].</p>

<p>47. Face coverings are likely to have benefits for the reduction of the transmission of other respiratory viruses including influenza <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:51" rel="footnote">[footnote 51]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:52" rel="footnote">[footnote 52]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:53" rel="footnote">[footnote 53]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:54" rel="footnote">[footnote 54]</a></sup> [high confidence].</p>

<p>48. Effective use of face coverings is very significantly determined by human behaviour [high confidence]. Successful application of face coverings as a population scale measure requires, at minimum, clear and consistent messaging around where and why they should be worn, as well as how to choose and wear a face covering or mask <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>49. Mandating the use of face coverings in appropriate situations is likely to increase usage [high confidence]. Usage has declined significantly in England since July 2021 when it ceased to be a legal requirement <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>. Increasing accessibility to face coverings has also been reported to increase uptake in different studies <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote">[footnote 46]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Interactions and hierarchy of measures</h2>

<p>50. The epidemiological situation is still dynamic, and we have not yet reached a steady state. <strong>The effectiveness of measures is highly dependent upon the context in which they are introduced, and measures will often interact and have complementary effects that should be considered. Packages of measures are highly likely to be more effective than individual measures.</strong></p>

<p>51. Reintroduction of measures is likely to present additional challenges and consideration should be given to minimising harms and disruption if this is necessary. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> have previously advised on the importance of positively framing the introduction of measures, ensuring equity, co-production, and providing adequate support for those affected <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>52. Reintroduction of working from home guidance, for those who can, may have the largest impact on transmission out of the potential Plan B measures, however there are associated harms and unequal impacts that should be considered upon implementation. It is difficult to estimate the effectiveness of individual measures and they should not be viewed in isolation.</p>

<p>53. There are other measures that could be introduced to mitigate the need for Plan B or more stringent interventions, in addition to increasing vaccine and booster rollout and uptake. This could include encouraging wider use of rapid antigen testing in workplaces, the community, and ensuring people receive sufficient support (and are aware, in advance, that they can access support) to self-isolate when infected.</p>
