<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide explains how we, the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), calculate dedicated schools grant (DSG) schools block recoupment for the financial year 2022 to 2023. This guide is primarily aimed at local authority finance officers and runs alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-complete-the-authority-proforma-tool-apt-2022-to-2023">2022 to 2023 authority proforma tool (APT) guidance</a>.</p>

<p>It does not describe how we deduct funding from the schools block of the DSG for high needs places. That information is available in the dedicated schools grant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2022-to-2023/dsg-technical-note-2022-to-2023">technical note</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities provide an individual schools budget (ISB) for each school in their area, in the APT that they submitted to us in January 2022. This includes the notional budgets for all academies and free schools (including university technology colleges and studio schools) in their area. It also shows the funding that academies would have received if they were maintained schools. As local authorities are not responsible for funding mainstream academies or free schools, we will deduct the amount of ISB for those schools from the total DSG allocated to local authorities. We refer to this deduction as ‘recoupment’.</p>

<p>Local authorities should use the national non-domestic rates (NNDR) values provided in the APT that are part of the indicative national funding formula (NFF) allocations published in July 2021, as the basis of their calculations for adjustments to reflect NNDR liabilities.</p>

<p>Where authorities made growth fund payments to academies in 2021 to 2022 for basic need, they should continue to provide these until the academies receive their new budgets from September 2022. We adjust recoupment accordingly in these cases to provide authorities with the funding to continue these payments. We do not adjust recoupment for diseconomy of scale or start-up funding as published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1037472/Schools_revenue_funding_2022_to_2023.pdf" rel="external">school revenue funding operational guide</a>. Local authorities should continue to meet the cost of these elements from their growth funds.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>New free schools</h2>
<p>We will continue to recoup for all free schools from the date they opened for the financial year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>To help local authorities estimate the recoupment amounts for new free schools, we included details of the expected pupil numbers for those they predicted to open in the next year when we sent the APT in December. We request local authorities to combine this data with their own local knowledge when submitting their financial year 2022 to 2023 APT, to determine the most accurate estimate of the number of pupils for new free schools.</p>

<p>The ISB should reflect the funding for the period in the year that the new academies are open. We will recoup the figure shown. Local authorities should use the ‘Opening/Closing’ factor on the ‘Local Factors’ worksheet to do this. We will not pro-rata the calculation for these academies. Local authorities should note that premises factors are not pro-rated by the ‘Opening/Closing’ factor. Any premises funding will be recouped at the value listed in the APT.</p>

<p>Local authorities may need to adjust these estimates; therefore, you should reflect any differences that you identify in the financial year 2023 to 2024 APT.</p>

<p>We expect local authorities to provide estimates for all new free schools. In rare cases where a school has opened and it was not possible to provide data in the APT, we will accept an estimate in-year to avoid delaying recoupment. This helps reduce the adjustment in the financial year 2023 to 2024 APT.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>New provision academies</h2>

<p>We asked local authorities to include any new provision academies on the APT that they submitted in January 2022.</p>

<p>This meant that local authorities had to estimate pupil numbers and characteristics for all these schools. This is the same as those opened under the new presumption free school arrangements.</p>

<p>The regulations allow retrospective adjustments in the following financial year, so that we fund schools appropriately if the actual numbers are different from the estimated numbers. Although this is a decision for the local authorities, we would generally expect to see these adjustments. It is up to the local authority to decide whether to use a threshold for these adjustments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Recoupment calculation</h2>

<p>We use the data provided by local authorities on their APTs to calculate recoupment.</p>

<p>For converting academies that opened after 11 January 2022, we asked authorities to show these schools as maintained schools on the APT. From this year, indicative business rates and historic rates adjustments will be deducted from the DSG for all mainstream providers rather than being recouped for academies.</p>

<p>The date that a school converts to academy status depends on whether we allow de-delegation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where a school converts to academy status on or before 1 April 2022, no de-delegation can happen</li>
  <li>where a school converts between 2 April 2022 and 1 September 2022 (inclusive), the authority can retain any de-delegated funding until 1 September 2022</li>
  <li>where a school converts to academy status between 2 September 2022 and 31 March 2023 (inclusive), the local authority can retain any de-delegated funding for the remainder of the 2022 to 2023 financial year. This will help service providers plan their future operations</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table shows the columns in the APT that we use in the recoupment calculations.</p>

<p>The following examples show the differences in the recoupment calculation depending on when the free school or academy opens in the academic year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Example 1: for free schools open before 2 September 2021</h3>

<p>We will recoup the figure shown on the ‘Post MFG budget’ of the APT data minus 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Post MFG budget – 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR allocation = Total recoupment</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Example 2: for academies open before 11 January 2022 (inclusive)</h3>
<p>We will recoup the figure shown on the ‘Post MFG budget’ of the APT minus 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR values, minus growth fund (for the period April 2022 to August 2022) if a local authority provided appropriate justification:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Post MFG budget – 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR allocation − Growth fund = Total recoupment</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Example 3: for academies opening from 11 January 2022 to 1 April 2022 (inclusive)</h3>

<p>The calculation in this example is the ‘Post MFG budget’ of the APT, minus 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Post MFG budget – 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR allocation = total recoupment</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Example 4: for academies opening from 2 April 2022 to 1 September 2022 (inclusive)</h3>
<p>Where a maintained school converts to an academy during this period, recoupment is calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Post de-delegation budget – 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR allocation = full year recoupment</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We then pro-rata this for the days the academy has been open in the financial year:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>(full year recoupment ÷ 365) × days open = recoupment adjusted pro rata</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We finally add the de-delegated funding pro-rata for 7 months of the year (September 2022 to March 2023):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>(recoupment adjusted pro rata + 7 months de-delegation) = total recoupment</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Example 5: for academies opening from 2 September 2022 up to 31 March 2023</h3>
<p>Where a maintained school converts to an academy during this period, recoupment is calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Post de-delegation budget – 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR allocation = full year recoupment</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We then pro-rata this for the days the academy has been open in the financial year:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>(full year recoupment ÷ 365) × days open = total recoupment</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We will not recoup the de-delegation funding for the financial year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Example 6: for new free schools opening on 1 September 2022</h3>

<p>For new free schools opening during this period, we will recoup the figure shown on the ‘Post MFG budget’ of the APT. The APT is likely to reflect a 1st September opening date. If a free school does not open on 1st September, we will pro-rata this figure to reflect the opening date:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Post MFG budget – 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR allocation = total recoupment</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Recoupment adjustments</h2>
<p>We expect recoupment to remain throughout the financial year as we originally calculated based on the APT. However, it may be necessary to apply adjustments to the level of recoupment on a case-by-case basis in exceptional circumstance. The most common reasons for recoupment adjustments are set out below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Growth</h3>
<p>Where local authorities have provided growth fund payments to academies in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, they must continue these payments to the end of August 2022. To provide the authority with the funding to make these payments, we will provide a recoupment adjustment for the amount entered to the ‘Recoupment’ tab of the APT, provided the value shown is supported by the appropriate justification.</p>

<p>If an academy converts in year, and the local authority has been unable to show growth figures for April 2022 to August 2022 on the APT due to it being classed as a maintained school, we will adjust recoupment to reflect the growth. We adjust this through the anomalies process once the financial year has started if you provided the appropriate calculation and justification to support this.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Private Finance Initiative (PFI)</h3>

<p>Where local authorities delegate PFI funding to academies for the first time, we will automatically adjust recoupment for the period April to August 2022. This is so that local authorities do not need to begin invoicing academies for the financial year 2022 to 2023 until September, as this is when the academies start to receive the funding needed to pay PFI costs. Local authorities must not invoice academies in the period that the costs are covered by recoupment adjustment.</p>

<p>If a significant increase in existing PFI delegation occurs between 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023, we will not adjust recoupment automatically. However, if the increase in the amount invoiced from April causes financial difficulty for the academy (because the corresponding additional funding does not start until September), we will consider a request to make a similar April to August adjustment on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Academy closures and infrastructural changes</h3>

<p>If an academy closes, we will usually stop recoupment at the point of closure, pro-rata for the number of days remaining in the financial year. However, we will continue the original recoupment if all pupils are placed in another recoupable academy in the local authority area. We will adjust recoupment if some or all the pupils from the closed academy are placed in a maintained school in the local authority.</p>

<p>If an academy closes and some or all the pupils are placed in another academy outside of the local authority area, we will continue to recoup from the local authority against the original academy for the remainder of the financial year, reflecting that we do not adjust the starting DSG allocation either.</p>

<p>A closed academy will not feature in the local authority’s recoupment reports in the financial year following the closure.</p>

<p>Where there are mergers or demergers that affect academies within a local authority, we will not change recoupment for the remainder of the financial year. The changes will take effect from the following financial year, for example, academy names changes, LA codes, and any split recoupment values following a de-merger, or joined up recoupment values following a merger.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Recoupment timetable</h2>
<p>We will write to each authority several times during the year to provide their recoupment calculations. These dates are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>April 2022</li>
  <li>July 2022</li>
  <li>September 2022</li>
  <li>November 2022</li>
  <li>January 2023</li>
  <li>March 2023</li>
</ul>
