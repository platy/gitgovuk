<p>The human papillomavirus (<abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>) vaccine is being made available through specialist Sexual Health Services (<abbr title="Sexual Health Services">SHSs</abbr>) and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> clinics to gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (<abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>) who are up to and including 45 years of age.</p>

<p>The vaccine will help to prevent <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection which can cause genital warts and <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-associated cancers. It is especially important for those who are living with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, and those who have multiple sexual partners. 
This guide includes information about the <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine and the diseases that it will help to protect against.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> and the diseases it can cause</h2>
<p>There are over 100 types of <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> that infect the skin and mucous membranes. The majority of <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infections do not cause any symptoms and infections usually resolve on their own.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infections which persist, such as <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types 16 and 18, can lead to cancers, for example <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types 16 and 18 cause the majority of <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> associated cancers and increase the risk of developing <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-related cancers later in life, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some mouth and throat cancers (head and neck)</li>
  <li>some cancers of the anus and genital areas</li>
  <li>cervical cancer in women</li>
</ul>

<p>Other types of <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> such as 6 and 11 cause genital warts.</p>

<h2>How <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection is spread</h2>
<p><abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in the UK. <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> is spread mainly by skin to skin contact. Genital <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infections are highly contagious, and usually associated with sexual contact. Nearly all sexually active people get infected with <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> at some point in their lives. The risk increases with the number of sexual partners you or your partners have.</p>

<h2>Can <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection be prevented?</h2>
<p>Condoms do not guarantee protection from infection. This is because <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> can be transmitted by skin contact with areas not covered by condoms.</p>

<p>The best way to protect yourself from <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection is to get vaccinated. The vaccines we offer to <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> attending <abbr title="Sexual Health Services">SHSs</abbr> and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> clinics are called Gardasil or Gardasil 9. Either vaccine can be given and both vaccines protect against the 4 <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types 6, 11, 16 and 18 that are responsible for causing cancers and genital warts. Gardasil 9 protects against additional types 31, 33, 45, 52, 58.</p>

<p>The vaccine is a course of 2 doses given at least 6 months apart. If you are <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> positive or immunocompromised you will require 3 doses of vaccine at 0, 1 and 4 to 6 months.</p>

<p>Ideally, vaccine should be given before you become sexually active, but the protection is still good even if you receive the vaccine later. To get the best protection, it is important you receive the full course of vaccination.</p>

<h2>Why <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> attending <abbr title="Sexual Health Services">SHSs</abbr> and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> clinics should be vaccinated</h2>
<p>The risk of anal cancer in <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> is higher than in heterosexual men. If you also have <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, this risk is higher again. In addition, <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> are more likely to get genital warts. <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> attending <abbr title="Sexual Health Services">SHSs</abbr> or <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> clinics are known to have an increased risk of <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection and disease.</p>

<p>In the UK, an <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine programme for girls aged 12 to 13 has been in place since 2008 and was extended to boys aged 12 to 13 in September 2019. <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> stand to benefit less from herd protection from the years of female-only vaccination.</p>

<p><abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination is a very effective way to reduce your risk of genital warts immediately and your risk of developing <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-associated cancer in the future.</p>

<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p>Like most injections, the side effects of the <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination are quite mild. Soreness, swelling and redness in the arm are common but wear off in a couple of days. More serious side effects are extremely rare.</p>

<p>The vaccine has passed the strict safety standards for use in the UK and has been shown to be a very safe vaccine. Millions of doses of vaccine have already been given to girls and boys in the UK and around the world. As with all vaccines, any reports of side effects are closely monitored and reviewed.</p>

<h2>How to get the vaccine</h2>
<p>Please ask your clinic nurse or doctor for more details. The vaccine is available in <abbr title="Sexual Health Services">SHSs</abbr> and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> clinics.</p>
