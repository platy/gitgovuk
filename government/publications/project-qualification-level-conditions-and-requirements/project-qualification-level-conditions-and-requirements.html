<h2>Content and assessment requirements</h2>

<h3>Content and assessment requirements for project qualifications</h3>

<p>Condition Project1.1 allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to the content and assessment of project qualifications.</p>

<p>We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition Project 1.1 below.</p>

<p>A previous version of these requirements was originally published as part of Criteria for Foundation, Higher and Advanced Diploma Qualifications.</p>

<h4>About project qualifications</h4>

<p>Project qualifications are free-standing, single-unit qualifications. They can have a number of different outcomes in terms of the evidence produced by Learners for assessment, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a report with findings from an investigation or study</li>
  <li>a dissertation</li>
  <li>an artefact, and/or</li>
  <li>a performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Aims and learning outcomes</h3>

<h4>Level 1 and 2</h4>

<p>Project qualifications at level 1 and level 2 must enable Learners to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop and apply skills</li>
  <li>develop as inquisitive and independent Learners</li>
  <li>be inspired by new areas and/or methods of study</li>
  <li>plan and review their learning</li>
  <li>use their learning experiences to support their personal aspirations for further study and/or career development</li>
  <li>develop, where appropriate, as electronically confident Learners and apply appropriate technologies in their studies, and</li>
  <li>transfer skills developed as part of their project to other areas of study</li>
</ul>

<h4>Level 3</h4>

<p>Project qualifications at level 3 must enable Learners to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a significant contribution to the choice and design of an extended project and take responsibility either for an individual task or for a defined task within a group project</li>
  <li>develop and improve their own learning and performance as critical, reflective and independent Learners</li>
  <li>develop and apply decision-making and, where appropriate, problem-solving skills</li>
  <li>extend their planning, research, critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, evaluation and presentation skills</li>
  <li>where appropriate, develop confidence in applying new technologies in their studies</li>
  <li>develop and apply skills creatively, demonstrating initiative and enterprise</li>
  <li>use their learning experiences to support their aspirations for higher education and/or career development, and</li>
  <li>transfer skills developed as part of their project to other areas of study.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<h4>Level 1 and 2</h4>

<p>Project qualifications at level 1 and level 2 must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>form part of a planned programme of study,</li>
  <li>be of sufficient breadth and depth to allow Learners to meet the aims and learning outcomes listed above,</li>
  <li>be based on an agreed set of standards and assessment, and</li>
  <li>have the potential to be researched and completed within one academic year.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Level 3</h4>

<p>Project qualifications at level 3 must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be of sufficient breadth and depth to allow Learners to address the broad aims and learning outcomes listed above, and</li>
  <li>develop and extend from one or more of the Learner’s study areas and/or from an area of personal interest or activity outside their main programme of study.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Topic</h3>

<p>Learners are required to select a suitable topic for their project. This means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at levels 1 and 2, the topic must be chosen by the Learner(s) through negotiation with their Teacher and, if appropriate, an employer, and</li>
  <li>at level 3, the topic must be chosen by the Learner(s) and agreed by the Centre and, if appropriate, an employer.</li>
</ul>

<p>At all levels, the project chosen by the Learner(s) must have the potential to provide the Learner(s) with opportunities to meet all the assessment objectives.</p>

<p>The awarding organisation must ensure that Centres confirm that Learners’ project topics support Learner progression.</p>

<h3>Subject content</h3>

<h4>Levels 1 and 2</h4>

<p>Project qualifications at levels 1 and 2 must require Learners to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>select, either individually or as part of a group, an appropriate topic</li>
  <li>identify a question, task or brief which specifies an intended project outcome</li>
  <li>produce a plan for how they will deliver their intended project outcome</li>
  <li>conduct research into the project brief, using appropriate techniques</li>
  <li>develop the intended project outcome, using selected tools and techniques safely</li>

  <li>At level 1:
    <ul>
      <li>share the outcome of the project, including a review of their own learning and performance, with others, using appropriate communication methods, and</li>
      <li>demonstrate knowledge and understanding of their studies or areas of interest</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At level 2:
    <ul>
      <li>share the outcome and an evaluation of the project, including a review of their own learning and performance, with others, using appropriate communication methods, and</li>
      <li>demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the concepts and principles underlying their studies or areas of interest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Level 3</h4>

<p>Project qualifications at level 3 must require Learners to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>select a topic or area of interest for an in-depth study which provides opportunities to develop knowledge, skills and understanding, and to negotiate the scoping of that project</li>
  <li>identify and draft one or more objectives for their project, providing a rationale for their choice</li>
  <li>produce a plan for how they will deliver their intended outcome</li>
  <li>conduct research as required by the project brief, using appropriate techniques</li>
  <li>develop the intended project outcome, using selected tools and techniques safely, to demonstrate the ability to pursue an extended project through to completion, and</li>
  <li>share the outcome of the project, including an evaluation of the outcome and their own learning and performance, with another or others, using appropriate communication methods.</li>
  <li>demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of:
    <ul>
      <li>the key concepts and principles underlying their studies or areas of interest, and</li>
      <li>connections, links and complexities, where appropriate, between different areas of study and/or different areas of interest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Scheme of assessment</h3>

<p>The scheme of assessment must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>include a specified written element</li>
  <li>reflect the aims and content of the specification</li>
  <li>address the assessment objectives at the appropriate level</li>
  <li>specify the type and format of evidence that is permissible, and</li>
  <li>stipulate a maximum mark of at least 30</li>
</ul>

<p>All Learners are required to meet the assessment objectives (set out below) for the appropriate level. The assessment objectives must be weighted as indicated below.</p>

<h3>Assessment evidence</h3>

<p>At all levels, in the case of group projects, this evidence must be individual to the Learner. While larger group activities, for example an expedition or a performance, may be a vehicle for evidence, that evidence must demonstrate how the Learner has met the assessment objectives and performance criteria.</p>

<h4>Levels 1 and 2</h4>

<p>Assessment must include evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the planning and process of the project</li>
  <li>the sources and range of information and other resources accessed</li>
  <li>the range of skills used, including, where appropriate, the use of new technologies</li>
  <li>the knowledge, skills and understanding used to complete the tasks/activities of the project</li>
  <li>an outcome demonstrating the Learner’s knowledge, skills and understanding,</li>
  <li>at level 1, a review of the outcomes of the project, and an evaluation of own performance and learning, and</li>
  <li>at level 2, an evaluation of the outcomes of the project and an evaluation of own performance and learning.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Level 3</h4>

<p>Assessment must include evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least one written piece</li>
  <li>the design, strategic planning and process of the project</li>
  <li>the sources and range of information and other resources accessed</li>
  <li>analysis of the data and a clear indication of how findings were used to inform the project</li>
  <li>the range of skills used, including, where appropriate, problem solving and the use of new technologies</li>
  <li>an outcome demonstrating the Learner’s knowledge, skills and understanding</li>
  <li>an evaluation of own performance, learning and decision making, and</li>
  <li>a presentation for a non-specialist audience, communicating outcomes, conclusions and evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Standard setting requirements</h2>

<h3>Requirements for setting specified levels of attainment for project qualifications</h3>

<p>Condition Project3.1 allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to the setting of specified levels of attainment for project qualifications.</p>

<p>We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition Project3.1 below.</p>

<p>For ease of reference, the specified levels of attainment used in project qualifications are referred to below as ‘grades’.</p>

<h4>Awarding of project qualifications</h4>

<p>Awarding organisations must award, and report on, the project qualification using the following grading scales:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a)	For level 1 – A*, A and B for graded results and U for unclassified results</li>
  <li>(b)	For level 2 – A*, A, B and C for graded results and U for unclassified results</li>
  <li>(c)	For level 3 – A*, A, B, C, D and E for graded results and U for unclassified results.</li>
</ol>

<p>In each case A* is the highest grade.</p>

<h4>Setting key grade boundaries</h4>

<p>Grade boundary marks for the project will be determined judgementally for the following key boundaries:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a)	Level 1:
    <ol>
      <li>(i) B/U</li>
      <li>(ii) A*/A.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(b) Level 2:
    <ol>
      <li>(i) C/U</li>
      <li>(ii) A*/A.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(c) Level 3:
    <ol>
      <li>(i) E/U</li>
      <li>(ii) A*/A.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The other boundary marks are determined arithmetically:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a)	For level 1, the mark interval between the top and bottom grades is divided by two. Where there is a remainder of one, the extra mark is added to the grade A interval.</li>
  <li>(b)	For level 2, the mark interval between the top and bottom grades is divided by three. Where there is a remainder of one, the extra mark is added to the grade A interval. Where there is a remainder of two, one extra mark is added to each of the grade A and grade B intervals.</li>
  <li>(c)	For level 3, the mark interval between the top and bottom grades is divided by five. Where there is a remainder of one, the extra mark is added to the grade A interval. Where there is a remainder of two, one extra mark is added to each of the grade A and grade B intervals. Where there is a remainder of three, one extra mark is added to each of the grade A, B and C intervals. Where there is a remainder of four, one extra mark is added to each of the grade A, B, C and D intervals.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Key dates requirements</h2>

<h3>Reviews of marking, moderation, and appeals: requirements for key dates for project qualifications</h3>

<p>We set out below the requirements which an awarding organisation must comply with when it specifies deadlines for requesting reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals. These requirements are published under Conditions Project8.3(b), Project11.3(b) and Project12.4(b) and apply to all project qualifications.</p>

<p>Awarding organisations are no longer required to set deadline dates for Learners/Centres to request reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals. In choosing to set any deadlines, an awarding organisation must comply with the requirements set out below and with all other requirements in its Conditions of Recognition.</p>

<p>In particular the requirements set out below must be read and complied with in conjunction with the Project Qualification Level Conditions (which set out further requirements in relation to an awarding organisation’s arrangements).</p>

<p>The requirements set out below align with the Project Qualification Level Conditions which are in effect. Some relevant Project Qualification Level Conditions have not yet come into effect and there are currently some transitional provisions in effect. We will keep the requirements set out below under review as any changes are made.</p>

<h4>Requirements for key dates for assessments other than assessments which are marked by a Centre <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</h4>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that the requirements in the table below are met in each case where the assessment is not marked by a Centre. The table sets out the minimum timeframe within which the awarding organisation must allow a review/appeal to be requested. Provided a review/appeal is allowed to be requested in that timeframe, an awarding organisation is permitted to also provide an ‘accelerated service’ (for example, where requests for reviews provided by an earlier date will be processed more quickly).</p>
