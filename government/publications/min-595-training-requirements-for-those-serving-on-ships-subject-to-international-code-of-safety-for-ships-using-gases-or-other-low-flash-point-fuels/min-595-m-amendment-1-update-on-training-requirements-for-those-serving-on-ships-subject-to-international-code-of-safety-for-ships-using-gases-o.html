<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>	Polar Code Refresher Training Requirements</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>	Changes to the Mandatory Requirements for the Training and Qualifications of Masters, Officers, Ratings and other Personnel on Passenger Ships as per Regulation V/2 paragraph 1 and paragraph 5, Section A-V/2 paragraph 2 of the STCW Convention and Code, 1978 as amended.</h2>

<p>•	Personnel serving on board passenger ships shall complete passenger ship emergency familiarisation appropriate to their capacity, duties and responsibilities as specified in section A-V/2, paragraph 1 of the STCW Code<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>(c)	This training is ship specific and not approved by the MCA. Your company should ensure that all such training is recorded, and documentary evidence given to every seafarer qualified by this training.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>	Changes to STCW References on Passenger Training Certificates</h2>

<p>MCA Approved Training Centres offering MCA approved passenger ship training should now be using the following CoP references:</p>

<p>•	CoP in Crisis Management and Human Behaviour as laid down in Regulations V/2, paragraph 8 and Section A-V/2 of paragraph 4 the STCW Convention and Code as amended.</p>

<p>The prerequisite ‘officer’ seagoing service for MCA approved HELM Management has been reduced from 12 months to 6 months.  This is to help companies stagger their officer training while ensuring the seafarer has enough relevant experience so that the course can add value. The MNTB guide for this course will be updated to reflect this, however this MIN can be held onsite by the training providers to confirm this new requirement.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>	Approval of Training Programmes</h2>

<p>All requests by training centres (noting that a shipping company may be considered a training centre) for MCA approval to deliver MNTB programmes should be addressed to the Surveyor in Charge of their local MCA Marine Office, with reference to Annex D of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1866-m-special-training-requirements-for-personnel-on-tankers-and-passenger-ships">MSN 1866</a> (for the approval of IGF courses) or the Annex of  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-637-m-international-code-for-ships-operating-in-polar-waters-polar-code">MGN 637</a> (for the approval of Polar Code courses).</p>

<p>Training centres must build into their Quality Management System the requirements outlined in this MIN,  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mgn-637-m-international-code-for-ships-operating-in-polar-waters-polar-code">MGN 637</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/msn-1866-m-special-training-requirements-for-personnel-on-tankers-and-passenger-ships">MSN 1866</a> and the applicable MNTB guide(s).  Evidence of approved seagoing service and bunkering operations should be held on file (paper or electronic) and made available to the MCA on request.</p>

<p>Overseas course approvals must be directed to Seafarer Training and Certification Branch: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:stc.courses@mcga.gov.uk">stc.courses@mcga.gov.uk</a>. These courses must be conducted at a fixed location.</p>

<p>If, as the result of an audit, or if the MCA otherwise becomes aware that the Training Centre is no longer complying with the conditions of approval or has major non-compliance issues as regards to health and safety, the MCA reserves the right to suspend or cancel the approval of the course.</p>
