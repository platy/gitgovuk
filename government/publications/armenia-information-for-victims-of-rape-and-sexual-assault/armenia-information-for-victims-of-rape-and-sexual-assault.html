<p>If you’ve been sexually assaulted it’s important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make informed decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention</li>
  <li>report to local police</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 103 for ambulance and 102 for local police</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>
    <p>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-yerevan">British Embassy Yerevan</a>. Our telephone number is +374(0) 10 264301. Embassy staff will be empathetic and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Armenia</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You must report the crime in Armenia before returning to the UK if you want it to be investigated. The crime must be reported at the nearest Police Station in Armenia. Leaving the territory of Armenia may lead to the cancellation of criminal proceedings</p>
</div>

<p>Reporting crimes to the police in Armenia can be a complex and time consuming process. Local officers may not have specific training in supporting victims of sexual assault. You may find the process of reporting the assault at times difficult, and quite different from what you would expect of UK police proceedings.</p>

<p>Rape and sexual assault are both criminal offences in Armenia, but conviction rates remain low, and judicial proceedings are likely to take a long time. It is very likely that victims will be asked to testify in front of third parties, and there is no legislation to punish those violating the confidentiality of a victim.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime:</p>

<ul>
  <li>try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained.</li>
  <li>washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence</li>
  <li>if you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police</li>
  <li>you may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts</li>
  <li>tell the police if you think you have been drugged</li>
</ul>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-yerevan">British Embassy</a> or you can contact the embassy yourself</p>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator and you are in an area reachable by the British embassy they will try to send a consular officer to support you. Consular staff can accompany you to the police station should you so wish and where possible. However, we cannot provide interpretation and might not be allowed to stay with you during a police interview.</p>

<p>You can request an officer of a particular gender although there is no guarantee one will be available. There is very limited number of English-speaking police officers. An interpreter might be provided by the local police but this is not guaranteed and there is no guarantee of quality either. In order to save time, you might consider having your own interpreter with you when you visit the Police station. The British Embassy Yerevan can provide you with a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/armenia-list-of-lawyers/list-of-translatorsinterpreters-in-armenia">list of interpreters</a>.</p>

<p>Once an initial verbal report is made to the police, you will be required to give a full statement. Not all police stations will have private rooms for taking a statement. Generally, interviews will take place in the office of duty investigators and there are likely to be several people working in one office.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Request the copy of the written statement in both languages when you are finished, although English version might not be readily available in Armenia.</p>
</div>

<p>Get the copy of your written statement describing the incident signed by the Police Officer, once you submit the original, and retain the copy. The signed copy will act as proof that the incident has been reported to the Police. The case is cascaded to the several area departments. Therefore, the victim will have to make a statement several times and sometimes visit the incident site together with the police officers.</p>

<p>All your clothes you had at the time of attack will be kept by the police as an evidence and will be send for forensic examination. The victim will be sent to the local hospital or the forensic examination suite if she/he hasn’t sought medical assistance in the first instance. The results of the examination will be reflected in a separate protocol and photo evidence of the face and body injuries will be taken.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Armenia</h2>

<p>The British embassy or consulate will be able to help you. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helping you make arrangements to contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK</li>
  <li>providing you with information on local support in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>They can provide you with the lists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>English-speaking <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/armenia-list-of-lawyers">lawyers and translators</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/armenia-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">medical practitioners</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can report the incident to them and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital</p>

<p>Consular staff can accompany you to the hospital should you so wish and where possible. In the interests of patient confidentiality, we will wait in reception during your medical examination.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime, but if you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated if there is a lack of forensic evidence</p>
</div>

<p>If you do not report the crime, you will still be able to get medical attention and you should go to the nearest hospital, a local doctor or gynaecologist, but you will not be entitled to a forensic examination.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>The support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence.</p>

<p>If you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>, or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London.</p>

<p>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police.</p>

<p>The UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</p>

<p>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.</p>

<h2>The medical examination</h2>

<p>Forensic examinations are performed in Armenia by a Forensic Examiner on notification via the Armenian Police. A forensic examination is carried out by a doctor.</p>

<p>Samples or swabs will be taken from clothes, the mouth, hair and there will be a gynaecological examination. This is undertaken by specially-trained medical staff. Photos of severe external injuries will be taken for investigative purposes.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>

<p>There are certain medical clinics most commonly used by foreigners in Yerevan that are able to offer medical support to victims of rape and sexual assault.</p>

<p>They can offer medical support including external injuries examination, gynaecological examination with swaps and STDs. Some medical practices will automatically pass details of people they believe to be victims of rape or sexual assault to the police. The British Embassy Yerevan can talk to local healthcare providers on your behalf to check a clinic’s policy in this matter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>hospital medical staff can give you advice on HIV PEP medication (‘Post-exposure prophylaxis’, a treatment that can prevent HIV infection) should you or they feel it is necessary. This can be prescribed at hospital. PEP is available in the country and can be done at <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.armaids.am/en/" rel="external">National Centre for Aids Prevention CJSC</a>. More information on risks is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/" rel="external">NHS website</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>emergency contraception can be obtained from a pharmacy, though you will require a doctor’s prescription and it is not free</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Abortion is available in Armenia for a gestational period up to 12 weeks.  You will need to see a doctor to request this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hospital treatments and tests can be paid by card, though some local clinics may accept cash payments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you have had medication administered whilst overseas keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication and let your local health provider know</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Police investigations in Armenia</h2>

<p>After the crime is reported to Police, they will decide depending on the circumstances of the incident, either to refer the case to the Prosecution Office or take the case forward himself after an initial interview with the victim.</p>

<p>The police may take the victim to the scene of the crime to get more details on the incident; however, they will not take the victim to a location where the victim thinks the attacker is located to try and identify the person. Suspects and victims may be interviewed simultaneously by the police, so there is a risk of victims and suspects meeting in corridors or waiting areas of the building.</p>

<p>In Armenia, victims will be asked to identify a suspect at the police station. Many police stations do not have 2-way mirrors installed, so it is likely that victims will be asked to make an identification face to face. In accordance with the local legislation, the victim must attend, as part of the investigation process. Criminal investigations in Armenia tend to progress very slowly.</p>

<p>Victims are generally expected to make statements in person, though having a lawyer present throughout the proceeding can be beneficial. The lawyer can speak to the prosecutor on behalf of the victim based on the case notes and copies of protocols.</p>

<p>Once the initial police investigation is completed, the public prosecutor or the police will decide one of several options open to them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>order a trial if they have overwhelming evidence – for example, if the suspect has confessed</li>
  <li>they can file the case - this does not mean that they have decided that nothing happened, but that they do not have sufficient grounds or evidence to prosecute</li>
  <li>they can extend the period of the investigation depending of the circumstances of the case</li>
</ul>

<p>The indictment completed by the Police is subject to the clearance of the Prosecutor. In all cases the victim leaving the country may trigger the closure of a case.</p>

<h2>Court procedures in Armenia</h2>

<p>All rape and assault charges are regulated under Criminal Code of the Republic of Armenia.</p>

<p>Victims are generally expected to testify in person, including in cases of rape and sexual assault. Questions are often asked around the details of sexual acts and might be uncomfortable for a victim. The absence of consent is considered as rape, however in practice the absence of torn clothes, or physical injury may be seen as consent, although in all cases it will be subject to investigation. Testimony will be in front of the accused. Due to particularities of the legislation it’s not prohibited for a suspect’s family members to attend the court hearing.</p>

<p>The victim is entitled to be aware of the case developments. However, having legal representation from the early stages of a case increases the likelihood that victims’ rights will be respected during initial interviews with police and further investigation stages. You will need to engage a lawyer at your own expense to represent you if you would like to receive good quality service.</p>

<p>The British Embassy can provide you the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/armenia-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers-in-armenia">list of lawyers</a>. A public lawyer can be provided by the court but there is no guarantee of quality either. If you choose to request lawyer from the court, you should inform them of this requirement in advance to allow them to make suitable arrangements.</p>

<p>It is possible to drop charges by providing a written statement to the investigators but the victim has to be prepared to explain the reason for doing it. If the victim is suspected to be giving false statements, she/he can face legal repercussions. The assailant may press counter charges against you claiming that you have made false accusations. The court will investigate these claims and decide on proceedings. Courts can order perpetrators to pay compensation to victims of rape and sexual violence including for moral damage.</p>

<p>If you do not speak Armenian, a translator will be provided by the court and you should inform them of this requirement in advance to allow them to make suitable arrangements. You can also have your own interpreter. The Embassy can provide a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/armenia-list-of-lawyers/list-of-translatorsinterpreters-in-armenia">list of interpreters</a> for you to choose one from. Consular staff will not normally be able to attend the trial with you. You may wish to be accompanied by a friend or member of your family for the court hearing.</p>

<h2>When you return home to the UK</h2>

<p>You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice where you live.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you. You should do this even if you have been tested in the country that the assault took place in.</p>
