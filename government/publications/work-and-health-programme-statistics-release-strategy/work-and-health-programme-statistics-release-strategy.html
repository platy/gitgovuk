<p>This release strategy updates the version published in February 2021. This updated strategy acts as the formal response to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/work-and-health-programme-statistics-publication-proposals">Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) official statistics consultation</a>.</p>

<p>We will investigate the opportunities to release <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/work-and-health-programme-statistics"><abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> statistics and management information</a> as outlined in this release strategy. This is designed to ensure that statistics are placed into the public domain in a clear and controlled way.</p>

<h2>Consultation</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> statistics consultation ran from 7 August to 17 September 2018.</p>

<p>The responses to this consultation have helped identify and prioritise the requirements for the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> statistics. This release strategy has been revised as a result of the consultation.</p>

<p>Read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/work-health-programme">Work and Health Programme</a>.</p>

<h2>Publication frequency</h2>

<p>The experimental <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> official statistics will be released on a quarterly basis (each November, February, May and August). They will include yearly summary information at the appropriate points in the programme’s lifecycle.</p>

<p>The initial intention had been to publish these statistics on the same day as the wider Labour Market Statistics, produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It is now clear that this would not allow sufficient time to 
quality assure and include the latest available month’s data.</p>

<p>Therefore, we will instead publish statistical information with a 3-month reference period. This means that, for example, the August 2020 statistics publication includes data up until the end of May 2020.</p>

<h2>Publication formats</h2>

<p>The statistics are currently released in the following formats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an HTML format report, containing key headline statistics and charts</li>
  <li>a set of spreadsheet tables, containing key statistics by referral cohort and geographical region</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a>, providing a guided way to explore statistics, create your own custom tabulations and view the results in interactive charts and maps</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data and statistics</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) plan to increase the range of information released within the statistics over time, as further quality assurance of data held within the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> administrative systems is completed.</p>

<p>The statistics consist of 5 main measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of referrals to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> (from the first publication in November 2018)</li>
  <li>the number of starts to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> (from the first publication in November 2018)</li>
  <li>the number of job outcomes achieved (added in the May 2019 publication)</li>
  <li>first earnings from employment (added in the February 2020 publication)</li>
  <li>provider performance levels (added in the November 2020 publication)</li>
</ul>

<p>The statistics include all areas that have provided referrals to the programme since November 2017, including Local Government Partners and Devolved Deal Areas.</p>

<p>Different areas began implementing the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> at different times. Each has its own implementation practices, therefore we will ensure context is set appropriately within the release to enable fair reporting on the scheme.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-statistics-background-information-and-methodology/work-and-health-progamme-statistics-background-information-and-methodology#areas"><abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> background information note</a> for more information about the areas covered by these statistics.</p>

<p>Some or all of the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> official statistics measures will be broken down by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>referral group – disability, early access, long-term unemployed</li>
  <li>claimant characteristics – gender, age in bands</li>
  <li>benefit group claimed at referral – Universal Credit, Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, incapacity benefits, Other</li>
  <li>geographical area – Contract Package Area, Devolved Deal Area, Local Government Partnership</li>
  <li>Work and Health Programme provider</li>
</ul>

<p>We have designated these as experimental official statistics, following <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" rel="external">guidelines set out by the UK Statistics Authority</a>.</p>

<p>Final statistics will be subject to the availability and quality assurance of associated data.</p>

<h2>Future developments</h2>

<p>Additional breakdowns may be included within these official statistics publications as quality assurance of data from the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> systems progresses.</p>

<p>From August 2020, the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> statistics, except those detailing provider performance levels, have been released on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a>, allowing users to create their own bespoke, detailed statistics. The remaining statistics will be released on Stat-Xplore once quality assurance has taken place.</p>

<p>It is not possible to provide a precise timescale or definitive list of additional breakdowns at this stage, however we will explore the possibility of including additional information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>main disabling condition</li>
  <li>self-employment status</li>
  <li>other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits claimed at point of referral</li>
  <li>disability and ethnicity status</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is keen to continue to receive feedback from users on which breakdowns are a priority for them.  Email your feedback to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:epass.team@dwp.gov.uk">epass.team@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>
