<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guidance explains how eligible education settings, childcare and children’s social care settings can access funding for costs previously incurred when conducting asymptomatic testing site (ATS) on-site testing, in line with the Government’s testing policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Expiry or review date</h3>
<p>This guidance will be kept under regular review.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Who is this publication for?</h3>
<p>This guidance is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream academies and maintained schools with secondary age pupils</li>
  <li>16 to 19 academies and maintained schools</li>
  <li>alternative provision academies with secondary age pupils, including hospital schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units with secondary age pupils</li>
  <li>special academies and special maintained schools with secondary age pupils</li>
  <li>further education (FE) colleges and sixth form colleges</li>
  <li>special post-16 institutions</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>independent special schools</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Scope</h2>
<p>These grant conditions relate to the allocation that schools and colleges will receive to support with the costs associated with the following testing activity:</p>

<p>Testing from 23 August 2021 to 17 December 2021, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rapid one-off on-site ATS testing on return of all students or pupils in autumn 2021 attending educational settings (secondary schools and FE colleges), with students or pupils receiving 2 lateral flow device (LFD) tests, spaced 3 to 5 days apart</li>
  <li>the maintenance of an on-site ATS testing offer from 18 September 2021 to 17 December 2021, to enable the twice weekly testing of students or pupils for whom at-home testing was not considered suitable or who may have needed additional assistance</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing from 18 December 2021 to 18 February 2022, including</p>

<ul>
  <li>the maintenance of an on-site ATS testing offer from 18 December 2021 to 7 January 2022 for FE colleges</li>
  <li>the rapid one-off on-site ATS testing on return of all pupils in January 2022 in secondary schools, with pupils receiving 1 lateral flow device (LFD) test</li>
  <li>the maintenance of an on-site ATS testing offer from 8 January to 18 February 2022, in line with departmental testing policy, to enable the twice weekly testing of students or pupils in secondary schools and FE colleges for whom at-home testing was not considered suitable or who may have needed additional assistance</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing from 21 February 2022 to 31 March 2022, including the maintenance of an on-site ATS testing offer from 21 February 2022 to 31 March 2022 (in line with departmental testing policy) to enable the twice weekly testing of students or pupils for whom at-home testing was not considered suitable.</p>

<p>This includes students or pupils who may have needed additional assistance in special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) settings, alternative provision (AP) and special education needs (SEN) units in mainstream schools or equivalent in FE colleges.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Eligibility</h2>

<p>The following institution types will be eligible for funding between 23 August 2021 to 18 February 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream academies and maintained schools with secondary age pupils</li>
  <li>16 to 19 academies and maintained schools</li>
  <li>FE colleges and sixth form colleges</li>
</ul>

<p>The following institution types will be eligible for funding from 23 August 2021 to 31 March 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream schools with SEND units, or equivalent in FE colleges</li>
  <li>alternative provision academies with secondary age pupils, including hospital schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units with secondary age pupils</li>
  <li>special academies and special maintained schools with secondary age pupils</li>
  <li>special post-16 institutions</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>independent special schools</li>
</ul>

<p>The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) will only provide funding to institutions that are on a list of confirmed participants in the rapid testing programme provided by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).</p>

<p>Each confirmed test site will have an agreed identifier to record test results. This will be used to identify participating institutions.</p>

<p>Independent institutions (with fee-paying pupils and students) are not eligible for this funding.</p>

<p>At eligible institutions, all pupils age 11 to 18 are in scope (for SEND units in mainstream schools this applies to pupils attending the SEND unit), as are any aged 19 plus who attended college during this period.</p>

<p>We are providing this funding to support institutions with the costs of testing. We expect this to be mainly workforce costs, however, institutions did have discretion on how they could spend this funding.</p>

<p>Other costs might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>minor incidental expenses, such as printing, paper and stationery, cleaning materials and equipment, tissues and wipes</li>
  <li>additional waste disposal costs incurred given the additional waste volumes likely to be generated from the testing bays and desks, such as LFD kits, disposable personal protective equipment (PPE), tissues and paper bowls</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Allocations</h2>
<p>Allocations will be based on the number of bays and desks calculated as needed to deliver the number of tests completed (measured by the number of test results recorded on the school or college’s individual account on the Test and Trace Log Results website).</p>

<p>To calculate funding, we will estimate the number of bays and desks a school or college would have required in order to complete the number of test results recorded, based on an average testing volume. We will then apply an average cost per bay.</p>

<p>We expect most of these costs to relate to workforce costs for quality lead/team leader, test assistants, processors, registration assistants and cleaners. For testing conducted before 8 January, we will also allow for waste disposal and minor incidental costs.</p>

<p>For rapid one-off on-site ATS testing on return of pupils or students who attended school, or college for testing on return in autumn 2021 to January 2022, we have calculated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 role per 10 testing bays and desks for the following roles: COVID-19 co-ordinator, quality lead or team leader, registration assistant, results recorder and cleaner</li>
  <li>1 processor per bay and desk</li>
  <li>1 test assistant per bay and desk in special schools, special post-16 institutions, or 1 per 5 bays and desks in mainstream settings</li>
</ul>

<p>Eligible institutions in London will be paid an additional weighting for workforce costs. This will be calculated in accordance with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities’ general labour market rates.</p>

<p>For institutions receiving Medacs support for administered swabbing requirements, the cost of this Medacs support will be deducted from that institution’s allocation or payment by recalculating the allocation with the Medacs funded post removed.</p>

<p>We have accounted for different staffing levels needed for rapid one-off on-site ATS testing on return of pupils or students in special schools, special post-16 institutions, alternative provision academies and pupil referral units.</p>

<p>We have assumed that these settings needed a higher number of test assistants to support pupils who could not self-administer tests.</p>

<p>Test assistants will be paid at a higher hourly rate to reflect the likelihood of additional qualifications or experience.
While these assumptions will be used to determine funding allocations, decisions on specific requirements for staffing are for individual institutions to make.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Exceptional funding for additional premises costs</h2>
<p>In exceptional circumstances, we will consider claims for additional funding over a minimum level of £250 to cover other additional costs incurred by schools and colleges.</p>

<p>The window to claim for exceptional premises costs for testing on return in autumn term 2021 opened at the end of the autumn term 2021, and the window to claim for exceptional premises costs for testing on return in January 2022 opened on 31 January 2022. Both windows are now closed.</p>

<p>This included schools that had to hire additional premises or make significant alterations to their existing premises to conduct a rapid one-off onsite ATS for pupils on return in January. We anticipate making payment for valid claims in spring 2022.</p>

<p>Claims are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only available in exceptional circumstances where the funding allocation is not sufficient and after every other alternative option has been exhausted</li>
  <li>need to be supported by an invoice or other documentary evidence of the costs incurred</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Payments</h2>
<p>A series of payments will be made to schools and colleges, with payments being made retrospectively and based on information reported through Test and Trace.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges">Coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing funding for schools and colleges</a> for more information about how much each institution has been allocated for the periods of testing that have already been paid for.</p>

<p>For testing conducted from 23 August to 17 September, payments were made to colleges, non-maintained special schools, local authorities and academies in November 2021.</p>

<p>For testing conducted from 18 September 2021 onwards, we will make payments to colleges, non-maintained special schools, local authorities and academies between April and July 2022.</p>

<p>Payments will be made directly to colleges, academies, local authorities and non-maintained special schools. Local authorities must pass payments on to maintained schools. ESFA will make these payments automatically. There will be no requirement to make a claim to receive the funding for Test and Trace reported testing.</p>

<p>We have asked institutions to make the necessary payments to carry out testing from their existing budgets and record these in line with local finance policies. Any school that is an academy on 1 April 2022 will receive payment directly from ESFA. Local authorities should pass on funding to schools due to convert to academies after this date.</p>

<p>Independent special schools (ISSs) included in these allocations may be paid later. To receive payment for this grant, ISSs will need to ensure they have registered their bank details with the department. This can be done by completing the online form, provide information about your banking and payments to DfE, following the route as a ‘provider’ organisation type.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Variation</h2>
<p>These conditions of grant may be altered at any time. Participating institutions will be notified of this through existing channels.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Recovery of funding</h2>
<p>This funding is being provided under section 14 to 16 of the Education Act 2002 and we reserve the right to audit the expenditure.</p>

<p>We will seek to recover funding that has been paid in error. This includes overpayment where an institution is also receiving Medacs support.</p>

<p>Recoveries will be made by invoice or by offsetting the amount against subsequent payments due from DfE.
The recipient must notify DfE immediately through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Education_and_Skills_Funding_Agency__ESFA__enquiry_form" rel="external">ESFA enquiry form</a> if it becomes aware of any instance of error, suspected fraud or financial irregularity in the use of the funds.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Monitoring, assurance and data requirements</h2>
<p>We have a responsibility to make sure that public funds are properly managed in line with these grant conditions.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to check each institution’s Test and Trace data. We may adjust an institution’s allocation if the recorded number of tests exceeds the department’s guidance on testing activity to be carried out this half term.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to request assurance of this grant funding and will provide further details as necessary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Further information</h2>
<p>Books, other documents and records relating to the recipient’s accounts shall be open to inspection by the Secretary of State and by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General may, under section 6 of the National Audit Act 1983, carry out examinations into the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the recipient has used its resources in discharging its grant-aided activities.</p>

<p>Schools, colleges and local authorities shall provide information as may be required by the Secretary of State to determine whether it has complied with these conditions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Short-term support with costs</h2>
<p>We recognise that a very small number of academies and colleges may be unable to make up-front payments to cover the additional costs due to COVID-19 because of cash flow issues. In these circumstances, academies and colleges should follow the normal process for seeking short-term advances to support their cash flow by contacting ESFA through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Education_and_Skills_Funding_Agency__ESFA__enquiry_form" rel="external">ESFA enquiry form</a>.</p>

<p>Any maintained schools in similar circumstances should contact their local authority for support.</p>
