<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance provides additional information on the allocations to be paid to schools and colleges to support the costs associated with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-schools-and-colleges-grant-funding">coronavirus (COVID-19) National Testing Programme</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Conditions of grant funding</h2>

<p>Information on the scope, eligibility and terms of funding for the initial roll-out of rapid ATS (asymptomatic) testing from 4 January 2021 until 1 April 2021 is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-schools-and-colleges-grant-funding">coronavirus (COVID-19) National Testing Programme: conditions of grant</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Spring 2021 Payment</h2>

<p>Institutions may receive two payments in spring 2021.</p>

<p>The initial payment will relate to testing for the period of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 January 2021 to February half term</li>
  <li>February half term to 5 March 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>This phase 1 period covers ATS testing for staff members and pupils onsite before the two-week rapid one-off testing completed on the return of all pupils.</p>

<p>The next payment will relate to testing for the period of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>phase 2: 6 March 2021 to 21 March 2021</li>
  <li>phase 3: 22 March 2021 to 1 April 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 2 will include the two-week rapid one-off ATS testing on return for all pupils, while phase 3 will recognise the ongoing ATS testing completed in the remainder of the spring term.</p>

<p>Information on how this will be paid to schools and colleges is in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-schools-and-colleges-grant-funding">coronavirus (COVID-19) National Testing Programme: conditions of grant</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Summer 2021 payment</h2>

<p>Institutions may receive one payment in summer 2021.</p>

<p>This payment will relate to testing for the period of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>phase 4: 2 April 2021 to 23 July 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 4 will recognise the ongoing ATS testing completed in the summer term</p>

<p>Information on how these payments will be paid to schools and colleges is in the coronavirus (COVID-19) National Testing Programme: conditions of grant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Allocations</h2>

<p>We will base allocations on the number of bays/desks calculated as needed to deliver the number of tests completed (measured by the number of test results recorded on the school or collegeâs individual account on the Test Site Results service).</p>

<p>We will pay eligible institutions in and close to London an additional weighting for workforce costs.</p>

<p>We will calculate this in accordance with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governmentâs general labour market rates.</p>

<p>For institutions receiving Medacs support for administered swabbing requirements, the cost of this Medacs support will be deducted from that institutionâs allocation/payment by recalculating the allocation with the Medacs-funded post removed. For the spring 2021 payment there were no institutions that received Medacs support.</p>

<p>We have accounted for different staffing levels needed for rapid one-off testing on return of pupils and students in special schools, Special post-16 institutions, alternative provision academies and pupil referral units. Weâve assumed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>these settings will need a higher number of test assistants to support pupils who cannot self-administer tests.</li>
  <li>test assistants will be paid at a higher hourly rate to reflect the likelihood of additional qualifications or experience being needed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Itâs important for us to be able to identify a school or collegeâs Unique Reference Number (URN) from their Test Site Results service data to calculate allocations correctly.</p>
</div>

<p>Allocation funding amounts for pupil and staff testing bays can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing funding for schools and colleges allocation funding amounts</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Spring 2021 allocation covering the period of 4 January 2021 to 5 March 2021</h3>

<p>We will calculate the spring 2021 allocation, covering the period 4 January 2021 to 5 March 2021, for staff and pupil ATS testing separately. An institutionâs total allocation will be the sum of these calculated funding amounts.</p>

<p>For pupil ATS testing we have calculated the number of estimated bays required for this payment period as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>total pupil ATS tests divided by 396 (6 days multiplied by 6 hours multiplied by 11 tests an hour) rounded up to the next whole bay.</li>
</ul>

<p>For staff ATS testing we have calculated the number of estimated bays required for this payment period as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>total staff ATS tests divided by 528 (32 days multiplied by 1.5 hours multiplied by 11 tests an hour) rounded up to the next whole bay.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the spring 2021 allocation, covering the period 4 January 2021 to 5 March 2021, an institutionâs establishment type and local authority location will reflect their status as of the 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>Allocation funding amounts for pupil and staff testing bays can be found in the Phase 1 â Pupil table and Phase 1 - staff table published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges">coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing funding for schools and colleges: allocation funding amounts document</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Spring 2021 allocation covering the period of 6 March 2021 to 1 April 2021</h3>

<p>The expectation is that, from 8 March 2021, members of staff have moved to at home testing. Allocations for this payment period will, therefore, be based on the number of bays/desks estimated as needed to deliver the number of ATS tests for pupils only.</p>

<p>For the period relating to the two-week rapid one-off ATS testing on return for all pupils (6 March 2021 to 21 March 2021), we have calculated the number of estimated bays required as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>total pupil tests divided by 594 (9 days multiplied by 6 hours multiplied by 11 tests an hour) rounded up to the next whole bay</li>
</ul>

<p>For the period relating to the 22 March 2021 to 1 April 2021, we have calculated the number of estimated bays required as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>total staff tests divided by 198 (9 days multiplied by 2 hours multiplied by 11 tests an hour) rounded up to the next whole bay</li>
</ul>

<p>An institutionâs total allocation will be the sum of these calculated funding amounts.</p>

<p>For the spring 2021 allocation, covering the period 6 March 2021 to 1 April 2021, an institutionâs establishment type and local authority location will reflect their status as of the 1 May 2021.</p>

<p>Allocation funding amounts for pupil testing bays during this period can be found in the following tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>phase 2: pupil</li>
  <li>phase 2: pupil Medacs support</li>
  <li>phase 3: pupil table</li>
  <li>phase 3: pupil Medacs support</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Summer 2021 allocation covering the period of 2 April 2021 to 23 July 2021</h3>

<p>The summer 2021 allocation will continue to fund ATS tests for pupils only.</p>

<p>For this allocation payment period we have calculated the number of estimated bays required as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>total pupil tests divided by 1,408 (64 days multiplied by 2 hours multiplied by 11 tests an hour) rounded up to the next whole bay</li>
</ul>

<p>For the summer 2021 allocation an institutionâs establishment type and local authority location will reflect their status as of the 1 August 2021.</p>

<p>Allocation funding amounts for pupil testing bays can be found in the phase 4: pupil table published in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing funding for schools and colleges: allocation funding amounts document</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Institutions who have delivered a small number of staff or pupil tests</h2>

<p>We know that some institutions have returned a small number of staff or pupil tests. We recognise that there will still be costs associated with this testing, but that this cost will be lower than running a bay full-time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Spring 2021 allocation covering the period of 4 January 2021 to 5 March 2021</h3>

<p>We have estimated that institutions who have returned less than 22 ATS tests during the spring 2021 allocation covering the period of 4 January 2021 to 5 March 2021 will have required less than 1 hour of testing on 2 separate days.</p>

<p>Therefore, institutions that have delivered less than 22 staff or pupil tests will receive a minimum allocation amount. This minimum threshold criteria will be applied separately to staff and pupil testing totals. If an institution has both staff and pupil testing totals less than 22, then they will receive the minimum allocation amount twice, once for their staff testing and once for their pupil testing.</p>

<p>Institutions who have not returned any staff tests will not receive any allocation for staff testing. However, they will receive funding for any pupil tests delivered. Likewise, institutions that have not delivered any pupil tests will not receive a pupil test allocation but will receive funding for their staff testing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Spring 2021 allocation covering the period of 6 March 2021 to 1 April 2021</h3>

<p>For the spring 2021 allocation, covering the period of 6 March 2021 to 1 April 2021, an institution will receive a minimum allocation amount if they have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>delivered less than 33 ATS tests during the period relating to the two-week rapid one-off ATS testing on return for all pupils (this is based on our estimation that institutions who have returned less than 33 ATS tests during this time will have required less than 1 hour of testing on 3 separate days)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>delivered less than 99 ATS tests during the period relating to the 22 March 2021 to 1 April 2021 (this is based on our estimation that institutions who have returned less than 99 ATS tests during this time will have required less than 1 hour of testing on 9 separate days)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This minimum threshold criteria will be applied separately to each phase. If an institution has delivered less ATS tests for each phase, then they will receive the minimum allocation amount twice. Minimum allocation amounts for all spring 2021 allocation payments are published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges">coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing funding for schools and colleges: allocation funding amounts document</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Summer 2021 allocation covering the period of 2 April 2021 to 23 July 2021</h3>

<p>For the summer 2021 allocation an institution will receive a minimum allocation amount if they have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>delivered less than 704 ATS tests during the summer term period (this is based on our estimation that institutions who have returned less than 704 ATS tests during this time will have required less than 1 hour of testing on 64 separate days)</li>
</ul>

<p>Minimum allocation amounts for all 2020 to 2021 allocation payments are published in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges">coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing funding for schools and colleges: allocation funding amounts document</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Unregistered ATS tests</h2>

<p>There are test results in the Test Site Results service data where the test itself has either not been registered by an institution, or has been registered incorrectly. Where we can identify the institution that the test result is recorded against, we have included these unregistered tests when calculating an institutionâs allocation.</p>

<p>As unregistered tests have no registration information associated with them, we are unable to distinguish if they were a staff or pupil test. Since the majority of tests during the period of 4 January 2021 to 5 March 2021 were staff tests, we have assumed that the unregistered tests are also staff tests. The total number of unregistered tests for an institution will be included in the calculation to determine their staff testing allocation.</p>

<p>As the spring 2021 allocation covering the period of 6 March 2021 to 1 April 2021 will only fund pupil ATS testing, unregistered tests will be included in the calculation to determine the number of pupil testing bays.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Spring 2021 allocation adjustments</h2>

<p>Where it has been identified that an institution requires an adjustment to their mass testing allocation, the published allocation will be amended accordingly, and this will be paid as part of their next allocation payment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Daily contact testing (DCT) and pilot scheme schools</h2>

<p>Initial pilots of testing in schools (led by Public Health England (PHE) and NHS Test and Trace), including contact testing, started in October 2020. These pilots illustrated the potential benefit of daily contact testing in schools in detecting more positive cases and ensuring continued face-to-face education.</p>

<p>Institutions that were a pilot scheme school or who have taken part in the DCT pilot will receive additional funding as part of their mass testing allocation. The spring 2021 allocation covering the period of 6 March 2021 to 1 April 2021, only includes DCT funding for those schools participating in phase 1 of the DCT pilot. Any additional funding will be included in future allocation payments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Mass testing allocation examples</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span>Spring 2021 allocation covering the period of 4 January 2021 to 5 March 2021</h3>

<h4>Example A</h4>

<p>URN: 999999</p>

<p>Name: Somewhere Academy</p>

<p>LA Name: Kingston-Upon-Thames</p>

<p>Their Region Lookup will be Outer London West</p>

<p>Establishment Type: Academy Convertor</p>

<p>Their Bay Type Lookup will be Mainstream School</p>

<p>Phase: Secondary</p>

<p>MEDAC support: No</p>

<p>Overall number of Staff Tests for this period: 107</p>

<p>Overall number of Pupil Tests for this period: 125</p>

<p>Number of bays calculation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Staff = 107 tests / 528 (1.5 hours x 32 days x 11 tests per hour) = 1 bay</li>
  <li>Pupils = 125 tests / 396 (6 hours x 6 days x 11 tests per hour) = 1 bay</li>
</ul>

<p>For this institution they would receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£5,830 for staff testing = 1 bay for a mainstream school in Outer London West</li>
  <li>Â£9,210 for pupil testing = 1 bay for a mainstream school in Outer London West</li>
</ul>

<p>Their total allocation for this period would be Â£15,040.</p>

<h4>Example B</h4>

<p>URN: 999999</p>

<p>Name: Somewhere Else College</p>

<p>LA Name: Devon</p>

<p>Their Region Lookup will be Not London</p>

<p>Establishment Type: Academy Convertor</p>

<p>Their Bay Type Lookup will be Mainstream School</p>

<p>Phase: Secondary</p>

<p>MEDAC support: No</p>

<p>Overall number of Staff Tests for this period: 1803</p>

<p>Overall number of Pupil Tests for this period: 1</p>

<p>Number of bays calculation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Staff = 1803 tests / 528 (1.5 hours x 32 days x 11 tests per hour) = 4 bays</li>
  <li>Pupils = 1 test = Less than the minimum threshold of 22 tests â so minimum threshold payment</li>
</ul>

<p>For this institution they would receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£9,850 for staff testing = 4 bays for a mainstream school Not in London</li>
  <li>Â£720 for pupil testing = minimum threshold payment for a mainstream school Not in London</li>
</ul>
