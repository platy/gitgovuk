<h2>Launch of the Armed Forces Families Fund (AF3) on 1 September 2022</h2>

<p>Following the launch of the Families Strategy in January this year, the MOD created a dedicated fund in aid of the delivery against the eight themes of the strategy: Family Life, Service Life, Family Home, Education, Health and Wellbeing, Childcare, Support to Partners and Spouses, and Non-UK families.</p>

<p>This was achieved through the amalgamation of existing education-focused funds, the Education Support Fund (ESF) and Early Learning and Childcare Support Fund (ELCF), broadening their scope in support of the delivery of the AF Families Strategy in its entirety.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce that MOD will partner with the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust to administer the AF3. The Trust is highly experienced in supporting the Armed Forces Covenant by delivering funding programmes that create real change to Forces communities across the UK. As we transition to the AF3, we will continue to focus on educational matters and deliver current programmes.</p>

<p>During the transition phase, the new fund, AF3, is now taking over the current applications for the ESF, a programme that awards grants to schools to help address additional challenges that children from Armed Forces families may face. Grants awarded under this programme are typically in the region of £50,000- £60,000. Applications to this programme need to be submitted by 30 September 2022. You can find out more at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://covenantfund.org.uk/programme/education-support-fund/" rel="external">https://covenantfund.org.uk/programme/education-support-fund/</a>.</p>

<p>A funding programme to support children from Armed Forces Families who are in early years settings such as nurseries, formerly covered by the ELCF, will open in September 2022.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;ESF&nbsp;in its current form will still be open for applications between 9 May and 30 September 2022. Full details of the ESF programme – including guidance, useful resources and how to apply – can be found on the Trust’s website: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://covenantfund.org.uk/programme/education-support-fund/" rel="external">https://covenantfund.org.uk/programme/education-support-fund/</a>.</p>
