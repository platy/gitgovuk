<h3><span class="number">1.Introduction </span></h3>

<p>1.1 The Merchant Shipping (Marine Equipment) Regulations 2016 SI 2016/1025 as amended (“the Regulations”) and this Notice set out performance and testing standards to be met by marine equipment placed or to be placed on board a UK ship in accordance with the UK’s conformity assessment procedures, as detailed in Part I of this Notice.</p>

<p>1.2 This Notice also sets out type approval procedures for equipment placed or to be placed on board UK ships which is outside the scope of the UK’s conformity assessment procedures for marine equipment, but which requires conformity approval by various UK instruments. Such type approvals are carried out by nominated bodies in accordance with the procedures in Part II of this Notice.</p>

<p>1.3 Further, this Notice sets out the technical standards for equipment not requiring conformity assessment of type approval, before being placed on board a UK ship and for which the carriage requirement does not provide for a specific standard of equipment.</p>

<p>1.4 This Notice is split into three parts, covering three overarching categories of equipment:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.4.1 Part I, sets out the equipment within the scope of the UK’s conformity assessment procedures for marine equipment and the associated technical requirements to which equipment must be approved by an approved body;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.4.2  Part II, sets out the requirements for equipment that falls outside the scope of the UK’s conformity assessment procedures for marine equipment but nonetheless requires approval of the Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency (“MCA”) as the flag administration for UK ships under the international instruments, and equipment required to be approved in accordance with other UK domestic instruments; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.4.3  Part III, sets out technical standards and arrangements for other equipment, where there is no specified standard for such equipment in existing UK instruments.</p>

<p>1.5  <u>Interpretation:</u></p>

<p>In this Notice:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5.1  “The Regulations” shall mean the Merchant Shipping (Marine Equipment) Regulations 2016 SI 2016/1025 as amended by the Merchant Shipping (Marine Equipment) (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 SI 2019/470.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5.2  Where a specific regulation is cited, unless specifically stated otherwise, this shall be construed as reference to a regulation within the Regulations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5.3  Where the term “Part” is used in relation to Part I, II or III of this Notice, this refers to the respective part of this Notice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5.4  Unless expressly stated otherwise, a term used in this Notice shall have the same meaning as defined in regulation 2 of the Regulations.</p>

<h2>PART I – Equipment within the scope of the UK conformity assessment procedures for marine equipment</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.Scope </span> of equipment approval according to the UK conformity assessment procedures for marine equipment</h3>

<p>2.1 Equipment within the scope of Part I is that which is required by the international instruments and must be approved by the flag State administration of the relevant ship, as provided for in regulation 5(1).</p>

<p>2.2  Equipment to which Part I applies must be approved by one or more approved bodies. For more information regarding the approval procedure and/or the application of requirements of such equipment, an approved body which may assess the relevant equipment should be contacted. A full list of approved bodies can be found in paragraph 5.2 of this Part.</p>

<p>2.3 Manufacturers with existing approval certificates in accordance with the Directive (Directive 2014/90/EU on marine equipment) may continue to make their equipment available to the UK market and to be placed on board UK ships as provided for in regulation 5 until 1 January 2023 when this will no longer be accepted.</p>

<p>2.4 Businesses are encouraged to be ready for 1 January 2023. MED approved equipment can continue to be placed on UK ships until 1 January 2023, provided MED and UK Standards remain equivalent.</p>

<p>2.5 MED approved marine equipment placed on board a UK flagged vessel can remain on board for the duration of its operational life and only when items are replaced, after 1st January 2023, must they be replaced with UK approved marine equipment in accordance with the requirements in this MSN. This means that MED approved equipment that is on board a UK flagged vessel prior to the 1 January 2023 can remain on board until the end of the equipment’s operational life. For example, if a piece of MED approved equipment was on board a UK flagged vessel prior to 1 January 2023, and then reached the end of its operational life after 1 January 2023; it would need to be replaced with UK approved marine equipment thereafter.</p>

<p>2.6 Equipment that is defined as a ‘spare’ part can continue to be placed on board a United Kingdom ship, this includes after 1 January 2023. A ‘spare’ is defined as: ‘Spares are replacements of Wheelmarked or Red Ensign marked products which ensure continued functionality (i.e., via maintenance or repair) of a wider product or system on board a United Kingdom ship.’</p>

<p>2.7  Additionally, EU-approved marine equipment that has been manufactured <b>before 1 January 2023</b> can continue to be placed on board United Kingdom ships as if it was a United Kingdom approved piece of marine equipment, subject to the timeframes around placing on board outlined elsewhere in this notice. If such equipment has been manufactured <u>after 1 January 2023</u>, then it must be UK approved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.Requirements </span> for equipment to be placed on board a UK Ship</h3>

<p>3.1 Equipment placed on board a UK ship to which this Part applies must meet the design, construction and performance requirements of the international instruments detailed in Annex 1 of this Notice applicable at the time when that equipment is placed on board in accordance with regulation 5(1)</p>

<p>3.2 Unless there is a change in the applicable standards specified in Annex 1 of this Notice for equipment already placed on board a UK ship, existing approval will continue to be accepted providing equipment continues to operate in accordance with its existing approval. If equipment is replaced, it must be replaced with equipment which complies with the Regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.Domestic </span> Passenger Ships and Large Fishing Vessels</h3>

<p>4.1 As required by regulation 5(2), where equipment is specified in Annex 1 of this Notice, a domestic passenger ship or fishing vessel must carry equipment that complies with applicable international standards, except where a carriage requirement provides for an alternative standard. The carriage requirements are listed in Annex 4 of this Notice.</p>

<p>4.2 Regulation 5(2)(c) provides an exception to regulation 5(2) detailed above, such that equipment voluntarily placed on board must meet the standard(s) specified by the Secretary of State. This provision is to allow flexibility while ensuring a minimum standard of safety. Such specified standards will be agreed by a ship’s appointed MCA surveyor where it is proven that the equipment complying with applicable international standards does not offer a practicable solution for reasons of size of the equipment/ integration with the ship or vessel etc.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.UK </span> Approved Bodies</h3>

<p>5.1 The MCA has designated organisations listed below as approved bodies for the purpose of carrying out approvals of equipment to undertake the examination, testing and certification of the equipment specified in Annex 1 of this Notice.</p>

<p>5.4 Approved Bodies must meet the requirements of Schedule 3 of the Regulations and will be assessed at least once every 2 years to confirm compliance with these requirements. The United Kingdom Accreditation Services (UKAS) as the national accreditation body is delegated this assessment responsibility. Further information and guidance is available for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be designated as an approved body in Marine Guidance Note 554 as amended.</p>

<p>5.5 The MCA is responsible for designating approved bodies on behalf of the Secretary of State. For this purpose, the MCA can be contacted at the following address:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.Provisionally </span> appointed UK Approved Bodies</h3>

<p>6.1 The MCA has provisionally designated organisations listed as approved bodies for the purpose of carrying out approvals of equipment to undertake the examination, testing and certification of the equipment specified in Annex 1 of this Notice. These are specified in the Approved Bodies table in section 5 above, on pages 6 – 8 of this Notice.</p>

<p>6.2 Provisionally appointed UK Approved Bodies must meet the requirements of Schedules 3 and 4 of the Merchant Shipping (Marine Equipment) Regulations 2016 as amended, and must successfully complete accreditation with the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) before 30th June 2023. Provisionally appointed UK Approved Bodies cannot approve marine equipment under the terms of the UK-US Mutual Recognition Agreement for marine equipment. This means they cannot issue the USCG mark for these items of equipment. Once provisionally appointed UK Approved Bodies become fully accredited and appointed as UK Approved Bodies, they will be able to approve items under the terms of the UK-US Mutual Recognition Agreement for marine equipment.</p>

<p>6.3 For information regarding the equipment types and modules of conformity an approved body may perform, the specific body must be contacted. Alternatively, please see the</p>

<p>information on the UKMCAB database:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> UK Market Surveillance</h3>

<p>7.1 The MCA, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Transport, is the market surveillance authority for equipment and is required to carry out market surveillance. Approved Bodies, manufacturers and manufacturers’ authorised representatives must cooperate with MCA market surveillance inspectors as indicated in this Part and in accordance with the Regulations. Market surveillance seeks to ensure the safety of products offered for supply to the UK market and UK ships. Such market surveillance will take into consideration the conformity assessment procedures applicable to equipment and the responsibilities of the flag State administrations in the international instruments.</p>

<p>7.2 Market surveillance may include the inspection of documents supplied with equipment to confirm its compliance as well as checks of equipment specified in regulation 5(1), whether or not it has been placed on board a UK ship. Where checks are carried out on equipment placed on board a UK ship, such checks will be limited to examinations that can be carried out while the equipment remains fully functional on board.</p>

<p>7.3 When the MCA has received evidence to suggest equipment specified in Part I may not be in compliance with the international instruments and/or poses a risk to the safety of persons on board UK ships or the marine environment it may seek further evidence by carrying out sample checks of such equipment. Accordingly, the MCA may request the manufacturer to provide the necessary samples at the manufacturer’s own cost or give on- the-spot access to the samples at the manufacturer’s premises.</p>

<p>7.4 Where the MCA has sufficient reason to believe that equipment to which this Part is applicable presents a risk to maritime safety, to health or to the environment, it may carry out an evaluation in relation to the equipment concerned covering all the requirements for such equipment. The relevant economic operators must cooperate as necessary with the MCA in accordance with the Regulations. Additionally, the MCA may inform the public on the potential risk via the publication of safety bulletins etc.</p>

<p>7.5 Where the MCA finds that, subject to the evaluation in 6.4, the equipment does not comply with the requirements in this Part, the MCA may without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the equipment into compliance with those requirements, using existing powers in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 by way of an Improvement or Prohibition Notice. This will be commensurate with the nature and extent of the risk which the MCA considers is posed by the equipment, as it may prescribe, or any other corrective measure justified by the MCA. The MCA will inform the relevant approved body accordingly. Where the economic operator does not carry out such corrective measures within the timeframe specified by the MCA, the MCA may initiate such appropriate measures as are necessary to prohibit or restrict non-compliant equipment from being supplied to the UK market or placed on board UK ships.</p>

<p>7.6 Where it is considered that non-compliance may not be limited to the UK market, the MCA may inform other parties to the international instruments flag administrations and international organisations to include the nature of the non-compliance and the corrective actions which has been implemented.</p>

<h2>PART II – Approved equipment outside the scope of the UK’s conformity assessment procedures but requiring approval under international instruments or other UK domestic instruments</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.Scope </span> of Approval</h3>

<p>8.1 Equipment to which this Part applies is that equipment outside the scope the UK’s conformity assessment procedures for marine equipment, but nonetheless requires approval by the MCA as a UK ship’s flag administration under international instruments. Part II also applies to equipment that requires approval by other UK domestic instruments and are specified in Annex 2 of this Notice. This equipment must be type approved by the UK nominated bodies.</p>

<p>8.2 Where equipment within the scope of this Part is of a novel nature or subject to significant design changes or the specifications or testing requirements are not considered to be sufficiently developed or experience of their usage is limited, the MCA must be contacted regarding the undertaking of the necessary approval procedure. For this purpose, the MCA contact details in paragraph 5.4 above should be used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.Requirements </span> for Equipment</h3>

<p>9.1 Equipment which is placed on board a UK ship to which this Part applies must hold a valid type approval certificate issued by a nominated body at the time when that equipment is placed on board.</p>

<p>9.2 The performance and testing standards of equipment within the scope of this Part are specified in Annex 2 of this Notice. In consultation with the MCA, a nominated body may waive the requirements for any test specifically cited in a performance standard providing it is satisfied that the sample has met the criteria of a specification superior to that of the prescribed test.</p>

<p>9.3 Existing type approval certificates for equipment within the scope of this Part will remain valid before the certificate’s expiry date, or until cancelled. Upon the expiry date of the certificate, manufacturers must re‐apply for renewal of their certificate to a nominated body. If requirements have not changed a new certificate will be issued. All certificates of type approval will be valid for up to 5 years.</p>

<p>9.4 Unless there is a change in the required standards specified in Annex 2 of this Notice applicable to equipment already placed on board a UK ship, existing approval will continue to be accepted providing the equipment operates satisfactorily. If it needs to be replaced, then it must be replaced with equipment for which a current type approval certificate is in force.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.Domestic </span> Passenger Ships and Large Fishing Vessels</h3>

<p>10.1 As required by regulation 5(2), where equipment is specified in Annex 2 of this Notice, a domestic passenger ship or fishing vessel must carry equipment that has been approved by a nominated body, except where a carriage requirement provides for an alternative standard to be met.
