<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The Housing Benefit Recovery and Fraud (<abbr title="Housing Benefit Recovery and Fraud">HBRF</abbr>) data collection was introduced in 2008.</p>

<p>There were 2 parts to the collection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the first part collected information on the amount of Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) that local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) identified had been overpaid, and the amount of overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> that they subsequently recovered</li>
  <li>the second part collected data on the number of fraud investigations carried out by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From 2016, the Fraud and Error Service within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> took on many of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>â fraud responsibilities. At this point, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stopped collecting data on the number of fraud investigations that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> carried out and the collection was renamed âHousing Benefit Debt Recoveriesâ (<abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr>).</p>

<p>The September 2016 <abbr title="Housing Benefit Recovery and Fraud">HBRF</abbr> publication (i.e. data covering the period April 2015 to March 2016) was the last to include data on the number of fraud investigations carried out by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>For users with an interest in historic data on <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>â fraud investigations, these continue to be available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-benefit-recoveries-and-fraud-data"><abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> collection page</a> and brief details of these statistics are provided at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a">Annex A</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of this document refers to the ongoing collection and publication of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-benefit-recoveries-and-fraud-data"><abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> statistics</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Context of the statistics</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1. </span> What is Housing Benefit?</h3>

<p>Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) is an income-related benefit which is provided to households in order to help them meet housing costs for rented accommodation. This is available to those who are either unemployed, on a low income or in receipt of other benefits.</p>

<p>The claimant may get help with all or part of their rent.</p>

<p><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> is administered by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.  Claimants receive support in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rent Rebate â <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> for council tenants, paid in the form of a reduction in their rent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rent Allowance â <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> for housing association tenants or private renters in the form of a payment to the claimant or their landlord</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since 2018, most new working-age claimants have claimed the housing element of Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) rather than <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, and all working-age <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants are scheduled to have transferred to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> by the end of 2024.  The impact of the migration from <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> statistics is discussed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-8">section 8.4.3</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2. </span> Why might <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> be overpaid?</h3>

<p>A claimant might provide incorrect information on their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim â either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accidentally (âclaimant errorâ)</li>
  <li>on purpose (âclaimant fraudâ)</li>
</ul>

<p>Or they might fail to inform their <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> of a change in circumstances â such as a change in the number of hours that they work â which leads to them no longer being paid the correct amount of benefit.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> publishes estimates of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system">fraud and error in the benefit system</a>. This publication provides fuller definitions of âfraudâ, âclaimant errorâ and âofficial errorâ and estimates the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpaid for each of these reasons.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3. </span> How do <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> identify overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>?</h3>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are encouraged and supported by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to identify and recover overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, for example, through the use of âreal-time informationâ to compare claimantsâ actual income, as reported by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, with the information that they provided when they submitted their claim for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>. Where <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> suspect that overpayment is the result of fraud, a criminal investigation may be carried out.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4. </span> How do <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> recover overpayment?</h3>

<p>Where an <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim is continuing, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> may be able to recover <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpaid to a claimant by deducting an amount from their monthly payments.  There are limits to the amount by which payments may be reduced.  As a result, it may take a long time for an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to fully recover an overpayment.</p>

<p>In cases where the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim has stopped, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> may be able to recover <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpaid to a claimant either by invoicing them or, if they are in receipt of other benefits, by applying to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for a deduction from these benefits.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> may sell some of their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt to a debt collection agency and, in cases of suspected fraud, claimants may be taken to court to recover overpayment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5. </span> Why and when might an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> âwrite-offâ overpayment?</h3>

<p>When an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> believes that it has exhausted opportunities to recover overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, for example because the claimant is untraceable, has been declared bankrupt or died, it may decide to âwrite-offâ the claimantâs debt.  Some <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> write-off overpayment at the point that they identify that they are unable to recover it.  Others process write-offs in batches.  Further information on âwrite-offâ of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayment is provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-4">section 8.4.7</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Purpose of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> statistics</h2>

<p>These statistics allow <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to monitor how effective local authorities are at recovering overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and allow <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to benchmark themselves against other authorities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Data source</h2>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> return data on spreadsheet templates.  The returns are based on data taken from their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> systems.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1. </span> Data fields and definitions</h3>

<p>There are 4 fields on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> return, as shown in the following table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Field</th>
      <th scope="col">Question</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Total value of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayments outstanding at the start of the quarter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Total value of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayments identified during the quarter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Total value of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayments recovered during the quarter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>Total value of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayments written off during the quarter</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Each of these figures is broken down into ârent rebateâ and ârent allowanceâ.  <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> that are unable to provide a breakdown are allowed to just provide âtotalâ figures.</p>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> report the total value of overpayments identified, recovered and written-off during the quarter, regardless of when the original overpayment actually occurred.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, a review of an <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim may identify that, although the claimant has been paid more than they were entitled to, they remain eligible for a lesser award (âunderlying entitlementâ).  In this situation, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> report the overpayment net of âunderlying entitlementâ and âunderlying entitlementâ is not recorded as either a ârecoveredâ or âwritten-offâ overpayment.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> sell some of their debt to a debt collection agency.  In this situation, the sale price is recorded as ârecoveredâ overpayment.  The difference between the amount of debt sold to the debt collection agency and the sale price achieved is recorded as âwritten-offâ overpayment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2. </span> Data reference area</h3>

<p>Data are collected at an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> level and aggregated to a regional and national level.  The <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> data relate to the <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and regions where the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims that have been overpaid are administered.  Occasionally, claimants receiving these benefits may reside in a different local authority area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3. </span> Frequency of data collection</h3>

<p><abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> data are collected on a quarterly basis, according to a pre-agreed timetable.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Quarter</th>
      <th scope="col">Reference period</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><abbr title="quarter 1">Q1</abbr></td>
      <td>1 April to 30 June</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr></td>
      <td>1 July to 30 September</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><abbr title="quarter 3">Q3</abbr></td>
      <td>1 October to 31 December</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><abbr title="quarter 4">Q4</abbr></td>
      <td>1 January to 31 March</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have a period of approximately 4 weeks from the end of the reference period to return their data to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.  The data returned to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, however, refer to overpayments identified, recovered and written-off up to the end of the reference period, not the date on which the data are returned to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Quality management</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1. </span> Quality assurance</h3>

<p>When <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> return their data to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, checks are carried out on their accuracy.  âLogicalâ checks are carried out e.g. that the sum of fields 3 and 4 (the amount of overpayment either recovered or written-off during the quarter) is not greater than the sum of fields 1 and 2 (the total amount of overpayment either outstanding at the start of the quarter or identified during the quarter).</p>

<p>Comparisons are made with figures for previous quarters.  Where there is an unusually large difference between figures for the current quarter and previous ones, this is queried with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.  These checks focus, in particular, on field 1 (the total amount of overpayment outstanding at the start of the quarter).  This is a larger and more âstableâ measure than the other fields, which see larger quarter-to-quarter variation.</p>

<p>The total amount of outstanding overpayment at the start of a particular quarter is compared with the total outstanding overpayment at the end of the previous one. The total outstanding overpayment at the start of <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr>, for instance, should, in theory, be the same as:</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Total outstanding overpayment at the start of Q1 + overpayment identified in Q1 - overpayment recovered in Q1 -overpayment written-off in Q1</p>
</div>

<p>Although these figures are not always exactly the same â for reasons explained in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-eight">section 8.4</a> â any differences should be small.  Where a large difference is identified, this is queried with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2. </span> Exclusions</h3>

<p>Quality assurance checks are carried out on the data and the results are fed back to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, who are invited to review the data that they previously submitted and make any necessary changes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may withhold publication of any data which, following discussions with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, continue to appear incorrect.  These instances will be clearly indicated in the final published tables.</p>

<span class="number">6.1. </span> Timeliness</h3>

<p>Figures for <abbr title="quarter 1">Q1</abbr> and <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr> of the financial year are published in March.  Figures for the whole of the financial year are published in September.  This represents an approximately 5 months lag from the end of the reference period to the date at which the figures are published.</p>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are given approximately one month from the end of the reference date to return their data to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.  There is a period of approximately two months, during which quality assurance checks are carried out on the data and any necessary revisions agreed with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.  Once the data have been quality assured, there is a final period of approximately 6 to 8 weeks, during which the figures are aggregated to regional and national level and analysed, and final quality assurance checks are carried out prior to publication.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2. </span> Data revision</h3>

<p>Figures for the first two quarters of the financial year are published in March.  In September, figures are published covering the whole of the financial year.  Where <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> notify us of changes to their first two quartersâ data â or provide us with a late <abbr title="quarter 1">Q1</abbr> or <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr> return â these are incorporated into figures published in September.</p>

<p>Exceptionally, errors by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be corrected via a revision in a subsequent publication or a special pre-announced release (depending on the severity of the error).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3. </span> Rounding policy</h3>

<p>Percentage figures presented in the summary document are rounded to the nearest 1%.  In some cases, figures may not add up to 100% due to rounding.</p>

<p>In the supplementary tables, raw data provided by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have been added to generate regional and national totals, before being rounded to the nearest Â£1,000.  As a result of this rounding, the sum of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> figures shown in the tables may be slightly different to the regional and national totals.  This is a different approach to that taken in previous publications, when <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> figures were first rounded before being added to generate regional and national totals.  The impact of this change on regional and national totals is negligible.</p>

<p>The sum of the amount of overpaid âRent Rebateâ and âRent Allowanceâ in an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> may be different to the total amount of overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> in that <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> due to rounding.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Status of the statistics</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> Statistics are designated âNational Statisticsâ.  This means that our statistics must meet the highest standards of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trustworthiness</li>
  <li>Quality</li>
  <li>Public value</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to establish and maintain trust in the statistics, we need to identify and, where possible, address any data quality issues.  Where it is not possible to completely address data quality issues, we need to provide adequate information alongside the statistics to help users to understand their limitations.</p>

<p>To ensure the accuracy and completeness of data returns, and in line with UK Statistics Authority guidelines, we keep in regular contact with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. As part of this work, in July 2021, we asked <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to complete a survey.  The aim of the survey was to help us to: understand how <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> complete the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> return; explain observed trends in the data; address data quality issues; and solicit feedback from <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> on the statistics.</p>

<p>Some of the main findings of this survey have been incorporated into the next section.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Quality</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1. </span> Assessment of user needs and perceptions</h3>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are regularly asked for information and feedback on the statistics.  These comments have been used to improve the commentary on the statistics and add further details to the âbackground informationâ provided in support of the statistics.</p>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and other users are invited to provide feedback on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> statistics, using the contact details provided at the end of this document.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2. </span> Timeliness and punctuality</h3>

<p>There are approximately 5 months between the end of the period that the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> data refer to and the data being published.  This allows time for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to return their data; for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to quality assure the data; and for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to aggregate figures, analyse trends and carry out final quality assurance prior to publication.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3. </span> Accuracy and reliability</h3>

<p>In addition to the quality assurance checks that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> carry out once <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have returned their <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> data, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> carry out a range of checks on their data prior to sending their returns to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.  <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statisticians are working with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to make sure these checks are adequate and consistent in order to ensure the accuracy of the data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4. </span> Coherence and comparability</h3>

<p><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> is a complicated benefit to administer and there have been a number of changes to the benefit system â such as the migration from <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> to Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) â which have had an impact on the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpaid and recovered.</p>

<p>This section describes some of the issues that users of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> statistics need to be aware of when comparing <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> statistics.</p>

<h4>8.4.1. Data completeness</h4>

<p>Some <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> do not send data returns every quarter or cannot supply data for all fields. This produces missing data in the returns. The table at the end of the statistical summary shows the scale of missing data, each year since the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> collection began.</p>

<p>In the first year of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> collection (<abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2009) <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> that returned data accounted for less than 75% of all <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants.  In view of the scale of missing returns in <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2009, data for <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2009 have been excluded from the charts in the statistical summary.</p>

<p>After the first year, response rates improved.  In <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2010, responses were received covering approximately 96.5% of all <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants and from <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2014, over 99% of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants were covered by the returns.</p>

<p>Up to <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr> of <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2017, when an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> did not send a return, its figures were estimated.  These estimates were not published but were added to figures for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> that had returned data, to produce estimates of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayments in GB as a whole.</p>

<p>Different methods for estimating missing <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> data were investigated.  This analysis arrived at two conclusions.  Firstly that, when it comes to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayments, there is a large amount of variation between <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, even between <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> of a similar size.  However, it concluded that variation between quarters for the same <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> was also large.</p>

<p>A decision was made to estimate overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> in GB as a whole by uprating the total amount of overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> reported by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> that responded to the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> collection using <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload data.</p>

<p>The following formula was used.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160963/figure-1-background-note.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Supplementary tables 1_5 to 1_8 show how the total amount of outstanding <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, and the amount of overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> identified, recovered and written-off by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, have changed since <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2009.  There are two columns of figures.  The first column shows the sum of the data returned by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.  The second shows âimputedâ GB totals, based on estimates made for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> whose data were missing.</p>

<p>During <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2017, the methodology for treating missing <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> data was reviewed. It was decided that, in recent years, the amount of data missing from the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> return had reduced to the point that estimates were unnecessary. Therefore, in the statistical summary, while âimputedâ GB totals are shown for earlier years, all of the figures from <abbr title="quarter 3">Q3</abbr> of <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2017 onwards are based on the data actually returned by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>We continue to work with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to reduce the number of missing returns and will review our policy for treating missing data should the number of missing returns increase.</p>

<h4>8.4.2. Comparing overpayment identified and overpayment recovered during a quarter or year</h4>

<p>It is not possible to make direct comparisons between the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayments that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> identify during a particular period and the amount of overpayment that they recover during that period.  Firstly, because overpayments are not necessarily identified in the same period that they occurred; and secondly, because overpayments are not necessarily recovered in the same period that they are identified.  Depending on the amount overpaid, it may take a long time for an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to fully recover an overpayment.</p>

<h4>8.4.3. Migration to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</h4>

<p>At the start of <abbr title="quarter 3">Q3</abbr> <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2015, there were just over 4.9 million <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants in GB.  By the start of <abbr title="quarter 4">Q4</abbr> <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2022, this number had fallen by 46% to just over 2.6 million. Since <abbr title="quarter 3">Q3</abbr> of <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2019, most new working-age claimants have claimed the housing element of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> rather than <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and all working-age claimants are scheduled to have transferred from <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> to the housing element of Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) by the end of 2024.</p>

<p>This fall in the number of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants has been a significant factor in the fall in both the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayment identified by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, and the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayment that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have recovered (as there are fewer new overpayments available to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to recover).</p>

<p>As well as the amount of overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> that is available to recover, migration to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> has also had an impact on the methods available to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to recover overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>.  With fewer claimants receiving <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have fewer opportunities to deduct an amount from ongoing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims.  Instead, they look to recover overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> by either invoicing claimants when their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim ends or applying to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for deductions from <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> or other benefits.</p>

<h4>8.4.4. <abbr title="Fraud and Error Reduction Incentive Scheme">FERIS</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The Fraud and Error Reduction Incentive Scheme (<abbr title="Fraud and Error Reduction Incentive Scheme">FERIS</abbr>) was introduced in <abbr title="quarter 3">Q3</abbr> of <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2015 to help <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to identify and prevent <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayment.  Around the same time, real-time information (<abbr title="real-time information">RTI</abbr>) on claimantâs incomes became available to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.  The income that claimants reported on their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims was checked against <abbr title="real-time information">RTI</abbr> on claimantsâ actual income from <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.  These checks led to undeclared income, and consequently overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, being identified by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>8.4.5. COVID-19</h4>

<p>At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> redeployed staff away from debt recovery to frontline activities and restricted face-to-face meetings between staff and claimants.</p>

<p>The increase in the amount of overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> identified and recovered by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2022 compared with <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2021 should be seen in the context of a fall in the amount of debt recovery activity being undertaken during the COVID lockdowns in <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2021.</p>

<h4>8.4.6. Retrospective changes in overpayments</h4>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> sometimes identify an amount by which a <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimant has been overpaid, but then revise this amount at a later date.  These revisions lead to a discrepancy between figures for one quarter and the next.</p>

<p>The total amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayment at the start of a quarter should, in theory, equal the total amount of overpayment at the start of the previous quarter, plus the amount of overpayment newly identified during the previous quarter, minus the amount of overpayment recovered and written-off during the previous quarter.  However, this is not the case in all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.  Nationally, the total amount of outstanding <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayment that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> reported at the start of <abbr title="quarter 4">Q4</abbr> of <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2022 was 0.37% less than the figures reported in <abbr title="quarter 3">Q3</abbr> suggested it would be.</p>

<p>This apparent discrepancy is due to the timing of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> extracts.  âTotal debt outstanding at the start of the quarterâ comes from a report run at the end of the quarter and changes can be made during the current quarter to the value of overpayments first identified in previous quarters and brought forward to the current one.</p>

<p>Overpayment identified in one quarter might retrospectively fall in a subsequent quarter.  In some cases, for instance, âunderlying entitlementâ might be belatedly applied to an overpayment, reducing the amount that the claimant was originally thought to owe.  In other cases, information might emerge that showed that, in accordance with <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> regulations, an overpayment that an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> sought to recover was in fact ânon-recoverableâ.</p>

<p>Conversely, overpayment identified in one quarter might retrospectively increase in a later quarter.  In some cases, a âwrite-offâ might be reversed â this occurs when new information suggests that an overpayment that was previously written-off could, in fact, be recovered.   Alternatively, an overpayment identified in one quarter could increase in a later quarter if recovery action led to court costs being added to the debt.</p>

<p>In over 80% of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, the difference between the total amount of overpayments outstanding at the end of quarter 3 of FYE2022, according to their quarter 3 returns; and the total amount of overpayments outstanding at the start of quarter 4 FYE2022, according to their quarter 4 returns, was less than 1%.  We have therefore decided not to ask <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to provide us with revised figures, when an overpayment identified in one quarter retrospectively changes in a later quarter, as to do so would place a disproportionate burden on <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>8.4.7. Write-off statistics</h4>

<p>There is extremely large quarter-to-quarter variation in the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayment written-off by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.  Although it is not the case in all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, across GB as a whole, there is a âspikeâ in overpayment write-off in <abbr title="quarter 4">Q4</abbr> followed by a sharp fall in <abbr title="quarter 1">Q1</abbr> the following year.  On average, write-off in <abbr title="quarter 4">Q4</abbr> of a financial year is around 75% higher than in <abbr title="quarter 1">Q1</abbr>.</p>

<p>Although some <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> write-off overpayments as soon as it becomes apparent that they wonât be unable to recover it, others write-off overpayments in batches â because, for instance, they need approval from their Cabinet to process write-offs over a certain amount.</p>

<p>Reasons for the âspikeâ in write-offs in <abbr title="quarter 4">Q4</abbr> include:</p>

<p>i. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> make a âpushâ to âtidy upâ accounts at the end of the financial year;</p>

<p>ii. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have made provision for âbad debtâ in their annual budget; and</p>

<p>iii. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> see an increased number of deaths in winter months.</p>

<p>In view of the high level of seasonality in âwrite-offâ, the statistical summary includes a chart showing average write-off over the previous four quarters.  This gives users of the statistics a clearer picture of the overall trend in âwrite-offâ.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5. </span> Accessibility and clarity</h3>

<p>The statistical bulletin and <abbr title="open document spreadsheet">ODS</abbr> tables are released in accessible format and meet the guidelines set out within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accessibility-statement-for-dwp-statistics/accessibility-statement-for-dwp-statistics"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>âs accessibility statement</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.6. </span> Confidentiality</h3>

<p>For confidentiality reasons, a small number of figures in the supplementary tables have been suppressed.  In <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> where:</p>

<p>1. Fewer than 5 <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> tenants were claiming <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> at the start of the quarter; and</p>

<p>2. The amount of overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> owed by <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> tenants at the start of the quarter was not zero.</p>

<p>the breakdown between overpaid âRent Allowanceâ (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> paid to <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> tenants) and âRent Rebateâ (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> paid to housing association and private tenants) is not shown.  This is to avoid the possibility of tenants who owe overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> to their <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> being identified.</p>

<p>In these <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, only the total amount of overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> is shown in the tables.  In the latest statistics, between 5 and 6 <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> fall into this category each quarter.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Limitations of the statistics</h2>

<h3>Known issues</h3>

<p>Not all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> return <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> data in all quarters.  Up until <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr> of <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2017, estimates were made for missing <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> data.  Analysis of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> data has found that there is a large degree of variability â both between different <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and within the same <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> in different quarters â in the amount of overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> identified, recovered and written-off.  Therefore, although the methodology that was used to estimate missing data was appropriate, there was a limit to how accurate these estimates could realistically be.</p>

<p>In view of the improved response from <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> collection, since <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2017, figures published in the statistical summary have been based on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> returns actually received by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.  Although the amount of missing data is small â in <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2022, data were missing from <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> that accounted for 0.8% of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants in GB â these figures are presented on a different basis to those prior to <abbr title="quarter 3">Q3</abbr> of <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2017.</p>

<p>As already noted, there is a large amount of quarter-to-quarter variability, especially in the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayment identified, recovered and written-off by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.  This makes it difficult to quality assure the figures as the large quarter-to-quarter differences routinely observed in these figures may occasionally mask errors.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> statistics show the amount of overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> in an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, as they understood it, at a particular point in time.  If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> made retrospective changes to an earlier overpayment â by, for instance, applying âunderlying entitlementâ to reduce the value of an overpayment in a later quarter â this would generally not be reflected in the statistics.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Data Tables</h2>

<p>The supplementary tables published with the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> statistics show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Table 1_1: The total amount of outstanding <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayments at the start of the quarter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Table 1_2 to 1_4: The total amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayments (i) identified; (ii) recovered; and (iii) written-off during the quarter</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These tables show a breakdown by <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.  The following conventions are used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â.â â missing</li>
  <li>â-â â zero or negligible</li>
  <li>â*â â included in total</li>
</ul>

<p>Many <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are unable to provide a breakdown between ârent reductionâ and ârent allowanceâ.  As a result, it is not possible to calculate regional and national totals for these measures.</p>

<p>There have recently been a number of local authority mergers.  The way that figures are presented in the supplementary tables has changed since the last set of <abbr title="Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> statistics were published in March 2022.  The statistics shown are based on the current <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> configuration, with figures for the âoldâ <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> that merged to form the new <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> no longer shown.  This is consistent with <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload figures published on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a>.</p>

<p>These statistics show the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayment that is identified and subsequently recovered by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.  <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> carry out a sampling exercise to estimate overall levels of fraud and error in <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, including overpayment not identified by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>According to the latest estimate, published in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-financial-year-2021-to-2022-estimates">May 2022</a>, there was approximately Â£860 million overpaid <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> in <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> 2021.  An estimated Â£540 million was overpaid due to fraud, Â£260 million due to claimant error and Â£70 million due to official error.</p>
