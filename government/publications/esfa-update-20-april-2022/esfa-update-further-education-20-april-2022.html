<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Information: subcontracting funding rules for ESFA funded post-16 funding (excluding apprenticeships)</h2>

<p>We have published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/subcontracting-funding-rules-for-esfa-funded-post-16-funding-excluding-apprenticeships">subcontracting funding rules for AEB, ESF and 16 to 19 funding for funding year 2022 to 2023</a>. The single set of subcontracting funding rules: sub-contracting funding rules for ESFA funded post-16 funding (excluding apprenticeships) are available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>For apprenticeships, ahead of the 2022 to 2023 funding year, we will be publishing draft funding rules before the end May, which will include the relevant subcontracting requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>New subcontracting standard</h3>

<p>In response to the subcontracting consultation, ESFA published interim subcontracting standard measures in June 2020. As a result, the subcontracting standard is being introduced from funding year 2022 to 2023. This is set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-subcontracting-standard">ESFA’s subcontracting standard guidance</a> which was published in July 2021.</p>

<p>The auditors guidance is under development and will be published on completion.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: publication of the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund audit guide for the 2022 to 2023 academic year</h2>

<p>We have published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-bursary-fund-audit-guide-for-local-authorities-2022-to-2023-academic-year">16 to 19 Bursary Fund audit guide</a> this week.</p>

<p>Although the guide is aimed primarily at local authorities, other institutions may find it helpful to review the information about ESFA assurance and audit as they review their bursary fund processes and policies ahead of the new academic year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: 16 to 19 tuition fund allocation for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>We have published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-allocation-data-2021-to-2022-academic-year">16 to 19 tuition fund allocations for the academic year 2021 to 2022</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The fund provides targeted small group tuition in English, mathematics and other subjects where learning has been disrupted because of the pandemic and is available to all 16 to 19 providers.</p>

<p>For further information, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund#:~:text=Further%20education%20funding-,16%20to%2019%20funding%3A%2016%20to%2019%20tuition%20fund,coronavirus%20(COVID%2D19).">detailed guidance about the 16 to 19 tuition fund</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: expansion of training flexibility for Universal Credit claimants</h2>

<p>The government will be expanding the additional training flexibility for Universal Credit claimants until April 2023.</p>

<p>Universal Credit claimants in the intensive work search group will be able to attend full-time, work-related training opportunities lasting up to 16 weeks across Great Britain as part of their work search activity. This flexibility has now been extended until 28 April 2023.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity for FE providers to work with their local Jobcentre Plus and Partnership Managers to offer full-time, work-related training courses. Universal Credit Claimants will need to get agreement from their work coach to ensure this is the right support for them and appropriate for the local labour market.</p>

<p>For further information please refer to DfE’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-skills-fund">National Skills Fund information page</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: resources available to support the mental health of Ukrainian students</h2>

<p>Thank you for your ongoing support of staff and students impacted by the war in Ukraine. We recognise that education staff are not mental health professionals, and young people from Ukraine and their families may need ongoing support available from specialist NHS and other community services. NHS England are actively looking into how they can address the implications of the Ukraine crisis and meet the mental health needs of Ukrainian refugees and the Ukrainian diaspora living in England at a national level.</p>

<p>In addition, there are existing training and guidance available to the sector that can assist you with supporting Ukrainian students.</p>

<p>Our recent £15 million <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mental-health-and-wellbeing-support-in-schools-and-colleges#wellbeing-for-education-recovery">Wellbeing for Education</a> Recovery and Return programmes provide free training, support and resources for staff dealing with young people experiencing additional pressures including trauma, anxiety or grief. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/psychological-first-aid-for-children-and-young-people" rel="external">Psychological first aid e-learning</a> training is also available for parents and carers, front line workers and volunteers supporting young people in emergency or crisis situations.</p>

<p>Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2">mental health and behaviour guidance</a>, much of which applies to the FE sector, advises how education staff can identify young people in need of extra mental health support, which includes working with external agencies, and we have published guidance and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/993669/Mental_Health_Resources_for_teachers_and_teaching_staff_June_2021.pdf" rel="external">signposting to external sources of mental health and wellbeing support for teachers, school staff and school leaders</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: market engagement opportunity for adult prison education services in England</h2>

<p>The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is very keen to hear from further education providers on their experience of delivering high quality education and improving attainment and learner experiences.</p>

<p>MoJ has issued a Prior Information Notice (PIN) containing details of market engagement activity relating to adult prison education services in all prisons in England. They want to engage with a range of providers, including those who have not previously considered providing services in custody, to learn from innovation and best practice across the education sector.</p>

<p>Links to the PIN can be found here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/a3b29677-949f-42c2-98be-250417ef9603" rel="external">Contracts Finder</a></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/007779-2022" rel="external">Find a Tender Service</a> (Notice No: 2022/S 000-007779)</li>
</ul>

<p>Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) is establishing the government’s vision to deliver a Prisoner Education Service which equips prisoners with the numeracy, literacy, skills and qualifications they need to get jobs or apprenticeships after they leave custody. They will therefore be seeking to procure new contracts to deliver education services in prisons across England.</p>

<p>A market engagement launch event, will be held via webinar on 26th April 2022. You can find out more information about the webinar and how to join on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/a3b29677-949f-42c2-98be-250417ef9603" rel="external">Contracts Finder</a>.</p>
