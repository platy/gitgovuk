<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Information: access to free school meals and the two-year-old early education entitlement for children from families with no recourse to public funds (NRPF)</h2>

<p>In 2020, government temporarily extended free school meal eligibility to include some children of groups who have NRPF. On 24 March 2022, following a cross-government review, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-03-24/hcws714" rel="external">we confirmed the permanent extension of eligibility</a> for free school meals to children from all families with NRPF, subject to specified income thresholds.</p>

<p>This permanent extension will begin from the start of the summer term 2022 and will ensure that children up and down the country can continue to access healthy, nutritious meals to help them concentrate, learn and achieve in the classroom. The department has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-meals-guidance-for-schools-and-local-authorities">guidance which includes advice about how schools can check and validate eligibility</a>.</p>

<p>Since 2020, some NRPF households have also been able to access the two-year-old early education entitlement and the department is now consulting on whether further NRPF groups should be eligible for this. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/free-early-education-for-2-year-olds-with-no-recourse-to-public-funds-nrpf">consultation</a> is live until 20 May 2022.</p>

<span class="number">8. </span>Information: market engagement opportunity for adult prison education services in England</h2>

<p>The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is very keen to hear from academy trusts on their experience of delivering high quality education and improving attainment and learner experiences.</p>

<p>MoJ has issued a Prior Information Notice (PIN) containing details of market engagement activity relating to adult prison education services in all prisons in England. They want to engage with a range of providers, including those who have not previously considered providing services in custody, to learn from innovation and best practice across the education sector.</p>

<p>Links to the PIN can be found here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/a3b29677-949f-42c2-98be-250417ef9603" rel="external">Contracts Finder</a></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/007779-2022" rel="external">Find a Tender Service</a> (Notice No: 2022/S 000-007779)</li>
</ul>

<p>Her Majestyâs Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) is establishing the governmentâs vision to deliver a Prisoner Education Service which equips prisoners with the numeracy, literacy, skills and qualifications they need to get jobs or apprenticeships after they leave custody. They will therefore be seeking to procure new contracts to deliver education services in prisons across England.</p>

<p>A market engagement launch event, will be held via webinar on 26th April 2022. You can find out more information about the webinar and how to join on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/a3b29677-949f-42c2-98be-250417ef9603" rel="external">Contracts Finder</a>.</p>
