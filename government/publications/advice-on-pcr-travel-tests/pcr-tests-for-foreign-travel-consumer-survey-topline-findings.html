<h2>Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)</h2>

<h3>PCR Tests for Foreign Travel (consumer survey topline findings)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Kantar, on behalf of the CMA, interviewed a sample of 2,497 UK adults age 18+ across 2 waves of its OnLineBus survey.</li>
  <li>of these, 393 respondents were eligible to answer the full CMA question set about PCR tests for foreign travel.</li>
  <li>fieldwork ran from 20-26 August 2021.</li>
  <li>the data are unweighted.</li>
  <li>we report numbers of respondents (Ns) rather than percentages in order to emphasise that results about all adults in the UK population who have arranged/paid for foreign travel since May 2021 cannot be robustly inferred from our findings.</li>
  <li>where Ns do not sum to base totals, this may be due to the exclusion of “don’t know” categories or multiple answers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Q00S Since the start of May 2021, which of the following things (if any) have you done?</h4>

<h4>Q001 (introduction text screen)</h4>

<p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), a government organisation, is conducting some research about PCR tests.</p>

<p>A PCR test looks for COVID-19 (coronavirus) on a swab sample collected from the back of someone’s throat and nose. The swab is sealed in a tube and is sent to a lab for analysis. (In comparison, the swab samples for lateral flow tests don’t get sent to a lab, and the results are available in about 30 minutes.)</p>

<p>The questions are about PCR tests from private companies that people arrange and pay for (not those that are provided for free by the NHS).</p>

<p>The questions are for anyone who has arranged and paid for one or more PCR tests (or had one or more PCR tests arranged/bought for them), since the start of May this year, to allow travel abroad and back to the UK. In the following questions, we refer to PCR tests done for this reason as “PCR tests for foreign travel”.</p>

<p>A private company that sells PCR tests for foreign travel to paying customers is called a “travel test provider”. In the following questions, when we refer to a “travel test provider” or “provider” (or to “travel test providers” or “providers”), we mean this type of company.</p>

<p>The CMA will be very grateful for your answers. By taking part in the following questions regarding PCR tests, the CMA will only be sent your responses to the questions and some limited demographic information, and your partial postcode, which does not identify you as an individual.</p>

<h4>Q002</h4>
<p>Since the start of May 2021, have you personally arranged and paid for one or more PCR tests?</p>

<p>This could be for yourself and/or for someone else.
By ‘arranged’ we mean you chose a provider and booked the test(s), either on your own or with the help of someone else.</p>
