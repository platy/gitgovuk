<h3>Additional declaration types (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2) C, F, Y or Z</h3>

<p>For Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) and Entry in Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>) users, the Declaration Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>) and any <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> part numbers must be declared in Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 2/1 using the Previous Document Type codes ‘DCR’ and ‘DCS’ respectively. See the Simplified Procedures notes section below.</p>

<p>For removals from warehouse using simplified procedures, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to be declared on the removal supplementary declaration, is the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> associated with the stock record for the removal of the goods. It is not the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> used to originally enter the goods to warehouse.</p>

<h3>Additional Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2) Z</h3>

<p>Where Previous Document Type CLE is declared at item level, it must not be declared at header level.</p>

<h3>Inventory Reference Numbers:</h3>

<p>For import inventory linked locations, the Inventory Reference Number (<abbr title="Inventory Reference Number">UCN</abbr>) must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 using the Previous Document codes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Z’</li>
  <li>‘MCR’</li>
  <li>Followed by the inventory reference number</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be declared at header level only.</p>

<h3>Electronic Licenses:</h3>

<p>Where an electronic licence is associated with a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> (for example DEFRA licences such as Common Health Entry Documents (<abbr title="Common Health Entry Documents">CHEDs</abbr>)), the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 at header level. To ensure successful matching, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered to the Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) should be the same as the one entered on the electronic licence.</p>

<p>For details of which licence types require a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to be provided, please refer to Appendix 5C: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document and Other Reference Codes: Licence Types.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>This data element must always be completed to identify a previous declaration or previous document(s).</p>

<p>A previous declaration, or document, is identified by class, type, reference and the goods item number of the previous document.  The goods item number element in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 may be omitted where the previous document comprised a single goods item.</p>

<p>The Procedure Code completion notes in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> give guidance on the codes expected to be used in specific circumstances for the procedure concerned.  They are not a definitive guide however and should be read in conjunction with the full list provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/previous-document-codes-for-data-element-21-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 3: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1: Previous Document Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Each previous document entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1, is declared as an alpha numeric code (an..42), made up of four components:</p>

<h4>First component: Document Category (a1)</h4>

<p>The first component (a1) consists of a letter and is used to distinguish between the three categories mentioned below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the declaration for temporary storage represented by ‘X’</li>
  <li>the simplified declaration or the entry in the declarant’s records, represented by ‘Y’</li>
  <li>the previous document, represented by ‘Z’.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: Y (used on supplementary declarations to represent simplified procedures).</p>

<h4>Second component: Previous document type (an..3)</h4>

<p>The second component (an..3), consists of a combination of digits and/or letters, serves to identify the type of document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose the appropriate code from the list in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/previous-document-codes-for-data-element-21-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 3: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1: Previous Document Codes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, code: CLE (to represent the entry in declarant’s records).</p>

<h4>Third component: Previous document reference (an..35)</h4>

<p>The third component (an..35) represents the data needed to recognise the document. Enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The identification number or another recognisable reference of the document</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, 20171001 (to represent the date of the entry in records).</p>

<h4>Fourth component: Goods item identifier (n..3)</h4>

<p>The fourth component (n..3) is used to identify which item of the previous document is being referred to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The goods item number on the summary declaration, temporary storage declaration, simplified declaration, entry in records or other previous document.</li>
  <li>This should be separated from the document reference number by ‘-‘.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: 2 (to identify that this reference refers to the second item on the previous document).</p>

<p>Where the previous document referred to contained only a single goods item, this component may be left blank.</p>

<p>The full code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 in this example would be YCLE20171001-2</p>

<p>Please note that the item number to be declared in this component is the item number from the previous document.  It is not the item number from the current declaration.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>On paper declarations the details are separated with a dash in the format (class-type-reference-goods item no. (for example, Z-380-12345-1).</p>

<p>References applicable to all items must be entered at header level, with a maximum number of 9,999 instances.</p>

<p>References not applicable to all items should be declared at item level, with a maximum number of 99 instances.</p>

<p>If removed from warehouse (other than by <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>) or Inward Processing, insert the document identity (for example, MRN or <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part that entered the goods to that procedure).</p>

<p>If goods are being placed in a warehouse enter the details of the documents relating to any previous administrative procedure.</p>

<h4>Electronic licences:</h4>

<p>Where an electronic licence is associated with a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> (for examples DEFRA licences such as <abbr title="Common Health Entry Documents">CHEDs</abbr>), the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 at header level. To ensure successful matching, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> should be the same as the one entered on the electronic licence.</p>

<p>For details of which licence types require a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to be provided, please refer to Appendix 5C: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document and Other Reference Codes: Licence Types.</p>

<h4>Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates (<abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr>).</h4>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is required for <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> purposes, this must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 at header level. To ensure successful matching, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> should be the same as the one entered on the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> Advance Notification.</p>

<h4>Simplified Procedures:</h4>

<p>Where supplementary declarations are aggregated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part of the first initial declaration as the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part for the supplementary declaration at header level.</li>
  <li>The SDE, DCR and DCS or CLE, DCR and DCS previous document sets should be repeated at item level, in order, for each aggregated element (for example, <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> release record).</li>
</ul>

<p>Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>):</p>

<p>For a Simplified Declaration:</p>

<p>Enter class code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘X’ for goods removed from Temporary Storage or</li>
  <li>‘Z’ other document;</li>
</ul>

<p>Followed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type of document and</li>
  <li>The reference number of the previous document followed by</li>
  <li>The goods item number if appropriate, from the previous document.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be followed by a subsequent previous document declaration to provide the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Z’</li>
  <li>‘DCR’ followed by</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> reference number that will be used as the commercial audit trail between the simplified declaration, commercial records and any subsequent supplementary declarations.</li>
</ul>

<p>For an <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> Supplementary Declaration:</p>

<p>Enter class code ‘Y’ followed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘SDE’</li>
  <li>The simplified declaration MRN</li>
  <li>the goods item number, if appropriate, from the previous document.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be followed by a subsequent previous document declaration to provide the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Y’</li>
  <li>‘DCR’ followed by</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> reference number that will be used as the commercial audit trail between the simplified declaration, commercial records and any subsequent supplementary declarations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> part numbers should be declared as a separate previous document using codes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Y’</li>
  <li>‘DCS’</li>
  <li>Followed by any <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> part numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>For removals from warehouse using simplified procedures, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to be declared, on the removal supplementary declaration, is the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> associated with the stock record for the removal of the goods. It is not the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> used to originally enter the goods to warehouse.</p>

<p>Entry in Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>):</p>

<p>For an <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> Supplementary Declaration:</p>

<p>Enter the class code ‘Y’, followed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘CLE’</li>
  <li>Date of <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> entry in records (date format yyyymmdd)</li>
  <li>the goods item number, if appropriate, from the previous document</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be followed by a subsequent previous document declaration to provide the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Y’</li>
  <li>‘DCR’ followed by</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> reference number that will be used as the commercial audit trail between the <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> record, commercial records and any subsequent supplementary declarations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> part numbers should be declared as a separate previous document using codes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Y’</li>
  <li>‘DCS’</li>
  <li>Followed by any <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> part numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>For removals from warehouse using simplified procedures, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to be declared, on the removal supplementary declaration, is the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> associated with the stock record for the removal of the goods. It is not the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> used to originally enter the goods to warehouse.</p>

<p>Simplified Procedure <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Completion Rules:</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and the optional part must be unique and should comply with the rules and format as detailed in the ‘Recommended Format of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>’ section below.</p>

<p>The declaration of a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is mandatory for all simplified procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> and <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>) declarations. The same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be supplied on all linked declaration parts, for example, simplified declaration with its supplementary declaration.</p>

<p>It is important that simplified procedure traders enter their own Declaration Unique Consignment Reference numbers (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference numbers">DUCRs</abbr>) into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 Simplified Declaration/Previous Document (third component using previous document type code ‘DCR’) as these are used to provide the audit trail between the initial declarations (simplified declaration and <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> entry), the linked supplementary declarations and any commercial documents.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part is the main reference to the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> declaration for simplified procedures purposes and can incorporate commercial references so that there is a single reference for accessing all related information in trade and customs computer systems. The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must contain the Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number of the simplified procedures authorised trader.</p>

<p>For removals from warehouse using simplified procedures, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to be declared, on the removal supplementary declaration, is the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> associated with the stock record for the removal of the goods. It should not be the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> used to originally enter the goods to warehouse.</p>

<p><abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part Numbers:</p>

<p>On supplementary declarations enter the related <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part (s) for the linked simplified declarations and <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> entries (initial declarations) using previous document type code ‘DCS’. If a supplementary declaration covers more than one initial declaration, use the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part of the first initial declaration as the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part for the supplementary declaration at header level. The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/Parts of each of the other initial declarations are to be declared as separate ‘DCS’ previous documents in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1, against the corresponding items at item level.</p>

<h4>Recommended Format of <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The recommended format of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> reference number in the UK is the WCO format, which is created from the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Year’ — is the year in which the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated. For example, ‘9’ if allocated in 2019, ‘0’ if allocated in 2020 and ‘1’ if allocated in 2011. Therefore, for the year 2019, ensure the year component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered onto the Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates (<abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr>) advance notification contains the single ‘9’ digit and not ‘19’. In 2020, enter the year as a single ‘0’ digit and not ‘20’.</li>
  <li>‘Country’ — is the country where the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated.</li>
  <li>‘<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>’ — is the identity of the trader as known to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). In the UK this is the 12-character <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number. This must be the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number of the simplified procedures authorised trader.</li>
  <li>’-‘ — is a dash.</li>
  <li>‘Reference’ — is a unique series of characters that the trader, whose <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is included in the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, devises and which provides an audit trail within traders’ commercial records. This component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is restricted to numbers, upper case letters and certain special characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is as follows: ‘9GB000000000000-12345’</p>

<p>This example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> would have been issued in 2019, in the UK, for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number ‘000000000000’, and with a trader reference number of ‘12345’.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires both Union and National document codes to be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, any Union Codes (beginning with a letter) must be declared first.</p>

<p>Each document type code has eight components: not all components are mandatory for all document codes.</p>

<h4>First component — document type code (an4) mandatory for all document codes declared</h4>

<p>The first component is a 4 figure Document Type Code. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a> for a list of document codes which should be declared in specific circumstances. The Document Code appendix should be read in conjunction with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/sections" rel="external"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Instructions</a>,  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 2: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes</a> for information on which Document Codes should be used in order to declare specific commodities or use specific customs procedures.</p>

<h4>Second Component: Document Identifier and Part (an..35), see additional notes on the second components format for licences in the section below</h4>

<p>The second component comprises of two sub-components.</p>

<h4>Sub-component 1: Document Identifier (an..30) mandatory for all document codes declared</h4>

<p>This sub-component is the document identifier.  This is the reference number, as specified against the document type code in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>. This must identify the unique document, authorisation, licence or certificate being declared.</p>

<h4>Sub-component 2: Multi Line Document (Document Part) (an..5) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>Enter the line item (part) as required for the particular document.</p>

<p>For example, some licences cover many products with each defined as a line. The document part sub-component is used to identify the line number when required.</p>

<p>If omitted it defaults to 1 and the attribution applies to the first (or only) line of the licence.</p>

<p>The line item number of the document is to be appended to the document identifier (completed in the first sub-component) separated by a dash (-).</p>

<p>For example: X0021234/16-3</p>

<h4>Third Component: Document Status Code (a2) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>The third component is a Document Status Code (a2). A full list of the document status codes may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-element-23-document-status-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5B: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document Status Codes</a>.</p>

<p>The document status code should be declared, as specified, by each document code.</p>

<p>The specific document status codes which may be used with each document code is specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Certain document type codes (for example, authorisation numbers) will not usually require a status code to be declared and where applicable this is specified against the document code in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Other document codes may be restricted in the document status codes which may be used, these are specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>A ‘Document identifier’ and ‘Reason’ must still be input when a waiver status code is used.  When declaring a waiver this can be entered as, for example, ‘Exempt’ in each field.</p>

<h4>Fourth component: Reason (an..35) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>Enter a free text description of the Reason where required by the Document Status Code.</p>

<p>Where the import goods are subject to specific measures a Reason description should be entered in the fourth component of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>A reason must be supplied for some status values. For example: Status code UP, reason entered “eaten by dog, replacement in post”.</p>

<h4>Fifth Component: Issuing Authority (an..70) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>Enter a free text description of the Issuing Authority. This should be specific enough to identify the governing body responsible for issuing the licence or certificate.</p>

<h4>Sixth Component: Date of Validity, if required (n8) conditional,</h4>

<p>The date of validity, if required, must be entered in the following date format: yyyymmdd.</p>

<h5>Licences and non-preference certificates:</h5>

<p>The date to be declared is the expiry date for the licence or certificate. Where the Document Code for the licence or certificate is listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-element-23-document-and-other-reference-codes-licence-types-imports-and-exports-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5C: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document and Other Reference Codes: Licence Types</a>, a date of validity must always be declared.</p>

<h4>Electronic Licences:</h4>

<p>Where an electronic licence is associated with a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> (for example DEFRA licences such as <abbr title="Common Health Entry Documents">CHEDs</abbr>), the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 at header level. To ensure successful matching, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> should be the same as the one entered on the electronic licence.</p>

<p>For details of which licence types require a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to be provided, please refer to Appendix 5C: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document and Other Reference Codes: Licence Types.</p>

<h4>Write-off amounts:</h4>

<p>When declaring a waiver status code (XX or XW as appropriate) for the following document codes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9005; 9100; 9101; 9102</li>
</ul>

<p>a write off amount must be included in the seventh and eighth components of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 with an amount of ‘0’ after a recognised measurement unit (for example, ‘KGM0’).</p>

<h4>Open licence types</h4>

<p>Please note that when declaring an open licence, a write off amount must be included in the seventh and eighth components of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 for open licences.  The amount entered should be shown as ‘0’ after a recognised measurement unit (for example, ‘KGM0’).  This is required on border releases and supplementary declarations.</p>

<h5>Preferential Proofs of Origin</h5>

<p>For preferential proofs of origin (for example, EUR.1, Generalised System of Preferences (<abbr title="Generalised System of Preferences">GSP</abbr>), Invoice Declarations, Statements of Origin), the date, if required to be declared by the specific document code, is the date of issue.</p>

<h4>Seventh component: Measurement unit and qualifier, if applicable: an..4 + conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>This is only required where a specific quantity and measurement type has to be decremented against a specific document.  For example, a licence has been issued for a total quantity of liquids in litres.</p>

<p>Where the specific document requires a measurement unit and/or qualifier to be declared, enter the appropriate code for the commodity’s/document’s measurement unit type using the list provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measurement-unit-codes-for-data-elements-23-and-44-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 20: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 &amp; <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/4 — Measurement Unit Codes</a>.</p>

<p>For example, if the document requires a quantity in litres, enter the measurement unit code of LTR. The quantity of litres being declared should be entered against the eighth component: quantity.</p>

<p>If no quantity or measurement unit/qualifier is required, this data element should be omitted.</p>

<h4>Eighth component: Quantity (n..16,6)</h4>

<p>Enter the quantity being attributed to the specific document identifier (second component). 
Any decimal places declared (up to a maximum of 6 places) must be deducted from the total number of characters available for this component. For example, if 3 decimal places are used, then only 13 whole numbers may be used in front of the decimal place.</p>

<p>For example, if the document requires a quantity in litres, the measurement unit code of LTR will have been entered in the seventh component (measurement unit), followed by the quantity of litres being declared as a value here, in the eighth component, for example, 12.05.</p>

<h3>Authorisation for customs procedures</h3>

<p>If two or more procedures apply (for example Outward Processing and Inward Processing) the details for each should be entered as separate document references.</p>

<p>Authorisations are declared as a document reference in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, using a document code from the list in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>. The authorisation should be declared in the format outlined in the example below.</p>

<p>For example, for an authorisation for a private Customs Warehouse:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Document code</th>
      <th scope="col">Document identifier: country code</th>
      <th scope="col">Document identifier: authorisation type code</th>
      <th scope="col">Document identifier: authorisation number</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>C517</td>
      <td>GB</td>
      <td>CWP</td>
      <td>The customs warehouse authorisation number</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Enter the authorisation document reference held to use a customs procedure. This code consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Document Code an4</li>
  <li>Country Code a2;</li>
  <li>Decision type an..4;</li>
  <li>Unique identifier for the decision an..29</li>
</ul>

<p>The corresponding <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number of the authorisation holder should be declared against the appropriate authorisation type code in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39.</p>

<p>Authorisation document codes and authorisation holder <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> numbers in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39 are only required where a full authorisation is held.</p>

<h3>Additional Declaration Types (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2) C, F, Y or Z:</h3>

<p>For Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) and Entry in Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>) the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 (Previous Documents) using the previous document code ‘DCR’.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>This data element is for optional and may be left blank.</p>

<p>This data element is available for use by the declarant to record a commercial reference for their own purposes.</p>

<p>The format of the reference number may take the form of the WCO <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, which is created from the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Year’ — is the year in which the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated. For example, ‘9’ if allocated in 2019, ‘0’ if allocated in 2020 and ‘1’ if allocated in 2011. Where a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is required for <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates">PEACH</abbr> or other electronic licencing requirements, this must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1.</li>
  <li>‘Country’ — is the country where the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated.</li>
  <li>‘<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>’ — is the identity of the trader as known to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). In the UK this is the 12-character <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number.</li>
  <li>’-‘ — is a dash.</li>
  <li>‘Reference’ — is a unique series of characters that the trader, whose <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is included in the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, devises and which provides an audit trail within traders’ commercial records. This component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is restricted to numbers, upper case letters and certain special characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is as follows: ‘9GB000000000000-12345’</p>

<p>This example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> would have been issued in 2019, in the UK, for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number ‘GB000000000000’, and with a trader reference number of ‘12345’.</p>

<p>Please note where customs duty is being paid or secured by deferment then:</p>

<ul>

<p>The above requirements do not need to be met when deferment is only being used for other taxes.</p>

<h3>Using more than one deferment account</h3>

<p>All the duty and tax may be deferred to the importer’s, declarant’s or representative’s account, or alternatively, the VAT and non-VAT charges can be split between the two different deferment accounts. When payment is being deferred to more than one deferment account, both deferment account numbers (<abbr title="Deferment Account Numbers">DANs</abbr>) must be entered in this data element.</p>

<p>Please note, two deferment accounts cannot be declared when they both belong to the importer.</p>

<p>When two deferment numbers are present, only VAT amounts will be processed against the deferment account for ‘2DAN’.</p>

<p>All other amounts deferred will be processed against the deferment account for ‘1DAN’.</p>

<p>There is no restriction on which <abbr title="Deferment Account Number">DAN</abbr> (the importer’s, declarant’s or representative’s) is used for ‘2DAN’.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>A declarant/representative acting on behalf of an importer must not use the importer’s deferment approval number without first being authorised to do so.</p>

<p>This authority may either be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Specific authority: which relates to one particular consignment. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-deferment-of-duty-payment-c1207s">Form C1207S</a> must be completed by the importer and retained by the agent/representative as evidence that they have authority to use the importer’s deferment account.  This must be provided to customs on request. Document code ‘1207’ must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes) providing the date and location details as declared on the C1207S.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Standing authority: Alternatively, an importer may give standing authority to their agent using form C1207N, which covers all consignments (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-use-your-duty-deferment-account%20for%20full%20details%20and%20examples%20on%20giving%20authority%20to%20use%20deferment%20accounts">Notice 101 Deferring duty, VAT and other charges</a>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the declaration is processed as a paperless declaration, evidence of the authority must be retained at the trader’s registered premises (for 4 years) and may be subject to audit by customs.</p>
