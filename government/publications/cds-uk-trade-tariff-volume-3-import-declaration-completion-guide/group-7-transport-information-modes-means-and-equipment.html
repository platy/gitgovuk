<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Leave this data element blank if the goods are not containerised or if it is not known whether they are containerised.</p>

<p>Enter the marks (letters and/or numbers) which identify the transport container.</p>

<p>Complete this data element if the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will be in a container at the point of entering the EU, enter the container number(s)</li>
  <li>Are containerised but the container number(s) are not yet known (for example on a pre-lodged declaration), then enter ‘number(s) unknown’.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the exact details are not available when the declaration is lodged, unknown may be entered, but the details must be entered later. This can be done prior to arrival at the border using standard amendment procedures.</p>

<p>To avoid duplication, the container number need only be declared against the first item of a declaration where all items are to be shipped in a single container.</p>

<p>Where items on the declaration are packed into different containers, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/10 will need to show individual container numbers at item level.</p>

<p>On paper declarations precede the (list of) container numbers by CN% or, for part containers, by Part Container%, and separate each container number by a comma, for example Part Container%ABCD12345, BCDE234567, WXYZ98765.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Please refer to <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/9 for package type codes and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/cefact/recommendations/rec21/rec21rev1_ecetrd195e.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UN/ECE</abbr> recommendation 21</a> on package types which includes the definition for containers.</p>

<h4>Air Transport:</h4>

<p>In the air mode, containers are special boxes to carry freight, strengthened and allowing horizontal or vertical transfers.</p>

<h4>Swap bodies and semi-trailers:</h4>

<p>In the context of this data element, the swap bodies and semi-trailers used for road and rail transport shall be considered as containers.</p>

<p>If applicable, for containers covered by the standard <abbr title="International Standards Organization">ISO</abbr> 6346, the identifier (prefix) allocated by the International Bureau of Containers and Intermodal Transport (<abbr title="Bureau of Containers and Intermodal Transport">BIC</abbr>) shall also be provided in addition to the container identification number.</p>

<p>For swap bodies and semi-trailers, the <abbr title="Intermodal Loading Units">ILU</abbr> (Intermodal Loading Units) code as introduced by the European EN 13044 standard shall be used.</p>

<h4>Modes of transport other than air:</h4>

<p>For modes of transport other than air, a container is a special box to carry freight, strengthened and stackable and allowing horizontal or vertical transfers.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The term container covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large, re-usable containers, for example, International Standards Organization (<abbr title="International Standards Organization">ISO</abbr>) types designed to be transported by road, rail, sea, or air</li>
  <li>Smaller re-usable types of containers of an internal volume of a cubic metre or more designed to be transported by road, rail, sea or air and capable of specialized handling without unloading</li>
  <li>Specialized re-usable containers designed to be used for the particular goods and transported by road, rail, sea or air</li>
  <li>Goods are to be regarded as containerised even when a container is mounted on a road vehicle or rail wagon</li>

<p>This data element is not required where codes 2 (Rail), 5 (Postal) or 7 (Fixed Energy Installation) have been declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/4 (Mode of Transport at the Border).</p>

<p>Using the relevant country code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-codes-for-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 13: Country Codes</a>), enter the nationality of the active means of transport crossing the Union’s external border.</p>

<p>Enter the nationality of the active means of transport crossing the border, except:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the case of ships or aircraft registered in the colonies or dependencies of a foreign country, enter the nationality of that country</li>
  <li>in the case of ships or aircraft registered in the UK’s dependent territories, enter the nationality of that territory.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>In the case of combined transport or where several means of transport are used, the active means of transport is the one which propels the whole combination. For example, in the case of a lorry on a sea-going vessel, the active means of transport is the ship. In the case of a tractor and trailer, the active means of transport is the tractor.</p>

<p>The nationality of the means of transport must not be declared if <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/4 (Mode of Transport at the Border) is completed with 2 (Rail Transport), 5 (Postal Consignments) or 7 (Fixed Transport Installation).</p>

<p>On paper declarations: enter the transport identity followed, if required, by the transport nationality, separated by a dash (—).</p>

<p>Where the Identity of means of transport on arrival, declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/9 is Eurotunnel, then the Nationality of active means of transport crossing the border declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/15 must be FR.</p>
