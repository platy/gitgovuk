<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Import simplified declaration C&amp;F (with regular use)">I1 C&amp;F</abbr>:</h3>

<p>This Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) is only required on a simplified declaration where a claim to a tariff quota is being made on the simplified declaration. Additional data elements will be required on the simplified declaration to support the claim to quota, for example, commodity code details.
Claims to Quotas on a simplified declaration may only be made where the requested procedure (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10) is free circulation.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter the order number of the tariff quota for which the declarant is applying.
When a reduced or nil rate of Customs Duty is claimed against a Tariff quota, enter the relevant serial number listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/find_commodity" rel="external">UK Integrated Online Tariff</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/find_commodity" rel="external">Northern Ireland Online Tariff</a>.</p>

<p>Quota relief may be claimed for goods entered for excise warehousing, but not on their removal from excise warehousing.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Article 50 of the Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447, restricts claims to quotas to declarations made to Free Circulation only.</p>

<p>A tariff quota is any pre-set value or quantity of given goods, which may be imported during a specified period with a reduction or on suspension of the normal customs duties, and beyond which any additional quantity of these goods can be imported by paying normal customs duties.</p>

<p>The Commission database for tariff quotas allows tracking the overall EU usage of “First come first served” import quotas in force granted to products originating from certain third countries. It displays the balances of each tariff quota applicable in the present year and in the past year. It also indicates the date when a particular tariff quota is exhausted. This information is subject to constant change as a result of the daily operations which take place.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>  contains details of all reference codes which may be declared in this data element, a description of their usage and provides guidance on the details to be declared against each code. Please refer to this Appendix to identify any specific document codes required to support the claim to quota.</p>

<h3>Critical Quotas:</h3>

<p>Where security may be required in the event of a quota being critical, an appropriate Method of Payment (<abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr>) code must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/8 (Method of Payment) to ensure the duty can be taken on deposit.  Please note that as per the guidance in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/6 (Deferred Payment), only a single method of payment can be used against a single tax type.</p>

<p>*Financial leasing covers operations where the lease instalments are calculated in such a way as to cover all or virtually all of the value of the goods. The risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. At the end of the contract the lessee becomes the legal owner of the goods.</p>

<p>**Processing covers operations (transformation, construction, assembling, enhancement, renovation …) with the objective of producing a new or really improved item. This does not necessarily involve a change in the product classification. Processing activities on a processor’s own account are not covered by this item and should be registered under item 1 of column A.</p>

<p>Enter the statistical value for the goods item in GBP (£ sterling), irrespective of the currency used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14 (item price).</p>

<p>This data element must be completed as required by the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code completion notes (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>  for details) or</li>

</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The statistical value is the approximate theoretical value of the goods at the time and place where they enter the territory of the Member State in which they are located at the time of release into the customs procedure (‘importing Member State’). The statistical value is to relate to this Member State.</p>

<p>Therefore, the statistical value consists of the (intrinsic) value of the goods and the incurred or calculated cost for transport and insurance from their point of the transport related departure to the point of entry into this Member State.</p>

<h4>Value of the goods</h4>

<p>Statistical value is based on the value of the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Value of the goods shall be the customs value, where it is determined (Title II, Chapter 3 of the Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) “VALUE OF GOODS FOR CUSTOMS PURPOSES”)</li>
  <li>Where a customs value is not determined, the value of the goods shall be;
    <ul>
      <li>In the case of a sale or purchase: the price actually paid or payable for the imported goods.</li>
      <li>In other cases: the price which would, for the import, reasonably be invoiced in the case of sale or purchase between a non-related buyer and seller.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Other costs</h4>

<p>The Statistical value must include only ancillary charges. These are the actual or calculated costs for transport and, if they are incurred, for insurance, but covering only that part of the journey which is outside the statistical territory of the ‘importing Member State’. If transport or insurance costs are not known, they need to be assessed reasonably on the basis of costs usually incurred or payable for such services (considering especially, if known, the different modes of transport).</p>

<h4>Other costs in relation to a customs value</h4>

<p>The customs value at the EU border has to be complemented by ancillary costs up to the border of the importing Member State. In case the customs value includes ancillary costs beyond the border of the importing Member State (for example, ‘CIF ‘final destination’’), these costs shall not be included in the statistical value. If applicable, overall “other costs” must be split up for example, on a kilometre pro rata basis.</p>

<h4>“Other costs” relating to more than one item on the import declaration</h4>

<p>If the ancillary charges (such as transport and insurance) relate to several items on an import declaration, the respective ancillary costs for each individual item must be calculated on a relevant pro rata basis, for example, kg or volume.</p>

<h4>Statistical value in case of processing (import)</h4>

<p>This applies only where the commercial transaction is not a sales contract, but a contract for services (a ‘processing’ contract). Note: Do not complete <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/6 for Inward Processing on a <abbr title="Special procedure: processing (inward processing)">H4</abbr> declaration category where the commercial transation is a sales contract. This exemption does not apply on any subsequent diversions to free circulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Imports for inward processing<br>
For goods which are to enter the Union for inward processing, the statistical value must be established by taking the value of the unprocessed goods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Re-imports after outward processing<br>
For goods which underwent outward processing and return to the Union, the statistical value must be established by taking the value of the previously exported unprocessed goods plus the value added during the processing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to the specific Procedure Code completion notes in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>  for more details.</p>

<h4>Currency conversion</h4>

<p>The Statistical Value must be expressed in the national currency of the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged. Values which are, for example, on documents, expressed in another currency (for example, invoiced currency of the goods), need to be converted. 
The rate of exchange to be used is the rate applicable at the time the customs declaration is accepted, and according to Union customs provisions on currency conversion relating to the determination of the customs value (Article 146 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>-IA).</p>
