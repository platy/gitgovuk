<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Import simplified declaration C&amp;F (with regular use)">I1 C&amp;F</abbr>:</h3>

<p>This data element is only required on a simplified declaration where specified by the Procedure Code, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> for specific details.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>The Destination Country Code must always be an EU Member State or Territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union.</p>

<p>Using the relevant country code, enter the code for the Member State or Territory where the goods are located at the time of release into the customs procedure, for example, free circulation (See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-codes-for-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 13: Country Codes</a>  for the codes which may be used).</p>

<p>Where it is known at the time of drawing up the customs declaration that the goods will be dispatched to another Member State or Territory after the release, enter the code for this latter Member State or Territory, for example where Requested Procedure Codes 01 or 42 are being declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> for specific details.</p>

<p>Where goods are imported with a view to place them under the Temporary Admission procedure, the Member State of destination shall be the Member State where the goods are to be first used.</p>

<p>Where goods are imported with a view to place them under the Inward Processing procedure, the Member State of destination shall be the Member State where the first processing activity is carried out.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The Destination Country Code must always be an EU Member State, Special Fiscal Territory or other Territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union. However:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where the Onward Supply Relief (<abbr title="onward supply relief">OSR</abbr>) procedure is used (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 codes beginning with 42), the Destination Country Code must not be GB or IM, but must be the EU Member State of destination for the onward supply.</li>
  <li>For example, goods being imported for onward supply to France, the code in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/8 must be declared as FR.</li>
  <li>Where the Onward Dispatch (<abbr title="onward dispatch">OSD</abbr>) procedure is used (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 codes beginning with 01), the Destination Country Code must not be GB or IM, but must be the Customs Union Territory of final  destination for the onward dispatch.</li>
  <li>For example, goods being imported for onward dispatch to Jersey, the code in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/8 must be declared as JE.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where there are a number of items on a declaration but there is only one country of ultimate destination, this must be declared at header level only. No reference to the destination country should be made at item level.</p>

<p>Where there are a number of items on the declaration and there is more than one ultimate country of destination, the ultimate country of destination must be declared at individual item level only, not at the header level. The ultimate country of destination must not be the same for all individual item level data.</p>

<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Import simplified declaration C&amp;F (with regular use)">I1 C&amp;F</abbr>:</h3>

<p>This data element is only required on a simplified declaration where controlled goods are being entered on a simplified declaration.</p>

<h3>Declaration category <abbr title="Declaration for the introduction of goods in the context of trade with Special Fiscal Territories or Territories with which the EU has formed a Customs Union">H5</abbr>:</h3>

<p>The code declared should identify the territory of dispatch to the UK.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Using the code list in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-codes-for-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 13: Country Codes</a>, enter the relevant country code for the third country/ territory from which the goods were initially dispatched to the UK.</p>

<p>However, where there has been a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stoppage (including consolidation) or</li>
  <li>Legal action taken in respect of the goods in an intermediate country, (for example, a non-EU country undertook an inspection which caused them to remain in that country for a longer period than would normally have been the case)</li>
  <li>Commercial transactions en-route (for example, a change of ownership in an intermediate country, for instance, a non-EU country)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should enter the country code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the last intermediate country, for instance, the non-EU country where the goods were last located before arrival in the UK or</li>
  <li>Where the change took place (for example, sale).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Whale factory ships: For goods produced or manufactured on whale factory ships not registered in the UK and consigned direct to this country, enter the code for the country in which the ship is registered.</p>

<p>Deep sea fisheries: For goods consigned direct to the UK from the deep-sea fisheries, enter the code for the country in which the fishing vessel is registered. Enter the description ‘deep sea fisheries’ in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/8 (Description of Goods).</p>

<p>Where there are a number of items on a declaration but there is only one country of dispatch/ export, this must be declared at header level only. No reference to the country of dispatch/ export should be made at item level.</p>

<p>Where there are a number of items on the declaration and there is more than one country of dispatch/ export, the country of dispatch/ export must be declared at individual item level only, not at the header level. The country of dispatch/ export must not be the same for all individual item level data.</p>

<p>Where the goods are being dispatched from a group of countries, enter the code for the individual country.  For example, if dispatched from the EU, this should be the individual code for the Member State, for example, ‘FR’ for France.</p>

<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Import simplified declaration C&amp;F (with regular use)">I1 C&amp;F</abbr>:</h3>

<p>This data element is only required on a simplified declaration where controlled goods are being entered on a simplified declaration.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Where <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/17 (Preference Code) has a first digit of ‘1’ this data element is always mandatory.</p>

<p>Enter the code for the country of non-preferential origin of the goods from the list of codes shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-codes-for-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 13: Country Codes</a>.</p>

<p>If a country of preferential origin is declared (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/16), this data element must be completed if the country of non-preferential origin to be declared (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/15) is different.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/16 is completed using a preference group code, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/15 must be completed with the specific country of origin for the goods within that group or, if different, the non-preferential country of origin.</p>

<p>For imports originating from EU Member States, where the individual Member State is unknown, it is acceptable to enter any Member State involved in the production of the goods. The Member State may be identified through the accompanying commercial documentation or the Registered Exporter system (REX) code on a ‘statement on origin’.  Please note, this only applies to entries on UK custom declarations: the origin stated on the proof of origin must be at the group of country level.  For example, a ‘statement on origin’ made out under the UK-EU Trade Cooperation Agreement should be completed in accordance with Annex 7 of that agreement and refer to ‘the Union’ as the preferential origin of the goods.</p>

<p>Where the goods are subject to an electronic licence, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/15 must always be completed.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>In determining the country of origin, the rules laid down in Article 60(2) of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 should be followed.</p>

<h4>Article 60(2)</h4>

<p>Goods whose production involved more than one country or territory shall be deemed to originate in the country or territory where they underwent their last, substantial, economically justified processing or working in an undertaking equipped for that purpose, resulting in the manufacture of a new product or representing an important stage of manufacture.</p>

<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Special procedure: storage (customs warehousing)">H2</abbr>:</h3>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/16 may be left blank for goods entered to a customs warehouse.</p>

<p>However, where a claim to preferential origin status is being reserved at the time of entry to the customs warehouse, the intended preference claim must be indicated on the entry to warehousing through the use of Additional Information (<abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr>) statement code WHSRP in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/additional-information-ai-statement-codes-for-data-element-22-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 4: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2: Additional Information (<abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr>) Statement Codes</a> for details).</p>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/17, 5/16 and 5/15 (where appropriate) must also be completed in these instances.</p>

<p>This data element is only required on a simplified declaration where controlled goods are being entered on a simplified declaration and a claim to preference is being made.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Where <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/17 (Preference Code) has a first digit other than ‘1’ this data element is always mandatory.</p>

<p>If a preferential treatment based on the origin of the goods is requested in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/17 Preference, enter the country of origin, as indicated in the proof of origin document.</p>

<p>Enter the code for the country of origin or preference group of the goods from the list of codes shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-codes-for-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 13: Country Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Where the proof of origin document refers to a group of countries, enter the group of countries by using the relevant codes in accordance with the codes listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-codes-for-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 13: Country Codes</a>.</p>

<p>For example, for preference claims made in the UK under the UK-EU Trade Cooperation Agreement, enter the code ‘EU’ rather than the specific Member State country code.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/16 is completed using a preference group code, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/15 must be completed with the specific country of origin for the goods within that group or, if applicable, the non-preferential country of origin.</p>

Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Additional Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) Codes E01:</h3>

<p>This data element must not be completed for goods which have been entered under Simplified Procedure Value (<abbr title="Simplified Procedure Value">SPV</abbr>).  It cannot therefore be used in conjunction with Additional Procedure Code E01 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.  (See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a> for details.)</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>This data element is only to be completed when an adjustment of air transport costs is being claimed for goods arriving from non-EU airports (see section 46 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-252-valuation-of-imported-goods-for-customs-purposes-vat-and-trade-statistics/notice-252-valuation-of-imported-goods-for-customs-purposes-vat-and-trade-statistics#air-transport-costs---percentage-to-be-included-in-the-customs-value">Notice 252</a>).</p>

<p>This data element is used to declare the airport of loading and should only be completed when claiming an adjustment to the customs value for the air freight charges related to the part of the journey which is considered to have been within the EU. The standard rates to be applied are shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/place-of-loading-codes-for-data-element-521-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 15A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/21: Foreign Airport Zones and Percentages</a>.</p>

<p>It is used in conjunction with codes AR, AS, BR and BS in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/9 (Addition and Deductions), otherwise it should be left blank.</p>

<p>Enter the 3-alpha IATA airport code shown on the air waybill which matches the codes listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/place-of-loading-codes-for-data-element-521-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 15B: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/21: Airport Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Where the goods were shipped from an airport not listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/place-of-loading-codes-for-data-element-521-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 15B: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/21: Airport Codes</a>, the code of the nearest listed airport must be used.</p>

<p>For consignments transhipped via another Member State, the airport of loading for the journey to the EU (third country airport) should be declared rather than the EU airport of transhipment.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>When goods are imported by air into the UK, that part of the air transport costs covering the distance flown inside the EU is excluded from the value for duty.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> calculates the appropriate adjustment, using the percentages attached to the Airport of Loading code, excluding it from the customs value for duty but includes it in the value for VAT.</p>
