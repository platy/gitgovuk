<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Special procedure: processing (inward processing)">H4</abbr>:</h3>

<p>Delivery terms must be completed for importations to Inward Processing when the declarant opts to use the Article 86 (3) customs debt rules as laid down in EU Reg. No. 952/2013. In such cases Additional Procedure Code F44 should be declared in Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/11 and GEN86 completed in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 (Additional Information). Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Import simplified declaration C&amp;F (with regular use)">I1 C&amp;F</abbr>:</h3>

<p>This data element is only required on a simplified declaration where a claim to a tariff quota is being made on the simplified declaration.</p>

<h3>Additional Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) Codes E01 or E02:</h3>

<p>This data element must not be completed for goods which have been entered under Simplified Procedure Value (<abbr title="Simplified Procedure Value">SPV</abbr>) or Standard Import Value (<abbr title="Standard Import Value">SIV</abbr>). It cannot therefore be used in conjunction with Additional Procedure Code E01 or E02 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11. (See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a> for details.)</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Delivery terms code must be provided for declarations using valuation method 1 (transaction value of imported goods).</p>

<p>Using the relevant Union codes and headings, specify the terms of the commercial contract.</p>

<p>The code to be declared shall be made up of two components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First Component: INCOTERM code</li>
  <li>Second Component: Location up to which the INCOTERMs apply.</li>
</ul>

<p>Details of the delivery terms which may be used, and their completion instructions may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivery-terms-for-data-element-41-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 7: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/1: Delivery Terms</a>.</p>

<h4>First Component: INCOTERM (a3)</h4>

<p>Enter the INCOTERM using the appropriate code from Appendix 7.</p>

<h4>Second Component: Location name (an..17 coded version or an..37 free text version)</h4>

<p>Enter the location up to which the INCOTERMs apply, in the following format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UN/LOCODE an..17.</li>
</ul>

<p>The UN/LOCODE must be used where an appropriate code exists.</p>

<p>A list of GB UN/LOCODES may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gb-place-names-and-unlocode-codes-for-data-element-523-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 16I: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/23: Goods Location Codes</a>. Codes from Appendix 16I declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/1 should be prefaced with the country code GB.</p>

<p>Non-GB UN/LOCODES may be <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/location" rel="external">found here</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>A plain language description for the location may only be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/1, where no UN/LOCODE exists for the location.</li>
  <li>Where no UN/LOCODE exists, enter the location details in the following format: The appropriate country code (a2) followed by plain text location (an..35). A list of country codes may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-codes-for-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 13: Country Codes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Using UN/LOCODE:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CIFGBTIL (Cost Insurance and Freight paid to Tilbury)</li>
  <li>FOBHKKWN (Free on Board at docks in Hong Kong)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using plain language description:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CIFGBCanewdon</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The delivery terms are part of the contractual agreements between seller and buyer. In principle the parties are free to agree whatever they might consider as necessary in order to pursue their commercial interests.</p>

<p>The terms of delivery have to be declared in a customs declaration for release for free circulation in order to allow for the correct determination of the customs value of the imported goods which is also used as the basis for the determination of statistical value/ value for VAT.</p>

<p>In international trade, parties usually base their contractual agreements on the INCOTERMS which are international sales terms, published by the International Chamber of Commerce (<abbr title="International Chamber of Commerce">ICC</abbr>). The INCOTERMS which may be used are listed in 
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivery-terms-for-data-element-41-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 7: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/1: Delivery Terms</a>.</p>

<p>The “INCOTERMS 2000” codes “DAF”, “DDU”, “DES”, “DEQ” have been kept in the code list for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/1 in Annex B to EU Reg. No. 2015/2447 to facilitate any existing contracts these apply to.</p>

<p>Where the delivery terms agreed between the parties are not covered by one of the 15 codes, the code ‘XXX’ shall be used. When using code ‘XXX’, the data element is to be completed as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First component: ‘XXX’</li>
  <li>Second component: Country Code (a2) to which the delivery terms apply (for example, freight paid to France) followed by a narrative description of the delivery terms given in the contract. A list of the country codes which may be used can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-codes-for-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 13: Country Codes</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where delivery terms are declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/1 that require an addition or deduction to the customs value, the equivalent addition or deduction code must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/9 to prevent the declaration being rejected. For example, delivery terms EXW would require, as a minimum a freight charge to be declared as an addition in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/9.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Where OVR01 <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement is entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The requirement to complete a manual tax calculation will be specified by the commodity code, procedure code or other <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement. <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement code OVR01 may only be used where a manual duty calculation is specifically required.

</ul>

<h4>Where a measurement unit and qualifier (3rd Quantity) are required:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This data element should be completed where a measurement unit and qualifier (as applicable) are required to support the calculation of the tax amounts, for example a third quantity is required such as alcoholic strength by volume.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a commodity code requires a measurement unit and qualifier (where applicable), this will be specified against the commodity code details in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/find_commodity" rel="external">UK Integrated Online Tariff</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/find_commodity" rel="external">Northern Ireland Online Tariff</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the specific commodity code requires a measurement unit and/ or qualifier to be declared, enter the appropriate code for the commodity’s measurement unit type using the list provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measurement-unit-codes-for-data-elements-23-and-44-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 20: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 &amp; <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/4 — Measurement Unit Codes</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>For example, if the commodity requires a quantity in litres, enter the measurement unit code of LTR followed by the quantity declared in litres.</li>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>For paper declarations: prefix any quantity with ‘Q’.</p>

<p>Any decimal places declared for the quantity (up to a maximum of 6 places) must be deducted from the total number of characters used in the data element. For example, if 3 decimal places are used, then only 13 whole numbers may be used in front of the decimal place.</p>

<p>If no quantity or measurement unit/ qualifier is required, this data element should be omitted unless otherwise a manual tax calculation is permitted.</p>

<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Import simplified declaration C&amp;F (with regular use)">I1 C&amp;F</abbr>:</h3>

<p>This data element is only required on a simplified declaration where a claim to a tariff quota is being made on the simplified declaration.</p>

<h3>For Additional Declaration Types, C, F, Y or Z:</h3>

<p>When Simplified Declaration Procedure or Entry in Declarant’s records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>) is being used, only Method of Payment (<abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr>) codes E or R may be used.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>The list of allowable <abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> and the codes to be declared for each may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/method-of-payment-codes-for-data-element-48-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 9: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/8: Method of Payment Codes</a>.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> code is only required where there is revenue to pay or secure.</p>

<p>Where no <abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> code has been provided and <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> identifies that revenue has to be paid or secured, <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will issue an immediate payment request.</p>

<h4>Security and outright payment required for a single tax type:</h4>

<p>A single <abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> code is to be declared for each tax type declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/3. Where a <abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> code is entered to secure (or pay) a particular tax type, the equivalent payment method will be used to collect any outright payment (or security) due. For example, <abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> code R (deferment account deposit) declared to secure the potential customs duty, the system will automatically collect any outright customs duty due from the same deferment account.</p>

<h4>Quotas:</h4>

<p>Where security may be required in the event of a quota being critical, an appropriate <abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> code must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/8 to ensure the duty can be taken on deposit. Please note that as per the section above, only a single method of payment can be used against a single tax type.</p>

<h4>Deferment:</h4>

<p>Where a deferred method of payment (code E or R) is used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the deferment account numbers (<abbr title="deferment account numbers">DANs</abbr>) in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/6.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where deferred payment is being used to pay or secure Customs duty:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Document Codes C505 and C506 must also be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 and</li>
  <li>Authorisation Type Codes CGU and DPO declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39.</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 and 3/39 do not need to be completed when deferment is only being used for other taxes.</p>

<h4>Cash Accounts:</h4>

<p>When <abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> codes N or P are being declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/8, then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/2 (Guarantee Type): Enter Code ‘Y’ where Cash Accounts are being used to pay/ secure the duties and other charges concerned.</li>
  <li>In <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/3 (Guarantee Reference): Enter the Economic Operator Registration and Identification number (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr>) of the holder of the Cash Account being used to pay/ secure any duties and charges.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Authorisation by Customs Declaration:</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> types shown in the following table are the only <abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> codes that can be used when security is required for an Authorisation by Customs Declaration to secure the potential duty due at the full rate of duty.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/method-of-payment-codes-for-data-element-48-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 9: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/8: Method of Payment Codes</a> for codes that can be used for other tax lines.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/8 may be left blank where no payment or security is due for the specific tax type.</p>

<p>When codes M or N are inserted, a deposit slip (form C&amp;E955) must be attached to the declaration.</p>

<p>When code R is used, deposit slip (form C&amp;E955D) must be attached.</p>

<p>Failure to attach forms C&amp;E955 and C&amp;E955D could result in a delay in any future repayment. Document code ‘955D’ must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3. Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence of VAT paid will normally be issued direct to importers in the form of a monthly VAT certificate form C79.</p>

<p>A declarant acting on behalf of an importer may not use the importer’s guarantee account (<abbr title="method of payment">MOP</abbr> U and V) without being authorised to do so. This authority may be specific (relating to one consignment) and be presented with the declaration, or alternatively may be a standing authorisation, which covers all consignments.</p>

<p>If a declaration is processed as a paperless declaration, any authority must be retained at the traders registered premises (for 4 years) and may be subject to audit by customs.</p>

<p>This data element may be completed at header or item level, dependent on the particular type of addition or deduction concerned (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/additions-and-deductions-for-data-element-49-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 10: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/9: Additions and Deductions Codes</a> for details).</p>

<p>Additions and deductions should only be declared at header level where they apply to all good items on the customs declaration.</p>

<p>Each addition or deduction code can only be declared once at header level.  The same addition or deduction code cannot then be declared at item level as well.</p>

<p>If a specific addition or deduction is being declared at item level, that addition or deduction may only be declared once per item.</p>

<p>All additions or deductions must be declared in the currency in which the charge (addition or deduction) was invoiced.</p>

<p>This data element is made up of two components:</p>

<h4>First Component: Additions and Deductions code (a2)</h4>

<p>For each type of addition or deduction, enter the relevant code from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/additions-and-deductions-for-data-element-49-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 10: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/9: Additions and Deductions Codes</a>.</p>

<h4>Second Component: Amount (n..16,2)</h4>

<p>For each addition or deduction declared in the first component, enter the corresponding amount to be included in or deducted from the item price.</p>

<p>This amount should be declared as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A monetary amount (with the relevant currency code), declared in the same currency in which the addition/deduction is invoiced or</li>
  <li>A percentage adjustment given to 2 decimal places</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the customs value of the goods in question cannot be determined under method 1 (Article 70 of the Code), the declarant shall provide the customs authorities any additional information necessary for the purposes of determining the customs value.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Where delivery terms are declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/1 that require an addition or deduction to the customs value, the equivalent addition or deduction code must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/9 to prevent the declaration being rejected. For example, delivery terms EXW would require, as a minimum a freight charge to be declared as an addition in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/9.</p>

<p>Up to 99 instances of this data element may be declared at header and item level.</p>

<p>Wherever a monetary amount is declared, a currency code must also be provided for that same data element, for example USD500 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14 (Item price).</p>

<p>The currency declared must relate to each specific monetary amount being declared.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Goods are invoiced in US dollars, the currency declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14 (item price) would therefore be USD</li>
  <li>Freight charges are invoiced in Euros, the currency declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/9 for freight costs would therefore be EUR</li>
  <li>Statistical value must be declared in Sterling, therefore the currency declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/6 would be GBP</li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/currency-codes-for-data-element-410-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 11: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/10: Currency Codes</a> for the list of codes to be used for each currency accepted by <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Freight Apportionment</h3>

<p>For multi-item declarations <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> divides any freight charges between the items in proportion to their value or gross mass according to the declarant’s choice.</p>

<p>Codes for apportionment by gross mass and value must not be mixed on a declaration. For instance, if a declaration includes any of the codes AP, AR, AV, BA or BR then it must not include any of the codes AQ, AS, AW, BS or BU.</p>

<p>When using codes BS and BU on a multi-item declaration, the deduction must not reduce the value of any item to zero or a negative amount.</p>

<p>In these cases, the freight charges must instead be apportioned by value rather than weight using the code BA or BR as appropriate.</p>

<p>Freight charges will be apportioned by value for codes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AP</li>
  <li>AR</li>
  <li>AV</li>
  <li>BA</li>
  <li>BR</li>
</ul>

<p>Freight charges will be apportioned by gross mass for codes -</p>

<ul>
  <li>AQ</li>
  <li>AS</li>
  <li>AW</li>
  <li>BS</li>
  <li>BU</li>
</ul>

<h3>Air Transport Costs (Codes AR, AS, BR and BS)</h3>

<p>Codes AR, AS, BR or BS must only be used when an Airport of Loading code has been declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/21 and an adjustment is being made to the customs value for the freight charges relating to the section of the flight which is considered to be within the EU. Only one of the codes AR, AS, BR or BS can be used on a declaration.</p>

<p>Enter those charges relating to the air transport of the goods which represent the freight charges only. Do not include any items such as handling charges or agency fees.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will adjust the air transport costs using set percentages as per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/place-of-loading-codes-for-data-element-521-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 15A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/21: Foreign Airport Zones and Percentages</a>, as part of the calculation of the customs value.</p>

<p>Any other freight charges, such as transport from the exporter’s premises to the airport, should be declared separately using the appropriate code from the list in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/additions-and-deductions-for-data-element-49-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 10: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/9: Additions and Deductions Codes</a>.  All freight charges to be added or deducted must be declared in the currency shown on the air waybill.</p>

<p>Transhipments:</p>

<p>For goods transhipped via another EU airport, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/21 (Airport of Loading) must still be completed with the code for the third country airport from which the goods were dispatched to the EU.</p>

<p>The adjustments for flights within the EU use standard percentages irrespective of the destination airport so you will not be disadvantaged.</p>

<p>Any separate transport charges from the transhipment airport within the EU to the final destination must be declared using the appropriate code AV or AW.</p>

<h3>Transport costs, loading and handling charges up to the place of introduction in the European Union (Codes AP &amp; AQ)</h3>

<p>These codes should not to be completed when freight charges have been included in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/11 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14.</p>

<p>If this data element is completed <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will include the charges in the calculation of the customs and other values.</p>

<p>Enter the amount of the transport costs, loading and handling charges to no more than 2 decimal places.</p>

<h3>Costs of transport after arrival at the place of introduction (Codes AV, AW, BA and AU)</h3>

<p>For goods imported by surface transport (land or sea), if the values declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/11 and 4/14 include the cost of transport within the EU, these should be declared against code BA or BU and will be deducted from the value for customs duty.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> calculates the value for VAT by adding any duties, levies or additional costs to be included in the VAT value, to the value declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14.</p>

<p>Codes AV or AW must only be used when there are any additional costs, not included in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14 Item Price, which need to be added to arrive at the value for VAT, for example freight charges covering transport within the EU (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-252-valuation-of-imported-goods-for-customs-purposes-vat-and-trade-statistics">Notices 252</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/imports-and-vat-notice-702">Notice 702</a>).</p>

<h3>Valuation Simplification Authorisations (Codes AN, AO, BG and BK)</h3>

<p>When using codes AN, AO, BG or BK to declare an addition or deduction based on a decision granted in accordance with Article 71 of the EU Reg. No. 2015/2446, the following must also be declared:</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes):</p>

<p>Please note that these codes must not be used on supplementary declarations (Additional Declaration Types Y or Z declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2).</p>

<p>Only one of the codes AN, AO, BG or BK can be used on a declaration.</p>

<h3>Percentage Adjustments</h3>

<p>When using codes AC, AX, AZ, AM, AO, BL, BF, BK or BI, <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will apply the declared % adjustment to the item price declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14. If the % adjustment should be applied to any other additions or deductions or if the % adjustment does not apply to the full amount declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14, then the declarant will need to calculate the amount manually and declare the monetary adjustment under the appropriate corresponding code, AB, AF, AH, <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr>, AN, BD, BM, BG or BH.</p>

<p>If making a manual calculation of the addition or deduction, then a work sheet showing the calculations must be held and made available to Customs on request. Document Code 9WKS must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes).</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/10 Invoice Currency (Box 22: Invoice Currency and Total Amount Invoiced)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/10 (invoice currency) is not declared to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> as a data element in its own right.</p>

<p>Wherever a monetary amount is declared, a currency code must also be provided for that same data element, for example USD500 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14 (Item price).</p>

<p>The currency declared must relate to each specific monetary amount being declared.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Goods are invoiced in US dollars, the currency declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14 (item price) would therefore be USD</li>

<p>The customs value of goods is defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-252-valuation-of-imported-goods-for-customs-purposes-vat-and-trade-statistics">Notice 252</a>.</p>

<p>It must be declared when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The valuation method used to determine the customs value is Method 2, 3, 4(a) or 5;</li>
  <li>The customs value using Method 4(b) is used for security purposes;</li>
  <li>The declaration is a Simplified Declaration for controlled goods on which a full licensing declaration at the border is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>When importers or agents/ representatives use their own valuation methods the customs value must also be declared in this data element.</p>

<p>When Additional Procedure Codes (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) E01 or E02 are used this data element must be left blank.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Wherever a monetary amount is declared, a currency code must also be provided for that same data element, for example USD500 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14 (Item price).</p>

<p>The currency declared must relate to each specific monetary amount being declared.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Goods are invoiced in US dollars, the currency declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14 (item price) would therefore be USD</li>
  <li>Freight charges are invoiced in Euros, the currency declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/9 for freight costs would therefore be EUR</li>
  <li>Statistical value must be declared in Sterling, therefore the currency declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/6 would be GBP</li>
</ul>

<p>Any decimal places declared (up to a maximum of 2 places) must be deducted from the total number of characters used in the data element. For example, if 2 decimal places are used, then only 14 whole numbers may be used in front of the decimal place.</p>

<p>The sum of the amount filled in for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14 (Item price/ amount) of all items in a customs declaration must be equal to the total amount filled in for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/11 (Total Amount Invoiced) where declared.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> system will convert any amounts declared in foreign currencies to sterling, using the rate of exchange current at the time the declaration is accepted by customs. If the current rate is not being used (for example because a fixed rate has been stipulated in the contract for sale of the goods or if the goods have been invoiced in more than one currency (see <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/11 Total Amount Invoiced) the amount shown in this data element must be in sterling.</p>

<h3>Multiple Invoice Currencies:</h3>

<p>Where the goods have been invoiced in more than one currency, the invoice value must be converted and entered in Sterling (GBP).</p>

<p>Where the goods have been invoiced in more than one currency Document Code ‘9WKS’ must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes). A copy of the worksheet or valuation declaration showing how the conversion was made, must be held and made available to Customs on request.</p>

<h3>Fixed Rates of Exchange:</h3>

<p>Where a fixed rate of exchange is stipulated in the contract of sale and is being used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the fixed rate of exchange used for the currency conversion, for evidence purposes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/15 (Fixed Rate of Exchange)</li>
  <li>Where declared, enter the Total Invoice Amount (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/11) in Sterling (GBP) and</li>
  <li>The item price/ amount (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/14) in Sterling (GBP).</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a fixed rate of exchange is applied, Document Code ‘9WKS’ must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes). A copy of the worksheet or valuation declaration showing how the conversion was made, must be held and made available to Customs on request.</p>

<p>Evidence to support the use of fixed rates of exchange must be held and made available to Customs on request.</p>
