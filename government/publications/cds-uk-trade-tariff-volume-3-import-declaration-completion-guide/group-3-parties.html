<p>Enter the full name and address of the last seller of the goods prior to their importation into the Union (as defined in Article 128 of EU Reg. No. 2015/2447).</p>

<h3>Declaration category <abbr title="Declaration for the introduction of goods in the context of trade with Special Fiscal Territories or Territories with which the EU has formed a Customs Union">H5</abbr>:</h3>

<p>Enter the full name and address of the consignor who acts as ‘exporter’ in the context of trade with Special Fiscal Territories or Territories with which the EU has formed a Customs Union. The consignor is the last seller of the goods prior to their introduction into the Territory where the goods are to be released.</p>

<h3>Declaration category H7:</h3>

<p>Enter the full name and address of the person consigning the goods as stipulated in the transport contract by the party ordering the transport.</p>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 must always be completed with the Name and Address of the Exporter.<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/2 is not required in any circumstances.</p>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 must be completed at header level only.</p>

<h3>All declaration categories</h3>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 is used to declare the Exporter’s name and address and postcode. If the exporter identification reference number (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) quoted in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/2 is recognised by <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> then <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 need not be completed.</p>

<p>Please note that the consignor/ exporter details (formerly Box 2) is now covered under 6 different data elements under <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Name and address</h3>

<p>Enter the full name and address of the exporter, including the postcode. Where a country does not use a postcode or equivalent code, (for example, US zip code), enter ‘NA’ in this section of the data element.</p>

<p>If more than two parties are involved in the exportation of the goods to the EU, the last seller of the goods prior to their introduction into the Union is indicated as the Exporter. The last seller is the party who last sold the goods before they were brought into the customs territory of the Union.</p>

<p>For example: A US company buys goods in China and then sells them to a UK company. The goods are dispatched directly from China to the UK, where they are released for free circulation.</p>

<p>The US company is the last seller of the goods before they were brought into the customs territory of the Union and is therefore indicated as the Exporter.</p>

<p>In cases where Article 128 (2) of EU Reg. 2015/2447 applies, the exporter to be indicated is the third country person selling the goods for export during the suspension procedure.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>For paper declarations only one exporter is to be declared.</p>

<p>For all other declarations:</p>

<p>If there is only one exporter, then the exporter details are to be supplied at header level. 
If there is more than one exporter, then:</p>

<h4>Use of Representatives or Agents to submit the declaration on the importer’s/ legal declarant’s behalf:</h4>

<p>Article 5(15) of Council Regulation No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) defines the legal declarant as:</p>

<p>The person lodging a customs declaration in his or her own name or the person in whose name such a declaration is lodged.</p>

<p>Where the legal declarant (for example importer) is completing the declaration themselves under ‘self-representation’, they shall be liable for the content of all declarations so completed and submitted.</p>

<p>Article 18 of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) permits customs representatives to be appointed to act on another person’s behalf.  This representation may be:</p>

<p>Direct: the representative acts in the name and of behalf of the other person. The liability rests with the original party (usually the importer). This is dependent on the representative holding appropriate evidence of their empowerment to act on behalf of the original party and can demonstrate that the original party’s instructions have been followed.</p>

<p>Indirect: the representative acts in their own name but on behalf of another person. The liability is held jointly and severally between both parties.</p>

<p>Article 5(6) of Council Reg. (EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines a representative as:</p>

<p>Any person appointed by another person to carry out the acts and formalities required under the customs legislation in his or her dealings with customs authorities.</p>

<p>A customs representative shall be established within the customs territory of the Union, except where the customs representative acts upon behalf of persons who are not required to be established within the customs territory of the Union.</p>

<h4>Direct Representation:</h4>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as a ‘direct’ representative, in the name of and on behalf of another person and is transmitting the declaration under the representative’s/ agent’s own user identity, the representative/ agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority of their powers to act. Failure to do so will result in liability resting with the representative.</p>

<p>In this example, the representative’s details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/17 or 3/18 (declarant’s identity).  The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Direct, code ‘2’.</p>

<p>Direct representation and sub-agents:</p>

<p>Where a representative/ agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub- agent, and the sub-agent submits the declaration on behalf of the first agent but using the sub-agent’s user identity as the authentication credential; the sub-agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority to act and the instructions provided for the completion of the declaration’s particulars. Failure to produce written authority will result in liability resting with the sub-agent. The sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/17 or 3/18 (Declarant’s identity).</p>

<p>The representative, originally contracted to complete the customs declaration and formalities on behalf of the importer must be declared as the Representative on the declaration and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/19 or 3/20 (Representative’s identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the representative and the importer, not the sub-agent and any other party. The Representative retains responsibility for ensuring the declaration is made in accordance with the instructions provided by the importer.</p>

<h4>Indirect Representation:</h4>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as an ‘indirect’ representative in his/ her own name, but on behalf of another person, both parties accept joint liability for all data transmitted under the user identity. A representative or agent failing to state the level of representation on the electronic declaration will be deemed to be acting in his/ her own name and on his/ her own behalf.</p>

<p>In this example, the representative’s details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/17 or 3/18 (declarant’s identity). The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Indirect, code ‘3’.</p>

<p>Indirect representation and sub-agents:</p>

<p>Where a representative/ agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub- agent, in an ‘indirect’ capacity on behalf of the first agent (but using the sub-agent’s user identity as the authentication credential), then the sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/17 or 3/18 (declarant’s identity).</p>

<p>The representative, originally contracted to complete the customs declaration and formalities on behalf of the importer must be declared as the Representative on the declaration and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/19 or 3/20 (representative’s identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the representative and the importer, not the sub-agent and any other party.</p>

<p>The Representative retains joint and several liability with the importer for the customs debt.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<h4>Postponed VAT Accounting (<abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Postponed VAT Accounting (<abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr>) is the process by which VAT registered traders can account for import VAT on their VAT return, instead of making a payment, securing payment or using deferment to pay the Import VAT due on a customs declaration.  See further details on the terms and conditions here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-when-you-can-account-for-import-vat-on-your-vat-return</p>

<p>All UK VAT registered Importers will be eligible to use <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr>; no authorisation for <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr> will be required. They will simply make the appropriate entry and provide their <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> and/or VAT registration number (<abbr title="VAT Registration Number">VRN</abbr>) on their customs declaration.</p>

<p>This process (subject to Customs clearance) will allow the goods to enter into free circulation without up-front payment of the import VAT. The customs declaration will generate an online Monthly Postponed Import VAT Statement (<abbr title="Monthly Postponed Import VAT Statement">MPIVS</abbr>) that will be the evidence required to account for and recover the import VAT as input tax on their next VAT return.</p>

<p>(Note: The C79 will continue to be produced for those entries where any VAT was paid on importation).</p>

<h4>Onward Supply Relief only:</h4>

<p>Where a single goods item is destined for onward supply to more than 1 receiving taxable person, each receiving taxable person’s VAT Registration Number must be declared separately in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/40 against code FR2.</p>

<p>A full audit trail must be held by the dispatching taxable person to identify the quantities shipped to each onward supply entity.  Failure to provide these details on request may result in a demand for the relieved import VAT being issued.</p>

<p>When the import is followed by an intra-Community supply of the goods to another Member State, no VAT is paid upon importation and VAT will be due in the Member State of final destination.</p>

<p>In order to use this procedure, the declarant has to provide information about the importer and the customer in the destination Member State in the import declaration. 
For the declaration of the importer, the code FR1 followed by the VAT number of the importer has to be used.</p>

<p>Where the importer is represented by a tax representative in the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged, the code FR3 followed by the VAT number of the tax representative is used. The declaration of the importer and the tax representative are exclusive. This means that the tax representative has only to be declared where the importer is actually represented and in this case the importer cannot be declared.</p>

<p>For the declaration of the customer in the Member State of destination, the code FR2 followed by the VAT number of the customer in the Member State of destination has to be used.</p>

<p>In situations of triangular supply where the goods are sold to an intermediate customer who is not the consignee of the goods at the final destination, it is the VAT Number of the customer of the importer which must be provided in the import declaration with code FR2 at the time of importation, and not the VAT Number of the final consignee in the Member State where the transport ends.</p>
