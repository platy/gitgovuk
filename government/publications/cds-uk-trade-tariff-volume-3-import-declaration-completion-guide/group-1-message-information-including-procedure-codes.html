<h3>Declaration Category H7:</h3>

<p>Only codes A and D may be declared on an H7 data set.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Used to indicate both the type of declaration and if the goods have arrived or not at the goods location. For electronic declarations the code used must be consistent with the Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) transaction being used.</p>

<p>Where goods are being declared at a Goods Vehicle Movement Service (<abbr title="Goods Vehicle Movement Service">GVMS</abbr>) location (see Appendix 16S), a Goods Not Arrived (pre-lodged) Additional Declaration Type must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 using the codes in the table below.</p>

<p>Where the declaration has been pre-lodged because the goods are being released from a <abbr title="Goods Vehicle Movement Service">GVMS</abbr> location, Additional Information Code âRRS01â must also be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 and a <abbr title="Goods Vehicle Movement Service">GVMS</abbr> location code from Appendix 16S declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/23.</p>

<p>For correlation purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full customs declarations are referred to under the Union Customs Code as standard customs declarations</li>
  <li>Simplified Frontier Declarations (<abbr title="Simplified Frontier Declarations">SFDs</abbr>) used under Customs Freight Simplified Procedures (<abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>) are referred to under the Union Customs Code as simplified declarations with regular use (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 codes C&amp;F)</li>
  <li>Incomplete declarations (Partial declarations in Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) terms) are referred to under the Union Customs Code as simplified declarations on an occasional basis (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 codes B&amp;E)</li>

<h3>Declaration Category H7:</h3>

<p>Each H7 Customs Declaration may only be submitted for a single goods item, therefore this must always be completed with a value of â1â. This does not prevent Grouping from being used. Information on Grouping can be found in Additional Procedure Code <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 F47.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter in sequential number order, up to a maximum of 999, the item number.</p>

<p>Enter the number of the specific goods item in relation to the total number of items contained in the declaration, the summary declaration, notification, or where there is more than one item of goods.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>If a declaration is amended and a goods item is removed, the goods item number relating to the removed item cannot be reused.</p>

<p>For example, if on a 12-item declaration, item number 11 is removed in an amendment, then item number 11 cannot be reused for a different goods item on the declaration. Item 12 would also not be re-numbered and remains as item 12.</p>

<p>For paper declarations: Enter the item number (in sequential number order), up to the total declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/9 (ex-box 5).</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Where, as a result of declaration processing, it is determined that customs will accept a declaration without the need for the presentation of the paper copy, the user identity used to lodge a declaration with <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will replace the hand-written signature as the authentication credential for that declaration.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> role identified by the user identity will determine the liability for all data transmitted in that declaration. In a paperless environment the user identity will have the same legal status as the hand-written signature on the paper declaration.</p>

<p>Individual liability will rest with the signatory within the company for the use of that credential (for instance, the user identity). If there is to be a change of person who will act as signatory, this must be notified immediately to HMRC in writing, whereupon its records will be updated</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<h4>Authorised Signatories:</h4>

<p>The declaration must be signed according to the following rules. If the importer is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An individual, by that individual or an employee who has been authorised in writing</li>
  <li>A partnership, by one of the partners, or one of their employees authorised in writing by a partner</li>
  <li>A company incorporated in the UK under the companies acts, by a director or the company secretary, or an employee of the company authorised in writing by a director or the company secretary</li>
  <li>A corporation incorporated in the UK by statute, by a person authorised by law to sign for the corporation, or an employee of the corporation authorised in writing by such a person</li>
  <li>A foreign firm or company, or a corporation incorporated abroad by statute, by a person authorised by the law of the country in which the firm or company, is established</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, the declaration may be signed on behalf of the importer by any firm, company or individual to whom the importer has given the authority to act as a declarant for customs purposes. The manner of authorisation is a matter of arrangement between importers and their declarant but, in giving authority to a declarant, the importer will be assumed to have given authority to the clerks and servants authorised by the agent to carry out all of the importerâs customs business. Customs may at any time require evidence that a declarant has been authorised by an importer to sign declarations on the importerâs behalf.</p>

<h3>Paper Declarations:</h3>

<p>Where paper-based declarations are concerned, the original of the handwritten signature of the person concerned must be given on the copy of the declaration which is to remain at the office of import, followed by the full name of that person. Where that person is not a natural person, the signatory should add his capacity after his signature and full name.</p>

<p>In signing <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/8, a legal declaration is being made that the details shown on the form and any continuation sheets are true and complete and that the requirements of any national or Union legislation have been met.</p>

<p>When a declaration partly completed in another member state is being used as the import declaration, the person signing <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/8 is committing themselves to the accuracy of all the information on the form, including that which was already completed when they received the document.</p>

<h3>Use of Representatives or Agents to submit the declaration on the importerâs/ legal declarantâs behalf:</h3>

<p>Article 5(15) of Council Regulation EU) No. 952/2013 (Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines the legal declarant as:</p>

<p>The person lodging a customs declaration in his or her own name or the person in whose name such a declaration is lodged.</p>

<p>Where the legal declarant (for example importer) is completing the declaration themselves under âself-representationâ, they shall be liable for the content of all declarations so completed and submitted.</p>

<p>Article 18 of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) permits customs representatives to be appointed to act on another personâs behalf. This representation may be:</p>

<p>Direct: the representative acts in the name and of behalf of the other person. The liability rests with the original party (usually the importer). This is dependent on the representative holding appropriate evidence of their empowerment to act on behalf of the original party and can demonstrate that the original partyâs instructions have been followed.</p>

<p>Indirect: the representative acts in their own name but on behalf of another person. The liability is held jointly and severally between both parties.</p>

<p>Article 5(6) of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines a representative as:</p>

<p>Any person appointed by another person to carry out the acts and formalities required under the customs legislation in his or her dealings with customs authorities.</p>

<h3>Direct Representation:</h3>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as a âdirectâ representative, in the name of and on behalf of another person and is transmitting the declaration under the representativeâs/ agentâs own user identity, the representative/ agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority of their powers to act. Failure to do so will result in liability resting with the representative.</p>

<p>In this example, the representativeâs details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/17 or 3/18 (declarantâs identity). The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Direct, code â2â.</p>

<p>Direct representation and sub-agents:</p>

<p>Where a representative/ agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub-agent, and the sub-agent submits the declaration on behalf of the first agent but using the sub-agentâs user identity as the authentication credential; the sub-agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority to act and the instructions provided for the completion of the declarationâs particulars. Failure to produce written authority will result in liability resting with the sub-agent. The sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/17 or 3/18 (Declarantâs identity).</p>

<p>The representative, originally contracted to complete the customs declaration and formalities on behalf of the importer must be declared as the Representative on the declaration and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/19 or 3/20 (Representativeâs identity).</p>

<p>The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the representative and the importer, not the sub-agent and any other party. The Representative retains responsibility for ensuring the declaration is made in accordance with the instructions provided by the importer.</p>

<h3>Indirect Representation:</h3>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as an âindirectâ representative in his/ her own name, but on behalf of another person, both parties accept joint liability for all data transmitted under the user identity. A representative or agent failing to state the level of representation on the electronic declaration will be deemed to be acting in his/ her own name and on his/ her own behalf.</p>

<p>In this example, the representativeâs details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/17 or 3/18 (declarantâs identity). The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Indirect, code â3â.</p>

<p>Indirect representation and sub-agents:</p>

<p>Where a representative/ agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub-agent, in an âindirectâ capacity on behalf of the first agent (but using the sub-agentâs user identity as the authentication credential), then the sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/17 or 3/18 (declarantâs identity).</p>

<p>The representative, originally contracted to complete the customs declaration and formalities on behalf of the importer must be declared as the Representative on the declaration and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/19 or 3/20 (representativeâs identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the representative and the importer, not the sub-agent and any other party.</p>

<p>The Representative retains joint and several liability with the importer for the customs debt.</p>

<h3>Declaration Category H7:</h3>

<p>Each H7 Customs Declaration may only be submitted for a single goods item, therefore this must always be completed with a value of â1â. This does not prevent Grouping from being used. Information on Grouping can be found in Additional Procedure Code <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 F47.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter the total number of items declared on the customs declaration. The number of items must correspond to the total number of âdescription of goodsâ (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/8) completed.</p>

<p>The maximum number of items that is to be entered is 999. If there are more than 999 items, then further declarations must be submitted for the balance of the items.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>If a declaration is amended and a goods item is removed, the âtotal number of itemsâ data element must be amended to declare the new total.</p>

<p>For example, if on a 12-item declaration, item number 11 is removed in an amendment, then the total number of items must be updated to declare 11. However, as explained under <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/6 item 12 must not be re-numbered.</p>

<p>For paper declarations: Any description of goods data elements on the declaration continuation sheets which are not used must be crossed through.</p>

<p>Declaration Category <abbr title="Import simplified declaration B&amp;E (on an occasional basis)">I1 B&amp;E</abbr> data sets may only be used where expressly permitted by both the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 procedure code and the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code completion notes.</p>

<p>If:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 procedure code permits the use of B&amp;E data sets but</li>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 2: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes</a> for details.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter the appropriate (4-digit) Procedure Code from those detailed in Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes. Use the Procedure Code index list and their completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>The 4-digit Procedure Code is made up using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first and second digits which indicate the Requested Procedure: the customs procedure to which the goods are being entered.</li>
  <li>The third and fourth digits which indicate the Previous Procedure: the customs procedure from which the goods are being removed. 00 as the third and fourth digits indicate that the goods have not been subject to any previous procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of a Procedure Code in this data element constitutes a formal declaration that the conditions of the relevant regulations (including but not restricted to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Council Regulation (EU) 952/2013</li>
  <li>Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 and</li>
  <li>Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447</li>
</ul>

<p>Will be complied with and binds the legal declarant accordingly.</p>

<p>The use of a Procedure Code is an undertaking by the importer/representative to pay to the Commissioners of HMRC immediately, on demand, any duties or other charges due in respect of the goods in question if the conditions of the specific procedure are not met.</p>

<p>Representatives/ Agents must have prior written approval from the legal declarant (holder of the procedure) to enter goods to a specific procedure on their behalf and must ensure a copy of the declaration is returned to the holder of the procedure.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Procedure Codes may only be declared with the relevant Declaration Category, as defined in the table below. Procedure Codes used on a customs declaration must all be from the same Declaration Category, for example a Procedure Code from <abbr title="Special procedure: storage (customs warehousing)">H2</abbr> may not be combined with a Procedure Code from <abbr title="Special procedure: processing (inward processing)">H4</abbr> on the same customs declaration.</p>
