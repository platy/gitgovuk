<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Import simplified declaration C&amp;F (with regular use)">I1 C&amp;F</abbr>:</h3>

<p>This Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) is required on a simplified declaration in all instances where controlled goods are being entered on a simplified declaration.</p>

<p>Net mass is not required for non-controlled goods unless they are being released as part of a bulk consignment.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter, up to 6 decimal places, the net mass in kilograms of the goods described in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/8 (Description of Goods). The net mass is the weight of the goods themselves without any packaging.</p>

<p>Where a net mass greater than 1 kg includes a fraction of a unit (kg), it may be rounded off in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From 0.001 to 0.499: rounding down to the nearest kg,</li>
  <li>From 0.5 to 0.999: rounding up to the nearest kg.</li>
</ul>

<p>A net mass of less than 1 kg should be entered as ‘0’ followed by a number of decimals up to 6, discarding all ‘0’ at the end of the quantity (for example, 0.123 for a package of 123 grams, 0.00304 for a package of 3 grams and 40 milligrams or 0.000654 for a package of 654 milligrams).</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The net mass is the weight of the goods themselves without any packaging.</p>

<p>“Packaging” means materials and components used in any packaging operation to wrap, contain and protect articles or substances during transport. The various kinds of packages whose weight is not included in the net mass (based on the fact that they are used only for transport).</p>

<p>The term “package” includes all articles used and, in particular, holders used as external or internal coverings for goods, holders on which goods are rolled, wound or attached, containers (other than those defined in international conventions) and receptacles. The term excludes means of transport and articles of transport equipment such as pallets and freight containers.</p>

<p>Any decimal places declared (up to a maximum of 6 places) must be deducted from the total number of characters used in the data element.  For example, if 3 decimal places are used, then only 13 whole numbers may be used in front of the decimal place.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Controlled goods are being entered on a simplified declaration or</li>
  <li>A claim to a tariff quota is being made on the simplified declaration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>This data element is only required where the commodity code requires a supplementary unit. In the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/find_commodity" rel="external">UK Integrated Online Tariff</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/find_commodity" rel="external">Northern Ireland Online Tariff</a>, a supplementary units indicator is shown in the ‘Value’ column (column 3), enter the quantity in terms of the unit specified, up to 6 decimal places (if needed).</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter the gross mass, expressed in kilograms, for the specific item declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/8 Description of Goods.</p>

<p>When the weight of the pallets is included in the transport documents, the weight of the pallets shall also be included in the calculation of the gross mass, except for the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The pallet forms a separate item on the customs declaration</li>
  <li>The import licence is based on the gross weight of the goods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The gross mass is the total weight of the goods and packaging but excluding containers and any other transport equipment.</p>

<p>Where a gross mass greater than 1 kg includes a fraction of a unit (kg), it may be rounded off in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From 0.001 to 0.499: rounding down to the nearest kg,</li>

<h3>Declaration Category I1C&amp;F:</h3>

<p>Enter a description of the goods which is specific enough to allow the unambiguous identification, classification and examination of goods.</p>

<p>The description has to be specific enough to support a debt to be raised in the event a supplementary declaration is not provided in conjunction with other data in the simplified declaration and the commercial records.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>For goods removed from a customs warehouse or an excise warehouse:</p>

<p>The relevant stock numbers must be included as part of the plain language description of the goods.</p>

<p>For excise goods:</p>

<p>A full description of the goods including the volume, brand name, container sizes and strength etc. must always be provided, for example 1000 c/s Old St Andrews golf ball whisky miniatures 12×5cl at 40%, rot 232/02.</p>

<p>Grouping:</p>

<p>Where goods are grouped under a single commodity code, the word grouping should be added to the goods description under <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/8 and F47 must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>In all cases, the use of general terms (for instance, ‘consolidated’, ‘general cargo’, ‘parts’ or ‘freight of all kinds’) or not sufficiently precise description cannot be accepted.</p>

<p>A non-exhaustive list of such general terms and descriptions which are not acceptable is published by the Commission and may be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/customs/customs_code/guidance_acceptable_goods_description_en.pdf" rel="external">found here</a>.</p>

<p>The goods described in this data element must all be subject to the same Binding Tariff Information Reference Number if held for the goods commodity code.</p>

<p>Where the commodity code to be used depends on size, weight or other physical criteria, the description should include that information.</p>

<p>If the goods described under each item do not comprise the whole contents of a package, container or trailer this should be made clear by adding the words ‘part case’, ‘part container’, ‘part trailer’ at the end of the description of the goods.</p>

<p>A description of the goods sufficiently precise enough to allow classification does not mean copying out the full description as set out in the tariff.</p>

<p>For example, ‘magnesium potassium sulphate’ (heading 3104 commodity code 310490000) should be described in those terms and not as ‘other mineral or chemical fertilisers, potassic’.</p>

<p>When the declarant provides the Customs Union and Statistics (<abbr title="Customs Union and Statistics">CUS</abbr>) code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/13) for chemical substances and preparations, a precise description of the goods may be waived.</p>

<p>Where the goods are subject to different duty or VAT rates (for example mixtures of red and white wine or children and adults clothing) the lowest divisible level of packaging must be declared in order to aid identification. Thus, bottles, wrapping or other packaging will be more appropriate in these examples.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>For beer, the packaging might be the crate or carton and not the bottle in which the beer is contained, if the crate is the smallest external package type used.</p>

<p>If the goods are contained immediately within cartons contained on a pallet (for example, books), the pallet should be declared.</p>

<p>For a single consignment in one or a number of containers, the containers themselves can be deemed to be the outer packaging. If the goods are declared as packaged in containers, then the following details should be declared:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Package Type Code (in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/9 Package Type): CN</li>
  <li>Quantity (in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/10 (Number of packages) Number of Containers</li>
  <li>Marks (in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/11 Shipping Marks): Container numbers</li>
  <li>Container numbers (in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/10) Container Identification numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>In effect, in this example, the container number(s) will be the marks and need only be entered as container details but with reference to this entered in the shipping marks data element, for example ‘Package type CN — see container id details entered’.</p>

<h3>Declaration Category H7:</h3>

<p>This information is optional for postal consignments.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter the number of packages making up the consignment covered by the declaration, based on the smallest external packing unit.</p>

<p>This is the number of individual items packaged in such a way that they cannot be divided without first undoing the packing, or the number of pieces, if unpackaged.</p>

<p>If the goods are packaged in several packages of different type, the data element can be repeated up to 99 times for a single goods item.</p>

<p>For unpackaged goods (non-bulk items):</p>

<p>Enter the number of pieces.</p>

<h4>Bulk Traffic:</h4>

<p>The number of packages associated with each bulked goods item should be determined using the examples below.</p>

<table>

      <td>enter the number of separately (packaged) units for example, number of timber bundles or number of cars</td>
      <td>Bundles of Timber/ cars, mail bags</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For bulk traffic, enter ‘Loose Bulk’ or ‘Break Bulk’ in the shipping marks data element.</p>

<h4>Combined Packaging:</h4>

<p>If goods are packaged in such a way that goods belonging to more than one goods item are packaged together, then the actual number of these packages is entered on the first goods item and for the other goods items, the number of packages declared should be ‘0’.</p>

<p>For items which are packaged together the details entered (for each item) in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/9 (packaging type code) and</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/11 (shipping marks)</li>
</ul>

<p>Must be identical for each item.</p>

<p>For example: item 1 and item 5 on the customs entry are packaged in a single carton:</p>

<ul>
  <li>item 1 <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/9 CT (Carton) and item 5 <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/9 CT (Carton)</li>
  <li>item 1 <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/11 KEAX123456 and item 5 <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/11 KEAX123456</li>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter a free text description of any marks and numbers on transport units or packages.</p>

<p>Where there is one common identifying number for all of the packaging then only this number need be entered.</p>

<p>For unpackaged goods, enter ‘Unpackaged’.</p>

<p>Where goods are containerised, the container number can replace the shipping marks.  It, can be used as the reference number in both <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/11 (Shipping Marks) and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/10 (Container Identification Number).</p>

<h4>Bulk Traffic:</h4>

<p>For bulk traffic, enter ‘Loose Bulk’ or ‘Break Bulk’ in the shipping marks data element.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This data element may be used up to 99 times at item level.</p>

<p>A UCR or references used in the transport document (which allow the unambiguous identification of all packages in the consignment) may also be used instead of the shipping marks.</p>

<p>If there is insufficient space to record all the information, create another set of package details with the same kind of packages type code.</p>

<h4>General Commodity Code Notes</h4>

<p>The use of a commodity code constitutes a legal declaration as to the nature and duty liability for the goods and is a core determinant of the import formalities and commercial policy measures to which the goods will be subjected.</p>

<p>Failure to declare the correct commodity code may render the legal declarant liable to penalties or other sanctions under the applicable legislation.</p>

<p>You can find information on and guidance on selecting the correct commodity codes in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/find_commodity" rel="external">UK Integrated Online Tariff</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/find_commodity" rel="external">Northern Ireland Online Tariff</a>. The length of the codes varies according to the nature of the goods, and whether or not they are subject to any Tariff measure requirements.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/find_commodity" rel="external">UK Integrated Online Tariff</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/find_commodity" rel="external">Northern Ireland Online Tariff</a> will identify any specific measures and document codes which may be required by the specific commodity code declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/14 — 6/17.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>, with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/find_commodity" rel="external">UK Integrated Online Tariff</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/find_commodity" rel="external">Northern Ireland Online Tariff</a>, should be used to identify any specific documents, licences, certificates or authorisations that need to be declared to place the goods to their intended use or enter them to the customs territory of the EU. Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a> for the specific completion requirements for any document codes which may be required by the commodity code.</p>

<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Import simplified declaration C&amp;F (with regular use)">I1 C&amp;F</abbr>:</h3>

<p>This data element is only required on a simplified declaration where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Controlled goods are being entered on a simplified declaration or</li>
  <li>A claim to a tariff quota is being made on the simplified declaration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Special procedure: storage (customs warehousing)">H2</abbr>:</h3>

<p>This data element is only mandatory in specific circumstances, as stipulated in the authorisation for the procedure.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter any National Additional Code for the goods being declared as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-additional-codes-to-declare-with-data-element-617-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 19: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17: National Additional Codes</a>. If no National Additional Code is required, leave this data element blank.</p>

<p>Where a commodity attracts a zero or reduced rate of VAT, codes ‘VATZ’ or ‘VATR’ must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Up to 99 National Additional Codes may be entered at item level.</p>

<p>The National Additional Codes will be used, in conjunction with information provided elsewhere in the declaration, to calculate the duties and taxes applicable. The codes declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 will also be used to indicate any exemptions or reduced rates of taxes which may be applicable for national taxes and other charges.</p>

<p>Where the goods require a VAT National Additional Code, only one VAT code may be declared for a single goods item.</p>

<p>Where the goods are being grouped under a single commodity code using Article 177 of the Code, the National Additional Code that attracts the highest rate for the type of tax must be declared.</p>

<p>The conditions of grouping as set out in Appendix 4 for the Additional Information (<abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr>) code must be met in order to use this simplification.  Additional Information Code 00600 must be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 where grouping is used.</p>

<p>The declaration of an additional code for an exemption or reduction in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 constitutes a legal declaration that the claimant is eligible for the relief or exemption.  An incorrect claim to an exemption or reduced rate may render the legal declarant liable to a demand for the relieved revenue and other sanctions or penalties under the applicable legislation.</p>

<p>You can find information on and guidance on selecting the correct commodity codes in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/find_commodity" rel="external">UK Integrated Online Tariff</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/find_commodity" rel="external">Northern Ireland Online Tariff</a>. The length of the codes varies according to the nature of the goods, and whether or not they are subject to any Tariff measure requirements.</p>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 codes must not be used to claim exemptions or reductions from taxes that are related to the customs procedure.  Where the relief or exemption relates to the customs procedure, these must be claimed through the use of appropriate Procedure and Additional Procedure Codes being declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 and 1/11.</p>

<p>Procedure Codes and Additional Procedure Codes (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 and 1/11) must not be used to claim relief or exemptions from taxes and duties that are based on national Tariff measures.  These must be claimed using the appropriate codes associated with the commodity in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17.</p>
