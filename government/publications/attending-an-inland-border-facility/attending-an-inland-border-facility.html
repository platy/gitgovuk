<h2>Before you go to an inland border facility (<abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr>)</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/attending-an-inland-border-facility">Check what services are offered</a> at each of our inland border facilities, not all inland border facilities carry out the same functions.</p>

<li>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tell-hmrc-that-youre-going-to-be-attending-an-inland-border-facility">Book in to attend an IBF</a>. Booking in will mean we should be able to deal with you more quickly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Traders using an Authorised Consignor or Consignee (ACC) do not need to attend an inland border facility. ACCs can start and end transit movement of goods at their own premises.</p>
</div>

<p>You only need to attend an inland border facility if you’re arriving at the Port of Dover, Eurotunnel or Holyhead and you’re moving goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under the Common Transit Convention and you’re not using the services of an <abbr title="Authorised Consignor or Consignee">ACC</abbr> to start or end your Transit movements</li>
  <li>into the country under the Common Transit Convention and you’ve been instructed to report to a site for those goods to be checked</li>
  <li>excluding live animals, using an <abbr title="Admission Temporaire or Temporary Admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet</li>
  <li>excluding live animals, covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<abbr title="the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">CITES</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>When you may need to attend an inland border facility</h3>

<p>You must follow instructions about whether you need to get your goods checked by customs on arrival or if you’re able to continue your journey.</p>

<p>You should use your goods movement reference number in the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/driver-inspection-notification/start" rel="external">check if you need to report for an inspection</a>’ service to understand if your goods are held. If you’re arriving into the Port of Dover, Eurotunnel or Holyhead, you’ll need to attend an inland border facility to have these checks carried out.</p>

<p>In some cases you may also be stopped by Border Force officers within the port to have checks performed on your vehicle or load. If this happens, you must still attend an inland border facility to complete 
customs functions if you have received instructions to do so.</p>

<p>The goods must be taken to an inland border facility directly and must arrive in the same condition as the goods were at the time of importation.</p>

<p>You may be liable to a penalty of up to £2,500 if you fail to follow HMRC instructions.</p>

<h3>When you do not need to come to an inland border facility</h3>

<p>You do not need to come to an inland border facility if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a vehicle that is empty</li>
  <li>are travelling in and out of the UK by other ports</li>
  <li>are using the services of an Authorised Consignor or Consignee (<abbr title="Authorised Consignor or Consignee">ACC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>are using other (non-Common Transit Convention) import or export procedures to move your goods in or out of the UK</li>
  <li>are transporting live animals, except <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> prioritised goods</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get ‘border ready’</h3>

<h4>Get ready before you reach Kent</h4>

<p>You must be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-hgv-border?utm_campaign=transition_p4&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=seg&amp;utm_content=ukb_hauluk__act3&amp;gclid=CO77m_6hre4CFUOiGwod2McNOg">‘border ready’</a> before you reach Kent ports or you’ll be turned back and could be fined.</p>

<p>If you’re crossing the Channel through the Eurotunnel or the Port of Dover, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-hgv-border?utm_campaign=transition_p4&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=seg&amp;utm_content=ukb_hauluk__act3&amp;gclid=CO77m_6hre4CFUOiGwod2McNOg">check a heavy goods vehicle (<abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr>) is ready to cross the border</a>.</p>

<h4>For outbound movements leaving the UK through the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel</h4>

<p>If you need to use an inland border facility and are coming to Kent from elsewhere, you should get ready before arriving in Kent. Do not wait until you’ve reached the port in Kent or you will be turned back.</p>

<p>To get ready you should either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attend an inland border facility at Birmingham or Warrington to carry out certain customs procedures before you reach Kent</li>
  <li>attend an inland border facility at North Weald or Ebbsfleet to carry out limited customs procedures</li>
</ul>

<h4>Holyhead</h4>

<p>Get ready before you travel to Holyhead. If your journey allows, you can also make use of the services at Warrington or Birmingham inland border facilities before you arrive at Holyhead.</p>

<p>Check for more information on getting ready for Welsh ports on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/preparing-wales-brexit/transport" rel="external">Gov.wales website</a>.</p>

<h2>Documents you’ll need to bring</h2>

<p>You’ll need all relevant paperwork in relation to your movement.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr> movements</h3>

<p>To start a movement, you’ll need to get the Local Reference Number (<abbr title="Local Reference Number">LRN</abbr>) from your agent or freight forwarder for every consignment, and provide the <abbr title="Local Reference Numbers">LRNs</abbr> at the Office of Departure to get a Transit Accompanying Document (<abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr>).</p>

<p>To end a movement at an Office of Destination, you’ll need to present the <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> and provide the Movement Reference Number (MRN) for every consignment.</p>

<p>If you’re a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>trader using an Office of Destination at an Inland Border Facility you should make sure that import entries are submitted and have arrived by the time the goods reach the Office of Destination</li>
  <li>driver attending an Office of Destination you should have details of the customs entries for the consignments you’re carrying (for example, entry numbers and dates)</li>
</ul>

<p>Goods without arrived import entries will need temporary storage.</p>

<p>If you’re a driver attending an Inland Border Facility with goods that need temporary storage you may have to use an alternative facility at your own expense.</p>

<p>Inland Border Facilities cannot be used for commercial storage.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Admission Temporaire or Temporary Admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet movements</h3>

<p>For both inbound and outbound movements, you’ll need to present the <abbr title="Admission Temporaire or Temporary Admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet documents for each consignment.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">CITES</abbr> movements</h3>

<p>For both inbound and outbound movements, you’ll need to present a <abbr title="the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">CITES</abbr> permit for each consignment.</p>

<h3>Stop 24 and Dover Western Docks</h3>

<p>There is some limited government-provided Office of Destination capacity at the offices of Dover Western Docks and Stop 24 for those who need to use an inland border facility.</p>

<p>Transit movements entering the UK at the Port of Dover should complete Office of Destination at Dover Western Docks.</p>

<p>Transit movements entering the UK using the Eurotunnel should complete Office of Destination at Stop 24.</p>

<p>This is in addition to existing commercial operations already provided at these sites.</p>

<h2>Tell HMRC that you’re going to be attending an inland border facility</h2>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tell-hmrc-that-youre-going-to-be-attending-an-inland-border-facility">tell HMRC in advance that you’re attending an inland border facility</a> if the goods you’re moving:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are going to an office of departure or office of destination (starting or ending a transit movement)</li>
  <li>are covered by an <abbr title="Admission Temporaire or Temporary Admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet</li>
  <li>need a <abbr title="the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">CITES</abbr> permit</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of why you attend the site, if your goods have been flagged as ‘held’ for a compliance check, you must let front office staff know about this upon your arrival.</p>

<p>You can also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-there-are-any-delays-at-an-inland-border-facility">check if there are any delays at an inland border facility</a>.</p>

<h2>What to expect when visiting an inland border facility</h2>

<p>There will be local signage in place to help direct you to the site along the strategic main roads.</p>

<p>Upon arrival at the site, you’ll be greeted by a traffic management marshal.</p>

<p>There will be automatic number plate recognition cameras at the entry and exit points of the site. This monitors vehicles entering and exiting the site to manage traffic and security.</p>

<p>A quick visual inspection of the vehicle will be done by security marshals at the entry check point. For example, they’ll check that there are no leaks and that the vehicle is not prohibited as a result of these checks.</p>

<p>Following this, you’ll be directed to a vacant parking bay. Once you’ve parked your vehicle, you’ll be asked to switch your engine off by the traffic marshal and to keep it off whilst you’re parked. There should be no idling of engines.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If your goods have been flagged as ‘held’ for a compliance check, you must tell front office staff this when you arrive.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll then take your documents to the front office and be directed to wait in your vehicle while the paperwork is processed. Once this is complete, you’ll receive either an approval and exit receipt to move off site, or a non approval where you will follow a separate process.</p>

<p>You’ll then be able to exit the site and re-join the strategic main road.</p>

<h3>If your vehicle is excluded</h3>

<p>It’s possible that vehicles may arrive at the site which are classed as ‘excluded’ from the requirement to park on the site. This is based on things like load content, vehicle size and the presence of hazardous goods. If there are any issues, your vehicle will be moved to the marshal inspection bays for further examination by a senior security marshal.</p>

<p>Vehicles are excluded if they contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>livestock and other live loads (exemptions to this apply on sites that process <abbr title="the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">CITES</abbr> movements)</li>
  <li>any vehicle transporting abnormal loads, which are:
    <ul>
      <li>a weight of more than 44,000 kilograms (kg)</li>
      <li>an axle load of more than 10,000kg for a single non-driving axle and 11,500kg for a single driving axle</li>
      <li>a width of more than 2.9 metres (m)</li>
      <li>a rigid length of more than 18.65m</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the following hazardous goods:
    <ul>
      <li>class 1 substances and articles (explosives) and class 4.1 substances (polymerizing substances)</li>
      <li>category I or II nuclear material</li>
      <li>high consequence dangerous goods</li>
      <li>class 6.1 substances (insecticides)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>vehicles subject to Special Types General Order (STGO) 2003</li>
</ul>

<h3>Duration of the checks</h3>

<p>We estimate that you will need between 1 to 2 hours at the facility to go through customs clearance. Make sure you leave sufficient time when planning your journey.</p>

<p>The sites are manned and operated 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.</p>

<p>Once you’ve completed the paperwork process, you can return to your vehicle and you should leave immediately.</p>

<h3>Facilities available on sites</h3>

<p>All sites will provide water, toilets, and handwashing facilities. Additional facilities are offered on a site-by-site basis as outlined in each site-specific section. Cookers and fires are not permitted on-site.</p>

<h3>Coronavirus secure measures</h3>

<p>The inland border facilities comply with current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">coronavirus (COVID-19) government guidance</a>.</p>
