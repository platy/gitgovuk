              <p class="app-c-published-dates__change-note">The methodology has been updated to include details of the new breakdowns in this week’s release. These include pillar 1 turnaround times, the number of household close contacts, and the time taken for contacts to be reached from the time that the positive case that referred them is transferred to the contact-tracing system. Also included are more details about what a close contact is and how these figures can be used.</p>
