<p>By viewing and using this service, you agree to these Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>Agreement to terms</h2>

<p>Welcome to the NHS COVID-19 app (the ‘app’) and the supporting website (GOV.UK) (together, the ‘service’), an iOS and Android application and website. The Department of Health and Social Care (‘DHSC’, ‘we’, ‘our’) is the legal manufacturer. The app supports the NHS Test, Trace, Protect service in Wales and the NHS Test and Trace service in England and will provide you with the appropriate advice.</p>

<p>We are now working with partner health services that provide digital contact tracing apps in Gibraltar, Jersey, Northern Ireland and Scotland. We all use the Apple and Google functionality to support digital contact.</p>

<p>These terms apply to the entire contents of the service, to any web feeds produced by the service, any interactions you may have with the service, and to any feedback or submissions provided back to the service. By downloading, viewing or using the service, you will be deemed to agree to these Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The app is designed to help the people of England and Wales (including visitors) stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). It does this by enabling people to inform others, who they have been in close contact with, that they have tested positive.</p>

<p>Any notifications provided through the app are advisory only. If you have concerns about the app’s advice including whether to self-isolate or seek a test, you are advised to contact NHS 111, NHS 119 or an appropriate health care professional who will be able to provide you with the appropriate information.</p>

<p>Other guidance about COVID-19 is available from the NHS in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/" rel="external">England</a> and in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://111.wales.nhs.uk/encyclopaedia/c/article/coronavirus(covid19)/" rel="external">Wales</a>.</p>

<p>Users will be supporting the public health response to the pandemic, as well as ensuring the app is working as expected, by sharing information (on an anonymous basis) with both England and Wales’ respective contact tracing programmes.</p>

<p>By using the app and sharing this information, you will be making an important contribution to helping your community stay healthy and save lives.</p>

<p>The app is UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) marked as a Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended).</p>

<p>The service is only for the purposes as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-app-privacy-information">Privacy notice</a>.</p>

<p>Your use of this app is governed by the laws of England and Wales.</p>

<h2>Working with partner health services</h2>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19 and give permission to alert other app users, we will work with partner health services to ensure all relevant app users receive an alert.</p>

<p>By using the Apple and Google functionality, we ensure that your identity is anonymous to other app users, partner health services, and the government.</p>

<p>Our partners are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gibraltar</li>
  <li>Jersey</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Scotland</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functions of the app</h2>

<p>The app has the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exposure alert, which lets you know if you have been near another app user who tests positive for COVID-19</li>
  <li>the option to share information (anonymously) about any positive COVID-19 diagnosis you might receive, allowing other app users to know they may have been near another app user who tests positive for COVID-19</li>
  <li>real time information about COVID-19 risk in your local area
    <ul>
      <li>including signposting to services and information for your area – these services and information are outside of the scope of the Terms of Use for the NHS COVID-19 app and are subject to their own terms and conditions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a symptom checker to see if you may have COVID-19, which is reviewed and updated in line with the latest public health advice</li>
  <li>a link to the relevant website, to order a COVID-19 test if appropriate</li>
  <li>a countdown to help you protect others by either self-isolating or being careful who you are in contact with</li>
  <li>the ability to enter, if required: your vaccine status, age (if under 18), whether you are medically exempt from COVID-19 vaccination, or that you are a participant in a COVID-19 vaccination trial – to update the advice you receive depending on your circumstances</li>
  <li>a trigger to explore whether the user is eligible for financial support for app users in Wales via the Self-Isolation Support Scheme (SISS)</li>
  <li>anonymised information sharing to help manage and respond to the public health emergency</li>
  <li>the ability to set reminders for certain functions and to provide additional reminders, in the app, for key functions such as contact tracing</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note: we do not take any steps to verify the age or vaccine status information you input into the app. You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide, and the advice provided by the app will be updated in line with your declaration.</p>
</div>

<p>The app should not impact on the normal operation of your phone.</p>

<p>The app provides links to external websites determined by the postcode district you enter. Links for both Welsh and English postcode districts are provided for by respective contact tracing programmes.</p>

<h2>Advice</h2>

<p>Please use the pause functionality, which pauses contact tracing, when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are fully protected from customers and colleagues by a physical barrier, such as a Perspex screen</li>
  <li>all healthcare workers should pause the app whilst they are working in healthcare buildings, including hospitals and GP surgeries</li>
  <li>you are a worker in health and social care and are wearing medical grade personal protective equipment (PPE) such as a surgical mask</li>
  <li>your phone is placed in a locker or equivalent</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to resume (un-pause) contact tracing when these no longer apply. The app allows you to set a timer and reminder. The app will provide an additional reminder on the following day.</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>This app may cause interference with Bluetooth-enabled medical devices.</p>

<p>Speak to a healthcare professional or seek advice from your device manufacturer for more information if you are concerned about the risk of interference with Bluetooth-enabled medical devices.</p>

<p>Details of the current version of the app can be found in the ‘About this app’ section within the app.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-app-privacy-information">Privacy notice</a> for further information about how the app processes personal data and respects your rights of privacy and confidentiality under data protection laws.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>We disclaim and exclude all liability to the maximum extent allowed by law for any claim, loss, demand or damages of any kind whatsoever (including for our negligence) arising out of or in connection with the use of either the service or the information, content or materials included on the service or on any website the service links to. Information held by the service is as provided by the user, and we take no responsibility for its accuracy.</p>

<h2>Continuity of service</h2>

<p>We make no warranty or representation, express or implied, as to continuity of service and to the fullest extent permitted by law, any implied warranties in respect of the service are hereby excluded. We reserve the right to suspend, terminate or otherwise alter access to some or all of the services at any time and without notice.</p>

<h2>Revisions to these Terms of Use</h2>

<p>We may revise these Terms of Use at any time and your continued use of the service will be deemed acceptance of such revised Terms of Use.</p>

<p>The venue check-in, venue alerts functions and link to claim Isolation Support Payment (for England) were decommissioned in February 2022.</p>

<p>Any such revisions take effect when this page is published.</p>
