<h2>The NHS COVID-19 app (updated December 2020): data protection impact assessment</h2>

<h2>The app and app user in context</h2>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is the data controller for several services provided to members of the public (data subjects). DHSC is responsible for taking steps to protect the privacy of individuals, to reduce their identifiability and to ensure that processing is proportionate, and that safeguards are in place. For example, as service users pass through systems, this means ensuring that only the minimum amount of data necessary is shared between services and data sets are held separately.</p>

<p>In the context of a pandemic (a public health emergency), data sharing between services is necessary to support the management of communicable diseases and for the protection of the public. This includes monitoring the effectiveness of services and their impacts on different communities.</p>

<p>This DPIA is updated to reflect new functionality introduced to the NHS COVID-19 App (the “app”) which supports the NHS Test, Trace and Protection service in Wales and the NHS Test and Trace service in England. You can find a summary of these changes in the section <a href="#updates" class="govuk-link">Update to the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for the NHS COVID-19 App</a>.</p>

<p>This DPIA is updated to reflect new functionality introduced to the NHS COVID-19 App (the “app”) which supports the NHS Test, Trace and Protection service in Wales and the NHS Test and Trace service in England.</p>

<p>More information our work with health services in Gibraltar, Jersey, Northern Ireland and Scotland can be found in the section <a href="#interoperability" class="govuk-link">working together</a>.</p>

<h3>The app user (the app data ecosystem)</h3>

<p>The use of data collected from app users is subject to the controls and oversight detailed in this DPIA and associated privacy notice.</p>

<p>The law requires a clear commitment from the Department of Health and Social Care to maintain the user’s privacy and protect their identity from other app users and the government. The user journey and data flows are shown in diagrams throughout this document. More detail is provided within the <a href="#appendices" class="govuk-link">appendices</a> and annexes of this document.</p>

<p>Any change to the data requested will be reviewed, will be lawful, and will be available as an additional choice by the user. Please note that any future changes beyond the scope of the current version of the app will be reflected and updated in this data protection impact assessment (DPIA).</p>

<p>Data generated and collected by the app is held in 3 environments. Systems are in place which support the secure and appropriate flow of data between these environments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>app users’ phone – the NHS COVID-19 App and the majority of data collected by the Apple/Google API will be always (and only) held on the app user’s phone. This is considered a user-held record. For most functionality, data is presented to the user’s phone and is checked against the data held on the phone (for example, visited venue QR codes that could be considered at risk or other users that should be considered at risk)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>product environment – certain data items are collected from user devices (via an API) to allow core features of the app to work and be managed effectively. This data collection includes details of the phone type and operating system and the user provided area information (postcode district and local authority). These items are described in the data dictionary set out in <a href="#appendix1" class="govuk-link">appendix 1 of this document</a>. Within the product environment service performance dashboards are provided to support the oversight and management of the app and associated services. Data and access is kept within the control of the DHSC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analytical environment – derived data from the app will flow to the analytical environment to support learning about the app and COVID-19. All data held in the analytical environment is subject to strict de-identification controls to ensure datasets are de-identified and aggregated.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Virology testing</h3>

<p>App users who enter symptoms and are recommended to seek a COVID-19 virology (antigen or swab  test can generate a reference code (“test code”) unique to themselves and to the particular occasion on which they seek a test. The test code gives the user access to the virology testing website where they can book a test. The functionality of the app will ensure that the test code is transferred to the website. In order for a test to be booked and the results sent to the correct individual, the website requests additional data from the user.</p>

<p>The test result and code are used to feed results back to the app. This will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>update the user’s COVID-19 status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add the relevant code to the list of “at risk” individuals presented to app users’ phones (triggering an update in the status of app users if their “Exposure Log” includes the protected identification code of the individual)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Further use of the data collected as part of the testing process is governed by the terms of use, privacy notice and DPIA of the website the user will be transferred to.</p>

<p>As noted in the update to this DPIA, new functionality allows the user to add a test result into the app without a test code generated from within the app.</p>

<h3>Venue (QR) alerting system</h3>

<p>Venue alert data is presented as a list of “at risk” QR codes (protected to obscure the location) sent out by the system to the app. This data triggers the alert functionality within the app.</p>

<p>Using QR codes to check in at venues is a more robust privacy preserving mechanism for the user than manually signing-in with a pen and paper.</p>

<p>This function does not relate directly to the data processed within the app.</p>

<p>To enable users to put this function in context, we set out below how the QR check in function works for venues, and how the process functions end to end below.</p>

<h4>Creating a QR poster</h4>

<p>Venues are able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">create a NHS Test and Trace QR code by using the GOV service available</a>. The QR generator resides in a sub AWS account of the NHSX domain, distinct from the app.</p>

<p>They will need to provide the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an email address – used to send a 6-digit verification code, required to continue the QR generation process.</li>
  <li>name – used to personalise the email sent with the link to the poster.</li>
  <li>type of venue – denotes the type of venue which his included as QR codes are not mandatory in all venues.</li>
  <li>venue name – this is displayed on the poster.</li>
  <li>address – displayed on the poster.</li>
  <li>contact email address and phone number for responsible person – used in case of need to contact venue.</li>
</ul>

<p>An official T&amp;T QR poster will be generated and emailed to the recipient, to be displayed at their venue.</p>

<h4>Checking in</h4>

<p>An app user is able to check in to a venue by scanning the QR code using the NHS COVID-19 App. When they check in, the venue name, date and time is shown to the user so they can verify the details (and cancel if necessary). The venue name, unique poster ID, date and time are stored on their device for up to 21 days, and this list is visible to the user. The user is able to delete any entries from this list.</p>

<p>If a user scans a third-party QR instead of the official COVID-19 the app will immediately alert the user, advising them the QR code is not recognised and it could be that they didn’t scan an official NHS QR code (or the code is damaged).</p>

<h4>Identification of outbreak at a venue</h4>

<p>Local Health Protection Teams (HPT) are responsible for local outbreak management. PHE consultants within the HPTs will investigate clusters to determine if there is an outbreak. They may receive information from a venue itself (reporting that staff/customers have tested positive), or through the Contact Tracing and Advice Service (CTAS) information which captures details provided voluntarily by persons who have tested positive, via a contact agent or an online webform. They use existing processes and log details in the HP Zone case management tool. This is outside of the scope of this DPIA.</p>

<h4>Triggering the notification in the app</h4>

<p>Secure two-factor authentication is used to access the Venue Risk Notification tool. This resides in the sub-AWS account in the NHSX domain, and provides a list of venues which have created a QR poster. In this system it is possible to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>search by Postcode or Poster ID and select a venue.</li>
  <li>once selected, a date/time from/to will be selected, depending on the assessment they have carried out</li>
</ul>

<p>When the venue is flagged in the Venue Risk Notification Tool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an API call is made into the app backend system.</li>
  <li>the app system sends the list of QR IDs into the app for all app users.</li>
  <li>the app will match against the user’s venue history, and if a match is identified it will trigger a notification to that user.</li>
  <li>the notification does not display the venue name</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contact tracing (national)</h3>

<p>No data from app users is passed to any of the national contract tracing systems in use. App users can choose to use the information held only on their phone to support the contact tracing process when interacting with the service. Data collection and use is governed by the DPIA and privacy notice alongside processes used by that service. No data is shared from the app.</p>

<p>An option being considered is to allow app users the choice to send data held on their phone to contact tracers. This is not currently available as a feature, but if adopted would allow the user to share details of the venues they have visited.</p>

<p>This option is subject to a change control review - including a review of the legality, proportionality and impacts upon privacy and identifiability.</p>

<h3>Contact tracing (local)</h3>

<p>The same conditions apply to any local contact tracing by local public health teams. The app user may use the data held only on their phone to assist themselves and the contact tracer, if they choose to.</p>

<h3>Update to the data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for the NHS COVID-19 app (December 2020)</h3>

<p>The DPIA is continually updated to reflect changes made to the NHS COVID-19 app and those changes that impact upon the service it provides. In line with GDPR and ICO best practice, the changes are reviewed as they are proposed. This ensures that they remain consistent with the obligation to app users, the law and support the purposes set out for the app.</p>

<p>The publication of this DPIA has occurred at the end of a series of small changes that contribute to the update of the app’s use of data required by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>changes to the Apple and Google digital contact tracing functionality (the GAEN)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alignment with wider government policy in providing advice relevant to the Local Authorities. This means app users now select their Local Authority based upon their postcode district</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>learning from the app’s initial months of use</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Relevant updates for app users to other services</h4>

<p>The app now offers support to app users seeking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://sip.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/help-support" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Test and Trace Support Payments (for app users in England)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">Self-isolation support scheme (SISS) (for app users in Wales)</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Outside of the app, the process that assesses whether a venue poses a risk of infection was improved and the administrative burden on Local Health Protection Teams reduced. The updated process does not result in any more data being processed by the app or change any processing.</p>

<h4>GAEN Mode 2 (updated digital contact tracing functionality)</h4>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 app utilises Apple and Google’s digital contact tracing functionality known as GAEN.</p>

<p>An explanation of the functionality of GAEN can be found in section on the GAEN which includes more detail about these changes, how they affect the app and its use of data.</p>

<p>Apple and Google set conditions for the use of their digital contact tracing technology (the “GAEN”) which ensure that app use is anonymous and the users’ privacy and identity protected. These standards, and the DHSC application of them, are maintained with these changes.</p>

<p>GAEN Mode 2 differs from the previous Mode 1 in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mode 1 – the existing “bucket” approach for capturing contact events. For example, it would classify distance of contacts into “buckets” defined as near, medium or far</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mode 2 – uses the measurements captured by the GAEN rather than these approximations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the update utilises an Exposure Window data set as part of calculating the risk of infection and whether an app user should be alerted as a result of a risky contact (and a high risk of infection)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>this Exposure Window is available for those providing COVID-19 apps, to support their analysis and public health purposes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crucial to the risk calculation is the infectiousness of the index case (the app user with COVID-19 who has updated their status and shared their Diagnosis Keys). This is calculated from the onset of symptoms data which accompanies the Diagnosis Keys when they are shared</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further uses of the Exposure Window data set are expected in due course and further details can be found in this DPIA</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This change reflects improvements to Google, Apple and our understanding of the Low Energy Bluetooth technology, COVID-19 and the public health emergency.</p>

<p>Detail on the algorithm and science behind these changes is available in the updated summary of the risk algorithm and within the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/updates-algorithm-underlying-nhs-covid-19-app" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Head of Data and Analytics for the app blog here</a></p>

<p>These changes impact upon both the data generated by GAEN and that which is utilised by the app for both Modes 1 and 2:</p>

<p>The changes required a review of the data used by the app, and in the analytical data set.</p>

<p>The data set is used to demonstrate that the app is working and contributes to the purposes set out in this DPIA:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In particular, the public health purposes of the app – breaking the transmission of the COVID-19 virus</li>
</ul>

<p>Crucially, this also allowed us to refine the approach based on the learning from app users, ongoing testing and the latest scientific advice.</p>

<p>More detail on these changes can be found in the updated section on Digital Contact Tracing and throughout this DPIA.</p>

<h4>Review of the Analytical Data Set</h4>

<p>The data items used within the app (as well as the analytical data set that supports it) have required an update due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ongoing learning from the working of the app</li>
  <li>the performance of technology</li>
  <li>updates from Apple and Google</li>
</ul>

<p>This review is ongoing and will look to conclude early in 2021. Depending on future developments in COVID-19, it may be necessary to review as a result of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>changes made by Apple and Google to their digital contact tracing technology and phone Operating Systems (iOS and Android)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>our improvements to the app, support for other functions and options for app users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what we learn about COVID-19 and the public health response</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Changes to the analytical data set for this update include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>updating the Test Result and Reason data set to count which testing journey is being used by app users</li>
  <li>updating the Isolation analytical data set to count the reason for any recommendation for any isolation</li>
  <li>update to provide a clearer service overview by counting the number of exposure notifications sent by app users</li>
</ul>

<p>All these changes must conform to the existing requirements of the app, the limitations of data and protections of app user’s privacy and identity. The data set includes only a count of most data items and only covers a 24-hour period. For more information, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix1">Appendix 1 (Data Dictionary)</a>.</p>

<h4>Addition of local authorities</h4>

<p>Government policy provides advice to the public on a Local Authority level. The NHS COVID-19 app is moving to align with this approach and will utilise both the user’s Postcode District and Local Authority to provide updates to the user:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>when entering their postcode district, app users will also be asked to select their relevant local authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the app will use this data to provide the latest information for that area, for example, an alert to a change in risk status</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In due course, the local authority data item will be added to the analytical data set, as part of wider alignment and consistency.</p>

<p>Processing both the Local Authority and Postcode District for a user increases the risk of reidentification. The processes used to reduce this risk can be found in the privacy issues identified and risk analysis(#riskregister).</p>

<h4>Users seeking Isolation Support Payment</h4>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 app will now allow app users to claim for a support payment if they receive advice to isolate based on interaction with an app user who subsequently confirms positive with COVID-19.</p>

<p>To make a claim, the app user will be prompted to leave the NHS COVID-19 app and enter a secure NHS portal where details about their claim will be captured.</p>

<p>Details about the terms and conditions, as well as the use of their data can be found in the <a href="https://contact-tracing.phe.gov.uk/help/privacy-notice" rel="external" class="govuk-link">portal and contact tracing privacy notice</a>.</p>

<p>The app will generate a validation token. This demonstrates that they have had a genuine alert from the app and are eligible to request a payment.</p>

<p>More information on how this token is generated and how the privacy and identity of the app user is protected within the app, can be found in the <a href="#isp" class="govuk-link">section ‘Isolation support payment’</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the token, the app provides the encounter date and end of isolation period date for the user – to ensure that any self-isolation is aligned with the Contact Tracing system (CTAS).</p>

<p>The app does not receive, utilise or retain any data about an app user’s self-isolation claim other than to validate the token provided.</p>

<h4>Points of clarification</h4>

<p>The intention to collect the analytical data set every 6-hours is not currently in place, and the data set continues to be collected daily. The DPIA is updated to reflect the daily data collection, the event analytical data set and the relevant risks were reviewed, see <a href="#riskregister" class="govuk-link">the risk register</a>.</p>

<h4>New functionality</h4>

<p>See above for the new functions that support the purposes of the app and the app user.</p>

<h4>Next steps for the app and the DPIA</h4>

<p>The DPIA for the app continues to be subject to routine review, as significant changes are identified the DPIA is updated. A new version of the DPIA will be published when major updates to the app are released.</p>

<h3>Apple and Google</h3>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 App is available through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Apple and Google provide the app independently of the NHS and Department of Health and Social Care.</p>

<p>For app user’s using older versions of the app, Apple and Google are responsible for exposure notification messages sent to users which are outside of the remit and control of the NHS and DHSC. In response to this notification, the NHS COVID-19 app provides a clarification message to explain the level of risk and actions recommended as a consequence.</p>

<p>We recommend routinely updating the app to ensure you have the latest functionality and best performance of the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>

<h2>The NHS Test and Trace app: data protection impact assessment</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 app (“app”) is a mobile phone application that is part of the NHS Test and Trace Service, which is designed to break the chains of transmission of COVID-19. By using the app, users will help to protect themselves and those around them – their friends, family, colleagues and local communities, and enable society to return to a more normal way of life. The app is a medical device providing maximum freedom at minimum risk.</p>

<p>The objectives of the app are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>create an enduring new medical technology to manage public health</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>promote behaviour change by helping people manage their risk exposure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify and inform people to help communities manage public health emergencies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reduce disease transmission by giving users easy access to health services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support and inform users during isolation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The behaviour sought by the app from users is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>download the app and use it daily</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep the app ‘on’ and carry their phone at all times</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>follow instructions issued by the app</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘pause’ the app when appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter symptoms and take a test quickly when told to</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>self-isolate (as we expect of everyone) if a user tests positive for COVID-19</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any “pause” of contact tracing needs to be resumed manually by the user. This is not an automated function.</p>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 App has 3 core roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>precision: to measure distance and time between app users accurately</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reach: to remember which other app users an app user has been near</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>speed: to initiate self-isolation quickly through contact detection of positive cases</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<figcaption><p>Figure 1: The 3 core roles</p></figcaption></figure>

<h2>The data controller</h2>

<p>On behalf of the Secretary of State, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) will act as controller for the processing of personal data that supports the functioning of the app. This is overseen by NHS Test and Trace (which is part of DHSC).</p>

<h2>Design objectives</h2>

<p>The app has six user-benefiting capabilities that are designed to encourage mass download and daily use. These capabilities have been designed to meet the remit of breaking the chains of COVID-19 transmission and enable society to return to a more normal way of life.</p>

<h3>Real-time high-risk area matches (alert)</h3>

<p>The app will notify the user if the postcode district within the local authority changes risk level. The user will confirm their local authority once they have entered their postcode district. The postcode district is the first section of the postcode (before the space). This facilitates alerts to users should the risk level in the selected local authority change.</p>

<h3>Digital check-in diary (venue check-in)</h3>

<p>The app will allow the user to check-in and check-out of venues that provide a QR code e.g. restaurants, shops and stadiums. If a venue later reports a cluster of positive coronavirus cases, the app user will be notified if they were present in the venue at the relevant time.</p>

<p>The remaining four categories are targeted at reducing public risk. These are:</p>

<h3>Symptoms questionnaire (symptoms)</h3>

<p>The app will allow the user to report their symptoms and the date when their symptoms started. Based on entering symptoms, the user will receive an initial indication as to whether they may have coronavirus. If the user’s symptoms indicate they may have coronavirus, they will be asked to self-isolate and book a test.</p>

<h3>Coronavirus test (test)</h3>

<p>If the user’s symptoms indicate they may have coronavirus the app will assist them in booking a test from the GOV.UK website. Once known, the test result will be provided in the app. Data entered used for the testing process is managed outside of the app environment and additional information is available elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is also possible to enter a test result in the app from testing mechanisms outside the app, not all of which require symptoms to be present. If the user is given a code during the process of getting a test, this code may be manually entered into the app so that the test result can be stored in the app and the isolation count down adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h3>Self-isolation countdown (isolate)</h3>

<p>The app will ask the user to self-isolate either because the user has reported symptoms indicative of coronavirus, or they have received an exposure notification (the contact case). Once asked to self-isolate, the user will have access to a self-isolation countdown which keeps a track of the time they need to spend self-isolating.</p>

<h3>Helping the community (analytics)</h3>

<p>The user will be able to help the public health response to COVID-19 by sharing information about coronavirus in the user’s postcode district and local authority region and how well the NHS Test and Trace programme and App are working.</p>

<p>This design has been driven through the collection of the requirements and iterated through user research.</p>

<p>Further explanation of the functionality and processing that supports these 6 features is set out in this document.
The app has been designed to protect the privacy of those who use it. Fundamental to this design has been the ICO Contact Tracing Principles – responses to these are summarised below.</p>

<h3>ICO Contact Tracing Principles and app design responses</h3>

<h4>Be transparent about the purpose – explain if the current/future purpose is only proximity notification or broader</h4>

<p>The purpose of the app is to enable society to return to a more normal way of life. To do this a combination of features are offered to reduce public risk by helping people:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>receive notifications if they have been near another app user who tests positive for coronavirus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>view current risk in the local area and receive a notification if there is a change that risk status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep a personal record of venues visited using the official NHS QR code and receive notifications if there is a reported outbreak at venues visited</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understand their symptoms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be able to order a test, via a link to the NHS Test and Trace website</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have an easy way to track the days they are recommended to isolate (if required)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More detail is available in the introduction and design section of this document.  The analytical data the app collects is to help manage the public health emergency.</p>

<p>The roadmap set out in this document illustrates current planning for future releases. The themes of new functionality relate to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maturity of app efficacy measurement via evolution of the GAEN</li>
  <li>evolution of testing options now including asymptomatic testing</li>
</ul>

<p>For more detail, please refer to the <a href="#roadmap" class="govuk-link">section on the roadmap for future functionality of this app</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of the app is explained comprehensively in its associated privacy notice.</p>

<h4>Be transparent about your design choices – use the least privacy intrusive approach possible. Explain risks.</h4>

<p>The initial design for an NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app undertook a centralised approach to managing data, built around a clear focus on the epidemiological understanding of the disease.</p>

<p>With the Google Apple API (the GAEN) we have moved to a decentralised approach. This is a design that is the least intrusive to privacy  as very little data leaves the phone and all matching happening only on an individual’s device. Our commitment to transparency is further demonstrated by open sourcing our code, which was published along with the DPIA at the commencement of the early adopter phase.</p>

<h4>Be transparent about the benefits – from both your perspective and that of the user. Explain how tensions between these are managed.</h4>

<p>The 6 app capabilities have been designed for user benefit. Research has been undertaken with users to refine these capabilities.</p>

<p>One area of tension in the design is setting the risk threshold to determine the volume of people who are asked to isolate. This determination is based on the deemed risk of the encounter they have had.</p>

<p>The risk threshold is set taking into consideration the current reproduction number.</p>

<p>This value drives the number of people asked to isolate and is regularly reviewed.</p>

<p>This approach has been scientifically determined by the Alan Turing Institute. More detail is available below regarding Automated decision making and Article 22 (GDPR requirements).</p>

<h4>Collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary – only collect or otherwise process information that is required for the core purpose (e.g. excluding location data).</h4>

<p>The app has been designed to use the minimum amount of personal data possible. In all instances, the data required, used or stored is minimised to reduce or remove the ability to identify an app user and to maintain their confidentiality and privacy. As an example, information collected in the app includes the user’s postcode district but as each postcode district is shared by ~8,000 households, this minimises the possibility of any personal identification. The user’s area, both local authority and postcode district, is stored on the app. The user’s local authority and postcode district, when both are collected in the analytical data set, will maintain the protections of privacy and identity.</p>

<p>More detail is available in the <a href="#nature" class="govuk-link">section ‘nature of the data’</a>.</p>

<h4>Protect your users – use pseudonymous identifiers which are renewed regularly.</h4>

<p>The app has no concept of registration, of allocating unique ids to app instances, or holding app instance specific data on the backend services.</p>

<p>Apple/Google exposure notification diagnosis keys are completely random and cannot be linked to the user. These are considered anonymous. A new diagnosis key is generated every day and will not be repeated. Diagnosis keys generate rolling proximity identifiers approximately every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>More detail is available in the <a href="#nature" class="govuk-link">section ‘nature of the data’</a>.</p>

<h4>Give users control – ensure your users can exercise their rights.</h4>

<p>The app has a section called ‘About’ which users can access to discover the information held about them.  This information includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>postcode district and selected local authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>venues captured via check in (if appropriate)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>last test result (if appropriate)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In a future release, this information might also include any symptoms entered by the user.</p>

<p>All data other than postcode district is able to be deleted from the app, with an option to the delete the postcode district available for update in a planned release. All data other than postcode district is able to be deleted from the app, with an option to the delete the postcode district available for update in a planned release.</p>

<h4>Keep data for the minimum amount of time – explain what that period will be and why.</h4>

<p>Diagnosis keys are kept for 14 days (the incubation duration for the virus). The keys are retained on DHSC secure computing infrastructure for a further 14 days. We will apply the same rationale to any diagnosis keys received from partner health service apps.</p>

<p>QR codes are kept for 21 days (this accounts for 14-day incubation period and 7-day infectious period of the virus)</p>

<p>The analytics data is anonymous as set out in more detail in Appendix 5, which explains how we ensure users cannot be identified from the analytics data from their app. More detail is available in <a href="#retention" class="govuk-link">section ‘retention of data from the app’</a>.</p>

<h4>Securely process the data –apply appropriate techniques to secure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, both at rest and in transit.</h4>

<p>The app system has been designed and developed in accordance with security principles that govern data on the device, data in transit, data processing on the backend.</p>

<p>More detail is available in <a href="#security" class="govuk-link">section ‘security of processing’</a>.</p>

<h4>Ensure the user can opt in or opt out without any negative consequences – functions decoupled to allow the user to benefit from one function without being compelled to provide data for others.</h4>

<p>The features of the app do not have to be used, for example the user has the option to turn on venue check-in functionality to scan the QR code. Users are entirely free to choose whether or not to enter their symptoms or book a test.</p>

<p>The option to call 111 (or the appropriate equivalent) is available should the user wish to discuss their circumstances, or the advice they have received. Google and Apple have been keen to assess this position and are satisfied the solution does not contradict their GAEN, which does not track or directly / indirectly limit public access.</p>

<p>More detail is available in <a href="#overview" class="govuk-link">section ‘overview of the functionality of the NHS COVID-19 App’</a>.</p>

<h4>Strengthen privacy, don’t weaken it – do not introduce additional privacy and security risks for the user</h4>

<p>We adhere to the principles which the Ethics Advisory Board set out for the first version of the app.</p>

<p>These principles are the basis by which any future change requests for the app will be assessed. Any request to add to or change the scope of the app will be formally presented to a Change Board which will convene weekly.</p>

<p>A core value of the app is privacy, specifically that the app must preserve the privacy of our users. In order to adhere to this value, the application and back-end service have considered privacy and security at each stage of design and development and has resulted in the use of a “decentralised” approach whereby data is stored and processed only on the user’s mobile device.</p>

<p>An example is venue check-in. Users are encouraged (but not required) to scan QR codes on official NHS posters posted at venues. This simple act provides user-led control for privacy. In this instance, the QR IDs are only stored on the user’s device and protected using encryption features available from their phone. The data never leaves their device, and can be deleted by the user at any time.</p>

<p>Where user identifiers are required, such as the virologic testing user journey, short-lifetime ephemeral tokens are used to protect the users’ privacy.</p>

<p>The use of SaaS (Software as a Service) means that IP addresses of user devices may be logged by infrastructure components. The solution attempts to remove this association at the earliest possible opportunity. As a precaution, any IP addresses of users that are transmitted from the networking layer to the backend servers are ignored by the application (never collected, logged or stored), minimising the possibility of inadvertently recombining IP address and payload data. This is a key privacy enhancing control to support anonymisation of data held by the backend.</p>

<p>More detail is available in the <a href="#privacy" class="govuk-link">section ‘privacy by design and default’</a>, and <a href="#security" class="govuk-link">section on ‘security of processing’</a>.</p>

<h2>Information Commissioner’s advice</h2>

<p>The Information Commissioner raised a number of specific issues relating to the previous iteration of the NHS COVID-19 App, that are addressed in this document:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Data subject rights – see the <a href="#rights" class="govuk-link">section on subjects’ rights</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Automated Decision Making at Article 22 of the GDPR – see the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#adm">automated decision making</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transparency requirements – it is intended that the app’s functions will be clearly communicated using the material set out in the <a href="#design" class="govuk-link">section ‘design objectives’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Necessity and proportionality – see the <a href="#privacy" class="govuk-link">section ‘privacy by design and default’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PECR (the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (as amended)) – including clarity of when information is stored on or accessed from user devices, and when opt-in consent is required. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#pecr">section on PECR</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Rationale for adopting the Apple-Google Exposure Notification API</h2>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#necessity">section on ‘necessity and proportionality’</a> for an explanation of this decision.</p>

<h2>Rationale for this data protection impact assessment (DPIA)</h2>

<p>Data controllers are required by the GDPR to conduct a DPIA before introducing data processing which could pose a high risk to subjects in the absence of proper controls. In particular, when using new technologies.</p>

<p>DHSC does process personal data that relates to the health of a very large number of individuals, and there are new types of technology employed in doing this, but all have mitigations in place to substantially reduce risk.</p>

<p>The Information Commissioner’s view is that organisations designing contact tracing apps are responsible for ensuring the app complies with data protection law. This is especially important because individuals may believe that the data protection by design and by default principles used in the development of the Contact Tracing Function extend to all aspects of a contact tracing app that is built to use it. Any supporting technology, including centralised processing to support contact tracing, should follow the same principles.</p>

<p>The app is designed to respect the privacy of those who use it. The identities of app users are not revealed as a consequence of its use. The App does not collect any directly identifiable information (for example, it does not collect name, telephone number, NHS number or GPS location data).</p>

<p>It is essential however to assure and formally document how the app works and how it protects the privacy of its users. Success relies on users’ confidence in the information being processed by the app.</p>

<p>This DPIA supports the national rollout of version 3.3 of the NHS COVID-19 App. This document will continue to be subject to review and revision in light of ongoing insight and learning.</p>

<h2>The nature of the data</h2>

<p>It is essential to document the nature of the data and identify whether it constitutes personal data for the purposes of data protection legislation. The data dictionary is presented in <a href="#appendix1" class="govuk-link">appendix 1</a>. Key features of constituent data items are referenced in the table above and described below.</p>

<p>The app makes use of the Apple/Google exposure notification system (hereafter the GAEN). This capability is incorporated in the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems. The GAEN can only be activated when an authorised App is installed. The NHS COVID-19 App has been authorised for installation by the Apple and Google app stores.</p>

<h3>The Apple-Google exposure notification API</h3>

<p>The GAEN generates 2 types of identifiers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>diagnosis keys</li>
  <li>rolling proximity identifiers (RPIs or broadcast codes)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Diagnosis keys</h4>

<p>Diagnosis keys are generated by the GAEN and uniquely reference an instance of the installed app on a user’s device. A new diagnosis key is generated by the GAEN every day and will not be repeated. Diagnosis keys are used by the GAEN to generate a further set of keys called rolling proximity identifiers (RPIs), or broadcast codes, approximately every 15 minutes (see below).</p>

<p>Diagnosis keys are released to the app when a positive COVID-19 test result is received. This is only possible with the express permission of the user. Once granted, they are submitted to DHSC secure computing infrastructure for distribution to all app instances.</p>

<p>Diagnosis keys (for a user who has submitted them) reside in the following locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the GAEN of the submitting user’s phone</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the app data of the submitting user’s phone</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DHSC secure computing infrastructure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the secure Federated Server used to support interoperability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>partner health service secure computing infrastructure in Gibraltar, Jersey, Northern Ireland and Scotland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app data of receiving users’ phones</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GAEN of receiving users’ phones</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Diagnosis keys are at no stage associated with any other information. The fact that they have been distributed for matching only indicates that the submitting user has been diagnosed as having COVID-19.</p>

<p>When distributed beyond the GAEN, diagnosis keys do not relate to an identified natural person. They also do not relate to an identifiable natural person by virtue of the design of the app and its supporting DHSC secure computing infrastructure – i.e. no identifying information is associated with them, technical controls are in place to prevent interception. On this basis they do not in themselves constitute personal data. This allows for their distribution without the need to disclose confidential patient information.</p>

<p>Diagnosis keys residing on the generating GAEN may be considered personal data by virtue of their association with the installed phone. The privacy design ensures that the controller cannot have access to these keys - other than for submission to the DHSC secure computing infrastructure.</p>

<h4>Rolling proximity identifiers (RPIs)</h4>

<p>The GAEN uses the daily temporary exposure key (TEK) to generate a new RPI approximately every 15 minutes. RPIs are made available over Bluetooth and are then collected by the GAEN running on other users’ phones. They are also referred to as broadcast codes. RPIs are random and almost certain to be unique, with only a remote chance of being repeated.</p>

<p>TEKs or RPIs cannot be accessed by the NHS COVID-19 App without a user testing positive for COVID-19. The user must also give permission to release the keys. Once approval has been received, TEKs are provided to the App and deleted from the GAEN. They then become diagnosis keys. Only when diagnosis keys are known can the RPI be re-generated. RPIs are not considered personal data because they do not relate to an identified or identifiable person.</p>

<h4>Exposure windows</h4>

<p>The GAEN digital contact tracing uses Low Energy Bluetooth (“BLE”) to approximate distance and duration of contacts between app users. Where 2 app users have been in contact, with the exchange of Rolling proximity identifiers (RPIs) or Broadcast codes, these measurements are used to calculate the risk of infection.</p>

<p>When an app user goes on to test positive for COVID-19 and chooses to share their Diagnosis Keys (an index case), their Diagnosis Keys are added to list of reference Diagnosis Keys provided to all app users. Should the GAEN detect a match, the process is detailed above, the Exposure Window data set associated with the broadcast is used to determine if the app user should be alerted.</p>

<p>This Exposure Window data set and measurements of the interactions between users is used to calculate the risk of infection from the contact with the index case. The calculation creates a risk score from the risk algorithm. If the calculation results in a score above the set risk threshold, the app will issue an alert to the app user with advice and a recommendation (i.e. the user is recommended to self-isolate due to a risky contact).</p>

<p>For more detail on the Exposure Window and its use see the section <a href="#EW" class="govuk-link">‘Digital contact tracing: exposure windows’</a></p>

<h4>Postcode district</h4>

<p>When the user installs the app, they are asked to provide their postcode district of residence. This is the first part of their postcode up until the space. Postcode district is uploaded to DHSC secure computing infrastructure daily with other anonymous analytics data.</p>

<p>Postcode districts are not regarded as constituting a component of the personal data in the data set when processed within the DHSC secure infrastructure, in the product or analytical data environments. This is due to the first level postcode district typically includes ~8,000 households, minimising the possibility of personal identification. There are additional controls throughout the app’s supporting systems, including the performance viewer, data flows to and data within the analytical environment which manage postcode districts which include a small number of households.</p>

<h4>Local authority</h4>

<p>When users enter their postcode district, they will be prompted to confirm their local authority. The selected local authority will allow users to get an accurate COVID alert level based on government restriction guidelines.</p>

<p>In future releases, a user’s selected local authority will also be used to provide users with valuable information, such as the number of infections and tests within a specific local authority.</p>

<p>The Local Authority is not currently collected as part of the analytical data set but is scheduled for the near future and is subject to the same standards and controls to remove the risk of re-identification. The risks of reidentification due to the collection of both Local Authority and Postcode District was considered and controls are in place to reduce and manage that risk.</p>

<p>See <a href="#appendix5" class="govuk-link">Appendix 5 for more information</a>.</p>

<h4>Test results</h4>

<p>When a user is recommended to take a virology test, the server allocates them a short-lived unique token. This token is passed to the virology testing platform so that test results can be sent back to the app system. The token replaces the need for any personal identifiable information. The token is destroyed within 24 to 48 hours of test results being received.</p>

<p>The token is associated with fully identifiable personal data relating to the subject throughout the processing of the test. The one-time token and the test result are returned to the Cloud Services database which downloads them to the user’s phone. The token and test result are then deleted.
Test results constitute a component of the personal data held on the installed app. This is because the token relates to a user and is identifiable in the context of their use of the app. The test result and the token constitute pseudonymised personal data whilst they are held temporarily in the Cloud Services database. Test results which are uploaded to Cloud Services daily with other anonymous analytics data only include the test status - and not the token. They are not identifiable to a user.</p>

<p>This process differs for app user’s utilising the <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Welsh testing system and website</a>.</p>

<h4>Personal data held only on the phone</h4>

<p>The app processes data entered by the user about their symptoms in order to provide advice on isolation and signpost to testing services.</p>

<p>The app also collects QR codes from venues which the user has visited and checked-in to. Although this information does not leave the phone, the data does relate specifically to the user and therefore constitutes personal data. The app provides the functionality to delete this venue check-in details both for specific venues and as part of the delete all data held on the phone function.</p>

<h4>Analytics data</h4>

<p>Analytics data is collected by the app and submitted to Cloud Services specifically for the purpose of understanding the performance or behaviour of the app system. It is uploaded each day to Cloud services in anonymous form. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix5">Appendix 5</a> for more information about this data and why we are confident it cannot be used to identify app users.</p>

<p>This Analytics data may include postcode district and test results which constitute a component of personal data when held on the installed App on the phone. This is because they relate to a user and are identifiable in the context of their use of the App. Other personal data used by the App is only held on the user’s phone and not part of the analytics data.</p>

<p>Symptoms data is not retained on the phone after submission in the analytics upload. This data is not considered personal data when held in anonymous form on DHSC secure computing infrastructure.</p>

<p>Area data, either postcode district or local authority, is not combined with symptoms data for the purpose of identifying where an individual is located. When the area is combined with other data items it is used for public health purposes, such as the monitoring of infection spread.</p>

<h4>Data held on Cloud Services</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix1">Appendix 1</a> describes a summary of the DHSC secure computing infrastructure data. The server only handles data if it is needed for app operation or for system monitoring. No data held on the DHSC secure computing infrastructure is traceable to an individual. See below for details around the management of IP addresses.</p>

<h2>Privacy by design and default</h2>

<p>As described in the section above, the app has been built to respect the ICO’s Contact Tracing Principles. Key privacy features of the app are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>users’ identities will not be revealed by the app</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no persistent user identifiers will be processed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the app will collect the minimal amount of data necessary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as far as possible processing will take place on user’s phone</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal data does not leave the device without the permission of the user</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analytics data is only collected in anonymous form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a performance view (via dashboards) using only aggregate and anonymous data to provide an oversight of the services provided by the NHS COVID-19 App</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there will be no third-party trackers gathering personal data in the app</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the user can delete the app and its data from their phone at any time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>data in the DHSC secure computing infrastructure will be made available only to individuals that have been formally authorised to access it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>transfer of data from the DHSC secure computing infrastructure to another system or controller, or processing for purposes outside the scope of this DPIA will be subject to further DPIA.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The app makes use of the Google/Apple GAEN, which is incorporated in the operating systems of Apple and Android phones. The features which ensure user privacy are outlined in this document.</p>

<p>Contacts, QR codes, local authority and postcode district data is processed on the device. Circuit breaker, diagnosis keys and anonymous data are processed off the phone.</p>

<h3>The GAEN</h3>

<p>The app is built upon the contact matching functionality of the Google/Apple GAEN. The GAEN is subject to routine review and improvement by Google and Apple based upon the what they have learnt about the technology, COVID-19 and the public health response. NHS Test and Trace has contributed to this discussion and undertakes vigorous testing to help understand and refine the risk algorithm used to calculate the risk of infection. 
The most recent update introduced a second GAEN Mode, Mode 2, in addition to the existing Mode, Mode 1. A brief explanation can be found below.</p>

<h4>GAEN Mode 1</h4>

<p>When the GAEN receives a broadcast code they record a measure of distance, the BLE signal strength. Mode 1 takes the set of measurements it receives associated with the broadcast code and merges those signals into a three-bin histogram. This allows the GAEN to determine how many seconds the interaction was in the “near”, “middle” or “far” histogram bin.</p>

<p>Mode 1 allows signal information to be calculated into a broad categorisation of risk. However, the Mode does cause some uncertainty if the measure of distance (signal strength) is impacted by other factors. For example, the Bluetooth signal is muffled due to the device being in a pocket or bag. This is a challenge within indoor environments due the nature of Bluetooth and the impact on Bluetooth signals indoors.</p>

<p>Mode 1 is deemed “good” at identifying high risk scenarios, by the International Machine Learning scale. However, Mode 2 offered by Apple and Google offers greater ability to account for these challenges.</p>

<h4>GAEN Mode 2</h4>

<p>Mode 2 uses signal strength attenuation, the approximation of distance, as a function of time difference between successive Bluetooth measurements. Time difference and time series is the key new feature of Mode 2 which is enabled by the Exposure Windows functionality, and data set, which measures 30-minutes of interactions when broadcast codes are received by the app. These Time series are the signal strengths taken over successive intervals within the 30-minute period of an Exposure Window.</p>

<p>A better estimate of distance between app users can be calculated by using Mode 2’s time series of measurements. Before the app moved to use Mode 2, a series of experiments were done in a number of environments and settings to collect data and understand the performance of the app. This testing, and a review of the results by international experts and colleagues, allowed us to define the best possible algorithm for differentiating risks to ask only those at risk of infection to isolate. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/updates-algorithm-underlying-nhs-covid-19-app">Read more information</a>. The Risk Algorithm is open sourced and the NHS COVID-19 app is believed to have the best discriminative performance internationally.</p>

<p>On the International Machine Learning scale, the algorithm used by the app for Mode 2 is deemed ‘excellent’. For users this will result in fewer unnecessary recommendations to isolate.</p>

<p>Mode 2 is utilised by the latest version of the app and is another reason why we recommend app users to routinely update their app for the best service and performance.</p>

<p>Read more <a href="#EW" class="govuk-link">information about the use and processing of data by the GAEN Mode 2 and Exposure Windows</a>. As with the GAEN, no identifiers are exchanged, and no personal data is processed due to the lack or removal of any possible identifiers of the individuals involved.</p>

<h3>Stateless and conversational APIs</h3>

<p>All of the APIs presented by DHSC secure computing infrastructure are either ‘stateless’ or ‘conversational’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stateless APIs do not save data generated in one interaction for use in the next interaction</li>
  <li>conversational APIs generate a token which is returned to the app in the initial communication allowing the app to poll for further communications relating to the same matter – this allows for processing to be conducted whilst the token remains current</li>
</ul>

<h4>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used by the app</h4>

<p>APIs used to communicate with DHSC secure computing infrastructure are described below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Analytics – collects analytical data from the app for aggregation and statistical analysis (stateless)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Analytics – same API used for Event Analytical Data Set – Collects analytical data from the app for aggregation and statistical analysis (stateless)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Config – provides configuration for the app, possibly based on device state, like language and type (stateless)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Distribute – access the data used for risk scoring; positive diagnosis keys, hotspot QR codes and area (postcode district/local authority) risk levels (stateless)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Risk – confirm with the DHSC secure computing infrastructure before taking a risk-based action such as isolation (conversational. The app request is returned a short-lived transaction ID. The token is needed as long as the circuit breaker takes to make its decision. There is manual input in this step, so time is not fixed. Rarely above 4 hours.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit – submit exposure diagnosis keys to be added to the positive key set (stateless)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control – support the control Panel web monitor (stateless)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Swab testing – app-facing API used to get a transaction token and get the swab test results (Conversational. A transaction ID token is maintained while a swab test is underway, which is expected to be 1 to 4 days.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TestLab – 3rd party test lab API used by the swab test Labs to submit test results, together with the linking token ID. (Conversational. A transaction ID token is maintained while a swab test is underway, which is expected to be 1 to 4 days.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>App Rest API client – collects and provides data to support operational interoperability with partner Health Service apps (stateless)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Supporting Isolation Payment Application APIs (please note: this may differ for Wales)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>TTSP Gateway API – supports the user’s application in accordance with the app’s privacy requirements (stateless)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TTSP Mobile AP – creates and updates the token for the app user making an application (conversational, the transaction of tokens is confirmed)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All API interactions to the DHSC will inevitably result in app users’ IP addresses being present in data communicated between the app and the DHSC servers due to the nature of networking. The DHSC will never use IP addresses for identification purposes. IP addresses are not processed and are removed as soon as is practical. The IP data is never held alongside data collected from app users.</p>

<h3>No user account or registration process</h3>

<p>There is no user account or registration process that requires the submission of direct identifiers. This includes no requirement (or opportunity) to submit name, email address or telephone number.</p>

<p>A central system, the DHSC secure computing infrastructure, is necessary to facilitate exposure notifications and the communication of test results. Use of the App does not however involve a persistent internal identifier to link data on the App with data in the DHSC secure computing infrastructure.</p>

<p>All communications between the App and the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database are conducted by polling rather than push notification. There is no need for a messaging service or messaging ID.</p>

<p>Distribution of data from the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database to the App is achieved by the App making requests to the relevant API.</p>

<h3>QR codes for venues visited never leave the phone</h3>

<p>A history of the scanned QR codes for venues a user has checked-in to is accumulated on the phone. This is used for matching against the distributed QR codes for venues identified as infected.</p>

<p>The codes scanned by the user never leave the phone.</p>

<p>The QR scanner is incorporated within the app to ensure that there is control over proper operation.</p>

<p>Details of the venue are encrypted with AES.GCM and the key is stored in private device key storage.</p>

<h3>Analytics data is anonymous</h3>

<p>App functionality which involves the backend (circuit breaker, key submission, onboarding) is real-time. Other analytics are collected on a regular basis, currently daily.</p>

<p>The analytics dataset is anonymous. As noted above, IP addresses of users when transmitted from the networking layer to the backend servers are ignored (never collected, logged or stored) thus minimising the possibility of inadvertently recombining IP address and payload data.</p>

<h3>Performance viewer</h3>

<p>Data from the NHS COVID-19 App’s product environment is provided to those overseeing the performance of the app. This is based on the analytical data provided by app users as part of the analytical data upload. More details of the data items included can be found in the data dictionary in <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix1">appendix 1</a>.</p>

<p>The performance viewer is available to a limited number of staff within the Department of Health and Social Care’s Test and Trace programme. Access is strictly controlled. Data provided to these viewers is subject to additional privacy and identity protections, such as small number suppression. The data supports data dashboards that provide those viewing the data with ability to question the data or change views. For example, they would be able to judge the uptake of the app within particular postcode districts or wider areas.</p>

<p>The dashboards and functionality are provided within the app’s Product Environment, provided by Amazon Web Services acting as data processor.</p>

<h3>Consent</h3>

<p>Consent as a basis for lawful processing for GDPR purposes is not being applied.</p>

<p>Installation of the app is entirely voluntary; Specific permission is requested for the app to access Diagnosis Keys, for submission, and to open the camera to scan QR codes.</p>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The app does not use GPS or any other geolocation technology to collect information about the specific location of a user’s phone.</p>

<p>The collection and recording of proximity encounters rely entirely on the strength of Bluetooth signals between communicating devices.</p>

<h2>Security of processing</h2>

<p>Threat modelling was conducted during the design stage. A STRIDE review was used to identify threats to data both in transit and at rest. These cover threats such as Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure (privacy breaches or data leaks), Denial of service and Elevation of privilege (STRIDE). Threats are prioritised based on potential or actual impact. All risks are covered, but threats remain unbounded.</p>

<p>Security principles have been established to define the controls needed to protect data:</p>

<h3>Securing the systems that enable the app</h3>

<p>Stateless microservices are used to deliver services where possible. The use of cloud provider services results in a highly scalable and reliable infrastructure.</p>

<p>All data is stored in encrypted storage.</p>

<p>Static data is monitored to detect change.</p>

<p>Service availability is continuously monitored as part of the operations function.</p>

<h3>Securing data in transit</h3>

<p>All data in transit is encrypted using TLS1.2+ using modern cipher suites.</p>

<p>Clients and services must mutually identify each other:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the mobile device app provides an API key to the backend</li>
  <li>third-party services provide an API key to the backend</li>
  <li>the backend service presents a certificate that the connection initiator verifies is issued to the service (certificate pinning)</li>
</ul>

<p>Data originating from the backend must be signed. Mobile app clients have a public key in the application which is used to verify the signature of data from the backend.</p>

<p>The infrastructure is protected through a range of techniques:</p>

<h4>Architecture</h4>

<p>Separation of environments – Environments are separated by use: development, testing, staging and production.</p>

<p>Use of DHSC secure computing infrastructure via cloud provider services – Where security functionality is available from the cloud service provider, these solutions have been selected over in-house or third-party solutions. These are proven services that are the responsibility of the cloud service provider to maintain. Where appropriate, we have followed the cloud service providers recommendations and guidance relating to secure configuration.</p>

<p>Use of microservices – Limited functions integrated into the SaaS architecture. Where possible these are stateless.</p>

<p>Use of web-based services – All web-based services use TLS v1.2 and all services require authentication (with the exception of requests from mobile devices where we attempt to preserve anonymity), and mutual authentication methods for service interconnects to other services are achieved where this is technically feasible using the chosen technologies</p>

<p>Repeatable delivery – The use of Infrastructure as Code is mandated to enable repeatable delivery of the environment and assurance of repeatability of test results.</p>

<p>These data flows support international travel whilst remaining protected under the international collaborative usage of the GAEN applications.</p>

<p>The solution is built and deployed into Public Cloud infrastructure, based upon Amazon Web Service (AWS) as a Processor, using combinations of Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) components.  Configuration and use of these components are under strict control by DHSC, but underlying operating environments are subject to change by the service supplier (AWS) to improve the security and resilience of AWS.</p>

<p>The performance viewer is hosted within the AWS instance that hosts the app supporting service. This allows it to provide visibility on the performance data received from the apps in real-time, not subject to delays that transfer to a separate environment would involve. The mobile apps send analytics information to AWS daily and when a test result is confirmed. The new exposure window information is triggered by the user entering a manual test result code or when they acknowledge a test result.</p>

<p>This data is made available to the performance viewer every minute. The presented dashboard data uses controls to prevent risks of indirect identifiability from the data presented.</p>

<p>This is implemented as an Amazon Kinesis Data Pipeline, which converts the data to a batch file format, writes this into Amazon S3/Athena, where it is then available as a reporting data source for Amazon QuickSight.</p>

<p>Traffic obfuscation techniques are implemented and maintained to reduce inference of communication content by ensuring random packet lengths and consistent sequencing of packets for different outcomes or user journeys.</p>

<h4>System user management</h4>

<p>Role-based access control – All users are granted permissions through roles. Access is granted on a per-environment basis.</p>

<p>Authentication – Multi-factor authentication is required.</p>

<p>The performance viewer presents data dashboards to entitled, authenticated users. The dashboards provide only read-only access to the app analytics. User authentication is achieved via the usage of role-based AWS accounts. The access restrictions for users of the performance viewer ensure that users are given permission only to view the information that is presented in QuickSight, and nothing further. Additionally at the system level the QuickSight processes are assigned AWS role policies that only allow access to the analytics data in the reporting data source, and no other system data.</p>

<h4>Monitoring</h4>

<p>Monitoring – Activities of highly privileged users and high impact actions are alerted in near real-time. These alerts are monitored by the app operations team.</p>

<p>Protective monitoring is described further below.</p>

<h3>Test the effectiveness of the security measures and respond to any security issues</h3>

<p>Security measures are tested throughout the delivery lifecycle for both the applications and backend services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Design – Threat modelling is performed, prioritising threats and identifying suitable controls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build – During deployment, backend security controls are explicitly tested to ensure that the configuration of the solution does not inadvertently lead to information leakage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test – Active penetration testing is performed using an independent third-party supplier. Cloud service provider compliance services are used to verify that the service meets CIS recommendations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Operate – In addition to the ongoing performance of the activities described in the Test phase, protective monitoring is undertaken. To the extent possible, all source code is made available as open source, enabling anyone to identify potential security issues. Reports are encouraged through the HackerOne Vulnerability Disclosure Programme are triaged and responded to.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to system protection, a number of components also detect compromise, significant events or compromise attempts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Protective security monitoring is deployed on the AWS platform and service running on the platform</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proactive security alerting is implemented to notify when a privileged role has been used or a high impact event occurs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security logs are sent to the NHS Digital Cyber Defence Operations Centre (CDOC)  for analysis of anomalous or malicious behaviour</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of these alerts, security incidents are triaged by the incident management team who respond appropriately.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Protective security monitoring and application behaviour monitoring are provided by CDOC and a company acting under contract to the DHSC (Zuhlke Engineering). Zuhlke Engineering are not required to process any personal data and are not considered a data processor but operate under strict contractual controls.</p>

<h3>Data flow lifecycle and data architecture choices</h3>

<p>Data flows through the system have been described in relation to each feature in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#overview">section ‘overview of the functionality of the NHS COVID-19 App’</a>.</p>

<p>The following principles have been used throughout the solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>no User State or Identifier is stored on the DHSC secure computing infrastructure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all APIs are stateless where possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when stateful behaviour is required, short-lived tokens are used as identifiers. As described in the flow below this exist only as long as are needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some interactions are in place to support future functionality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rich analytics are collected, protecting the app user’s identity. For example, a user’s IP addresses will not be recorded.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All web-service APIs owned by the project use TLS encryption and DHSC secure computing infrastructure require all app user’s data to be embedded in the content of the payload.</p>

<p>The following data items are sent from the end user and stored in the DHSC secure computing infrastructure or persistent storage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>diagnosis keys – A set of device keys encountered by the device. This data is only uploaded when the user has a positive test and they have specifically given permission to sharing through the app. If the user gives permission then this data is distributed to all devices periodically. The validity of the duration of the keys is defined by the Apple/Google API.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analytics data – This is aggregated and made available for query by authorised users. This data is provided via dashboards for management and oversight of the service delivered by the app service. The data is also exported to the App Analytics Environment (AAE) for additional analysis and support of public health. interactions with the service which are logged through cloud provider services. These records are provided to the Cyber Defence Operations Centre to enable them to perform protective monitoring.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>venue check-in – registration for and provision of a QR code poster to venues that wish to display one outside of the scope of this DPIA. The process includes the email address and venue location. Where venue owners request a poster, they are required to provide an email address and location. This is used to send the poster to the individual registering the venue. A list of poster IDs and their associated location is provided to JBC.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The following data items from the end user are stored on the device and are not stored in cloud databases or persistent storage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>symptoms submission (Not in use in the present version)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following data items relating to the end user are stored on their device and are stored within back-end integrations with third parties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>virology test bearer token – Where a user registers for a test, a temporary token is obtained from NPEx which is stored on the device and subsequently used to retrieve their test result (NPEx is a system owned and operated by Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust in support of the national COVID testing operation)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rationale for collecting postcode district</h2>

<p>When the user installs the app, they are required to provide their postcode district. This is the first part of their postcode up until the space. On the EN Server this is included in the analytics dataset but is not considered personal data as it is fully anonymous.</p>

<p>The area, postcode district and local authority, are also used to provide app user’s with details about the services in their area. For example, if there are any additional testing options.</p>

<p>The postcode district is collected in order to understand the geographical distribution of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>app uptake</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reported symptoms of coronavirus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>potential transmission events</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This data will be used to understand where the virus is spreading, and how fast it is spreading in different locations. This information could be used to coordinate local responses - be it by increased provisioning at the local NHS Trust or deploying more Test and Trace resources. The postcode district will also provide insight into regional variation in the uptake of the app as well as regional infection rates. The postcode district will also be used to alert users when their postcode district is at a higher risk from coronavirus.</p>

<p>Regional variation information will provide improved epidemiological insights. In future versions of the app, this information would allow the implementation of a localised risk function, including messaging within the app to provide users with information about COVID prevalence and services in their area. This could contribute to a more granular loosening/tightening of social distancing rules at a more geographically granular level. This would ultimately help to get more people back to normal life quickly and safely.</p>

<h2>Rationale for processing local authority</h2>

<p>When users enter their postcode district, they will be prompted to confirm their local authority. The selected local authority will allow users to get an accurate COVID alert level based on government restriction guidelines. The risk level will be presented in a manner that is compatible to the government guidelines to enable users to have an accurate risk level based on their selected local authority.</p>

<h2>Confidential patient information</h2>

<p>Diagnosis keys are an indicator that a referenced individual has become infected with COVID-19. If the individual were identifiable, then this would constitute confidential patient information for common law purposes.</p>

<p>Using or disclosing confidential information requires one of three bases for it to be lawful:</p>

<ol>
  <li>consent</li>
  <li>overriding public interest</li>
  <li>statutory permissive power or obligation</li>
</ol>

<p>Diagnosis keys more precisely represent an approximate 24-hour period within which the EN API (operating on a user’s phone) broadcasts rolling proximity identifiers (which expire and are replaced approximately every 15 minutes).</p>

<p>As neither the diagnosis keys nor the rolling proximity identifiers can be used to identify a user or their phone, they are not considered to constitute personal data away from the user’s phone. Nor are they considered confidential patient information.</p>

<p>As described above, the receipt and communication of test results by the DHSC secure computing infrastructure involves the result being associated with a temporary one-time use token. The use of this code requires that it is associated with information that does reveal the subject’s identity, such as name and telephone number – but only outside the app.</p>

<p>In the context of the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database, the token and the test result are transient. The only purpose being to facilitate communication to the user when requested by the app.</p>

<p>The token and the test results are considered pseudonymised, as no linkable identifying information is available to the controller. In order to provide maximum protection and privacy however, they will be treated as though they are sensitive personal data relating to health - and therefore confidential patient information.</p>

<h2>Necessity and proportionality</h2>

<p>At every stage of development, the intention of the UK government has been to adopt the technical solutions which support efforts to control the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Initially, an app was designed which allowed for both effective contact tracing and provision of additional epidemiological functionality to manage the spread of COVID-19. The focus of this app was on collecting the minimum data necessary.</p>

<p>A new exposure notification framework was developed by Google and Apple however, which supported digital contact tracing through slightly different means. A review was subsequently taken to assess the Google/Apple API against the functionality judged beneficial for managing the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The functionality of the Google/Apple API was assessed alongside rigorous testing of the original app. Testing revealed that reliability of the original app was not sufficient and would therefore not be effective in helping manage the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The government decided that the Google/Apple approach had the highest likelihood of achieving the stated goals, while collecting the minimum data necessary. Following advice from his advisers, the UK Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, announced on 18 June that the government had begun the next phase of development in building a new app that supports the end-to-end NHS Test and Trace service. This app would use the Google/Apple decentralised exposure notification framework to achieve this goal.</p>

<p><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2617653/apple-google-api-opinion-final-april-2020.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">The ICO opinion on the Google/Apple API is available</a></p>

<h2>The roadmap for future functionality of this app</h2>

<p>Improvements and enhancements within the functionality of the app go through a change control process, these adhere to the existing commitments to app users, accounting for information rights law and privacy requirements. This continues to be required and appropriate as the app responds to the developing public health emergency and identifies areas for improvement.</p>

<p>The scope of future functionality will continue to develop. New changes will always be subject to review based upon policy decisions and requirements. Many policy decisions will be for ministers to decide and cannot be pre-empted here. The following is under consideration for future release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the focus of the changes ahead in the app relate to being able to measure its efficacy which evolves as the Google Apple API matures (the GAEN). This direction and the specifics on the implications of data collected in an anonymous and aggregated manner are described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#riskthreshold">section on the risk threshold</a>. These changes will come into effect across several releases over the coming months. No other major changes to functionality are currently expected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>updates to follow the testing path. The app was initially established to take testing results once a user has demonstrated symptoms. With additional testing options including mass testing sites there are other paths to testing and results. The intention is to ensure that the app provides consistent advice, such as isolation periods, to all app users in line with the latest testing policy</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The app is part of NHS Test and Trace and considers the broader roadmap for the whole programme.</p>

<h2>Assessment of application of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (as amended) (‘PECR’)</h2>

<p>We accept that regulation 6 is engaged as regards some portions of the app’s functionality. These functions require access to data stored on the phone (for example performance metrics, diagnosis keys) and storing data on the phone (for example venue details, area (either postcode district or local authority) to support the associated alert function). All data that falls under PECR is deemed strictly necessary to provide services explicitly requested by the user.</p>

<p>The functions of the app that fall under the PECR are explained below (with further detail provided in the data dictionary set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix1">Appendix 1</a>:</p>

<h3>Performance and use metrics</h3>

<p>to ensure the app is working as expected and that the user’s phone can safely support the core functionality (contact tracing; venue check-in; symptom tracker; isolation countdown; test ordering) the app collects the following information from the user’s phone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>phone model</li>
  <li>operating system version</li>
  <li>app version number</li>
  <li>completion of onboarding</li>
  <li>storage and data download usage</li>
</ul>

<p>Phone and operating system information is required to ensure any features of the app which do not function correctly on specific phone models or operating system can be quickly remediated and allow relevant alerts to be sent to users. This is necessary to ensure the App is working as it should on the device and providing services for users that are safe, effective and which are not being misused.</p>

<p>Onboarding information is used to validate that users have an up to date version of the app and have completed the onboarding process. This ensures users are using the app correctly and have the benefit of the latest guidance and support.</p>

<p>Storage and data download usage information is necessary to ensure the app is able to function and not using disproportionate amounts of storage or data.</p>

<p>The app validates receipt of system updates every 2 hours. This is necessary to ensure users have access to real time risk information which provides latest safety information.</p>

<h3>Medical device efficacy</h3>

<p>To comply with accreditation requirements of the app as a medical device there is a requirement to collect information which demonstrates ongoing review of the app’s efficacy as a medical device, providing full lifetime traceability that the medical features of the app are working properly – for example to cross check the swab test result levels with isolation advice to ensure the app’s isolation advice is functioning correctly. This necessitates collection of data across the medical features of the app such as isolation status, swab test status and symptom questionnaire results.</p>

<h3>Digital contact tracing</h3>

<p>If the app user receives a positive test result, daily codes stored on the phone will be shared with other app users (subject to cryptography and referred to as Diagnosis Keys) alongside the onset of symptoms data but only if specifically authorised by the app user who has the positive test. To ensure this contact tracing and alert system functions safely and effectively, the app provides data in the analytical data set and event analytical data set about the user’s postal district, exposure events and pause button usage. This data will be used to validate that the level of alerts users receive are consistent with the wider risk environment and is necessary to calibrate the efficacy of the alert system.</p>

<p>The Exposure Window data, with measurements of duration and distance of contact, are used in digital contact tracing to determine when an alert should be issued to the app user (i.e. the risk score is above the risk threshold).</p>

<p>Together with the relevant onset of symptoms data, which is used to calculate the infectiousness, the Exposure Window and Scan Instances data sets enable the app to calculate the risk of COVID-19 infection from a contact with an index case. For more detail about these data sets, see the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#EW">Digital Contact Tracing: Exposure Windows</a>.</p>

<h3>Public health response management</h3>

<p>To help public health authorities learn more about the virus and its transmission and take effective measures to manage the response to the COVID-19 public health emergency the following data are accessed from the app:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>postal district</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>exposure events</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>QR check in count</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>symptom questionnaire results</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>isolation status and reason</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>swab test status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pause button usage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>test result and test result pathway (i.e. what was the result of test and was it provided via the app or by SMS code)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>exposure window and scan instances of contacts with index cases</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This information comprises the contribution app users commit to making when they download and use the app, to help support management of and response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Sharing information about the efficacy of the NHS Test and Trace Programme (or the Test, Trace, Protect Programme in Wales) and app is critical to helping authorities understand whether the Programmes and the app are working as expected.  It supports being able to learn and respond better to the public health emergency, thereby helping the community to stay healthy and save lives. The privacy and identity protections of the app ensure that app users can do this through anonymous data. Using these services helps reduce the transmission of COVID-19 ensuring that appropriate steps are taken. As outlined in the privacy notice for the app, the user has specifically requested to use these services and contribute by downloading and using the app.</p>

<h2>Automated decision making and Article 22 (GDPR) requirements</h2>

<p>We consider it is arguable as to whether or not Article 22 is engaged by the contact tracing function of the app. On one view, Article 22 might be said to apply where a user comes into contact with someone who has tested positive and so is advised by way of a notification sent via the app to self-isolate and order a test. It is noted that in order for Article 22 to apply, there must be a decision that has a legal or similarly significant effect on an individual that is based solely on automated processing of personal data.</p>

<p>In any event, whether or not Article 22 applies as a matter of law, in order to try and maximise the ICO’s and the public’s confidence in the app, we have decided to take all the relevant steps and implement all the appropriate protections to comply with Article 22 as if it were engaged. We are taking all steps required to comply with these requirements.</p>

<p>For the purposes of its effective compliance with the requirements of Article 22, DHSC considers that any automated decision making is authorised by law, specifically section 2A of the NHS Act 2006 which permits the Secretary of State to take such steps as he considers appropriate for the purpose of protecting public health. This is the power that the Secretary of State relies on to authorise the design, implementation and operation of the App by DHSC. We have also sought to implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights, freedoms and legitimate interests as would be required by Article 22. As regards Article 22(4), we note that any automated decisions based on special categories of personal data shall be processed on the basis of Article 9(2)(g) being processing that is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, following the conditions in paragraph 6 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (Statutory and government purposes).</p>

<p>See our document on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-covid-19-app-privacy-information/nhs-covid-19-app-our-processing-of-special-categories-of-personal-data" class="govuk-link">processing of special categories of personal data</a>.</p>

<h3>Informing the app user</h3>

<p>Upon downloading the app, the user will be informed that the app’s contact tracing function includes a type of automated decision making.</p>

<h3>Support and advice 111</h3>

<p>When a user is receives a notification to the effect that they should self-isolate, they will be able to call NHS 111 to discuss the implications of this advice and their personal circumstances.</p>

<p>This will be particularly helpful, for example, should an individual receive a notification despite the fact that they have not been in direct contact with anyone for an extended period. The user would be able to discuss these circumstances with the NHS 111 operator who might advise that self-isolation and ordering a test is not necessary.</p>

<p>For app users in Wales, they will be directed to the equivalent service in Wales (see <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://111.wales.nhs.uk/">https://111.wales.nhs.uk/</a> for more information)</p>

<h3>Circuit breaker</h3>

<p>The ‘circuit breaker’ is a backend feedback and control service. It enables the app to manage notifications by the app where there are concerns about accuracy or where a significant number of app users may be told to self-isolate.</p>

<p>The circuit breaker triggers automatically when conditions are met. These conditions are set by human intervention and stop exposure notifications from being sent. Two examples of where this may apply are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Concerns over accuracy of testing results or data (referred to as compromised)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concerns over venue notification</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The functionality will not be utilised in the initial release of the app. A review of the processes and criteria for intervention will be undertaken during this period by the Public Health functions responsible for the intervention</p>

<p>We look forward to continuing to discuss the above with the ICO, and particularly whether any further proportionate additional measures could be implemented for the benefit of App users.</p>

<p>For further context on contact tracing functionality, we set out below how we arrive at the risk threshold for recommending self-isolation.</p>

<h3>Risk threshold for isolation</h3>

<p>The app uses GAEN to measure Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal attenuation— device calibrated received signal strength between transmitting and receiving smartphone devices. The API defines 2 user types: affected users (those that have tested positive) and potentially exposed users (all other app users).</p>

<p>The GAEN functionality now provides two Modes, see <a href="#GAEN" class="govuk-link">section on GAEN Modes</a> for more information. Depending on which version of the app you are using, the relevant Mode and risk algorithm will apply. We recommend all app users to routinely update their app to get the best service and support.
The risk threshold for the app is under regular review and may change. This is to ensure that the app alerts users in line with wider public health policy, ongoing learning about the performance of the digital contact tracing and app.</p>

<p>To identify the impact of different risk threshold settings, the team from the Alan Turing Institute used statistical modelling to generate data for 100,000 simulated encounters. In order to calibrate the statistical model, experimental data from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was used. MIT havehas run a series of real-life scenarios conducted in a controlled environment where device signal attenuation and precise distance have been recorded. The statistical model was then used to generate 100,000 known encounters, enabling an understanding of whether the app would categorise these encounters as risky or not.</p>

<p>From this, the modelling compares the numbers of true positives (correctly identified as high risk), true negatives (correctly identified as not at high risk), false positives and false negatives, for different risk thresholds. 
This is the scientific basis of the app’s automation to recommend an app user to self-isolate. We have also researched the approaches being taken by Denmark, Italy, Germany Switzerland, Ireland and Northern Ireland, where a difference can be observed in aligning the likelihood of more false positives or more false negatives.
Read <a rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/risk-scoring-algorithm.html" class="govuk-link">more information on the risk algorithm and ongoing work to improve it</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/updates-algorithm-underlying-nhs-covid-19-app" class="govuk-link">Updates to the algorithm underlying the NHS COVID-19 app
</a>.</p>

<h4>Setting the risk threshold</h4>

<p>Based on the understanding of Mode 1 and Mode 2 API, because we use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal strength, it is not possible to definitively identify all the high-risk encounters between app users. Consequently, a judgement is made on the risk threshold to ensure we maximise the number of high-risk encounters identified without including too many lower or medium risk encounters.</p>

<p>Various factors impact on the decision to set the risk threshold, these include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes to the risk algorithm, for example if Google and Apple introduce more capabilities</li>
  <li>analysis and testing provide more insight on where the risk threshold should be set</li>
  <li>where the COVID-19 public health situation and its impacts require a review</li>
</ul>

<p>Ongoing field trials of the app, modelling and simulation are used to constantly evaluate the real-life behaviour of the app.</p>

<p>The Early Adopters phase of the app used the GAEN Mode 1. It considered the distance and duration of encounters. Modelling was undertaken to estimate the ability to maximise the number of high-risk encounters identified and minimise the number of lower or medium risk encounters that might be mistaken for high-risk encounters. The risk threshold was set accordingly.</p>

<p>The app forms part of the wider Test and Trace programme, which includes manual contact tracing, which is at the core of public health management and which the app’s digital contact tracing compliments. Manual contact tracing can mitigate this risk to a degree as contacts, who are known to the index case, will be identified through the manual contract tracing process. The other factor in setting the risk threshold was  to minimise the number of app users asked to isolate unnecessarily.</p>

<p>On 3 occasions since the early adopter phase, based on further modelling, we have adjusted the risk threshold. Based on insights from modelling and updating of the algorithm, we have been able to lower the risk threshold, yet maintain the same accuracy for high risk interactions. This has allowed us to reduce the number of isolation alerts sent unnecessarily.</p>

<h4>Risk Algorithm – Calculating the Risk of infection</h4>

<p>Five factors are used to calculate the risk of infection from a contact between app users.</p>

<p>The following factors are approximated by the GAEN and used by the app to determine the risk of infection from contact with an app user with COVID-19.</p>

<ul>
  <li>infectiousness of index case at time of encounter</li>
  <li>distance related factor</li>
  <li>duration related factor</li>
</ul>

<p>Two factors are set as a default for app users as part of the privacy protections in place and limitations of the technology (BLE).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Weighting associated with potentially affected user (e.g. age)</li>
  <li>Context adjusting factor (e.g. indoors / outdoors)</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst these two factors are important the app does not account for them and they are set to a default that is the same for all app users and contexts, as the app  cannot determine whether you are indoors or outdoors.
An index case is an app user who has tested positive for COVID-19, updated their app and chosen to share their diagnosis key. Their infectiousness is calculated from the onset of symptoms data which, where available is provided along with the diagnosis keys. Our understanding of the virus that causes COVID-19 is that infectiousness is at its maximum as symptoms are about to start. Providing the onset of symptoms data alongside the Diagnosis Key allows this to be factored into the risk calculation.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11057.pdf" class="govuk-link">Risk score is a combination of these factors, as detailed here</a>.</p>

<h2>Use of the app by children</h2>

<p>The app will be available to children between the ages of 16 to 18. We refer to these as young app users.
The existing features of the app and messaging are appropriate for young users. We have undertaken user research and engagement with key stakeholders. We have also used the ICO’s age Appropriate Design Code to support our design choices. To help mitigate any potential risk of self-isolation advice or a copy of test results causing anxiety for young users, alerts have been adapted for all users to include text that if they are under the age of 18 they are advised to show the message to a trusted adult.</p>

<p>All app users will be supported by links from the app to details about other services in the NHS Test and Trace programme, in England, and those determined by NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS), in Wales.</p>

<p>All app users are asked to confirm is they are 16 or over during loading of the app. This is a manual confirmation with no external validation. The response is not collected. If the app user confirm they are under the appropriate age for the app they will receive an appropriate message and be unable to continue using the app.</p>

<h3>Necessity and proportionality</h3>

<p>We revisited the necessity and proportionality review undertaken for older app users in light of the app’s use by young app users. Our conclusion was that processing is in the best interest of the young app users. The app is a key part of the country’s ongoing COVID-19 response, aiming to extend the speed, precision and reach of the existing NHS Test and Trace service.</p>

<p>The app has been trialled for early adopters aged 18 or above. There are approximately 1.3 million 16 to 17-year olds across England and Wales, with access to smartphones.</p>

<p>Extending the availability of the app to users aged 16 to 17 years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provides access to information and potentially notification of exposure in their day-to-day lives which they can use to protect themselves and others;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>allows young app users to benefit from the features of the app to reduce their personal and public risk, helping control the spread of the virus;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enable them to engage with every aspect of the NHS Test and Trace service, from ordering a test through to accessing the right guidance and advice;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>access the functions of the app and support the government’s management of the COVID-19 public health emergency</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional data flows and data items collected about young app users</h3>

<p>There are no additional data flows or data items associated with young app users.</p>

<h3>Privacy notice for young app users</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-covid-19-app-privacy-information/nhs-covid-19-app-privacy-notice-for-young-people">privacy notice for the app will account for young app users either within the existing document or in supplementary material and will be published</a>.</p>

<h3>Privacy risks for young app users</h3>

<p>The controls of privacy risks in place to protect all app users are equally applicable to young app users. The app is not considered to pose additional privacy risks and safeguards are in place to allow the deletion of data held on the phone. This includes the ability to delete specific venue check-ins. Notifications with self-isolation messaging advise users under 18 to show the message to a trusted adult, it is up to the young app user to decide if this is appropriate.</p>

<p>Privacy risks, controls and mitigations are under ongoing review to ensure that they are appropriate and robust.</p>

<h3>Age appropriate code</h3>

<p>We have adhered to the principles set out in the Information Commissioner’s Office age appropriate design code for young app users.</p>

<h3>Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR)</h3>

<p>There are no additional considerations with respect to young app users for PECR.</p>

<h3>Automated Decision Making (GDPR, Article 22)</h3>

<p>As noted in the section Automated Decision Making, we have decided to take all the relevant steps and implement all the appropriate protections to comply with Article 22 as if it were engaged.</p>

<p>Recital 71 states that automated decision-making within the definition of Article 22 should not concern children. However, this is not a prohibition.  It is considered that the essential contact tracing function of the app and advice for users to self-isolate should apply to 16 and 17-year-old users in the same way that it applies to adults.</p>

<p>For the purposes of its effective compliance with the requirements of Article 22, the measures put in place to safeguard the rights of adult users will also apply to young app users Notifications to the effect that any user is advised to self-isolate include the message that users under the age of 18, are advised to show the message to a trusted adult.</p>

<p>In accordance with section 2A of the NHS Act 2006, any use of automated decision making here is justified as it is appropriate for the purpose of protecting public health.</p>

<h2>Working with other health service digital contact tracing apps (interoperability)</h2>

<p>To further disrupt the spread and transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19), several jurisdictions are working together to deliver Exposure Notifications where an app user has moved between jurisdictions or app users from different jurisdictions have interacted.</p>

<p>As all the relevant apps are using the same digital contact tracing, the GAEN, the functionality can support app users across jurisdictions whilst still protecting their privacy and identity. This process will involve sharing of Diagnosis Keys between these jurisdictions subject to controls, assurance and ongoing oversight.</p>

<p>The jurisdictions currently involved are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Within the Common Travel Area:
i.	Northern Ireland
ii.	Scotland
iii.	Wales
iv.	England 
v.	Bailiwick of Jersey, which is a British Crown Dependency, as part of the Channel Islands</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additional jurisdictions:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>i.	Gibraltar, which is a British Overseas Territory</p>

<p>It is intended to include Republic of Ireland, which is part of the Common Travel Area, as soon as is appropriate.
The jurisdictions have adopted an Interoperability Agreement.</p>

<p>This agreement sets out the expectations and obligations on each jurisdiction and how they intend to deliver this support for app users. There are additional written agreements and controls to support the appropriate, accurate and secure transfer of diagnosis keys between those jurisdictions.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/107651/interoperability_diagram.png" alt=""></div>
<figcaption><p>Interoperability diagram</p></figcaption></figure>

<h3>Necessity and proportionality</h3>

<p>The provision of interoperability supports the necessity and proportionality argument for the app and its use of data. By providing anonymised diagnosis keys to other jurisdictions we maintain the privacy of app users while supporting appropriate health alerts. What will be shared is the minimum data necessary to support interoperability. See section necessity and proportionality for more information</p>

<h3>User choice (within the NHS COVID-19 app)</h3>

<p>As set out within this DPIA, when a user receives a positive COVID-19 test result and their app status is updated, they are prompted to share their diagnosis keys. If they give permission, these diagnosis keys are submitted to the central system where they are added to the list of diagnosis keys provided to all app users. Users will be informed that we will provide their keys to the other locations as listed to support the digital contact tracing across jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The use of the data will support the purposes of the digital contact tracing functionality and response to the COVID-19 Public Health emergency across these jurisdictions. It will be subject to the controls in use by each jurisdictions and obligations owed to app users.</p>

<h3>Data subject rights</h3>

<p>There are no impacts on data subject rights arising from interoperability. However, the NHS COVID-19 app is committed to be fair and transparent with app users. We will communicate interoperability to its app users through the app, the privacy notice and by providing details within the Data Protection Impact Assessment.</p>

<h3>Additional processing to support Interoperability</h3>

<p>In addition to being provided to all NHS COVID-19 app users in England and Wales, as part of a set of reference data, that the app uses to assess whether a user needs to be alerted to an increased risk, interoperability requires the following additional steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>each jurisdiction will upload their diagnosis keys to a federated server</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>each jurisdiction will have a distinct area within the federated servers for the keys they upload</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they will ensure that the diagnosis keys are submitted securely from each jurisdiction and can then be made available to other jurisdictions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>jurisdictions within the interoperability agreement will download Diagnosis Keys from Federated Servers on a regular basis to their app support systems. For the NHS COVID-19 app these systems are detailed in this DPIA</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the diagnosis keys are then provided to each jurisdiction’s app users as part of their existing Digital Contact Tracing via the GAEN functionality</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The process preserves the privacy and identity of app users from each other and from the government’s providing the service. Further details are available in each jurisdiction privacy information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>storage of the diagnosis keys from the Federated Server will align with broader retention for each app</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The NHS COVID-19 app retention of diagnosis keys is detailed in the section on retention and we will keep all Diagnosis Keys for period noted.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As noted elsewhere, no IP address will be submitted with the diagnosis keys to the Federated Server by any party. Controls within the NHS COVID-19 app for the removal of IP addresses can be found in this DPIA.</p>

<p>Processes will ensure that the diagnosis keys are made available to other jurisdictions in a format that supports digital contact tracing and accounts for changes to the GAEN or associated Operating Systems.</p>

<p>In addition to the diagnosis keys, jurisdictions will work to together to ensure that the systems are safe, secure and accurate. This will involve providing data to support appropriate oversight, access controls and technical requirements such as synchronisation. These are not derived from app users or related to the Diagnosis Key but would for instance, indicate the number of diagnosis keys submitted by each jurisdiction each day. These analytics do not relate to app users, or meet the definition of personal data, as no partner jurisdiction can identify an individual from them.</p>

<p>In order to support the use of digital contact tracing apps based on the GAEN across jurisdictions, work is underway to assess and minimise the amount of data required. As additional partners are considered, the potential amount of data from providing diagnosis keys may increase. In order to reduce the cost or impact on an app user’s data allowance whilst travelling, we are looking to minimise these impacts. For example, only providing app users with diagnosis keys submitted from jurisdictions that are relevant to them. Further work is underway in this area.</p>

<h3>Interoperability assurance and oversight</h3>

<p>Though diagnosis keys are considered anonymous data items, the supporting assurance and technical oversight will manage the data to the standard expected by GDPR. This will include ongoing governance, an agreed technical protocol between all parties and an ongoing process of testing and assurance. This will cover the federated server(s) used noting requirements for business continuity and disaster recovery to ensure a consistent and predictable service between parties.</p>

<h3>Legal Basis for providing this service in England and Wales</h3>

<p>The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has powers to protect public health which include the provision of mobile applications; this is underpinned by section 2A of the NHS Act 2007 which provides the power. The processing of diagnosis keys is strictly necessary to delivering health care to app users.</p>

<p>Welsh Ministers entered in an agreement with the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care under section 83 of the Government of Wales Act 2006. This agreement covers the provision of a Contact Tracing Application, the NHS COVID-19 app, in Wales.</p>

<p>Providing alerts from Contact Tracing Applications, utilising the same GAEN functionality, supports these legal duties towards citizens and enables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the appropriate management of public health incidents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the issuing of advice and guidance to members of public to enable them take appropriate action and seek clinical interventions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For interoperability, these diagnosis keys will only be relevant where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The app user has interacted with an app user from another jurisdiction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functionality of the app determines that it is appropriate for the user be alerted</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Details of the process for this app can be found in this DPIA and published material.</p>

<h3>Compliance with information law</h3>

<p>Whilst the data shared with other jurisdictions is considered anonymous, the following assessment was undertaken.</p>

<p>The sharing of the diagnosis keys with other jurisdictions supports the following purposes and functions of the app.</p>

<h4>Purposes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Digital Contract Tracing</li>
  <li>Receive notifications if they have been near another app user who tests positive for coronavirus (when appropriate)</li>
  <li>Driving safer behaviour by helping people manage their risk exposure</li>
  <li>Identifying and alerting known and unknown contacts when transmission may have occurred</li>
</ul>

<h4>Function (as relevant to PECR)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>digital contact tracing (relevant to PECR)</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant key objectives of the app, supported by interoperability, include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>create an enduring new medical technology to manage public health</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>promote behaviour change by helping people manage their risk exposure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify and inform people to help communities manage public health emergencies</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>GDPR Article 6</h3>

<p>Where personal data is processed by the NHS COVID-19 app, the following lawful basis applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GDPR Article 6(1)(e) – the processing is necessary for the performance of its official tasks carried out in the public interest in providing and managing a health service</li>
</ul>

<p>Interoperability through Diagnosis Keys, noting the key is not personal data as defined by GDPR, is in line with this basis for processing.</p>

<h3>GDPR Article 9</h3>

<p>Where special categories personal data is processed by the NHS COVID-19 app, the following lawful basis applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>GDPR Article 9(2)(g) – the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest in the basis set out in Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (para 6 (Statutory and government purposes))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GDPR Article 9(2)(h) – the processing is necessary for medical diagnosis, the provision of health treatment and management of a health and social care system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GDPR Article 9(2)(i) – the processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Interoperability through diagnosis keys, noting the key is not personal data as defined by GDPR, is in line with this basis for processing.</p>

<h3>Automated Decision Making (ADM), GDPR Article 22</h3>

<p>There are no additional considerations with regard to ADM with the inclusion of Diagnosis Keys from other jurisdictions.</p>

<h3>Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR)</h3>

<p>Regulation 6 of PECR governs the use of data; there are no additional requirements as a consequence of interoperability and sharing of Diagnosis Keys. As noted, the use of this data is strictly necessary for the Digital contact tracing detailed in this DPIA.</p>

<h3>Data Protection Act 2018, Schedule 1</h3>

<p>Where special categories personal data is processed by the NHS COVID-19 app, the following lawful basis applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>DPA 2018 – Schedule 1, Part 1, Section 2(2)(f) – the management of health care systems or services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DPA 2018 – Schedule 1, Part 1, Section 3 – public health purposes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Interoperability through Diagnosis Keys, noting the key is not personal data as defined by GDPR, is in line with this basis for processing.</p>

<h3>Common Law Duty of Confidentiality</h3>

<p>The diagnosis key, as it is associated with a positive COVID-19 test for an app user, will be treated as if a common law duty of confidentiality is owed when used by the NHS COVID-19 app. This is regardless of the point of origin of the diagnosis key. See the <a href="#confidential" class="govuk-link">section on ‘confidential patient information’</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Human Rights Act</h3>

<p>With regards to the right of privacy, Article 8, interoperability contributes to the objectives and supports the protections of privacy. Further Human Rights considerations of interoperability are in line with the broader assessment and purpose of the app.</p>

<h2>Retention of data from the app</h2>

<p>Diagnosis keys are retained on the user’s phone for 14 days and are then deleted (14 days is the incubation period for the virus). Submitted diagnosis keys are retained on the DHSC secure computing infrastructure for 14 days and then deleted. So, the maximum age of a diagnosis key that has been distributed to DHSC secure computing infrastructure is 28 days.</p>

<p>QR codes that are scanned by the user when visiting venues are automatically deleted after 21 days. This is to take into account the 14-day incubation period, and 7-day infectious period of the virus.</p>

<p>The retention period for analytics data is subject to confirmation. As the data is anonymous, GDPR Article 5(e) which requires that personal data is kept in identifiable form for no longer than is necessary, is not engaged.</p>

<h3>Retention of data sets outside of Data Protection Legislation</h3>

<p>Data submitted by app users will not contain direct, indirect or consistent identifiers meaning that retention should not be considered in the context of GDPR. However, retention of data sets and records needs to be set even where it does not constitute personal data. This applies to the analytical data noted above.</p>

<p>Retention of records associated with the app are likely to fall into 2 categories, records which are used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>hold organisations to account is held for 8 years;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>monitor communicable diseases, for example in the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, are retained for 5 years (if they contain personal data which is not the case in this instance) and 20 years for anonymous data prior to any review</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Retention for these records is governed by the relevant Section 46 Code of Practice, Public Records Act and statutory duties of the organisations accountable (the Department of Health and Social Care).</p>

<h2>Subjects’ rights</h2>

<h3>Data held on DHSC secure computing infrastructure</h3>

<p>As described in the section above, the personal data processed on DHSC secure computing infrastructure (i.e. the test code and test result) does not enable identification of a data subject by the controller. In order to respond to a subjects’ rights request DHSC would need to associate additional information with the data held. This would undermine the privacy controls that we have incorporated.</p>

<p>Under GDPR Article 11(1) a controller is not obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information for the sole purpose of complying with the Regulation – e.g. responding to subjects’ rights requests. On this basis we will respond to requests made in relation to data held on DHSC secure computing infrastructure that we are unable to provide the information as the exemption in Article 11(1) applies.</p>

<h3>Data held on the phone</h3>

<h3>Subject access and right to erasure</h3>

<p>We have discussed in previous versions of the app the importance for individuals to exercise their rights, specifically the right to access the information held about them.</p>

<p>To access this information, the user selects the ‘About contact tracing’ menu item, then in the ‘Your data’ section selects ‘Manage data’. From here all data held is displayed. At the bottom, the red text ‘Delete all my data’ can be selected. There is a prompt to check this action on the next screen.</p>

<p>This user flow is displayed below. These screens may slightly differ from those actually within the app.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/102897/PN_image_4.png" alt=""></div>
<figcaption><p>Subject access and right to erasure user flow</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Users may also uninstall the app at any time, at which time all the data held on the phone is erased. Should the user have submitted diagnosis keys these will be deleted from the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database within 14 days as a matter of routine.</p>

<h3>Subjects’ rights - summary</h3>

<h4>How will you action requests from individuals (or someone acting on their behalf) for access to their personal information?</h4>

<p>Subject access requests will be facilitated by a feature of the app to present personal data held in the App on the phone. This will include: the postcode district you have entered, the local authority you have selected, the venues you have captured via the check in, symptoms onset date and your most recent test result.</p>

<p>No personal data can be retrieved from the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database. As above, this is only the test code and result, and the exemption in Article 11(1) is engaged.</p>

<h4>How would you locate all personal data relevant to an individual?</h4>

<p>All personal data that can be provided to app users will be on their phones.</p>

<h4>What is the procedure for this system to responding to data subject’s request to be forgotten – Article 17</h4>

<p>Users can delete the personal data associated with the venues they have checked into and their most recent test result. They may also uninstall the App from their phone at any time which will cause deletion of all personal data from the device. As noted above, new functionality allows app users to delete individual venues from their phone.</p>

<p>Personal data will not cascade to the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database.  The diagnosis keys are deleted after 14 days automatically. However, diagnosis keys away from the user’s phone are not considered personal data</p>

<h4>Article 16 – Right to rectification</h4>

<p>Not available – controller does not have access to the personal data on the phone. If a user disagrees with a test result, they will need to contact the test provider.</p>

<h4>Article 18 – Right to restriction of processing</h4>

<p>Not available – controller does not have access to personal data on the phone.</p>

<h4>Article 19 – Notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing</h4>

<p>Not available – controller does not have access to personal data on the phone.</p>

<h4>Article 20 – Right to data portability</h4>

<p>This right is not available because the processing is not based on consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a); or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6(1)(b).</p>

<h4>Article 21 – Right to object</h4>

<p>Available by uninstalling app. As well as the choice to use functionality, such as the venue check-in, and the ability to delete the data held by the app.</p>

<h4>Article 22 – Automated individual decision-making including profiling</h4>

<p>See discussion above.</p>

<h2>Human rights</h2>

<p>Human rights are a key consideration for an app that may involve millions of users and the management of the COVID-19 Public Health emergency. However, the advice to app users are not enforced by the app and are set by broader Public Health Policy. A human rights review has been carried out by the programme and is summarised here.</p>

<p>Whilst the ECHR and HRA does not enshrine rights as absolute, especially in the context of a public health emergency and pandemic, the app continues to uphold those rights and where possible support them in the context of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Rights that have been considered include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ECHR Article 8 – respect for private and family life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ECHR Article 5 – right to liberty</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ECHR Article 2 – right to life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ECHR Article 11 – right to freedom of association</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ECHR Article 9 – right to freedom of religion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ECHR Article 14 – prohibition of discrimination</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Workstreams to support human rights obligations and agenda include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>policy, strategy and communication work streams that directly address, consider or contribute</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the equalities and health inequalities work, related to the DHSC legal duties under the relevant statutes and various policies</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Public health purposes and value of the app</h2>

<p>The app is intended to influence the behaviours of a proportion of the public sufficient to alter the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak. By providing alerts and monitoring app users’ proximity to those who present a risk of infection or may be at risk of infection, this is intended to alter the behaviour of a proportion of those groups.</p>

<p>The app will give citizens maximum freedom with minimal risk during a public health emergency by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>driving safer behaviour by helping people manage their risk exposure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identifying and alerting known and unknown contacts when transmission may have occurred</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enabling users to isolate and test to reduce transmission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supporting and informing users during isolation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>creating an enduring new medical technology to manage public health emergencies</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In doing so, it will contribute to the objective of the Test and Trace programme: breaking the chains of transmission by minimising the frequency and extent of the COVID-19 outbreaks, to enable society to return to a more normal way of life.</p>

<p>The app will also provide information to support the tactical and strategic management of the COVID response.</p>

<h2>Overview of the functionality of the NHS COVID-19 app</h2>

<p>Each of these features is summarised below, including overall description, pointer to the appropriate user journey in the relevant annex, summary of data flows, list of requirements gathered which determined this feature.</p>

<p>User flow diagrams for each of these features can be found in annexes 1 to 6 of the data protection impact assessment.</p>

<h3>Digital contact tracing: Exposure Windows</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>As Apple and Google continue to improve their digital contact tracing system (the “GAEN” or Google Apple Exposure Notification) there is an increased ability to process data to support the purposes of the app.</p>

<p>With the latest changes, Google and Apple can provide the app team with more detailed technical data. The work done so far, the testing undertaken by the app team, and the analytical data set, has allowed the risk algorithm used by the app to be improved.</p>

<p>This allows the app to more accurately identify when an app user is at risk of infection and when they should isolate. Work undertaken by the app’s data science team was shared and checked with colleagues around the world. This has improved the <a class="govuk-link" href="#riskalgorithm">risk algorithm</a> we use, that is used to generate a risk score and the risk threshold. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#riskthreshold">section on risk threshold</a> for more information.</p>

<p>We have continued to carefully consider the potential impacts on privacy and risk of any change, such as the risk of reidentification, the app continues to preserve the privacy of the app user. The app will never and cannot track you.</p>

<p>This refinement, utilising Mode 2 of the GAEN, is an improvement but the extra detail available in the Exposure Window set will help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evaluate how the app is working</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what impacts the app is having on the chains of transmission of COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what we can learn about the infectiousness of the COVID-19 from the data provide by app users</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are processed by the GAEN as part of the Exposure Window functionality and associated data sets, the “Exposure Windows” and “Scan Instances”. Apple and Google have made these data sets available to those using their digital contact tracing including the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>

<p>GAEN Mode 2 and the Event Analytical Data set of Exposure Windows data sets support these objectives and key purposes of the app:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>promote behaviour change by helping people manage their risk exposure by improving the accuracy of alerts;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify and inform people to help communities manage public health emergencies by contributing to knowledge about COVID-19 infection and risk of infection through the analysis of the Exposure Window data;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support and inform users during isolation through this improved functionality and analysis.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The GAEN provides digital contact tracing to enable app users to support the wider response to the COVID-19 public health emergency.</p>

<p>The relevant design objectives are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helping the community (analytics)</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant purposes of the app as set out in the DPIA:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>COVID-19 symptom identification and monitoring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alerting users if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or been to a high-risk location or area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>responding to the public health emergency</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant primary purposes of the app are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to alert users when they have come into proximity with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to support decision-making and advice to meet public health demands regarding the COVID-19 public health emergency</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to enable public health management and provide information to app users’, the public and those managing public health</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This section sets out how the Exposure Window processes data and how it supports the objectives and purposes of the app.</p>

<p>We have updated <a href="#appendix5" class="govuk-link">Appendix 5</a> User Data Journeys with examples of the Exposure Window process.</p>

<h4>How Exposure Windows Work (Processing of data)</h4>

<p>The Exposure Window works as part of the Exposure Logging and Exposure Notification which is described in the section on <a href="#DCT" class="govuk-link">digital contact tracing</a>.</p>

<p>The key is the sharing of broadcast codes, or RPIs, with other app users which enables, through cryptocracy, for data but not identity to be shared between app users.</p>

<p>The Exposure Window, Exposure Logging and Exposure Notification process becomes relevant once an app user gets a COVID-19 test result.</p>

<h4>Step 1. Updating Your App with your COVID-19 status</h4>

<p>The app user receives their test result and updates their app</p>

<ul>
  <li>For app users who begin their testing journey in the app, this occurs automatically</li>
  <li>For others, they will need to add their test result to the app</li>
</ul>

<p>If the app user has tested positive for COVID-19 they are prompted to share their Diagnosis Keys.</p>

<p>For other app users, they will be prompted for relevant advice (for example, if they need to seek a further test or can end their self-isolation).</p>

<h4>Step 2. Sharing your Diagnosis Keys with onset of symptoms data</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Choosing to share Diagnosis Keys allows other app users to be alerted if appropriate</li>
  <li>This will include the Diagnosis Keys for all the relevant days and the onset of symptoms data;</li>
  <li>The Diagnosis Keys are sent to the central system</li>
  <li>They are added to the reference list of Diagnosis Keys provided to all app users
    <ul>
      <li>This is updated approximately every 2-hours (allowing prompt but not instantaneous notification)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3. Matching Diagnosis Keys and Broadcast Codes</h4>

<p>Each app, technically within the GAEN functionality, reviews the Diagnosis Keys in the reference list;</p>

<p>If any broadcast codes held can be derived from a Diagnosis Key, then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the app user has been in touch with an index case (i.e. another app user with COVID-19)</li>
  <li>the app will calculate the risk of infection using the risk algorithm and the details held about the Exposure</li>
  <li>if the calculated risk, risk score, is above the risk threshold then the app will alert the app user and provide advice (for example, to self-isolate)</li>
</ul>

<p>The data used for this calculation includes the Exposure Window and Scan Instance data sets.</p>

<p>The Exposure Window data set captures, for a 30-minute period.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The date of the exposure (date)</li>
  <li>List of the Scan Instances within the Exposure Window (List of Scan Instances)</li>
  <li>The Risk Score version (Risk score version) for the Exposure Window to understand the basis of the calculation and which algorithm was used</li>
</ul>

<p>This is used to check that the appropriate risk algorithm was used, and the calculated risk score</p>

<ul>
  <li>Infectiousness of Index Case (Diagnosis Key) based on the date of the interaction between the users and the onset of symptoms data for the Index Case</li>
  <li>The Risk Score produced</li>
</ul>

<p>Within each Exposure Window, the Scan Instances data sub-set captures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A minimum distance measure (minAttenuation) approximated via BLE signal strength</li>
  <li>The typical distance measure (Typicalattenuation)</li>
  <li>Duration (Timesincelastscan) the seconds elapsed since the previous Scan Instances</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither the Exposure Window or Scan Instance data sets can or are attributed to any app user or to the two app users involved in the interaction by the NHS COVID-19 app and its supporting systems.</p>

<h4>Step 4. Submitting the Exposure Window and Scan Instance data sets</h4>

<p>Where an Exposure Window is generated it will be uploaded to the apps support systems, held on DHSC Secure Infrastructure; see section <a href="#security" class="govuk-link">‘security of processing’</a> for more information</p>

<p>The GAEN functionality determines when the Exposure Window are sent to the Product Environment, this process uses a number of privacy-preserving techniques to protect the identity of app users. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Within a 24-hour period randomising when the Exposure Windows are sent (preserving the privacy of app users by preventing any allocation of a time to an interaction between users)</li>
  <li>Ensuring that no identifiers are associated with either app user, including the Diagnosis Key</li>
  <li>Further privacy preservation techniques are undertaken once the Exposure Window data set and contents arrives at the product environment. These are detailed in section <a href="#ew" class="govuk-link">Digital Contact Tracing: Exposure Window</a> and <a href="#appendix5" class="govuk-link">Appendix 5</a>.</li>
  <li>The data is then passed to the app’s analytical environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix5">Appendix 5</a> for User Data Journeys for an example of the data generated as part of app use and interactions with index cases.</p>

<h4>Further Developments of the Exposure Window and Analysis</h4>

<p>The Exposure Window data set offers further support to key purposes of the NHS COVID-19 app as well as determining the effectiveness of digital contact tracing in the current public health context.
These developments will:</p>

<p>Capture Exposure Windows where both app users have updated their app with a positive COVID-19 test, with the index case having shared their Diagnosis Keys</p>

<ul>
  <li>In addition to other purposes, this change helps understand if the app is breaking lines of transmission for app users and getting a sense of the scale of the impact</li>
  <li>This data set will likely add a data item to indicate the app user has updated their status with a positive test result</li>
</ul>

<p>For the full evaluation of the data sets and how they align with the apps purposes and the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations (PECR), see the data dictionary in Annex A.</p>

<h4>Relevant Data Flow</h4>

<p>The Exposure Window data sets will be sent to the Product Environment, which supports the NHS COVID-19 app. This will be undertaken using the existing Analytics API. Once received into the product environment, checks ensure the privacy of users (see the section on the removal of any IP addresses) and the data is provided into the App Analytical Environment.</p>

<p>There are no new data flows of this data beyond that which is set out in this DPIA.</p>

<h4>Compliance with information law</h4>

<p>As part of assessing any change to the app, a review is undertaken to ensure that the change is within the existing legal framework for the app and supports the existing purposes for the app. How the Exposure Window data set, and its use in analysis, supports the objectives and purposes of the app is set out above. 
The Exposure Window data set and its use for these purposes falls within the existing legal framework of the app, that is detailed in <a href="#ew" class="govuk-link">the section ‘Digital Contact Tracing: Exposure Windows’</a>.</p>

<h4>Assessments of PECR (Digital contact tracing)</h4>

<p>The data set is strictly necessary for the digital contact tracing and Public health response management function of the app, which is relevant to PECR, see the <a href="#PECR" class="govuk-link">section PECR</a> for updates on the data items used to support these functions.</p>

<h4>Automated decision making and Article 22 (GDPR) requirements</h4>

<p>See section on <a href="#ADM" class="govuk-link">automated decision making</a> above which outlines the app’s position about Automated Decision Making. The introduction of GAEN Mode 2 changes parts of method of risk calculation and the risk algorithm used but does not change the existing policy or approach to the recommendation provided by the app.</p>

<p>It falls in line with the power of the Secretary of State outlined in the section above and that processing remains necessary for substantial public interest, within the conditions set out in paragraph 6 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

<h4>Necessity and proportionality</h4>

<p>The collection of this additional data items within the central informatics system is deemed necessary and proportionate to support the key purposes of the app as well as permit the evaluation of the app’s effectiveness in providing digital contact tracing and its impact upon public health.</p>

<p>The use of the Exposure Window data set alongside the Analytical Data Set provides the best modelling of the risk of infection and ensures that the recommendation for isolate are accurate and appropriate. The scientific team that supports the app can use the data collected to improve the understanding of the risk of infection, how different factors (such as time, distance and infectiousness of the index case) interact to create this risk and to continue to improve the app’s performance.</p>

<p>In addition, the data allows the app’s performance and impact to be evaluated and enables the risk algorithm (the calculation of the risk of infectiousness), the risk score and the risk threshold (the score required to trigger a recommendation to isolate) to be scrutinized.</p>

<p>Given the protections in place to protect the privacy of users and effectively anonymise their identity, the use of this data is proportionate to the purpose set out for the app. The data set maintains the key conditions of the use of data and is necessary to deliver and evaluate the purposes for the app.</p>

<p>For more information on the risk algorithm, risk score and risk threshold see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#riskthreshold">section on the risk threshold</a>.</p>

<h3>Real-time high-risk area matches (alert)</h3>

<p>The app will give users the ability to view the current risk level in the local authority they live in based on the postcode district and local authority entered during the registration process. It will also alert them to any changes in this and provide advice on what users should do next to get further information and guidance.</p>

<p>Risk levels and alerts will be sourced from the Local Authority Watchlist determined by the Secretary of State for Health and Care drawing on epidemiological advice from the CMO, NHS Test and Trace, Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) and Public Health England. It identifies Local Authorities of greatest concern across the country.</p>

<p>The watchlist is produced by first considering the lower tier local authorities with the highest incidence rate and its trend, combined with a range of other indicators including the test positivity rate, an assessment of the local response and plans, and the trend of other metrics such as healthcare activity and mortality. The classification decision is therefore a blended assessment drawing on professional judgement. There are further details regarding <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/local-lockdown" rel="external">alerts for app users in Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-levels-what-you-need-to-know">for app users in England</a>.</p>

<p>To determine local risk levels and generate alerts, the app will match the postcode district users enter on registering for the app to the local authority in which that district resides. The user will then confirm the local authority matched to the postcode district is correct.</p>

<p>There are 343 local authorities in England and 22 local authorities in Wales, so the risk of identifying specific individuals from assessments formed at this level is extremely low.</p>

<figcaption><p>Diagram 1: alert architecture</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Summary of requirements which led to this feature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there must be an alert if the user’s postcode district is no longer risky</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the app must store the postcode district locally in an encrypted way to ensure of the user’s privacy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current risk level for the user’s postcode district must be shown on the home screen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the app must check the user’s stored postcode district against a provided cluster of known high-risk postcode districts in order to determine the current risk level for the user’s postcode district</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the user must be notified if the risk level for the postcode district stored in the app changes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the user must be able to enter the postcode district (first 2-4 characters of postcode) in the onboarding journey of the app. This step is mandatory</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Digital check-in diary (venue check-in)</h3>

<p>Users will be able to ‘check in’ to a venue via the app. The user must have the NHS COVID-19 App installed (they cannot use native, or other, QR apps for this feature).</p>

<p>Venues across a wide range of settings will be encouraged to support this capability, including workplaces, restaurants, pubs, leisure facilities and anywhere else where groups of people are likely to gather. If any of these venues are later confirmed as the source of a COVID-19 outbreak, users who visited them during a specified period time will receive an alert from the app advising them of this and what they should do next. Discussions are currently underway with PHE to agree the content and form of this advice.</p>

<p>The app will give users the ability to collate a ‘Digital Diary’ of locations they have been to over the last 21 days stored locally on their device. Users will create this via the QR code feature to ‘check-in’ to venues they visit and record the date and time they arrived. They will also have the ability to delete this data.</p>

<p>The app and its venue check-in and alert capability will align with the following high-level summary of the process for identifying, confirming and responding to local outbreaks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Health Protection teams (HPT) identify and plan an appropriate response to COVID-19 outbreaks in their region working with local authorities</li>
  <li>To do this they receive data from manual contact tracing, and local sources</li>
  <li>Health Protection Teams (HPTs) and Local Authorities investigate and follow up if required to form an assessment of whether it is an outbreak and what measures are needed to contain it</li>
  <li>HPTs record details of outbreaks in the dedicated web application (called HPZone)</li>
  <li>Once checked that an alert is appropriate for a venue by the administrative team, details of these outbreaks (QR code, date and time window) are entered into the app system. It will broadcast a message to each instance of the app that triggers an alert for any app users who had been to that venue during a specific timeframe and could therefore have been at risk of exposure</li>
</ul>

<p>This process was updated to better support Health Protection Teams and reduce the administrative impact upon them. The data from the HPZone systems and used by Health Protection Teams are used to understand the nature of the public health emergency and learn about potential outbreaks or patterns. The use of this data falls outside of this scope of this DPIA. The process above, updated since the publication of the last DPIA does not result in any more data being processed by the app or the supporting services.</p>

<p>Details of where a user has checked-in to are recorded securely on the device and are not shared with the App backend system or database. Data from this service cannot, therefore, be used to either track movement over time or re-identify the user. This data can also be deleted by the user.</p>

<figcaption><p>Diagram 2: venue check-in architecture</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Summary of requirements which led to this feature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To be compliant with Apple’s terms and conditions the scanned venues must be automatically and permanently deleted from the device after a maximum of 28 days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be compliant with Apple’s terms and conditions a readable list of captured venues must be readily visible to the user within the app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be compliant with Apple’s terms and conditions and for privacy reasons, all records of venue check-in activities are kept exclusively on the device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The venue name, ID and rounded check-in and check-out time must be shown in the venue history in “my data”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The venue name and exact check-in time must be shown in the check-in confirmation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must store the following information: venue ID, venue name, timestamp of check-in (rounded down to last completed quarter), timestamp of check-out (rounded up to next completed quarter).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be possible to suppress alerts about infected venues by a “circuit breaker” on the backend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be an option to cancel a check-in to cover the case that the user accidentally scans a wrong QR code (e.g. fake poster).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of days the venue code is stored must be configurable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must provide automatic check-out options for visited venues. In v3/MVP check-out happens automatically at midnight or when there is a check-in to another venue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The user must be notified in case of a visited venue reporting high infection risk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must regularly check the stored user’s venue codes for high-risk venues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must securely store the scanned QR codes for a time configurable by the backend. The initial value is 21 days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The user must be asked to grant permission to use camera for QR-code scan.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must enable QR code scanning from within the app and also when offline since connectivity might be limited at some venues.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Symptoms questionnaire (symptoms)</h3>

<p>The app will allow the user to report the symptoms they are suffering with and the date of when they started. Based on which of the symptoms they have selected from a list, the user will receive an initial indication as to whether they may have coronavirus. If the user’s symptoms indicate they may have coronavirus, they will be asked to self-isolate and book a test.</p>

<p>The symptomatic questions are provided to the app team by the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) based on current epidemiological guidance. The questions and advice are captured in a version-controlled file on the DHSC secure computing infrastructure. As needed symptoms will be updated by the CMO. To capture the latest information, the questionnaire file is periodically synchronised from the back-end servers to make sure users are displayed the latest questions and advice.</p>

<p>For launch the current questionnaire includes the following symptoms: a high temperature (fever), a new continuous cough, a new loss or change to your sense of smell or taste, a runny nose, sneezing, feeling feverish, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite.</p>

<p>For those using the Wales version of the app there will be some differences visit the <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Test, Trace and Protect programme for details</a></p>

<figcaption><p>Diagram 3: symptom checker architecture</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Summary of symptoms checker requirements which led to this feature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If an index case reports symptoms and is asked to isolate, the system should block the symptoms report for the isolation period. (This does not apply to contact cases).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The algorithm evaluating the reported symptoms must be executed on the device in order to minimise the amount of data exchanged between the app and backend, and to ensure the backend is not considered a medical device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The user needs to give their permission every time any data reported on the symptoms report questionnaire is uploaded to the backend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of the questionnaire must be determined using a fixed algorithm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The symptoms report questionnaire must be configurable without the user having to update the app in order to quickly adapt to changes in policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The default date for the symptoms onset in case users don’t remember the date must be configurable as policy may change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The symptoms report questionnaire must contain a date for the onset of (all) symptoms in order to determine the remaining self-isolation period for the index case and to determine which contacts need to receive an exposure notification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The user must be able to quickly fill out the symptoms report questionnaire in order to increase the number of entries. It should therefore fit on a single page.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Coronavirus test (test)</h3>

<p>A symptomatic app user will be invited to click a link from the iOS and Android applications to launch the testing service. Clicking the link within the app launches an external mobile browser and loads a page within the test registration journey with a unique app reference code (CTA token) passed as a query string parameter in the URL.</p>

<p>An example of this URL is below, where xxxx-xxxx is replaced by the unique CTA token.</p>

<p>https://self-referral.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/antigen/name?ctaToken=xxxx-xxxx</p>

<p>Once the user has been taken to the testing website, they will follow exactly the same journey as users who visit the testing website via a different platform (e.g. computer browser), but the CTA token that was passed to the website will be associated with the test booking. The information captured during the standard test registration journey (such as name, date of birth, phone number, address etc.), will be stored in the relevant testing informatics technology system (NPEx), which is held separately to the app, along with the user’s CTA token. The user will then take their test at a test centre or at home, and the test kit will be sent to a laboratory for processing. The CTA token is not sent to the test lab. The completed lab result (positive, negative or void), will then be sent to NPEx and re-associated with the app user’s details.</p>

<p>If the test result received by NPEx is for a user who has a CTA token associated with their test record, then a three-field JSON file will be sent to the mobile application back end. The three fields are included in each file sent – the CTA token, the test result (positive, negative, void) and the hour range in which a test result was received.
The mobile application will poll the app back end to confirm whether a test result has been received. Once a result is received, it will notify the user whether they have a positive, negative or void test result. If the result is positive, the user will be prompted to share their Diagnosis Keys and enable the appropriate alerts of other app users.</p>

<p>The user journey flow for this feature can be found in annex 1 – risk score user journey.  This is a visual file accessed by clicking a link from the page that also hosts this DPIA.</p>

<p>The data flows relating to the test feature are summarised in the diagram below:</p>

<figcaption><p>Diagram 4: ordering a test architecture</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>In addition to the overall data flow, the following is provided on how tokens will be generated, managed and secured. As per the diagram there are three tokens. All 3 are generated by the cloud service when an app user is recommended a virology test. The Lambda nodes refer to code that presents the respective APIs – listed above.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/102902/PN_image_9.png"></div>
<figcaption><p>Diagram 5 showing how tokens will be generated, managed and secured</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>This includes the diagnosis key submission token, the test result polling token and the CTA token. Three tokens are employed as a security measure so that we do not use the same identifier in multiple locations.</p>

<p>The CTA token is the human readable random code that is displayed to a user and passed to the virology test system.</p>

<p>The test result polling token is the token used by the app to ask the DHSC secure computing infrastructure if the test result has been received yet.</p>

<p>The diagnosis key submission token is used by the app when a user is confirmed to be positive via test and gives permission to sharing their keys, so that the DHSC secure computing infrastructure can be sure the keys do relate to a confirmed positive case.</p>

<p>The Test Polling Token and the Diagnosis Submission Token are generated by the App Services hosted in AWS. They are unique, anonymous codes that are not derived from each other or any other keys, and are not composed of any other identifiers. A secure database within the App Services associates these three tokens (the third being the CTA token). The reason that three different tokens are used is for privacy reasons, so that the knowledge of the CTA token does not allow someone to poll for the results or submit diagnosis keys. All tokens are deleted once the test result has been delivered to the app.</p>

<p>The Test Polling Token, Diagnosis Submission Token and CTA Token are all created when the app asks for a CTA token when a user is recommended to take a test. They are retained in a secure database by the App Services only for as long as needed. All three are sent to the mobile app which stores the tokens in a Secure local store. The app uses the CTA token to pass to the Virology Testing website when recommending a test. The app uses the Test Polling Token when it is asking the App Services in AWS if a test result has been received. When the App Services receive a test result from Virology testing via NPEx, that will include a CTA Token. On receipt of the result the App Services will look up the Test Polling Token linked to the CTA Token and write the result in to a database together with the Test Polling Token. The CTA Token is then deleted. When the app next polls to see if a result is available, passing the Test Polling Token, the App Services will detect a match on Test Polling Token and return the result. The Test Polling Token is then deleted. The app user is then asked to submit their diagnosis keys, and when they do the keys are sent to the App Services together with the Diagnosis Submission Token. This Diagnosis Submission Token is required so the system can be sure that the submitted keys link to a genuine result. Once diagnosis keys are submitted the Diagnosis Submission Token is deleted.</p>

<p>The CTA tokens are unique, randomly generated codes of reasonable complexity, and it would be challenging for a malicious actor to guess a CTA token. If someone modifies the CTA token the most likely result is that the test result will be associated with an invalid CTA Token, which will be rejected when the unknown CTA Token is received from NPEx. In the highly unlikely event that an actor does manage to change the token to another valid CTA Token value that relates to a test currently underway, that would not allow them to access someone else’s result, because they would not have the correct Test Polling Token. What it might mean is that the app user to which that CTA token relates would receive two test results.</p>

<p>Summary of test ordering requirements which led to this feature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The app generates a token whenever the user clicks on “book a test”. This token temporarily links the user’s test result to the app and thereby allows the result to be reported back to the app without entering personal details in the app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The user must be asked for permission before uploading the diagnosis keys stored on the user’s phone. The request for permission is triggered after the user has seen the positive virology test result in the app. In order to avoid turning the app into IVD, it must not be the primary source for reporting the virology test result to the user.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For v3/MVP the app must ensure automatic result retrieval and user notification of the virology test results for all test options connected to MPEX.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must send a token to the virology testing website (in the background) when the user navigates to the website from the app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must allow the order of a test kit and will do this by providing a link to the virology testing homepage from within the app. In v3/MVP this is only provided to users who have reported symptoms in the app and are still in self-isolation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The diagnosis key submission token is used by the app when a user is confirmed to be positive via test and permission to sharing their keys, so that the DHSC secure computing infrastructure can be sure the keys do relate to a confirmed positive case.</p>

<h3>Self-isolation countdown (isolate)</h3>

<p>The app will ask the user to self-isolate either because the user has reported symptoms indicative of coronavirus (the index case), or they have received an exposure notification (the contact case). Once asked to self-isolate, the user will have access to a self-isolation countdown which keeps a track of the time they need to spend self-isolating.</p>

<p>The data flows relating to the Isolation feature do not leave the phone. The date that a user tells us they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms is stored on the phone and used to drive the timing of the advice given. The isolation timing is configurable in a similar mechanism to the symptomatic questionnaire. The only data that is communicated to the back-end services in relation to the isolate feature is an analytics statistic to understand how many app users are currently self-isolating.</p>

<p>The user journey flow for this feature can be found in the relevant annex – isolate user journey</p>

<p>Summary of self-isolation advice requirements which led to this feature</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If multiple test results come through in sequence for a given user, the first negative/positive test result will remove the user from being an index case/a contact case. The user will not be sent back to self-isolation based on later contradicting results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If multiple test results come through at the same time for a given user, only the most recent will be acted upon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must provide the user with information about the remaining self-isolation duration in days. In v3/MVP receiving new encounter notifications must not restart the self-isolation period if the user is already in self-isolation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must regularly check and compare the self-isolation period with the newest configurations based on policies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must alert the user if the remaining self-isolation period has changed or expired.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must use a defined algorithm to determine the self-isolation duration depending on the type and date of the isolation trigger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users can be a contact and index case at the same time. During that time the longer self-isolation period is displayed. The self-isolation countdown may therefore be adapted when a test result arrives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A contact case must not be released from self-isolation by a negative test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The durations of self-isolation for different cases must be configurable by the backend based on policy changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maximum duration for self-isolation must be configurable by the backend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must provide 3 triggers to stop self-isolation: Negative test result (index case only), isolation completed, isolation exceeded maximum duration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app must provide 2 triggers for starting self-isolation: Reported Symptoms (index case), and Exposure Notification (contact case).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Functionality to pause the app exists whereby the Bluetooth-based contact detection can be temporarily disabled. No contacts, or exposure logs, will be made or recorded during the time that the pause is in effect. Users are provided with a clear visual indication on the home screen to indicate that contact detection is disabled.  New functionality allows app users to set a timer when they pause the contact tracing functionality.</p>

<p>The ability to pause the app is provided to ensure that users who are in engaged in close proximity activities and have taken appropriate measures (such as a barber who is wearing a PPE face mask) can prevent erroneous exposure notifications.</p>

<p>Please note that guidance provided by the app can direct users to a website external to the app.</p>

<p>No interaction with the backend services is involved in this feature. Time idle during periods of pause is recorded by the app and submitted as part of the anonymous analytics data. This ensures that appropriate use of this feature can be assessed in aggregate.</p>

<p>These screens may slightly differ from those actually within the app:</p>

<h2>Isolation Support Payment</h2>

<p>The Isolation Support Payment will be known in England as the Test and Trace Support Payment (TTSP) and in Wales as the Self-Isolation Support Scheme (SISS). The Isolation Support Payment functionality allows an app user to start the process to apply for an isolation support payment from the app.</p>

<p>Applying for an isolation support payment places the app user under a legal obligation to self-isolation. This is regardless of whether they are confirmed as eligible for the payment. Information about eligibility is signposted to users from the app.</p>

<p>An app user can apply for isolation support payments when they are advised to isolate as a result of an exposure notification from the app. At the current time, this service from the app exists for England only. Welsh residents can access a site outside the app to apply, until system integration is built. See below for details of how and when the token and details to support the application are produced.</p>

<p>To use this service, England residents will need an NHS log in. If a user does not have one, they are able to create it as part of the process.</p>

<p>When the option is selected to seek financial support, this process will exit the user from the app and will take them to an external site known as the Gateway Portal. Exiting the app to complete the process of exploring eligibility for the isolation support payment, ensures the app does not capture any of the additional detail that is necessary for making an application for support. This preserves user anonymity in the app.</p>

<p>Isolation support payment also has another established process outside the app, which is triggered via manual contact tracing. Whether the process commences inside or outside the app, the individual is directed to the Contact Tracing and Advice Service (CTAS ) system. CTAS records information about people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and their contacts. Next they are directed to their Local Authority to execute payment.</p>

<p>A key point to note is that an app notification to isolate, based on exposure, is not legally enforceable. During the process of applying for an isolation support payment within the CTAS system. However, the instruction to isolate becomes legally enforceable. To ensure this is clear, the Gateway Portal explains this process and will request permission from the user before they can proceed. Once permission is given in the Gateway Portal the legal duty to isolate is established regardless of whether or not the isolation support payment is paid.</p>

<p>An app user may receive a further exposure notification once their previous self-isolation period has completed, if they come into contact with another person who has tested positive, and therefore will need to isolate again. At this point, the app user is able to apply for a further isolation support payment. Provided the periods of self-isolation do not overlap, the process will commence again.</p>

<p>Once the app process to request financial support is started, a unique app reference code for an Isolation Payment Claim (IPC  token) is generated to secure the interaction and data exchange between App, Cloud Services and the Gateway Portal. This portal allows the detail needed by CTAS (Encounter Date and Isolation End Date) to be gathered securely without impacting the privacy of app users.</p>

<p>The IPC token enables two factor authentication to reduce the risk of fraudulent tokens being created. Two factor authentication uses two systems and two different APIs for creating and verifying the token in order for the app user to be passed into the CTAS systems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Factor 1: System “User/App” creates token with Isolation Payment Mobile API (Cloud Services) with Mobile-to-Cloud Services connection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Factor 2: System “SIP Gateway” verifies this token with Isolation Payment Gateway API (Cloud Services) with Gateway-to-Cloud Services connection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The token allows the Cloud Services to associate data with the token, specifically the encounter date and isolation end date. Isolation end date is required to ensure the isolation period is still in effect. The user is encouraged to register for the isolation support payment as soon as possible to support the intended behaviour of isolating. It is important that the app isolation end date and the CTAS end date are identical, otherwise the app isolation period may differ from the legally enforceable isolation period.</p>

<p>The Gateway Portal will verify whether the user is from England or Wales. In Wales, although the IPC token is created, the process cannot progress until the Welsh integration with this solution is built. Therefore after a maximum of 14 days a token from a resident of Wales will be deleted. 14 days is also the maximum retention for an IPC token for an English app user (further details in the table below). Until integration for Wales is built, Welsh residents can access a site outside the app to apply.</p>

<figcaption><p>Diagram showing isolation support payment architecture</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The app recommends the user to self-isolate and displays a button to allow a user to enroll for financial support during this period.</p>

<ul>
  <li>claim: The user pushes the button in the app to seek financial support.</li>
  <li>create: The app calls the Cloud Services (backend) which creates a new Isolation Payment Claim (IPC) token.</li>
  <li>update: The app transfers Encounter Date and Isolation End Date, and retrieves the Gateway URL (web page).</li>
  <li>redirect: The app redirects to the web page (Gateway Portal) which manages the enrolment process on the browser of the mobile device and in this process passes the IPC token.</li>
  <li>verify: The Gateway Portal uses the token to retrieve the Encounter Date and Isolation End Date.</li>
  <li>identify: The Gateway Portal verifies the user with an existing NHS system (NHS Login) which implements multi-factor authentication. If a user does not have an NHS login this process will allow them to create one in order to proceed.</li>
  <li>enroll: The Gateway Portal collects the necessary information to enroll the user to the service and sends the details to the existing CTAS system for processing.</li>
  <li>consume: When the details have been sent to CTAS, the Gateway Portal will call the Cloud Services delete the token.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Gateway Portal has an audit log where the tokens, timestamps and interactions with the other systems will be logged. No personal user information whatsoever will be logged or stored on the TTSP Gateway.</p>

<p>Analytical monitoring of this service is outside the scope of this DPIA.</p>

<p>Summary of isolation support payment requirements which led to this feature</p>

<p>This feature has been developed to ensure the app, which receives exposure notifications (an alert of a potential risk of infection), can seamlessly allow an app user to explore qualification for the isolation support payment, as they would if they had been instructed to isolate as a result of the manual contact tracing process.</p>

<h4>Asset/Project Name</h4>

<p>Organisation: Department of Health and Social Care</p>

<h3>Section 2: Purposes</h3>

<h4>Project/Change Outline – Provide a description that provides an outside party with a good understanding of what the initiative is about.</h4>

<p>The introduction at the start of this document provides a fuller description of the app.</p>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 App is a mobile phone application that is part of the NHS Test and Trace service. It is designed to reduce personal and public risk by providing support for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>COVID-19 symptom identification and monitoring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alerting users if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or been to a high-risk location or area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>responding to the public health emergency</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Aims/Objectives - Why is it being undertaken? What is the purpose of processing the personal information?  What do you want to achieve?</h4>

<p>The app aims to give citizens maximum freedom with minimum risk during a public health emergency by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>driving safer behaviour by helping people manage their risk exposure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identifying and alerting known and unknown contacts when transmission may have occurred</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enabling users to isolate and test to reduce transmission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supporting and informing users during isolation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From the user’s perspective, the app will help them take action to break the chains of transmission. Users are asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>download the app and use it daily</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep the app ‘on’ and carry their phone at all times</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>follow instructions issued by the app</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘pause’ the app when appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter symptoms and take a test quickly when required</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To achieve the above the detailed primary of the app are as follows:</p>

<h4>Primary purposes</h4>

<p>The primary purposes of the app are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to facilitate self-symptom analysis for COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to enable users to order tests and receiving test results</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to alert users when they have come into proximity with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to alert users when they have visited a venue that has subsequently found to have a significant number of confirmed COVID-19 cases leading to a risk of infection to app users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to support decision-making and advice to meet public health demands regarding the COVID-19 public health emergency</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to enable public health management and provide information to app users’, the public and those managing public health</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These purposes are achieved by 2 key components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The app itself i.e. instances of the app downloaded and installed on users’ mobile phones</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A DHSC secure computing infrastructure, hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) UK and Microsoft Azure Cloud Services (UK) supporting the app, which includes a database holding exposure notification diagnosis keys</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These components function as follows:</p>

<h4>The instance of the app installed on a user’s phone</h4>

<p>a) Collects postcode district, allows the user to select the relevant Local Authority, and device type on installation and reports these to the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database</p>

<p>b)  Initiates the Apple-Google Exposure Notification API (GAEN) to record proximity encounters between users of the App on their respective devices, using Bluetooth technology, this includes the Exposure Window functionality which is part of GAEN Mode 2</p>

<p>c) Gives users a risk score for their area</p>

<p>d) Provides a facility for users to check their symptoms and get advice on what to do</p>

<p>e) Provides a facility of users to submit their Diagnosis Keys to the Cloud Services database should they be tested positive for COVID 19</p>

<p>f) Receives Diagnosis Keys from the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database from users that have submitted them on positive diagnosis for COVID-19</p>

<p>g) Interacts with the GAEN to establish whether an exposure event with an infected user has taken place and alerts the user should this be the case with advice on what to do</p>

<p>h) Provides a facility for users to scan QR codes for venues they visit</p>

<p>i) Obtains QR codes for venues that have reported infections, matches them to those visited and alerts them if a match with advice on what to do</p>

<p>j) Provides a facility for users to request a one-time use token which they can use to order a test for COVID-19</p>

<p>k) Receives the result of the test through the App from the Cloud Services database and reports this to the user (results can also be obtained through text/email to the user)</p>

<p>l) allow the app user to manually enter a test code with an associated result to update their and other user’s status</p>

<p>m) Reports and anonymous analytics data set to the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database.</p>

<p>n) Supports the user if they choose to seek support payment as a consequence of a recommendation to self-isolation</p>

<p>The Local Authority is not currently collected as part of the analytical data set but is scheduled for the near future and is subject to the same standards and controls to remove the risk of re-identification.</p>

<h4>DHSC secure computing infrastructure</h4>

<p>a) Receives Diagnosis Keys submitted by users that have tested positive for COVID-19</p>

<p>b) Distributes these keys to all users’ apps</p>

<p>c) Receives and distributes the QR codes for infected venues</p>

<p>d) Issues a unique one-time use token which users can use to order a test for COVID-19</p>

<p>e) Receives the results of tests ordered from swab testing systems using the one-time use token</p>

<p>f) Reports test results back the app on request using the token</p>

<p>g) Collects analytics data on a regular basis, currently daily.</p>

<p>h) Collects event analytics data on a regular basis, see section <a href="#securingdata" class="govuk-link">‘Securing data in transit’</a></p>

<p>See this document’s <a href="#appendices" class="govuk-link">appendices for the data dictionary, APIs presented by DHSC secure computing infrastructure and Operational Stages.</a></p>

<h4>Interoperability via federated servers to DHSC secure computing infrastructure</h4>

<p>a) provide diagnosis keys to the federated servers from app users who have provided permission from England and Wales</p>

<p>b) ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data provided through with supporting information to enable their use and ensure service management, for example, a count of the number of Diagnosis Keys submitted on each occasion</p>

<p>c) download Diagnosis Keys from Federated Servers from other jurisdictions within the interoperability agreement, see the interoperability section for more detail</p>

<p>d) ensure these diagnosis keys are made available in the appropriate format to support digital contact tracing through the DHSC secure computer infrastructure</p>

<h4>Performance and usage</h4>

<p>The DHSC secure computing infrastructure database holds the anonymous analytics dataset specified in the Data Dictionary – see this document’s introduction and <a href="#appendices" class="govuk-link">appendices</a>.</p>

<p>The separate App Analytical Environment is currently hosted in Microsoft Azure. Additional safeguards exist to support processing of anonymous analytics data transferred from the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database to this separate database.</p>

<p>The data protection impact assessment for the initial NHS COVID-19 app helped shape and inform this DPIA.</p>

<h3>Section 3: The data involved</h3>

<h4>Information that identifies the individual and their personal characteristics</h4>

<p>There must be justification for processing a particular dataset.</p>

<h4>Area (postcode district and local authority)</h4>

<p>Justification: Postcode district (the first digits up to the space) and local authority are needed to show users the COVID-19 risk level in their local area, and to collect data about the broad location of the disease to manage the public health emergency.</p>

<h4>Medical/health/genetic information</h4>

<p>Justification: Self-reported information indicating that a user has symptoms potentially of coronavirus (these reside temporarily on the local app before submission in anonymous form to DHSC secure computing infrastructure) is used to advise the user on whether their symptoms may be coronavirus. Test results received into the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database and local app inform public health planning as to the broad prevalence of coronavirus. Data indicating that a user has been in proximity with another user that has reported COVID-19 symptoms is used to inform users of their potential exposure.</p>

<p>The submission of diagnosis keys to the DHSC secure computing infrastructure indicates positive COVID-19 diagnosis – but is not considered personal data.</p>

<h4>Unique identifying codes</h4>

<p>Justification: Cryptographic keys (diagnosis keys/rolling proximity identifiers) with no link to user identity (direct identifiers) held by the controller are used to enable digital contact tracing.</p>

<h4>Sensitive/special category of information</h4>

<h4>Information relating to the individual’s physical or mental health condition</h4>

<p>As set out above, the app ensures personal data is only stored on the phone and information that is held centrally does not identify the user.</p>

<p>Justification: Self-reported information indicating that a user has symptoms indicating that they may have coronavirus (these reside temporarily on the local App before submission in anonymous form to DHSC secure computing infrastructure). Test results received into the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database and local app. The submission of diagnosis keys to the DHSC secure computing infrastructure indicates positive COVID-19 diagnosis – but is not considered personal data.</p>

<h4>Data supporting interoperability</h4>

<p>Diagnosis keys are exchanged with the federated server. The keys are associated with a positive test result for COVID-19 and with their jurisdiction of origin. In this case England and Wales. For interoperability, diagnosis keys are treated as anonymous in GDPR terms.</p>

<h3>Section 4: Overview of processing, necessity and proportionality</h3>

<h4>Why is the processing of personal data necessary?</h4>

<p>The functionality of the app and nature of the data are explained in the introduction of this document.</p>

<h4>Research and public health management</h4>

<p>Users are asked to provide their postcode district – that is, the first portion (up to the space) of the users’ home address postcode (e.g. SW1A) when they initially install the app. The app will not collect data about which postcode district a user might be in from time to time as they move around and nor will it link the person’s identity to the postcode district they have entered.  There is verification that the user has entered an actual postcode district (i.e. the app checks whether such a postcode district exists) but no checking that the user has entered the postcode district in which they live.</p>

<p>The postcode district and local authority data will primarily be used for alert notifications to users about changes in local risks, but may also be used for public health planning purposes, in conjunction with reported diagnoses and proximity information (for example, to help Local Government and NHS organisations to understand the spread of the disease in their area), and may also be used for research purposes. Such research will not have impact on individuals and would address GDPR requirements in relation to research e.g. the safeguards set out in Article 89.</p>

<h3>Data Processor – The Health Informatics Services (THIS) hosted by Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust (CHFT) utilising the NPEx: processor (Provision of test code with test result)</h3>

<p><strong>How is the information collected by this organisation?</strong></p>

<p>Data is provided through the testing process, with the data subject (the user undergoing test) informed of the process. They have a choice to use the app-generated test code or not. The test code and result are taken from the testing process and provided via NPEx to the App central system.</p>

<p><strong>Where will the information be stored? (including country location of data storage/back up)</strong></p>

<p>Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust (CHFT) systems, based in the UK</p>

<p><strong>How will the information be kept up to date?</strong></p>

<p>Long standing systems and processes meeting Lab quality standards for accuracy and currency subject to UKAS oversight and ISO15189 compliance.</p>

<p><strong>Which team(s) and roles have access to the information within this organisation?</strong></p>

<p>Test Result Database and system (NPEx) support team.</p>

<p><strong>What security measures are in place to protect this information from unauthorised use?</strong></p>

<p>The system and service are subject to the standard expectations on an NHS organisation for processing personal data. This is <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/OrganisationSearch/RWY">measured through audit, testing and the Data Security and Protection Toolkit</a></p>

<h4>Is there a Data Sharing Agreement/protocol/data processing agreement in place (as applicable)?</h4>

<p>The NPEx service provided by THIS is subject to the standard contracts conditions of an NHS Foundation Trust supplemented by the requirements of the lab information systems.</p>

<h4>Note on Apple and Google</h4>

<p>Apple and Google are considered independent data controllers or controllers for the services which support the app. Any processing they undertake is distinct to processing of personal and other data by the app.</p>

<h3>Section 6: assessment</h3>

<h4>Data protection principle: lawfulness, fairness and transparency</h4>

<h4>What is the legal basis for processing the information? (see appendix 3 &amp; 4 for legal grounds for processing)</h4>

<p>6(1)(e) “…exercise of official authority…”</p>

<p>Underpinned by section 2A of the NHS Act 2007 which provides the power that the  Secretary of State relies on to authorise the design, implementation and operation of the App by DHSC\</p>

<p>For special categories:</p>

<p>9(2)(g) “…necessary for reasons of substantial public interest in the basis set out in [law]”</p>

<p>Underpinned by DPA 2018 – Schedules 1, Part 2, para 6 - Statutory and government purposes relating to public health and in particular the management of the COVID-19 public health emergency</p>

<p>9(2)(h) “…necessary for the management of health or social care systems and services…”</p>

<p>Underpinned by DPA 2018 – Schedule 1, Part 1, s. 2(2)(f) – Health or social care purposes</p>

<p>This condition applies because it is necessary to process the personal data for symptom checking and test management as this is an essential process in delivering care to App users.</p>

<p>9(2)(i) “…necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health…”</p>

<p>Underpinned by DPA 2018 – Schedule 1, Part 1, s. 3 – Public health</p>

<p>3 This condition is met if the processing—</p>

<p>(a) is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health,</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>(b) is carried out—</p>

<p>(i) by or under the responsibility of a health professional, or</p>

<p>(ii) by another person who in the circumstances owes a duty of</p>

<p>confidentiality under an enactment or rule of law.</p>

<p>This condition applies because the objectives of the App include public health planning.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#confidential" class="govuk-link">section on ‘confidential patient information’</a> and table above.</p>

<h4>Is the processing of an individual’s information likely to interfere with the ‘right to privacy’ under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act?</h4>

<p>No. Although DHSC could invoke the exception in Article 8(2) “…where necessary in a democratic society…for the protection of health…” the decentralised approach built on the Apple/Google API achieves its objectives without the necessity to interfere with this right.</p>

<p>Robust privacy and identity protection of app users, alongside the voluntary use of the app, ensures that choice and the right to privacy is protected throughout the use of the app.</p>

<h4>How and when are data subjects made aware of how their data will be used? E.g. Privacy statement</h4>

<p>App users will receive a privacy notice via the App, that explains what information will be collected, how it will be used, the rights available to them, and sources of further information.</p>

<h4>If you are relying on consent to process personal data, how will consent be obtained and recorded, what information will be provided to support the consent process?</h4>

<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h4>Do we inform individuals about the use of cookies and other tracking technologies?</h4>

<p>Yes, information is provided to app users <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/cookies.html">about the use of cookies</a></p>

<h4>Do you receive information about individuals from third parties?</h4>

<p>Yes – the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database will receive test results with temporary identifying token from the NPEx (National Pathology Exchange) system.</p>

<h4>Data protection principle: purpose</h4>

<h4>Does the initiative involve the use of existing personal data for new purposes?</h4>

<p>No. The data used to enable app users to claim support payments for isolation does not constitute personal data within the app and the app’s systems.</p>

<h4>Are potential new purposes likely to be identified as the scope of the initiative expands?</h4>

<p>Yes – these would be related to the response to the COVID-19 emergency, efficacy of the App and services that users interact with.</p>

<p>Any change to processing of personal data would require revision to this DPIA.</p>

<p>As the Analytics data collected as a by-product of the operation of the App is anonymous, any new purposes for this data are unlikely to raise privacy concerns.</p>

<h4>Are we consolidating and linking files and systems and if so how?</h4>

<p>No</p>

<h4>Are we changing the technology we use and if so, how are we mitigating the privacy affects?</h4>

<p>No – this is an implementation built on the Google Apple API and noting changes to that system as it works. Any future changes would be subject to revision to this DPIA.</p>

<h4>Data protection principle: automated decision making</h4>

<h4>Will the processing result in a decision being made about the data subject solely on the basis of automated processing (including profiling)?</h4>

<p>See the section on <a href="#adm" class="govuk-link">automated decision making</a></p>

<h4>If yes, is the decision necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller? Or authorised by law based on the data subject’s explicit consent?</h4>

<p>No. See the relevant section.</p>

<h4>Please describe the logic involved in any automated decision-making.</h4>

<p>The design of the App’s contact tracing function means that App users will be notified automatically if they come into sufficient contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. The notification will advise them to self-isolate and may advise them to order a test. How the risk threshold is decided for issuing a notification is described in the section ‘<a href="#adm" class="govuk-link">automated decision making</a>’. It is integral to the design and operation of the contact tracing function that users be notified automatically, so that they can take appropriate steps to protect themselves, in a way that does not identify to anyone, including DHSC, or the person whose positive test result caused the notification to be issued. The App reminds users that they can phone NHS 111 if they have any questions or concerns about the notice to self-isolate in light of their personal circumstances (i.e. what the alert means, what they should need next, whether it is appropriate to obtain a test).</p>

<h4>Data protection principle: adequacy</h4>

<h4>Is the data adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed?</h4>

<p>Yes. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#nature">section ‘nature of the data’</a>.</p>

<h4>How have you ensured that only the minimum data is used to meet the purpose of processing? e.g. each data item is justified and periodically reviewed?</h4>

<p>All persistent personal data is held on the phone and is not accessible to the controller. With the exception of test results with their associated tokens (which are transient and short-lived) the data held on the DHSC secure computing infrastructure backend is anonymous.</p>

<h4>How many individuals are processed through this system in a given time period?</h4>

<p>The use of the app is voluntary. It will be effective at any level of uptake, but most effective if more people download and use it. We are expecting mass download and use of the app. If 80% of adult smartphone users use the app, it would represent around 56% of the population or around 37 million people</p>

<h4>Data protection principle: accurate and up to date</h4>

<h4>How are personal data checked for accuracy?</h4>

<p>Diagnosis Keys are generated by the GAEN and are not under our control. We rely on the GAEN to generate unique keys that are not repeated for each instance of the installed app. We also rely on the GAEN to generate Rolling Proximity Identifiers that are unique to an instance of the installed app. We also rely on the GAEN to re-generate the correct set of RPIs from diagnosis keys distributed by the DHSC secure computing infrastructure.</p>

<p>We are reliant on the user’s self-symptom analysis, but symptom checker questions have been carefully designed with professional oversight in line with overarching public health advice relating to COVID-19. We are reliant on the user to submit their postcode district but can check that it is a valid postcode district code.  There is no verification as to whether the postcode district the user enters is the one in which they reside.</p>

<p>The anonymous Analytics dataset (and risk action etc.) are generated and submitted automatically by the App.</p>

<h4>What action would be taken to correct inaccurate personal data?</h4>

<p>Current implementation of postcode district validation uses the following:</p>

<p>Min length 2</p>

<p>Max length 4</p>

<p>Matches the regex ^[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9R][0-9A-Z]?</p>

<p>The user can delete and re-enter the postcode district if they have entered one in error (subject to the same validation outlined above).</p>

<h4>How frequently is the personal data updated or what would trigger the information being updated?</h4>

<p>Data on the users’ phones is updated as they come into proximity with other users, so the frequency depends on this.</p>

<p>The DHSC secure computing infrastructure database is updated once (per infection) when the user submits their Diagnosis Keys. It is also updated when test results are received – so once per test request.</p>

<h4>Is the quality of the information good enough for the proposed purposes?</h4>

<p>Yes</p>

<h4>Are the sources of the personal data recorded?</h4>

<p>No. It is a privacy feature of the design of the App that this information is not necessary.</p>

<h4>Data protection principle: retention</h4>

<h4>What are the retention periods for the personal information</h4>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#retention">section ‘retention of data from the app’</a></p>

<h4>What is the justification for holding the information for this length of time?</h4>

<p>See <a href="#retention" class="govuk-link">section ‘retention of data from the app’</a></p>

<h4>How will the retention schedule be managed and enforced?</h4>

<p>See <a href="#retention" class="govuk-link">section ‘retention of data from the app’</a></p>

<h4>How often is this retention period reviewed?</h4>

<p>At least every 6 months</p>

<h4>Are there any exceptional circumstances for retaining certain data for longer than the normal period?</h4>

<p>There are none anticipated at present however in the context of a national emergency this is a possibility.</p>

<h4>How will information be fully anonymised, archived or destroyed after it is no longer necessary?</h4>

<p>The diagnosis keys and analytics data held on the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database are anonymous when collected, refer to Appendix 5 for further detail.</p>

<p>The diagnosis keys are retained for a maximum of 28 days (14 days on the phone and 14 days on the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database). They are permanently deleted from the phone after 14 days, and from the DHSC secure computing infrastructure after 14 days from submission.</p>

<p>Test results and associated tokens are transient and short-lived.</p>

<h4>Data protection principle: rights of the individual</h4>

<h4>How will you action requests from individuals (or someone acting on their behalf) for access to their personal information?</h4>

<p>Subject access requests will be facilitated by a feature of the app to present all information held in the app on the phone. No data will be retrieved from the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database as there is no way to link the information held in the DHSC secure computer infrastructure to individual users.</p>

<p>There is a feature planned for a follow up release that allows a user to view all captured data on the app. Given that this data never leaves the app that is the only place they will be able to view it.</p>

<h4>How would you locate all personal data relevant to an individual?</h4>

<p>Personal data that can be located is on the phone</p>

<h4>What is the procedure for this system to responding to data subject’s request to be forgotten – Article 17</h4>

<p>Users may uninstall the app from their phone at any time which will cause deletion of all the app data from the device. Although this will not cascade to the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database the diagnosis keys are deleted after 14 days automatically.</p>

<h4>Article 16 – Right to rectification</h4>

<p>Not available – controller does not have access to the personal data on the phone. If a user disagrees with a test result, they will need to contact the test provider.</p>

<h4>Article 18 – Right to restriction of processing</h4>

<p>Not available – controller does not have access to personal data on the phone.</p>

<h4>Article 19 – Notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing</h4>

<p>Not available – controller does not have access to personal data on the phone.</p>

<h4>Article 20 – Right to data portability</h4>

<p>This right is not available because the processing is not based on consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a); or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6(1)(b).</p>

<h4>Article 21 – Right to object</h4>

<p>Available by uninstalling App.  The user also has the choice not to use Venue-Check in functionality as well as the ability to delete both all or individual Venues</p>

<h4>Article 22 – Automated individual decision-making including profiling</h4>

<p>See section <a href="#adm" class="govuk-link">‘automated decision making’</a></p>

<h4>Data protection principle: appropriate technical and organisational measures</h4>

<h4>What procedures are in place to ensure that all staff with access to the information have adequate IG/Data Protection training?</h4>

<p>Both DHSC (the controller) and NHS England and NHS Improvement have well established mandatory IG training that must be accessed annually by all staff.  This also applies to NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<h4>How will the information be provided, collated and used by these staff?</h4>

<p>DHSC – internal procedures</p>

<p>NHS England and NHS Improvement – online training provided and monitored via the Electronic Staff Record.</p>

<h4>What are the access restrictions and permissions in place, including a JML process?</h4>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#security">section ‘security of processing’</a></p>

<h4>What are the security measures in place for this data?</h4>

<p>Data are held on the user’s device.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#security">section ‘security of processing’</a></p>

<h4>Data protection principle: transfers both internal and external including outside of the EEA</h4>

<h4>Will an individual’s personal information be disclosed internally/externally in identifiable form and if so to who, how and why?</h4>

<p>No.</p>

<h4>Will personal data be transferred to a country outside of the European Economic Area? If yes, what arrangements will be in place to safeguard the personal data?</h4>

<p>There are no expectations that personal data will be transferred outside of the UK or EEA.</p>

<h4>Consultation</h4>

<h4>Identify both internal and external stakeholders</h4>

<p>DHSC – the controller</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace – part of DHSC, with overall responsibility for delivering the Test and Trace programme</p>

<p>NHSX – comprising DHSC, NHS England and NHS Improvement (TDA and Monitor).</p>

<p>The legal entities comprising NHS England and NHS Improvement provide resources/staff for DHSC through NHSX.</p>

<p>The Welsh Government and its Test Trace Protect programme is a stakeholder in so far as they have decided to make use of the app.</p>

<p>We have a stakeholder engagement plan which we are using to reach out to groups in the health sector, social care, patient representatives, communities, charities, business and academia to inform the development of the app. We are in dialogue with privacy groups and are engaged with the National Data Guardian, Information Commissioner’s Office, Understanding Patient Data and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation.</p>

<h4>Guidance used</h4>

<h4>Details of any link to any wider initiative or list any national guidance applicable to this initiative.</h4>

<p>This initiative accompanies analytical work to support the COVID-19 emergency generally. The app’s data storage is under the remit of the Test and Trace programme. However, no linkage of data between the data sources is possible.</p>

<h4>Is the provision of personal data obligatory or voluntary?</h4>

<p>The provision of diagnosis keys to the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database is a voluntary action for app users, requiring a positive action.</p>

<h4>If obligatory, why/how is that the case?</h4>

<p>Use of the app is voluntary and users who have downloaded it can delete it at any time.</p>

<p>No obligation to use symptom checker.</p>

<h4>What are the possible consequences for a data subject if there is a failure to provide the requested personal data?</h4>

<p>If a user does not upload diagnosis keys then opportunities may be missed to carry out proximity alerting for that user (and the other users with whom they had proximity encounters).</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>

<h4>What will be the effects of the processing (i.e. what actions/decisions will result from the processing)?</h4>

<p>Users will be (i) notified about proximity encounters that mean they may have contracted COVID-19, and given advice on the steps to take; and (ii) will have the opportunity to self-diagnose on the basis of a symptom checker (both apply if the user displays symptoms); and (iii) be given the opportunity to request a test for COVID-19; and (iv) be notified when they have visited a venue where cases have been reported</p>

<h4>Common law duty of confidentiality</h4>

<h4>Are any of the data subject to a duty of confidentiality (e.g. clinical records, OH details, payroll information)? If so, please specify them.</h4>

<p>Yes. Test code and results – held temporarily in the Cloud Services database.</p>

<p>(Diagnosis keys submitted to the DHSC secure computing infrastructure database indicate positive COVID-19 diagnosis associated with a set of derived rolling proximity identifiers. Neither diagnosis keys nor RPIs are considered personal data.)</p>

<h4>Where it is planned to use or disclose such data, what are the grounds for doing so?</h4>

<p>To enable a test result to be passed back to the user’s phone, which will allow them to see it and be asked whether they are willing to release their Diagnosis Keys to the cloud so that the App’s contact tracing function can be initiated. The Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 set aside the CLDC for this purpose. Test results are used by the broader Test and Trace programme  to support planning purposes in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency.</p>

<h4>If the processing is of data concerning health or social care, is it for a purpose other than direct care?</h4>

<p>Public Health Management</p>

<h4>Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (as amended) (‘PECR’)</h4>

<h4>Does the processing engage the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (as amended) (‘PECR’)? If so, how are the requirements of the regulations met?</h4>

<h3>Appendix 5: anonymisation of analytical data collected</h3>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 app (“the app”) collects analytical data to ensure the app is working properly, safely and helping manage the COVID-19 public health emergency.  The methodology and protections that anonymise app users are determined by the Apple/Google API and non-identification of users is a condition for using their contact tracing functionality.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-covid-19-app-privacy-information/anonymisation-definitions-and-user-data-journeys">read a summary of this appendix</a>.</p>

<h4>Data and the app</h4>

<p>Your app retains data within the app around specific interactions. The logs of who you have interacted with are retained within the Apple/Google GAEN and are not visible or accessible to us. Details of which venues you have visited again are only on your app. The app will hold details of a relevant test result but only for as long as necessary, 14 days after any self-isolation period this data is no longer recorded. As detailed below you can delete the app, or just some data items (specific venues) or all the data it contains.</p>

<h4>Data provided to the app by the central systems</h4>

<p>The central system provides all app users with three key sets of data. Every app user receives the same information, called reference material, which the app uses to determine if you need to receive an alert or advice. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the list of Diagnosis Keys from app users who have tested positive. This functionality keeps the identity of app users anonymous to other app users;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the list of all postcode districts, which are mapped to local authorities, and their current risk level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the list of venues that could pose a risk, as determined by the Venue alert process</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Systems also provide you with an update to your status if you used a test code provided through the app.</p>

<h4>Analytical data</h4>

<p>Each day, the app collects a summary count of key information. This is called the analytical data set and helps us monitor the use, performance and information about the app and its use. The data is prepared and will be sent to central systems where it used for assurance of the app, technical checks and the public health functions. It does not include the data held on your app about specific venues or your close contacts.</p>

<h4>Event Analytical data set</h4>

<p>The Exposure Window data sets are a new type of data set collection for the NHS COVID-19 app. With the introduction of updated functionality from Apple and Google, the GAEN Mode 2, new data items are available to support the alert notification process, the analysis of alerts and knowledge about the public health emergency.</p>

<h3>Access control, audit logs and oversight</h3>

<p>Our safeguards ensure only people who are authorised and need access as part of their role will have access to the analytical data. For example, no user can remove data from our technical environments and where even negligible risks of identification are considered safeguards such as small number suppression are brought in.</p>

<p>All flows and use of data are under strict control and testing. The National Cyber Security Centre and other key cyber security experts continue to advise and recommend on how to protect and preserve the privacy of app users, including the controls and techniques we use to anonymise and aggregate data.</p>

<p>To further support the privacy of app users, we have put in place organisational safeguards to ensure separation between all technical data that is used to check the app is working and the analytical data can only be used for approved public health purposes.</p>

<p>With these controls, monitoring and safeguards in place we conclude that the risk to data privacy of an app user being identified by a combination of factors (e.g. phone model and operating system, plus postcode district), would be negligible to non-existent.</p>

<p>We use small number suppression in the performance view and dashboards. Any query or result that would result in a number below 5 is suppressed. For example, the following data items are the most likely to trigger small number suppression when combined with other data items in a query: onboarded users, users isolating due to risky contact and/or users’ isolation, users completing questionnaires, tests recommended and user check in counts.</p>

<h4>User data journeys</h4>

<p>In order to explain how app users’ data is generated and collected we have laid out a number of different scenarios about using this app. These are our User Data Journeys where we set out what data is generated, where it is held and where it flows. We reference the data that flows to app users and what category of data (for example, aggregated or anonymous) they fall into.</p>

<p>The User Data Journeys included below are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Overview for all App Users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interaction with Index Case</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Venue Check-In Users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>App users who only use the contact tracing within the app</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>App users who use all the functionality of the app</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>App users booking and receiving test results via the app</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Definitions are based on the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/535024/data-security-review.PDF" class="govuk-link" rel="external">National Data Guardian for Health and Care Review of Data Security, Consent and OptOuts</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.connectedhealthcities.org/community/glossary-data-use/" class="govuk-link">Connected Health Citites Data Glossary</a></p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>You generate data through your use of the app. Specific functions will generate different data items. For example, venue check-ins will add details of the venue onto your app. The analytical data set collected about your venue check-ins is the number of venues checked into and the number of failed or cancelled venue check-ins. No other details about the venue are collected or available to the analytical data set.</p>

<p>This count allows us to monitor how well the app is working and which functions are being used. We can monitor how well the app is working whilst preserving the privacy and identity of app users.</p>

<p>The analytical data set collected from the app prevents it from being linked to other data sets held by us, the Department of Health and Social Care, as data controller. See below for the specific example of test results and the app.</p>

<h4>Other Test and Trace Services</h4>

<h4>Contact Tracing</h4>

<p>As an app user, you may be contacted by national or local contact tracers. Your details will have been provided by other members of the public who believe they may be at risk or may pose a risk of COVID-19 infection to you. This does not relate to your use of the app and no details exist within the app that could be passed to contact tracers. However, if helpful you could use your app to help you provide details of the venues you checked into to the contact tracers. They, and we, have no access to that specific information.</p>

<h4>Testing</h4>

<p>The process of ordering and returning a test results protects the user’s identity and privacy through several techniques. These include minimising data flows, ensuring that only necessary systems have access to the data needed for their part of the process.</p>

<p>If you use a code generated through the app to book and test, your status will be sent back to the app. When you book the test, the only details that are passed to the website is the test code provided via the app. The details you enter into the website when booking a test, which includes personal data, are not available to the app and cannot be linked to the analytical data set generated by the app.</p>

<p>Co-ordination between services ensures the correct test result gets back to you and to your app. However, we separate out the codes and use tokens to ensure that the data cannot be linked. Once the result is returned to you via the app, the test code is deleted from our systems.</p>

<p>New functionality for national launch will allow anyone receiving a test (in England and Wales) to enter a code provided during testing to update the app with their test result and status. This is available to support those using the app who did not generate a code (i.e. they booked their test independently from the app).</p>

<h4>Venue Check-Ins</h4>

<p>Currently, venue check-ins details are updated from central systems but no details about who or how many users attended a venue is recorded. Local Health Protection Teams (HPTs), national Public Health Experts and the Joint Biosecurity Centre work together to help determine what venues should be considered at risk. This decision not only relates to updates for app users but for local HPTs and services.</p>

<h4>Isolation Support Payment</h4>

<p>Recent updates for the app support an app user in applying for isolation support payments. When recommended to self-isolate due to a contact with a risk of infection, in England the app user can apply for the isolation payment. Support for this process is expected in Wales shortly.</p>

<h4>Data Sets</h4>

<p>The Analytical Data Set differs between Apple and Google (Android) to account for differences in the functionality.</p>

<p>The following data is collected from Apple app users but not from Google (Android) users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cumulative Cellular Download Bytes (Data to app by cellular)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cumulative Cellular Upload Bytes (Data from app by cellular)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cumulative Wifi Download Bytes (Data to app by wifi</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cumulative Wifi Upload Bytes (Data from app by wifi)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This data relates to the app’s receipt and transmission of data across different types on network.</p>

<h4>App data environments</h4>

<p>The app holds data in the following 3 environments:</p>

<p>1) App</p>

<p>The app holds data generated by the app, and when prompted can request access to the diagnosis key provided by the Apple Google functionality (the GAEN). The contacts held by this function cannot be viewed by the app and the DHSC.</p>

<p>The app holds data about the user (the venue’s they’ve checked in for example) as well as reference material provided to all app users to support the functionality of the app (for venue check-ins the details of venue’s that may pose a risk to of COVID-19 infection).</p>

<p>2) Product</p>

<p>This is the central system that supports the app and its users. It manages the APIs that deliver information to and from your app. The data within the analytical data set arrives within this environment and is managed by the software and systems it contains. This environment also sends out the updates to all app users.

<h4>Updating the app and app users</h4>

<p>The app is updated by the central systems (product environment), on average, every 2 hours. This will include an updated list of diagnosis keys (from app users who have tested positive), of venues that may pose a risk and the latest area risk status. This data triggers the app’s functionality for relevant users. For example, if you checked into a venue during a relevant period and may be at risk – you will receive a notification.</p>

<p>Where an app user has tested positive for COVID-19 they will be prompted to share their protected ID. Once these are processed by the central system, they are provided to all app users. The Apple Google functionality uses these codes to determine if you should be alerted. This is distinct for the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>

<p>Once the data is provided to the app user, the app checks whether any alerts or notifications need to be displayed to you. This is based on how the app works, is supported by automated decision making and uses the reference material provided to all app users.</p>

<h4>Data generated and collected</h4>

<p>This section sets out different aspects of the data why it is generated or collected and what function the data serves.</p>

<h3>Apple Google GAEN</h3>

<p>Your app will hold the following, subject to the controls of the Apple Google Functionality and provided via the Exposure Notification API.</p>

<p>The app holds the broadcast codes from other app users you have been in contact with, including the details that allow the app to determine whether you might be at risk</p>

<p>These broadcast codes are changed every 15 minutes and are not accessible to you as an app user or us as data controller.</p>

<p>This system is designed by Apple and Google to protect the privacy and identity of app users, making their use of the app anonymous.</p>

<p>As part of the routine update the app receives details of all Diagnosis Keys that could pose a risk, another set of reference material used by all app users. The app’s functionality combined with Apple Google GAEN help determine if any of the broadcast codes should trigger an alert for the app user. They do this by determining is broadcast code relates to a diagnosis key through a process that maintains the privacy of both parties.</p>

<p>With the introduction of GAEN Mode 2, the Exposure Window data set is used as part of the risk algorithm and risk score calculation process. The data sets are also sent to the DHSC secure computing infrastructure as a Event Analytical Data set.</p>

<h4>Data Held on the App</h4>

<p>Beyond the digital contact tracing all app users will have the details listed below on their app. The same reference material is on everyone’s app. Other details will vary with how you use the app but are only held on your phone.</p>

<h3>The App</h3>

<p>The app will retain your declared postcode district, selected local authority, latest virology test result and any venues visited. This data can be deleted when you delete the app, through the app and even for individual venues. No history of postcode districts, local authority or virology test results are retained.</p>

<h4>Data about the user</h4>

<p>QR Venues Visited (details of the venues checked into)</p>

<p>Postcode District (the users current declared postcode district)</p>

<p>Local authority (the local authority selected by the user after they input their postcode district)</p>

<p>Virology Test Results (the last test result retained for the isolation period plus 14 days)</p>

<h4>Reference Material (used to appropriately update the app user)</h4>

<p>In addition, to the diagnosis key detailed above, the app holds two sets of reference material which enable the app to function and appropriately update you. For example, the list of risk status for postcode district, within a local authority, allows you to be notified about any changes to the risk score as well as display the baseline risk.</p>

<p>Risk status for every postcode district/local authority within the app [Area Risks]</p>

<p>Full list of venues that are “at risk” with details of the relevant time period [Hotspot QR Venues]</p>

<h3>Analytical Data Set</h3>

<p>Using the app will populate the analytical data set. As noted above, the majority are summaries or counts of function use and do not list data items.</p>

<p>This data is not only important to understanding if the app is working as expected, to manage the transmission of COVID-19, but it also supports us in meeting our statutory obligations to app users.</p>

<p>For example, our obligations include equalities and health inequalities. Monitoring the data, storage and use of the pause function allows us to understand the potential impacts of the app and its use. This helps to ensure that the app supports as many communities and users as possible. For example, if the app uses large amount of data then those on limited data plans may not be getting the service we want to provide.</p>

<p>All users potentially generate the following data items in the Analytical Data Set.</p>

<h4>Core details</h4>

<p>The app collects the following details about your phone, the app and the analytical period the data applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start Date – when the period for the analytical data began</li>
  <li>End Date – when the period for the analytical data ended</li>
  <li>Postcode District – the current postcode district of the user</li>
  <li>Device Model – the device model</li>
  <li>Operating System Version – the operating system in use on the phone</li>
  <li>Latest Application Version – the application version of the app</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data Usage of the app and data submitted to the app</h4>

</ul>

<p>See below for an overview what background tasks are and this data set.</p>

<h3>Function specific data in the analytical data set</h3>

<p>The following data items are present for all users but vary by the functions you use. Where not used your data return will be zero (or nil) for the relevant entry.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Isolation Trigger</h4>

<p>The following provide an overview of whether an app user is isolating and for how long. It cannot be used for any enforcement.</p>

  <li>isIsolatingForHadRiskyContactBackgroundTick</li>
  <li>is Isolating Background Tick</li>
</ul>

<h4>Analytical Data upon arrival at the central system</h4>

<p>No identifiers are provided to the data as it leaves the app, preventing you from being identified across analytical data packets (subject to additional controls). On landing data will be placed into a row.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Row Level</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background tasks</h3>

<p>In line with most apps, the NHS COVID-19 app uses “background tasks” as a way for the app to keep content up to data and for the app to function in the background of your phone. For example, when you are using another app or have the app minimised. These background tasks are normal functions of your app interacting with your phone’s operating system.</p>

<p>Background tasks do not enable us to track the location of users, or to read any other information from the phone for example about other apps and how you use them.</p>

<p>Every time the app interacts with the operating system it creates a “background tick” which helps us to understand how often certain app functions might be being used and if the app is working as expected. Typically, we would expect to see the app interact with your phone’s operating system up to 12 times, and a minimum of 0. If 0, this implies that the app was not running that day.</p>

<p>We use this count from background tasks as a comparator to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>see how many active users the app had fully operational on a given day;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Diagnostics - to ensure that the app was running correctly, as certain metrics should be no higher than the background tick (e.g. a user is self-isolating);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Number of times encounter detection was triggered.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This data is used as a count or summary and not with any identifiers from the user. This makes sure that we don’t know which app user they apply to but allows us to understand how the app is being used and if it is working effectively.</p>

<h4>Protecting your privacy and identity</h4>

<p>The following summaries outline the key techniques we use to protect every app user’s privacy and identity, as well as our analysis of the risks from particular data items. We try to make sure that an app user can use the app anonymously whenever possible, with the minimum data collected that is necessary to deliver the functions of the app. However, the data collected must provide an effective service to app users and help us understand and manage the COVID-19 public health emergency.</p>

<p>We have included a review of the risks and protections for each environment within our Data Protection Impact Assessment.</p>

<h3>Personal Identification Risk</h3>

<p>The analytics data relating to app operation is collected as summary counts, for example the number of exposure events and QR code check-ins. The details of specific exposure events and QR code check-ins never leave the mobile device on which the app is running. We cannot access any information on your specific contacts or location check-ins.</p>

<h3>Anonymisation Strategy: Technical data items</h3>

<p>The analytics data is collected and held in such a way that it cannot be used to identify the user.  Firstly, no data is collected which would allow us directly to identify an individual – we do not collect details of the user’s name, address, phone number, device IMEI or any other unique piece of identification.  Secondly, the data that we do collect is held so it cannot be put together (“linked”) to identify a user – specifically, we separate all  technical data relating to the phone, used to ensure the app is functioning properly, from the public health data that we need to manage the pandemic.</p>

<p>This is done by using different environments to manage the data with additional controls around the public health data and broader analytical functions.</p>

<p>The technical tech items are detailed below along with the risks of identification that could arise.</p>

<h4>Phone model and operating system</h4>

<p>The app supports as many phone models and operating systems as possible. This data is used to check that the app is working properly. With a version of the app available to the population of England and Wales there should be enough app users to prevent the identification of any single user from the uniqueness of their phone make, model and operating system.</p>

<p>If an app user happens to have a very unusual phone model and operating system, it may be possible that they will be the only person in their postcode district with that combination of phone model and operating system.  However, unless an app user made their phone make, model and postcode district publicly known, we could not possibly identify them from this data set. To further mitigate this risk, we have taken steps to ensure we cannot identify how many phones of a particular model and/or operating system exist within a given postcode.   Removing this link should make it impossible to identify a given user by reference to their phone.</p>

<h4>App Version Number</h4>

<p>The app version number helps determine how many app users are using the current version of the app. There are likely to be a small  number of version releases of the app, with each version downloaded by a large number of users. Our analysis has not found any situation where only one individual is using a particular version of the app and could be potentially identifiable as a result.</p>

<h4>Onboarding Status</h4>

<p>The onboarding status of an app on a user’s phone is binary – either “complete” or “not complete”.  On the assumption that a large number of users will be using the app and represented in each of these categories at any one time, our analysis shows that a specific user could not be identified from this information.</p>

<h4>Usage, storage and data download usage</h4>

<p>We do not see any situation in which the data we collect about usage status (i.e. whether the app is updating correctly), storage usage on a phone and data download usage on the phone would allow us to identify an individual app user as this is unlikely to be unique to any identifiable person.</p>

<p>This analytical data set does include the user’s  phone model and operating system which tend to relate to the usage and storage statistics. This would not add any addition risk of identification beyond those associated with unique phone model and operating system combinations.</p>

<h4>IP Addresses (Not used by the app)</h4>

<p>Your IP address (a unique identifier for your phone when you use the internet) is automatically shared with the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) when you share data through the App. DHSC does not use your IP address however and deletes it as soon as it is received. Like every other app, our app uses the internet to work which requires the use of the IP address.</p>

<p>The application is reviewed and tested to make sure that there never exists functionality that collects, logs, retransmits or stores the IP addresses received within HTTP headers. This minimises the possibility of recombining IP address and payload data.</p>

<p>We have no intention of collecting IP addresses to attempt to identify app users and have these technical safeguards to remove any possibility of this being attempted. Protecting the identity of users, and demonstrating those protections, is a core condition of the use of the Apple/Google Contact Tracing functionality.</p>

<h3>Anonymisation Strategy: Public Health data items</h3>

<p>The same anonymisation, data minimisation and tests to ensure the items are necessary are used with data items that are used either solely for public health or for both functions. A key requirement is to protect the identity and privacy of you as an app user.</p>

<h4>Postcode District</h4>

<p>The postcode district entered by the user is potentially identifiable data. Most postcode districts have around 8,000 households in them and we expect a large number of users to download the app within each postcode district. Our analysis suggests that is a negligible risk of an app user being identified at postcode district level.<br>
We have accounted for the postcode districts with smaller population densities (e.g. less than a thousand) by grouping these smaller postcode districts with other postcode districts to ensure the group represents at least 8,000 households. Postcode districts in incoming analytics messages are changed to this group identifier before persistence (i.e. before being stored and made available for analysis). As detailed above, any reporting also considers the need for small number suppression.</p>

<p>Where postcode districts could be combined with other data items, for example test results, that might indicate a small number of app users, we add further protections. These include techniques such as small number suppression and the removal of these data items for non-technical analysis.</p>

<p>Alongside the additional controls to prevent linkage and holding the app data as distinct data sets, this prevents you as an app user being identified through the data we hold about your use of the app.</p>

<p>The user’s area, both local authority and postcode district, is stored on the app. The user’s local authority and postcode district will take account of interactions that result in fewer than 1,000 households to minimise the chance of re-identification.</p>

<p>The Local Authority is not currently collected as part of the analytical data set but is scheduled for the near future and is subject to the same standards and controls to remove the risk of re-identification.</p>

<h4>Quantity of Exposure Events and QR Code Check-in Counts</h4>

<p>We do not collect any information which would allow us to identify which app users have been in contact with each other user, or the venues they have checked in.  The decentralised app system we have adopted achieves this, by ensuring this information is only held on users’ phones.</p>

<p>Our review of the risks demonstrates that recording the overall number (quantity) of exposure events and check ins does not present any risk of users being identified as we do not link this information to individual users.  For example, the information that a person had checked in to (say) five venues or had ten proximate contacts, would not allow us or others to identify them. We do not identify which venues and do not associate that information with any other details (for example, postcode districts).</p>

<p>Venues/Business can register for an official NHS QR code. As the venue check in is only held on the phone, with just a count being taken of venues, we would be unable to determine whether 1 or 300 people had “checked-in” to any venue either routinely or even when issuing an alert for that venue.</p>

<h4>Pause Usage</h4>

<p>When we collect information about how long contact tracing has been turned off on the app, we do not link this to individual users or other information that would allow us to identify a specific user.  If a user wants to turn, contact tracing off altogether they also have the option to delete the app.</p>

<h4>Symptomatic Questionnaire Results and Isolation Status</h4>

<p>We collect a simple “yes” or “no” to whether the app advised a user to isolate and seek a test. We do not collect information about individual users’ symptoms beyond whether they might or are not indicative of COVID-19.  Nor do we collect data as to how much longer a user has left to isolate, only that they were isolating at the moment the data was collected.</p>

<h4>Swab Test Results</h4>

<p>If an app user has linked their test result to their app, we take data as to whether or not the test was positive in order to compare the actual test result against what we advised the user to do, to monitor and improve how the app works.</p>

<p>When the app is used to provided test results back to the user, the data is promptly deleted, and the techniques across the data flow involves compartmentalising the data and codes to prevent any reidentification of app users from these details.</p>

<p>The name and address information used to book an actual test is not passed to the app, and there is no way of identifying that an identifiable person has tested positive via the app.  Also, this data is not linked to other data which could in combination identify the individual user (e.g. the postcode district, model or operating system details of their phone).</p>

<h3>Risks of Identification outside of the App</h3>

<h4>Small numbers of contacts.</h4>

<p>While it is unlikely ever to happen, our privacy notice makes users aware that there are some unusual circumstances in which another person might be able to identify that they were the person who had tested positive when they receive an alert.</p>

<p>For example, if an App user had only been in contact with a single person and no one else, they would be able to infer who the infected person was when they received an alert (i.e. the only person with whom they had been in contact). This risk could also happen with manual contact tracing.</p>

<p>We have noted the privacy risk in our risk register but recognise that this is an underlying risk in the context of contagious diseases and public health management.</p>

<h3>User choices</h3>

<h4>Deleting the app</h4>

<p>Should you wish to cease providing analytical data they have the option to delete the app from your phone at any time. Safeguards to prevent the identification of you are so robust that we would not be able to determine who that user was in order to delete or remove any analytical data they had already submitted.</p>

<h4>Deleting data held by the app</h4>

<p>You can choose to delete all of the data held by the app or just individual venues that you have checked into. This will stop you receiving any alerts from the app based on the information you have deleted. It will not be present for the app to check against the lists provided by the central system.</p>

<p>If you choose to delete the postcode district in the app, this will also delete venue and other details. It acts as a reset for the app.</p>

<p>The data about your use of the app will still be in the analytical data set and these summary counts will be submitted for the relevant period and will continue to be unless you delete the app.</p>

<h3>Digital Contact Tracing (Exposure Window, Exposure Logging and Exposure Notification)</h3>

<p>The methodology and protections that maintain the anonymity of app users through contact tracing are determined by Apple and Google. The functionality and Exposure Notification API (GAEN) that provides this service has strict conditions of access and use, which the NHS COVID-19 app uses. For both contact tracing functionality and any analysis delivered by the app – non-identification of users is a condition of access for Apple and Google. We are happy to comply with that standard.</p>

<h4>The User Data Journey</h4>

<p>These scenarios provide examples of the data generated and collected when you use the app. We have included the most relevant ways we protect your identity and privacy, through anonymising and aggregating data along with other safeguards.</p>

<h3>Scenario: All App Users</h3>

<p>We have detailed above the data generated and collected by the app, along with what it is used for. For this example, we’ve repeated some of that information, so you can see how this works in practice. This scenario is updated to reflect the latest changes to the app. See <a href="#updates" class="govuk-link">section on recent updates to the app</a> for more information.</p>

<p>For all users who complete onboarding and are using the app, key information will be collected in the app and as part of the analytical data set. Data will be held within:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the Apple Google functionality (the contact tracing) until a request to share that is triggered by a positive test result;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>within the app (and will always be retained only within the app);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as part of the analytical data set which will remain on the app until the app triggers the upload to the APIs that interact will the central system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the digital contact tracing functionality provided by Apple and Google (the Google Apple Exposure Notification or GAEN) now includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exposure Window data collect and data set.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Exposure Window data set is triggered when your app registers that a shared Diagnosis Key, provided by another app user, can be derived from a broadcast key held on your phone. This is registering a close contact and potential risk of infection on your app.</p>

<p>The data set allows the app to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate your risk of COVID-19 infection;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where appropriate give an alert and advice (i.e. that you are at risk and should self-isolate)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Exposure Window(s) for each 30 minutes of contact are provided as part of the analytical data required by the app. They are held on the app until the app triggers an upload to the APIs that interact with the central system</p>

<h4>Digital Contact Tracing</h4>

<h3>Digital Contact Tracing</h3>

<p>The Apple Google functionality generates a daily code for the app user, a broadcast key (changed every 15 minutes) is passed to other app users who are in contact (via Low Energy Bluetooth or “BLE”). An app user who tests positive for COVID-19 and who chooses to share their codes (protected as diagnosis keys) has this code added to the list of “potential risk” users provided to all app users.</p>

<p>Each individual user’s app will check whether they have a broadcast key associated with a diagnosis key on their phone. If a derived (i.e. a broadcast code produced from the diagnosis key) code is present and meets the set criteria – the app will alert the user. This functionality and the identity protection within this process are provided by Apple Google. However, the NHS app sets the criteria for when an alert should be issued.</p>

<p>Our working with health services in Gibraltar, Jersey, Northern Ireland and Scotland allows app users across all of the digital contact tracing apps to support this functionality. By giving permission to share diagnosis keys, app users in England and Wales can make sure that other app users receive alerts when appropriate. This is regardless of which digital contact tracing app they use or which jurisdiction they are in.</p>

<h4>Apple Google GAEN Mode 1</h4>

<p>This is only relevant for app users who have not updated their NHS COVID-19 app. It is strongly recommended that users routinely update their app in order to get the most effective service.</p>

<p>A user’s app will hold, subject to the controls of the Apple Google Functionality and provided via the Exposure Notification API.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The broadcast keys from other app users they have been in contact with, including the details that allow the app to determine whether the user might be at risk;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These details include a measure of distance and duration of contact.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This enables that routine checking of whether an app user needs to be alerted of a potential COVID-19 risk from another app user. You won’t know which user from the details the app provides and we, the DHSC, cannot identify either you or the app user who generated your alert.</p>

<h4>Apple Google GAEN Mode 2</h4>

<p>The new version of the Exposure Notification functionality (GAEN Mode 2) adds a layer of detail to the previous version (GAEN Mode 1), this uses the Exposure Window data sets and events to calculate the risk.</p>

<p>Much like GAEN Mode 1, a user’s app will hold subject to the controls of the Apple Google Functionality and provided via the Exposure Notification API.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The broadcast keys from other app users they have been in contact with, including the details that allow the app to determine whether the user might be at risk;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These details include a measure of distance and duration of contact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This enables that routine checking of whether an app user needs to be alerted of a potential COVID-19 risk from another app user. You won’t know which user from the details the app provides and we, the DHSC, cannot identify either you or the app user who generated your alert.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the GAEN Mode 2 captures 30-minutes Exposure Windows for interactions between the app user and index cases (see above for the definition) who have shared their Diagnosis Key and may pose a risk of infection. Within each Exposure Window is a Scan Instance which captures the approximate duration between the contacts and distance between.</p>

<p>With Mode 2 of the GAEN app, the Exposure Windows for any contacts are submitted to the Analytical API for use in the Analytical Environment.</p>

<h4>Data Held on the App</h4>

<p>Outside of the digital contact tracing, all app users will have the details listed below on their app. The same reference material is on every user’s app.</p>

<p>Other, non-reference, details vary with how you use the app but are only held on your phone.</p>

<h4>The App</h4>

<p>The app will retain the user’s declared postcode district, the selected Local Authority (from those suggested by the users postcode district), latest virology test result and any venues visited. This data can be deleted when you delete the app, through the app and even for individual venues. No history of postcode districts or virology test results are retained.</p>

<p>Data about the user:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>QR Venues Visited - details of the venues checked into;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postcode District - the users current declared postcode district;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local Authority – the local authority selected by the user (based on their postcode district);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Virology Test Results - the last test result retained for the isolation period plus 14 days;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Reference Material (used to appropriately update the app user):</h4>

<p>The app holds two sets of reference material which enable the app to function and appropriately update the user. For example, the list of risk status for postcode district allows the user to be notified about any changes to the risk score for their postcode district as well as display the baseline risk.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Risk status for every postcode district within the app (Area Risks)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Risk Status, or Tier, for area will be set by the Local Authority though availability of services may be based on areas</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full list of venues that are “at risk” with details of the relevant time period (Hotspot QR Venues)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Analytical Data</h4>

<p>Use of the app will start to populate the analytical data set. As noted above, most are summaries or counts of function use and do not list data items. The data is generated over the 6-hour analytical period and then prepared for submission.</p>

<p>All users will start to generate the following data items:</p>

<h4>Core Details</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Start Date – when the period for the analytical data began</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>End Date – when the period for the analytical data ended</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postcode District – the current postcode district of the user</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local Authority – selected by the app user based on their postcode district</p>
  </li>

<h4>Function specific</h4>

<p>The following data items are present for all users but vary by the functions used. Where not used the data, collected will only show a zero (or nil). So if you receive no test results all of the three test results fields will be zero.</p>

</ul>

<p>Exposure Window:</p>

<p>Exposure Windows are created to evaluate the risk of infection. In addition to being used within the GAEN, the data set is sent to the Product Environment and used in the Analysis of the app.</p>

<p>For each Exposure Window (see above for what triggers an Exposure Window) a 30-minute period of details are captured that contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ExposureWindows: object</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ExposureWindows: date</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ExposureWindows: List of ScanInstances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ExposureWindows: Risk score version</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ExposureWindows: Infectiousness of IndexCase (i.e. the app user who shared their Diagnosis Key)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ExposureWindows: Risk Score</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Data Items to support analysis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Local Authority (Area)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postcode District (Area)</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>App Version</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Type of Event</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Scan Instance (Exposure Window data sub-set)</h3>

<p>Within the Exposure Window will be several scan instances that capture the distance and duration of the interactions in the following data items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ScanInstances: minAttenuation (an approximation of a minimum distance between app users)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ScanInstances: Typicalattenuation (an approximation of the typical distance between app users)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ScanInstances: Timesincelastscan (a detail that allows the duration of a contact to be approximated)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Analytical Data upon arrival at the central system</h4>

<p>No identifiers are provided to the data as it leaves the app, preventing a user from being identified across analytical data packets (subject to additional controls). On landing data will be placed into a row and time stamp of when the data arrived.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Row Level</li>
  <li>Time Stamp</li>
</ul>

<h4>Processes used to prevent re-identification</h4>

<p>The process of alerts for digital contact tracing prevents the app user being identifiable through data provided through the app’s functionality. The matching of diagnosis keys with broadcast keys, that are derived from them, protects the identity and privacy of app users.</p>

<p>The following techniques are used to prevent re-identification of data received from the app (the analytical data set)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each data packet is sent each day without an identifier that would allow for the linking data of a user across multiple periods;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each device sends their data packets at a random time after the analytics window closes;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon arrival information is removed from any data packet (such as the IP address), and processes are undertaken to protect the identity of users – such as small postcode district grouping and small number suppression;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further reviews and safeguards are in place for the performance view and data passed to the analytical environment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Processes used to prevent re-identification (Exposure Windows)</h4>

<p>In addition, the processes used above, the Exposure Windows are provided without any details of either app user such as the Diagnosis Key.</p>

<h3>Scenario: App User has contact with Index Case</h3>

<p>During a 14-day period, the app user has interacted with several other app users. The user’s app collects the broadcast codes, which change every 15 minutes, of those other app users they have interacted with. This data is maintained with the GAEN provided by Apple and Google.</p>

<p>Alongside the broadcast code, data is captured about the Low Energy Bluetooth (“BLE”) signal and its duration. This is used to approximate the distance and duration of the contact between the two app users.</p>

<h4>Updated Diagnosis Keys</h4>

<p>The app user receives the list of reference Diagnosis Keys. Other app user’s who have tested positive for COVID-19, updated their status and chosen to share their Diagnosis Keys enable other app users to be appropriately alerted.</p>

<p>These Diagnosis Keys are added to the reference Diagnosis Key list provided to every app user. In order to help determine the infectious of a contact (the index case), this is accompanied by the onset of symptoms data from the app user sharing their Diagnosis Keys.</p>

<p>The app user receives the updated list, which is provided approximately every two hours, and their app checks whether any Broadcast Codes relate to any of these Diagnosis Keys. 
In this scenario, during the past 14 days an app user interacted with one of these index cases. The app finds a match, using the cryptography that preserves both user’s identity, between a Diagnosis Key and Broadcast Codes.</p>

<h4>Exposure Windows</h4>

<p>The app uses the GAEN functionality and data to calculate the relevant risk score. This is done through the Exposure Window data set.</p>

<p>For each 30-minute window, whether partially or fully for 30-minutes, that the app user was in contact with the index case, an Exposure Window is generated and stored. This data set will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The data of the Exposure Window;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The risk score version used to calculate the risk score for the contact;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The infectious of the Index Case (based on the onset of symptoms data provided alongside the Diagnosis Key);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The risk score calculated for this Exposure Window;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The list of scan instances within the Exposure Window.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Exposure Window will cover at least one change in the Broadcast Codes (as they are changed every 15-minutes) but both will relate to the same Diagnosis Key.</p>

<p>Within the Exposure Window there will be Scan Instances for periods where the two app users were in contact. This is a summary of the BLE functionality that supports digital contact tracing.</p>

<p>These allow an approximation of the duration and distance of the contact and include the following data items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ScanInstances: minAttenuation (an approximation of a minimum distance between app users);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ScanInstances: Typicalattenuation (an approximation of the typical distance between app users);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ScanInstances: Timesincelastscan (a detail that allows the duration of a contact to be approximated).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Analytical use of Exposure Windows</h4>

<p>The Exposure Windows for the user are uploaded into the DHSC secure computing infrastructure and will be added to the app’s dedicated analytical environment. The Exposure Windows are sent every 24 hours but are sent in a randomised schedule (so the first generated Exposure Window may not be sent via the Analytical API first) where applicable.</p>

<p>Once submitted, the Exposure Windows are prepared in the DHSC secure computing infrastructure and provided to the App Analytical Environment to enable analysis.</p>

<h4>Analytical Data Set</h4>

<p>The following examples, show what data is collected in two cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Case 1 – The risk score from the contact is enough for the app to trigger an alert (recommending that the user self-isolates) it is above the risk threshold;</li>
  <li>Case 2 – The risk score from the contact is below the risk threshold and no alert is triggered.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Case 1 – Self-Isolation Recommended (Risky Contact)</h4>

<p>In the case of a risky contact the app will alert the user. In addition to the data within the Exposure Window and Scan Instances data set, the analytical data set will include a summary and count of the interaction.</p>

<p>Isolation Trigger:</p>

<p>Is Isolating Background Tick – The Self-Isolation countdown will have been triggered by the Risky Contact, a count indicating that is the case for this day will be added (i.e. the value is returned as 1)</p>

<p>Has Had Risky Contact Background Tick – The app will capture the fact that you have had a contact which has reached (i.e. the risk score is greater than) the risk threshold set for a risky contact. The data set will indicate that this is the case for the day. (i.e. the value is returned as 1)</p>

<p>Isolation Analytical:</p>

<p>isIsolatingForHadRiskyContactBackgroundTick – The app will capture the fact that the app user is isolating for a risky contact (i.e. the value is returned as 1)</p>

<h4>Case 2 - No recommendation (Non-Risky Contact)</h4>

<p>In the case where the contact is not sufficient to trigger an alert, the app will capture the relevant Exposure Windows and Scan Instances providing them to the app’s DHSC secure computing infrastructure. The analytical data set will include a summary and count of the interaction which differs from the case above in the following ways.</p>

<p>To show what data is captured, in comparison to the case above:</p>

<p>Isolation Trigger:</p>

<p>Is Isolating Background Tick – The Self-Isolation countdown is not triggered, a count indicating that is the case for this day will be added (i.e. the value is returned as 0)</p>

<p>Has Had Risky Contact Background Tick – The app will capture the fact that you have had a contact which has not reached (i.e. the risk score is greater than) the risk threshold set for a risky contact. The data set will indicate that this is the case for the day. (i.e. the value is returned as 0)</p>

<p>Isolation Analytical:</p>

<p>isIsolatingForHadRiskyContactBackgroundTick – The app will capture the fact that the app user is not isolating for a risky contact (i.e. the value is returned as 0)</p>

<h3>Scenario: Venue Check-Ins</h3>

<p>This example is a walkthrough of the use of the venue check-in function. This will help demonstrate what data is generated as a result.</p>

<h4>Digital Contact Tracing</h4>

<p>Venue check-in has no impact on the digital contact tracing function.</p>

<h4>Data Held on the App</h4>

<p>For each venue successfully checked into an entry is added to the app about each venue. It will include a time stamp of when the venue was booked into as well as an accessible description of the venue (i.e. its name and location). Deletion of these details is described above.</p>

<h4>Analytical Data</h4>

<p>Venue check-ins add a count of the venue check-ins during the 6-hour analytical period. Where the check-in fails or is abandoned this is counted as well. This data is used to ensure the QR venue check in is working as expected as well as give a sense of how app users are using the function and the potential imapcts..</p>

<p>At the start of each day, both counts are reset to zero.</p>

<p>Venue Check-In:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>checked In (count of venue check ins);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cancelled CheckIn (count of venue check ins cancelled - not check outs).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Processes used to prevent re-identification</h4>

<p>Only those with access to the app will have details of the venues checked into. No details about which venues a user has checked into is included in the analytical data set or provided to the use.</p>

<h3>Scenario: Contact Tracing Only (No Test Results sought, No Alerts Received)</h3>

<p>You choose to just download the app and use it solely for contact tracing purposes. The app is only used for the baseline contact tracing.</p>

<p>The app is not used for any other purpose such as test results. They have not interacted with any other app user who tested positive for COVID-19, updated their app status and choose to share their diagnosis key alerting other app users (including you).</p>

<h4>Outside of the app</h4>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19, the relevant Contact Tracing Team are likely to be in contact to establish who you have been in contact with and where you may have visited. This does not relate to your use of the app but is the normal manual contact tracing practice in public health emergencies.</p>

<p>In addition, if someone you know tests positive and they provide your details to the Contact Tracing team, this team will contact you. This will happen regardless of whether you have the app or not.</p>

<h4>Digital Contact Tracing</h4>

<p>In this scenario, the user is not generating any data from the use of the functions of the app.</p>

<h4>Apple Google GAEN</h4>

<p>As detailed for all app users. The app will hold the broadcast codes of other app users that the user has interacted with. As the users has received no alerts, none of the diagnosis keys within the reference set are relevant to the user. You would not receive an alert or a recommendation to self-isolate.</p>

<h4>Data Held on the App</h4>

<p>Your declared postcode district and selected local authority will be held on the app, along with all the reference material provided to every app user. There will be no venue or virology test results.</p>

<h4>Analytical Data</h4>

<p>The core details will be collected, in addition to the amount of data used and submitted by the app. The service and system checks data items will be present and populated, indicating that the app is working as expected.</p>

<h4>Function specific</h4>

<p>No function specific data will be generated for inclusion as the functions aren’t being used.</p>

<h4>Risk of reidentification</h4>

<h4>By the data controller</h4>

<p>The data collected from app users in this scenario and provided as part of the analytical data set include a minimal amount of data about the user and their use of the app.</p>

<p>The baseline risk of a reidentification (from small postcode district, rare phone make and model) is present but cannot be combined with other data associated with the app. No other data is held about the app user with a means of identifying them across systems. As they have not sought a test via the app or returned results to the app, even the possibility of linkage to other data sets does not exist.</p>

<h4>By other app users</h4>

<p>As no alerts sent or received by the user, the app user will not be identifiable to other app users even outside of the app’s functionality.</p>

<h3>Scenario: Using all the app’s functionality</h3>

<p>You have downloaded the app and are using all of its functions. You use the app to routinely check symptoms, and where prompted will seek a test and add your test results to the app. When asked you choose to share details so that other app users can be alerted if appropriately. You use venue check-ins when prompted.</p>

<p>Outside the use of the app, the app user may be contacted separately to the use of the app. This will happen regardless of whether you have the app or not.</p>

<h4>Digital Contact Tracing</h4>

<p>The app user will provide their Diagnosis key when prompted to the central system. This will be provided to all other app users, so the risk the user is to other app users can be assessed and when needed alerts issued whilst maintaining everyone’s privacy.</p>

<h4>Apple Google GAEN</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Broadcast codes of other app users along with key details that allow the proximity and length of contact to be assessed. These are not accessible to you as an app user or us [Contacts Detected];</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>List of Diagnosis Keys from the GAEN that were requested from user confirmed positive and shared with other users [Diagnosis Key Sets – reference material];</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Data Held on the App</h4>

<p>The app will hold details of all the venues checked into, unless deleted, test results and area of the user. The key differences with other app users will be the amount of venues listed and the current test result.</p>

<p>The same reference material is available to all app users.</p>

<h4>Analytical Data</h4>

<p>The set of analytical data will reflect the use of all the app functions. However, the data is a count or sum of data use. It will hold the: Core Details, Data Receipt and Transmission, as well as Service and system checks.</p>

<h4>Function specific</h4>

<p>All of the function specific data items will be collected. The combination may be particular to a user but (a) would, in part, reset every day and (b) be unable to be linked to the particular app user from the data retained.</p>

<p>For most data items, they are unlikely to be unique to any particular user. They cannot be linked to other data sets and would not identifiable in themselves.</p>

<h4>Risk of reidentification</h4>

<h4>By the data controller</h4>

<p>Despite the greater use of app functionality there is not a significantly greater risk of identification beyond the baseline. The data controller would need to know more details about the app user and their phone than is retained in the analytical data set.</p>

<p>Protections in place to ensure that test results are appropriately returned are crucial for maintaining the privacy and identity of the user. This is supported by the prompt deletion of the test code once results are returned to the correct app user.</p>

<h4>By other app users</h4>

<p>Other app users would need additional information outside of the context of the app in order to identify another app user. The protections within the app ensure that the app ensures the privacy of all app users. In the “rural postman” scenario, an app user would have a limited number of contacts during the week and would be able to make an educated guess about which other app user had triggered an alert and has tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>However, in such circumstances the individuals are likely to also be in contact with local Health Protection Teams (HPTs) and manual contact tracers. In such circumstances, which are routine for communicable diseases (as defined in law) and the COVID-19 public health emergency. The risk from users from the app is no greater and considerably less likely than the baseline risk of identification in public health situations which is necessary for the management of health risks to the public.</p>

<h3>Scenario: Testing (via the App)</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/105552/Scenario_1_test_booked_by_mobile_app.png" alt=""></div>
<figcaption><p>Scenario 1: test booked via mobile app</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>You have used the symptom checker and have been recommended to take a test. The user generates a code through the app, which accesses the test code generating API. The test code is passed to the relevant testing website These websites are external to the app (and is treated as a separate “data ecosystem”) and data associated with testing is held separately to data about app users. The app token is short-lived and created specifically upon requested.</p>

<p>The swab sample taken from the user, whether at home or via on-site testing, is linked to a barcode no identifiable data accompanies the test and no app token is included (the app test code). The test results are returned to the person seeking the test via email and SMS (text message).</p>

<p>The app system is informed of the test result associated with the token (app test code). No identifiable data flows to the app from testing. The app periodically checks if a result is available, when it is the app is updated and the result deleted from the central systems once confirmed as sent to the correct app user.</p>

<p>The test result must be returned to the correct app user which is regardless of whether the result is positive, negative or void.</p>

<h4>Returning the results and protecting the user’s privacy</h4>

<p>The technique used to provide app users with their correct result also ensure that the identity of the user is protected. When the app recommends a test for users it requests three separate tokens. These are generated by services outside of the app and are not recorded in the app. They are unique and anonymous and cannot be derived from each other or any other information. A secure database, used only for this purpose, associates these tokens and the three work together to maintain the privacy of users. Knowledge of just one token, particularly the CTA token, does not allow you to link results or trigger app functionality.</p>

<p>The three tokens are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The CTA Token which will go to the Virology website</li>
  <li>Test Polling Token is used by the app to check if a result is received</li>
  <li>Diagnosis Submission Token</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 1. When the NPEx system returns a test result it includes the CTA Token. The app service looks up the Test Polling Token linked to the CTA Token and add the result to a database along with the Test Polling Token. The CTA Token is then deleted.</p>

<p>Step 2. When the app next checks to see if a result is available it submits the testing polling token, which can then be matched with the one held along with the result. Once the result is returned, the Test Polling Token is deleted.</p>

<p>Step 3. If you receive a post test result, you are asked to submit your diagnosis keys by the app. When you do the keys along with the Diagnosis Submission Token. This token is used to ensure that the keys are associated with a genuine result. Once you have submitted diagnosis keys the Diagnosis Submission Tokens is deleted.</p>

<p>All three tokens are retained in an App service secure database for only as long as needed. All three are sent to the app which stores the tokens in a Secure local store. The Test Polling Token, Diagnosis Submission Token and CTA Token are all created when the app asks for a CTA token when a user is recommended to take a test. All tokens are deleted once the test result has been delivered to the app.</p>

<h4>Digital Contact Tracing</h4>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19 and receive or add your results to the app, you are prompted to share your diagnosis key with the app’s central system. If you choose to do so, this key is added to the list of diagnosis keys provided to all app users.</p>

<p>Once received by other app users, the app’s functionality (using the risk algorithm) combines with Apple Google’s functionality to see if they need to be alerted.</p>

<p>This enables the app to check the broadcast codes it holds to determine if any are derived from any diagnosis keys in the reference pack. As broadcast codes change every 15 minutes, diagnosis keys are associated with the daily code and the checking mechanism is in the hands of Apple Google, the app user’s privacy and identity is protected. The anonymity of the user is preserved from the DHSC (government) and other app users by the functionality of the app.</p>

<h4>Apple Google GAEN</h4>

<p>Data held will be in line with other app users.</p>

<h4>Data Held on the App</h4>

<p>In addition, to other data held on the app it will hold the app user’s test result for the relevant isolation period plus 14 days. A positive test result will trigger the self-isolation timer to commence.</p>

<h4>Analytical Data</h4>

<p>For void or negative test results this will be added to the analytical data set. For positive test results this will also be included for a period of 14 days In addition, the self-isolation countdown will commence and relevant background checks will check in. These monitor the users compliance with isolation but are not used for enforcement and privacy safeguards prevent the app for being used for this purpose.</p>

<h4>Relevant data items</h4>

<p>Test Results (into the app):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Received Void Test Result (test not conclusive)</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Analytical Data upon arrival at the central system</h4>

<p>No identifiers are provided to the data as it leaves the app, preventing a user from being identified across analytical data packets (subject to additional controls). On landing data will be placed into a row and time stamp of when the data arrived.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Row Level</li>
</ul>

<h4>Processes used to prevent re-identification</h4>

<p>The process of alerts for digital contact tracing prevents the app user being identifiable through data provided through the app’s functionality. The matching of diagnosis keys with broadcast codes, that are derived from them, protects the identity and privacy of app users.</p>

<h4>Within the analytical environment</h4>

<p>No data specific to the test process, code or process (other than the result) is retained in the app analytical environment.</p>

<h4>Within the testing system from website through to the return of the results</h4>

<p>See above for how the use of tokens and testing system protects the identity of users.</p>
