<p>The Inquiry will examine, consider and report on preparations and the response to the pandemic in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, up to and including the Inquiry’s formal setting-up date, 28 June 2022.</p>

<p>In carrying out its work, the Inquiry will consider reserved and devolved matters across the United Kingdom, as necessary, but will seek to minimise duplication of investigation, evidence gathering and reporting with any other public inquiry established by the devolved governments. To achieve this, the Inquiry will set out publicly how it intends to minimise duplication, and will liaise with any such inquiry before it investigates any matter which is also within that inquiry’s scope.</p>

<p>In meeting its aims, the Inquiry will:</p>

<p>a) consider any disparities evident in the impact of the pandemic on different categories of people, including, but not limited to, those relating to protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 and equality categories under the Northern Ireland Act 1998;</p>

<p>b) listen to and consider carefully the experiences of bereaved families and others who have suffered hardship or loss as a result of the pandemic. Although the Inquiry will not consider in detail individual cases of harm or death, listening to these accounts will inform its understanding of the impact of the pandemic and the response, and of the lessons to be learned;</p>

<p>c) highlight where lessons identified from preparedness and the response to the pandemic may be applicable to other civil emergencies;</p>

<p>d) have reasonable regard to relevant international comparisons; and</p>

<p>e) produce its reports (including interim reports) and any recommendations in a timely manner.</p>

<p>The aims of the Inquiry are to:</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
