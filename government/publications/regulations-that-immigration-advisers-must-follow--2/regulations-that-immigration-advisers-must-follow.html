<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Audits</h2>

<p>Audits allow the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner (<abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>) to check that all policies and procedures required by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-code-of-standards-commissioners-rules-2012">commissioner’s code of standards</a> are being followed. Audits also give advisers the opportunity to discuss any other issues that they might like to raise with the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>What audits cover</h3>

<p>Audits cover assessment of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>policies and procedures</li>
  <li>adviser competence in providing immigration advice or services</li>
</ul>

<p>When an adviser is due to be audited, <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> staff will explain how the audit process works, what’s involved, and timescales.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Arranging an audit</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> aims to audit all newly regulated organisations within 12 months of approval, and will decide when further audits are required. The office will contact advisers to arrange a suitable date for an audit.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Continued registration</h2>

<p>Registered organisations that want to continue their registration with the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> must re-register every year.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> notifies all organisations by email several weeks before the continued registration application has to be submitted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Continued registration fees</h3>

<p>The Immigration and Nationality and Immigration Services Commissioner (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 No. 296 is:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Application for continued registration</h3>

<p>Registered advisers need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/applications-for-continued-registration">download and complete the appropriate application(s)</a> for continued registration for their organisation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Professional Indemnity Insurance</h3>

<p>All <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> regulated organisations must have current and adequate Professional Indemnity Insurance (<abbr title="Professional Indemnity Insurance">PII</abbr>). No organisation can be part of the regulatory scheme if it doesn’t have <abbr title="Professional Indemnity Insurance">PII</abbr>. Code 52 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-code-of-standards-commissioners-rules-2012">commissioner’s code of standards</a> explain what’s required.</p>

<p>Depending on the policy’s terms, the adviser’s policy provider will cover compensation payable by an adviser to a client due to the adviser’s error, negligence, misrepresentation and/or inaccurate advice if this can be shown to have caused, or contributed to, the client’s financial or other loss.</p>

<p>Advisers need <abbr title="Professional Indemnity Insurance">PII</abbr> if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide advice to clients</li>
  <li>handle data belonging to a client or business</li>
  <li>are responsible for a client’s intellectual property</li>
  <li>provide a professional service and could be challenged on their work</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations are obliged to inform their insurance providers if they’re aware of either a potential claim or an actual complaint, as this makes it likely that any claim the adviser may make in respect of that matter on their policy will be accepted by the policy provider. An organisation that fails to do so is in danger of failing to comply with their policy’s conditions and consequently not having coverage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>
<abbr title="Professional Indemnity Insurance">PII</abbr> and client care letters</h3>

<p>If a client isn’t satisfied with the immigration advice and services provided, they’re entitled to raise their concerns with the regulated organisation. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-code-of-standards-commissioners-rules-2012">Codes 23-26</a> require advisers to include details of their complaint-handling procedure (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-code-of-standards-commissioners-rules-2012">Code 79</a>) in the client care letter they issue to all clients. The <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> strongly recommends that advisers also include in that letter information about their <abbr title="Professional Indemnity Insurance">PII</abbr>, using this suggested paragraph:</p>

<h4>Professional Indemnity Insurance</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> requires us to have Professional Indemnity Insurance (<abbr title="Professional Indemnity Insurance">PII</abbr>). The purpose of <abbr title="Professional Indemnity Insurance">PII</abbr> is to cover any compensation we may need to pay to correct a mistake or to cover any legal costs due to negligence, misrepresentation and/or inaccurate advice which may cause, or contribute to, financial or other loss to the client.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Complaints scheme</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-complaints-scheme-2012">complaints scheme</a> explains how the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> deals with complaints against people providing immigration advice or services. It also covers people who are employed by the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> or work under its supervision.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>If your circumstances change</h2>

<p>Advisers must notify the commissioner of any changes to their organisation that may affect an adviser’s or organisation’s competence or fitness within 10 days of the changes taking place.</p>

<p>Changes could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new adviser joining</li>
  <li>an adviser leaving</li>
  <li>ceasing to give immigration advice or services</li>
  <li>changing address</li>
  <li>taking someone on under supervision</li>
  <li>being placed under arrest</li>
</ul>

<p>Advisers should contact their <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> caseworker if they’re not sure whether they need to notify the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> of any changes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Adding a new adviser</h3>

<p>New advisers joining an organisation which is already regulated by the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> should download and complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-adviser-application-and-competence-statement">new adviser application and competence statement form</a>.</p>

<p>Where the level of competence of the new adviser will raise the competence level of the whole organisation, the application should be accompanied by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-application-for-regulated-organisations-to-work-at-a-new-level">application form and notes for raising levels</a>.</p>

<p>If the new adviser is currently regulated by the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> with another organisation, or was regulated by the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> within the last 6 months, it isn’t necessary to complete a competence statement. However, the organisation must provide the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> caseworker with the adviser’s details and await confirmation that they’ve been approved under their certificate of registration. The new adviser will not normally be required to undertake a competence assessment unless issues of concern were raised when previously regulated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Increase levels of existing advisers</h3>

<p>Advisers can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-application-for-adviser-raising-levels-competence-statement">apply to increase their level of competence</a> when they believe they’ve obtained the necessary training and experience to enable them to work at a higher level. As above, should this increase also result in an increase of level for the whole organisation, the organisation should also submit to the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-application-for-regulated-organisations-to-work-at-a-new-level">application form and notes for raising levels</a>.</p>

<p>All applications should be sent to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

The Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner
<br>5th Floor
<br>21 Bloomsbury Street
<br>London
<br>WC1B 3HF
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Applicant advisers aren’t permitted to provide immigration advice or services until they’re fully approved by the commissioner.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Closing an immigration advice organisation</h3>

<p>Advisers must inform their caseworkers that they’ll be closing down or ceasing to give advice. Advisers should also inform clients of the situation and either refer the client’s case on to another advisory organisation or hand the client’s file back to the client.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Continuing professional development scheme</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-continuing-professional-development-scheme/">continuing professional development (CPD) scheme</a> encourages and helps advisers to keep learning so that they are best able to help their clients.</p>

<p>Further information can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oiscs-reviewed-cpd-scheme">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Guidance and practice notes for advisers</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> produces a number of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-notes-for-regulated-immigration-advisers">guidance and practice notes</a> for immigration advisers.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Data protection</h2>

<p>Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-immigration-services-commissioner/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a> contains the standards you can expect when we ask for, or hold, your personal information.
