<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> About the FCDO Advisory Cadres</h2>

<p>World-leading technical and analytical capability is central to FCDO’s mission. FCDO Advisers embody these capabilities, playing a key role in the delivery of the UK’s international objectives and development impact in particular.</p>

<p>Advisers have a central role in the design, implementation, appraisal, and evaluation of international development programmes; in the development and implementation of foreign and development policy; and in diplomacy and international partnerships. They play an expert role in inter-disciplinary thinking and thought leadership, linking programmes and bringing deep expertise to maximise impact. They have strong links with specialist networks, research organisations, and professional bodies in the UK and globally.</p>

<p>Advisers are accredited to one or more of thirteen Advisory Cadres. These are professional bodies within FCDO and cover: Climate and Environment, Conflict, Economics, Education, Evaluation, Food and Agriculture, Governance, Health, Humanitarian, Infrastructure, Private Sector Development, Social Development, and Statistics. The Economics, Statistics, and Evaluation Cadres are linked to government-wide advisory services. Each Cadre has a Head of Profession (HoP), who is responsible for ensuring that professional standards are maintained both within the Cadre and for those wishing to join. The HoP provides thought leadership, quality assurance, and supports continuous professional development.</p>

<h3>Adviser capabilities</h3>

<p>Advisers have certain capabilities in common. These include but are not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>expertise and thought leadership in international policy and investment, applicable across a range of themes and geographies, and with a focus on development impact</li>
  <li>use of evidence to inform policy and programming including the use of political economy analysis</li>
  <li>policy and programme delivery, from design through to implementation and appraisal</li>
  <li>international influence and diplomacy, thinking and working politically and cooperatively, and through appropriate challenge, to shape norms and approaches</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Assessing capability</h2>

<p>Assessments will be based around a review of evidence that describes the extent of knowledge and expertise applicants hold in the relevant competencies, and also against capability levels from the FCDO Capability Framework: Awareness, Foundation, Practitioner and Expert (within Expert HoPs Group differentiate between Expert and Senior Expert). Note that particularly for Senior Expert level, consideration will be given to candidates’ ability to give high quality demonstration of technical leadership and an ability to communicate and influence in their evidence.</p>

<p>The TCFs are structured so that competencies are clearly defined and can be expressed at Practitioner, and Expert and Senior Expert.</p>

<h3>Practitioner</h3>

<ul>
  <li>strong and confident day to day application of capability in common or standard situations but may need to seek expert support on more complex issues</li>
  <li>holds several years of relevant experience* and may be augmented by a formal qualification of direct relevance</li>
  <li>minimum level for entry to the relevant Cadre – successful Technical Assessment dependent on fulfilling all stated criteria in the TCF</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expert</h3>

<ul>
  <li>recognised for specialist or technical knowledge and/or skill, underpinned by extensive experience applying it in practice on complex issues; connected with other experts</li>
  <li>holds several years of relevant experience* and may be augmented by a formal qualification of direct relevance</li>
  <li>standard level for entry to the relevant Cadre – successful Technical Assessment dependent on fulfilling all stated criteria in the TCF</li>
</ul>

<h3>Senior Expert</h3>

<ul>
  <li>recognised for deep specialist or technical knowledge and/or skill, underpinned by extensive experience applying it in practice on complex issues; connected with other experts</li>
  <li>holds significant years of relevant experience* and may be augmented by a formal qualification of direct relevance</li>
  <li>evidence of applying specialist knowledge and skill as well as displaying leadership qualities in a range of contexts</li>
  <li>accreditation dependent on fulfilling all stated criteria in the TCF and assessment against 2 Civil Service Competencies, Leadership and Communicating and Influencing</li>
</ul>

<p>*Relevant experience is defined as work experience in one or more sectors of direct relevance to the competency.</p>

<p>Accreditation assessments will take into account the entire academic and professional history of a candidate and not rely solely on their last or most recent post.</p>

<h3>Assessment framework</h3>

<p>The table below sets out the framework for how capability will be assessed at the competency level. The framework is based around the standard 1-7 scoring system used for Civil Service recruitments. During an accreditation round, the sift panel will agree a pass mark for all competencies. This could be, for example, 4. A sift will score all competencies at or above the pass mark for an applicant to pass from sift to interview. If a candidate applies for a level and does not pass, the sift panel can at their discretion agree whether they might still pass at a lower level. For example, an applicant might apply at Expert level. During the sift the panel might not pass them on all competencies, but after discussion agree to progress them to interview at Practitioner level.</p>

<p>Prior to interviews, the interview panel will again set a pass mark for all elements of the assessment. An interviewee must score higher than the pass mark in all areas to be considered for accreditation. If a candidate applies for a level and does not pass, the interview panel can at their discretion accredit the candidate at a lower level. Candidates who pass at a particular level cannot be considered for accreditation at a higher level, regardless of their scores. They must re-apply for accreditation at a higher level in a future accreditation round. The full set of accreditation requirements are specified in Section 5.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Routes to Accreditation</h2>

<p>There are 2 accreditation pathways to accredit to the Food and Agriculture cadre:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standard pathway: demonstration that knowledge and practice meets the requirement for Senior Expert*, Expert or Practitioner in all 4 standard competencies</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>specialist pathway: demonstration that knowledge and practice meets the requirement for Senior Expert*, Expert or Practitioner in a specialism and in 3 of the 4 standard competencies</li>
</ul>

<p>Those accredited at Senior Expert, Expert or Practitioner are considered to be accredited to the Food and Agriculture cadre.</p>

<p>The table below outlines the 2 routes to accreditation at the 3 levels:</p>
