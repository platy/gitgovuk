<h2>
<span class="number">2 Reasons </span> for restrictions and their scope</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Why we impose restrictions</h3>

<p>Weâ€™re imposing restrictions to limit a tax-avoidance practice known as forestalling. This is a practice whereby excessive quantities of goods are removed for home-use on payment of duty because an increase in the rate of duty is expected.</p>

<p>The Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979, section 6(A) (2) (b) allows the Commissioners to restrict the removal for home-use of goods in quantities exceeding those which appear to the Commissioners to be reasonable.</p>

<h3 class="2">
<span class="number">2.2 </span> The products that are affected</h3>
<p>Restrictions apply to cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco. Restrictions do not currently apply to cigars, other smoking tobacco, chewing tobacco or tobacco for heating.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> When restrictions apply</h3>
<p>Restrictions can be applied for a period of up to 3 months prior to an anticipated rate rise, this period is known as the controlled period.</p>

<p>For Autumn 2022, the controlled period will be from 1 September 2022 until 11:59am on the day of the rate rise.  Any removals after 11.59am on that day, will be deemed to have taken place at the time at which any rate rise takes effect.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this notice and to allow you to apply for an allocation, it is assumed that a rate rise will occur on 16 October 2022.</p>

<p>Any restrictions for future years will be announced in future anti-forestalling notices. If we decide not to impose restrictions in any year, weâ€™ll publish an information sheet to say that.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Removals that are affected</h3>

<p>Restrictions apply to all cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco for home-use which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>removed from registered tobacco premises</li>
  <li>removed from an excise warehouse</li>
  <li>cleared on payment of Excise Duty (and any Customs Duty) at the place of entry into the UK</li>
  <li>imported using the registered consignee scheme which will apply only to Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3 How </span> to obtain an allocation</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re an excise warehouse keeper, registered consignee or a person clearing cigarettes, hand-rolling tobacco, or both at importation, you must also read <a class="govuk-link" href="#additional-warehouse-consignees">section 5</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Why you must obtain an allocation</h3>

<p>Your allocation specifies the quantity of cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco you may remove to home-use during the controlled period. Unless youâ€™ve obtained an allocation, you will not be permitted to remove any cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco to home-use during the controlled period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> How you obtain an allocation</h3>

<p>There are 2 stages in obtaining an allocation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you must submit an opening statement showing the quantity of cigarettes (sticks) and hand-rolling tobacco (kg) youâ€™ve calculated that you may remove to home-use during the controlled period (see paragraphs <a class="govuk-link" href="#How-to-calculate-your-allocation">3.3</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#format-opening-statement">3.4</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#calculate-importing-cigarettes">3.5</a>)</li>
  <li>if we agree with your calculation, weâ€™ll write to you confirming your allocation, the confirmation will set out the total quantity of cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco that youâ€™ll be permitted to remove during the controlled period, without further authority from our Officer</li>
</ul>

<p>During the controlled period, you can remove cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco duty paid up to, but not in excess of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your total allocation</li>
  <li>the percentage specified at <a class="govuk-link" href="#How-to-calculate-your-allocation">paragraph 3.3</a> in each calendar month during the controlled period</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> How to calculate your allocation</h3>

<p>The quantity you may remove during the controlled period will be based on your average daily home-use removals in the base period, the 12 months ending on 30 June 2021.</p>

<h4>Cigarettes</h4>

<p>The formula to be applied for cigarettes has 3 steps.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>

<p>Calculate your average daily removals and multiply this figure by the number of days in the controlled period as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td style="text-align: right"></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Removals over the 12 month period to 30 June 2022 Ã· 365</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Ã— 77 days (the number of days from 1 September 2022 to the day of the rate rise)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<p>Allocation = Stage 1 Ã— 97%</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<p>A further restriction then needs to be applied to ensure that removals take place in a balanced manner during the controlled period. How you do this will be at your own discretion, but you cannot remove more than 40% of your calculated allocation in any calendar month during the controlled period.</p>

<p>The following table provides examples of how you may split your allocation over each month of the controlled period. This of course can vary, but, itâ€™s important that you remove no more than 40% in any calendar month of the controlled period.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">September</th>
      <th scope="col">October</th>
      <th scope="col">November</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>30%</td>
      <td>30%</td>
      <td>40%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>40%</td>
      <td>40%</td>
      <td>20%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Hand-rolling tobacco</h4>

<p>The formula to be applied for hand-rolling tobacco also has 3 steps.</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>

<p>Calculate your average daily removals (kgs) and multiply this figure by the number of days in the controlled period as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td style="text-align: right"></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Removals over the 12 month period to 30 June 2022 Ã· 365</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Ã— 77 days (the number of days from 1 September 2022 to the day of the rate rise)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

<p>Allocation = Stage 1 Ã— 100%</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<p>No more than 40% of your calculated allocation can be removed in any calendar month during the controlled period.</p>

<p>The table provides examples of how you may split your allocation over each month of the controlled period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> The format that you must use for the opening statement</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re a manufacturer or an importer using an excise warehouse, you must submit an opening statement in the format given at <a class="govuk-link" href="#Opening-statement-manufacturer-warehouses">section 7</a>. If youâ€™re a new importer who started removing cigarettes, or hand-rolling tobacco, or both to home-use after 1 July 2022, you should ignore the rest of this paragraph and read <a class="govuk-link" href="#calculate-importing-cigarettes">paragraph 3.5</a> instead.</p>

<p>Anyone else who removed cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco, or both to home-use before 1 July 2022 and who is applying for an allocation must submit an opening statement in the format given at <a class="govuk-link" href="#opening-statement-imports-third-countries">section 8</a>.</p>

<p>Your opening statement must show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the quantity of cigarettes and amount of hand-rolling tobacco you removed for home-use between 1 July 2021 and 30 June 2022 inclusive</li>
  <li>the overall allocation, that youâ€™ve calculated using the formula at <a class="govuk-link" href="#How-to-calculate-your-allocation">paragraph 3.3</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> How to calculate your allocation if youâ€™ve only recently started importing cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco</h3>

<p>Special consideration will be given to those who started importing cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco, or both and removing them to home-use less than 12 months before the start of the controlled period. If youâ€™re in such a position, and require an allocation, you should write to HMRC, Tobacco Policy Team by email at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:holding.movement@hmrc.gov.uk">holding.movement@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>when you began or intend to start importing cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco, or both</li>
  <li>the quantity of cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco â€” which youâ€™ve removed to home-use during the past 12 months</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> The date HMRC must receive your opening statement</h3>

<p>All opening statements must be received by HMRC no later than Monday 12 September 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> If you find an error</h3>

<p>If you find an error in the calculation of your allocation, you must tell the Tobacco Policy Team immediately (<a class="govuk-link" href="#calculate-importing-cigarettes">paragraph 3.5</a>), supplying details of the error.</p>

<p>If you need to submit a revised opening statement for any reason, you should send it to your relevant contact point, as above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> Youâ€™ve submitted a revised opening statement</h3>

<p>If youâ€™ve submitted a revised opening statement for any reason, HMRC will write to you confirming your revised allocation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span> If HMRC does not agree with the calculation on your opening statement</h3>

<p>If we do not agree with your calculation for any reason, weâ€™ll contact you to explain why and ask you to complete a revised opening statement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> Reducing your allocation</h3>

<p>If we find that your allocation in your opening statement is unreasonably high, for example as a result of changes in market share during the base period, weâ€™ll require a reduction in the quantity of cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco that you may remove to home-use during the controlled period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span> If the duty rate change is not on the assumed date</h3>

<p>If, before the end of the controlled period, it becomes clear that the duty rate change will be later than the assumed date in <a class="govuk-link" href="#restrictions-apply">paragraph 2.3</a> we may publish an extension notice. This allows us to extend the controlled period for up to one month and make any changes that we believe are appropriate. See subsections (6) and (7) of section 6A of the Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979.</p>

<p>Following publication of an extension notice youâ€™ll need to amend your allocation and submit a revised opening statement.</p>

<p>If HMRC establishes before the end of the controlled period that the duty rate change will be earlier than the published assumed date, we may make changes to the controlled period that we believe are appropriate. See section 6A(8)(a) of the Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979.</p>

<p>In these circumstances you must submit your revised opening statement to Tobacco Policy Team at the email address in <a class="govuk-link" href="#calculate-importing-cigarettes">paragraph 3.5</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.12 </span> Youâ€™re a manufacturer, importer or registered consignee (Northern Ireland only) and you need to apply for an additional allocation</h3>

<p>If you consider that you have sufficient grounds to apply for an additional allocation you should write to the Tobacco Team at the address shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="#calculate-importing-cigarettes">paragraph 3.5</a>.</p>

<p>You should explain the circumstances that have caused your request and provide supporting documentary evidence as appropriate.</p>

<p>We will only allow extra allocations in exceptional circumstances. These circumstances could be due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>destruction of duty paid goods due to withdrawal of a brand</li>
  <li>duty paid goods destroyed due to accidental fire or flooding</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive and each case will need to be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.13 </span> If I want to remove to home-use more than my allocation of cigarettes</h3>

<p>You cannot, under any circumstances, remove to home-use more than your permitted allocation. This also includes removing no more than 40% of your total allocation in any calendar month of the controlled period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.14 </span> If you exceed your allocation</h3>

<p>If you exceed your total allocation or the monthly restrictions of no more than 40% you may be liable to a financial penalty. See subsections (1) and (2) of section 6B of the Tobacco Products Duty Act 1979.</p>

<p>The penalty could be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>150% of the lost duty (if any) where youâ€™ve provided us with an admission notice</li>
  <li>200% of the lost duty (if any) in any other case</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4 Admission </span> notices</h2>

For example, you may have exceeded your agreed overall allocation in the controlled period or removed more than 40% of your allocation in any calendar month of the controlled period.</p>

<p>This section does not apply to manufacturers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Additional requirements for importers storing cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco, or both in an excise warehouse</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re an importer and you store cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco, or both in excise warehouses and intend to make removals for home-use during the controlled period, you must follow the guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="#How-obtain-allocation">section 3</a> and apply for an allocation.</p>

<p>When applying for your allocation, you must send with your opening statement a schedule detailing the addresses of the excise warehouses from which you intend removing cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco during the controlled period.</p>

<p>The total quantity of cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco you intend to remove cannot exceed your allocation calculated in accordance with the guidance at <a class="govuk-link" href="#How-obtain-allocation">section 3</a> and shown on your opening statement.</p>

<p>You will not be permitted to remove cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco from any warehouse which is not listed on the schedule to your opening statement.</p>

<p>You must also provide a copy of your opening statement, together with our confirmation of your allocation, to each excise warehouse keeper from whose premises you intend to remove cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco during the controlled period.</p>

<p>If you do not provide the opening statement and our confirmation to the warehouse keeper, you will not be allowed to remove your goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> If you are an excise warehouse keeper storing cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco, or both belonging to other people in your excise warehouse</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re an excise warehouse keeper who stores cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco, or both for third parties, you must ensure that any home-use removals of cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco are not in excess of the ownerâ€™s total and monthly allocation.</p>

<p>You must also ensure that, for all removals to home-use of cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco, or both from your warehouse during the controlled period, you retain a copy of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the relevant opening statement</li>
  <li>our letter confirming the allocation</li>

<p>You should not allow removals if you do not have these documents.</p>

<p>The controlling officer for your warehouse will check that these requirements have been met.</p>

<span class="number">5.3 </span> Imports to the UK</h3>

<p>If you intend to import cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco, or both into the UK and account for the excise duty at the place of importation during the controlled period, the restrictions still apply.</p>

<p>You must apply for an allocation as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#How-obtain-allocation">section 3</a>.</p>

<p>You should send your application to the address in <a class="govuk-link" href="#calculate-importing-cigarettes">paragraph 3.5</a>.</p>

<p>If you attempt to clear goods at a port or airport without first agreeing an allocation with us, your consignment may be delayed.</p>
