<span class="number">1. </span>Community status</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>The terms ‘community status’ or ‘community goods’ are applied to goods originating in the UK or an EU member state, and goods imported into the UK or an EU member state, on which any Customs Duty has already been paid and has not been refunded. Goods that have benefited from a total or partial relief of Customs Duty are not community goods. Goods of community status are also described as being ‘in free circulation’. ‘Non-community status’ applies to goods not in free circulation in the community.</p>

<p>The vast majority of goods moving within the UK or EU are deemed to be community goods unless it is established that they do not have community status. However, there are circumstances when, in spite of this rule, it will be necessary to prove the status of community goods.</p>

<p>Further details of the circumstances under which proof of the community status of goods is required is given in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/procedural_aspects/transit/common_community/index_en.htm" rel="external">Transit Manual</a>.</p>

<p>Further information on the status of the goods can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transit-manual-supplement">Transit Manual Supplement</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Proof of the community status of goods</h3>

<p>A full list of documents and rules used for proving community status and guidance on the use of community status documents can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/procedural_aspects/transit/common_community/index_en.htm" rel="external">Transit Manual</a> but these include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a T2L or T2LF (copy 4 or 4/5 of the Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>))</li>
  <li>a properly completed commercial document (invoice or transport document or shipping company’s manifest)</li>
  <li>if the community status of goods is required to be proved for goods travelling from the UK under an ATA or TIR carnet the symbol ‘T2L’ can be entered in the space reserved for the description of the goods - this must be accompanied by the declarant’s signature, if the carnet includes both community and non-community goods they must be listed separately and ‘T2L’ entered alongside the UK or EU goods</li>
  <li>the ship’s logbook is used to provide evidence of community status for catches made by fishing vessels registered in the UK or one of the EU member states and landed in another EU member state</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Authentication of community status documents</h3>

<p>The most efficient way for users to authenticate community status documents is to become an authorised consignor for community status purposes.</p>

<p>This avoids the need for the goods or community status documents to be presented to customs.</p>

<p>Authorised consignors can either use pre-authenticated T2Ls, which have the customs stamp pre-printed on copy 4 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>, or authenticate their own T2Ls or community status declarations on commercial documents.</p>

<p>Traders who wish to be approved as authorised consignors for community status purposes can apply on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-apply-for-comprehensive-guarantee-and-other-simplifications-c1343">form C1343</a> to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

<p>Telephone: 0300 322 7905 and select option 2<br>
Fax: 03000 575 992</p>

<p>For traders who are not authorised consignors T2L/T2LF documents (ie copy 4 or 4/5 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>) can be sent to the National Clearance Hub for authentication. These documents, together with supporting documents and a stamped self-addressed envelope for return of the documents should be sent to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

The National Clearance Hub
<br>Ralli Quays
<br>3 Stanley Street
<br>Salford
<br>Manchester
<br>M60 9HL
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>There is no public counter facility at this address, so these documents will need to be sent by post. Processing will be done Monday to Friday during normal office hours.</p>

<p>The National Clearance Hub can also authenticate commercial documents. Authentication of commercial documents is not necessary where the value of the community goods does not exceed 10,000 euro but the name of the competent customs office must be written on the document in addition to the information set out above.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>ATA Carnets</h2>

<p>An ATA carnet is an international customs document. It can be used in place of normal customs documents to temporarily export certain goods for use outside the UK or EU. It can also be used to temporarily import certain non-community goods for use in the UK.</p>

<p>Each carnet consists of a cover with vouchers and counterfoils for use during each movement of goods covered by the carnet. The carnet must be presented to customs each time goods enter or leave a country for the relevant voucher to be stamped and detached and for the corresponding counterfoil to be certified.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>TIR Carnets</h2>

<p>TIR carnets are used to accompany goods travelling in sealed road vehicles or containers across several different countries, as long as those countries are signatories to the UN’s TIR Convention. Their use avoids the need to use national transit procedures for each country through which the goods pass. They do not replace standard import declarations.</p>

<p>The UK and EU is considered a single territory for TIR purposes. When TIR consignments are in transit through the UK or EU the carnet must be presented to customs at the place of arrival in and departure from the UK or EU. When a TIR movement ends in the UK the carnet must be submitted with the import declaration.</p>

<p>Traders who move goods under the cover of a TIR carnet are also required to submit a TIR declaration to the NCTS for that part of the journey within the territory of the UK and EU. The NCTS generates the Transit Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr>) which is affixed to the TIR carnet.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the paper TIR carnet remains the legal instrument and is required to be presented along with any accompanying documents, the vehicle and the goods.</p>

<p>Further information about the TIR carnet system can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/procedural_aspects/transit/common_community/index_en.htm" rel="external">Transit Manual</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transit-manual-supplement">Transit Manual Supplement (see section 2.1)</a>.</p>

<p>With effect from 1 October 2005, traders can apply for authorisation as authorised consignees to receive goods transported under the TIR procedure at their premises or any other specified place. Applications for authorized consignee for TIR should be made on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-apply-for-comprehensive-guarantee-and-other-simplifications-c1343">form C1343</a>:</p>
