<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> What this notice is about</h3>

<p>This notice gives important advice and information about what to do if you have had something seized by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force. It applies to the seizure of things, such as goods and vehicles, under section 139 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/2/section/139" rel="external">Customs and Excise Management Act 1979</a>. It does not apply to seizures carried out under any other law.</p>

<p>Details of the things seized from you will be listed on one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a seizure information notice handed to you or your agent if the thing was seized in your or their presence — the reason for the seizure should have been explained to the person present at the time of seizure</li>
  <li>a notice of seizure sent to you if you or your agent were not present when the thing was seized</li>
</ul>

<p>The information in this notice covers seizures by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and Border Force because the process is the same even though they are separate government organisations. However, it gives different contact details for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and Border Force. It is important that you contact the correct organisation, depending on who seized something from you, so your case can be dealt with promptly.</p>

<p>Seizures of cash under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/contents" rel="external">Proceeds of Crime Act 2002</a> and seizures made under section 19 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/contents" rel="external">Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (<abbr title="Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984">PACE</abbr>)</a> are not covered by information in this notice. If your cash or goods have been seized under either of these acts, your receipt or notice of seizure for that will include details about what you can do if you do not agree with the seizure.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> What to do if you have had something seized</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Your options if you disagree with the seizure</h3>

<p>If you have had something seized by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force and you do not accept there was a legal right to seize it and you want them to consider returning it, you have 3 options. You can:</p>

<p>(a) challenge the legality of the seizure by sending a notice of claim to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section3">section 3</a> below)</p>

<p>(b) write to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force asking for the thing to be returned to you even if you accept it was seized legally — this is called restoration — (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section4">section 4</a> below)</p>

<p>(c) do both of the above at the same time by challenging the legality of the seizure and asking for the seized thing to be returned in the meantime (see sections <a class="govuk-link" href="#section3">3</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#section4">4</a>)</p>

<p>It is important to understand that challenging the legality of the seizure (option (a) above) and asking for restoration (option (b) above) are 2 completely separate processes. The legality of a seizure is a matter that is dealt with before a court by way of condemnation proceedings, usually by a magistrate’s courts, or in Scotland the Sheriff’s court. Restoration is decided by either <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force but if you do not agree with their decision you can ask for a statutory review. Both processes are explained in more detail in sections <a class="govuk-link" href="#section3">3</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#section4">4</a> of this notice. If you choose option (c), the 2 processes may be dealt with at the same time but in separate ways. They cannot be combined because magistrates’ courts and tribunals have different areas of authority.</p>

<p>If you do not challenge the legality of the seizure by submitting a notice of claim, you will not be able to challenge it later at the tribunal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Where to get more advice</h3>

<p>In addition to the information in this notice, you may wish to get legal advice. You may have to pay for this. You can also consult your local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk" rel="external">Citizens Advice</a>. The Citizens Advice should be able to offer you general advice on what you can do but they are unable to assist with specific cases. Details of your local Citizens Advice are in the phone directory or on their website.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Personal property</h3>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force has seized your vehicle, you should take as much of your personal property from it as you can, particularly any high-value things. You should tell the seizing officer about any property you are unable to take so they can record it.</p>

<p>Smaller items will be placed in a sealed bag. You will not be allowed to take any seized things or items of property that are being held as evidence of any criminal proceedings.</p>

<p>If, at a later date, you want to arrange for the collection of any property you could not take with you at the time, you should write to the address shown on the seizure information notice or on the notice of seizure. Your letter must arrive within 45 days of the date of seizure and you should mark it ‘personal property’. You must collect or make arrangements for collection of your personal property within a reasonable period (2 months from the date of seizure). If you have not collected your personal property within 2 months, it’ll be disposed of.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Documents that have been taken from you</h3>

<p>If you are present at the time of seizure, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force will, whenever possible, give you copies of any documents they take from you. If they did not do that or you were not present at the time of seizure, you can apply for copies by writing to the address on the seizure information notice or on the notice of seizure.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How to challenge <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s or Border Force’s legal right to seize something</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Circumstances when you can challenge a seizure</h3>

<p>If you believe something should not have been seized, you can challenge the legality of the seizure. That will lead to a court hearing where <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force has to prove the seizure was lawful. The burden is on the claimant to prove goods are duty paid.</p>

<p>You may believe that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force had no legal right to seize something because, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>excise goods brought into Northern Ireland from an EU country were for your own use or to be given away</li>
  <li>goods imported into Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) from outside the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, or into Northern Ireland from outside both the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and the EU, were within your statutory allowance</li>
  <li>duty has been paid on <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> excise goods that are liable to duty</li>
  <li>goods were not prohibited or restricted</li>
  <li>a vehicle running on duty-rebated fuel (such as red diesel) was allowed to use it</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Who can challenge the seizure</h3>

<p>Any person can challenge the legality of the seizure but the person who does that (or their solicitor) must swear an oath at court that they owned the thing at the time of seizure. As the owner you may ask someone else to send a notice of claim for you but it must include your signed authority for them to act on your behalf. All challenges to seizure made by Border Force must include an authority form. Failure to provide a signed authority may cause delay in Border Force giving you a decision. There’s an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/659954/Agent_authority_form.pdf" rel="external">example of an authority form</a> you can use.</p>

<p>Where some of the seized things are owned by different people, each person who wants to challenge the seizure of their items must send a notice of claim to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force within the time limit.</p>

<p>If you want to write a joint letter each person must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sign the letter</li>
  <li>give their full name and address</li>
  <li>state which of the seized things their challenge refers to</li>
  <li>use continuation sheets where necessary to include all relevant information</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> How to challenge the seizure</h3>

<p>You can challenge a seizure by sending a notice of claim to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force, depending on who made the seizure, setting out the reasons for your challenge.</p>

<p>When sending a notice of claim, we recommend that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>write to us in English — this will allow us to process your request more efficiently and reduce delays</li>
  <li>use a service that gives you proof of postage — failure to do so may result in your notice of claim being received outside the legal deadline, which may mean that we will not be able to proceed with your challenge</li>
</ul>

<p>In legal terms, by making a notice of claim you are asking <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force to start court action known as condemnation proceedings. These proceedings decide whether something was liable to forfeiture and seized lawfully by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force. The proceedings do not involve court action against any person to decide if they are guilty of an offence in relation to seized things, such as smuggling.</p>

<p>An example notice of claim letter is at <a class="govuk-link" href="#paragraph-315">paragraph 3.15</a> of this notice. You may use it to challenge the seizure or, if you prefer, you may write your challenge in your own words. The format of your claim will not affect how your case is treated but you must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear reasons why you believe <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force was wrong to seize the thing</li>
  <li>your full name and address</li>
  <li>any reference you were given by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or by Border Force</li>
  <li>evidence of ownership if your vehicle has been seized</li>
  <li>continuation sheets where necessary to ensure you include all the relevant information</li>
</ul>

<p>A notice of claim should only list the things whose seizure you want to challenge. You should be as specific as possible, including quantities where possible such as the weight of rolling tobacco, number of cigarettes, litres of beer, wine or spirits and brand names. If you have had several things seized and you accept the seizure of some items was lawful, do not include those on your notice of claim.</p>

<p>Your case will be dealt with more quickly if it is clear from the start what you are asking us to do.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Time limit for challenging the seizure</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force must receive your notice of claim within one calendar month of the date of seizure shown on the seizure information notice or the date shown on the notice of seizure. If <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force does not receive a notice of claim within the time limit, you will not be able to challenge the legality of the seizure.</p>

<p>The time limit is set by the law and there is no provision for late challenges. This means that unless the legality of a seizure is challenged within the one month time limit, ownership will pass to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force (depending on who seized the goods). There is no other way to challenge the legality of a seizure even if you later decide to appeal against a duty assessment or wrongdoing penalty.</p>

<p>The one calendar month period starts on the day after the seizure and ends at 11:59pm on the last day of the one month period, irrespective of how many days are in the month. For example, if the seizure occurred on the 30 June, the calendar month starts on 1 July and ends at 11:59pm on 31 July.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Where to send my notice of claim</h3>

<p>It is important that you send your notice of claim to the correct address. If you do not send it to the correct address, there could be a delay in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force dealing with your challenge against a seizure.</p>

<p>If your things were seized by Border Force, for example on arrival in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> at a port or airport or at an import postal hub, you should send your notice of claim to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

National Post Seizure Unit
<br>Border Force
<br>3rd Floor
<br>West point
<br>Ebrington Street
<br>Plymouth
<br>PL4 9LT
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>If your things were seized by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and are excise goods, you should send your notice of claim to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Solicitor’s Office and Legal Services
<br>HMRC
<br>Excise Reviews &amp; Litigation
<br>BX9 1ZT
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>or email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:admin.excise.appeals.team@hmrc.gov.uk">admin.excise.appeals.team@hmrc.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Make sure you email the correct team or your email may be returned.</p>

<p>If your things were seized by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and are customs goods, you should send your notice of claim to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Solicitor’s Office and Legal Services
<br>HMRC
<br>Customs Reviews &amp; Litigation
<br>BX9 1ZT
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>or email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:sols.customsra@hmrc.gov.uk">sols.customsra@hmrc.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Make sure you email the correct team or your email may be returned.</p>

<p>For both <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and Border Force claims send as much information as you can so your notice of claim is referred to the correct person to deal with your case. It is particularly important that you write in English wherever possible and include any case reference numbers on the notice of seizure or seizure information notice as these will help identify the goods and ensure your notice of claim is directed to the correct place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> If you live outside the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you live outside the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the Isle of Man you must provide additional information as well as sending a notice of claim. You must also send <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force the name and address of a solicitor in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> instructed to act on your behalf and to accept the service of legal documents. You should complete an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/659954/Agent_authority_form.pdf">agent authority form</a> with the solicitor’s details to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force that the solicitor is authorised to act on your behalf. You must do this within the one calendar month time limit for sending a notice of claim.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> What happens when <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force receives a notice of claim</h3>

<p>When <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force receives a notice of claim, they apply to the appropriate court for condemnation proceedings, which is the process for dealing with a claim against a seizure. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force will apply to the court as soon as possible, in most cases within 6 months, in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The court then sends you details of when and where the hearing will take place. The type of court and the document you receive with details of the hearing varies, depending on where in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> the goods were seized. Condemnation proceedings for things seized in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>England or Wales are usually held in a magistrates’ court and you will receive a summons</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland are held in a magistrates’ court and you will receive a notice of application</li>
  <li>Scotland are usually held in a sheriff’s court and you will receive a writ</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> What happens at the court hearing</h3>

<p>You’ll be asked to confirm on oath that you owned the thing at the time it was seized. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force will present their evidence showing why they think the thing was seized and you will be able to tell the court why you disagree. The magistrate then decides whether <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force was right to make the seizure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span> These are not criminal proceedings</h3>

<p>Challenging the legality of a seizure is a civil process, mainly to establish whether something was seized lawfully by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force. A notice of claim will trigger <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force to start court proceedings to decide if a seizure was lawful. Those proceedings only decide what should happen to seized things. They do not decide any action against a person in relation to seized things so you will not get a criminal record just because the court decides <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force was right to seize something.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> You do not need a solicitor for condemnation proceedings</h3>

<p>You do not have to be legally represented at condemnation proceedings unless you live outside the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#paragraph-36">paragraph 3.6</a> of this notice). However, you may want to instruct a solicitor to act on your behalf. This is usually at your own expense.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and Border Force can explain the options available to you but they are not able to give you legal advice. It is for you to make a decision on whether you wish to challenge the legality of the seizure and seek restoration. If you need more information about what to do next, beyond what is available in this notice, you should consider consulting a solicitor.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span> How long the process takes</h3>

<p>Challenging the legality of a seizure can take several months from when you send <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force your notice of claim to when it is heard in court. The court hearing itself usually lasts less than a day.</p>

<p>If criminal proceedings have been started, the civil process will be adjourned until the conclusion of the criminal action.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.12 </span> What happens if you are successful at the condemnation proceedings</h3>

<p>If the court decides in your favour, the seized thing will be returned to you. If <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force has already disposed of the seized thing, the owner has the right to ask for compensation of an amount equal to the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sum paid for the goods in question</li>
  <li>proceeds of sale (where <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force have sold the goods in question)</li>
  <li>market value of the goods at the time of seizure</li>
</ul>

<p>The market value of the goods at the time of a seizure may, for example, be the price you paid for them abroad. Alternatively, it might be an amount agreed by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force and the owner of the goods. If <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force and the owner of seized items cannot agree on the market value of seized goods, an independent referee appointed by the Lord Chancellor may decide the value.</p>

<p>Additional compensation (perhaps for costs, travel expenses, interest) would only be considered in exceptional cases, such as where it can be shown that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force has wrongfully interfered with the goods in question.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.13 </span> What happens if you are not successful at the condemnation proceedings</h3>

<p>If the court finds in favour of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force, it will make an order forfeiting the seized thing to them. The court may also order you to pay their costs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.14 </span> You change your mind during the process</h3>

<p>You can withdraw your challenge against the seizure at any stage by writing to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force but you may still have to pay some of their costs if the case is well advanced. If you decide to withdraw your challenge, it is important that you write to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you withdraw your challenge, you are accepting the seizure was lawful and the seized things will be condemned. It will not affect any request for restoration (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section4">section 4</a> below) but you will not be able to challenge the legality of the seizure as part of a request for restoration. Similarly, if you later appeal against a duty assessment or wrongdoing penalty issued to you after a seizure of excise goods, you will not be able to do that on the grounds that excise duty was not payable on them or had already been paid unless you have challenged the legality of the seizure by submitting a notice of claim.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.15 </span> Notice of claim — example letter</h3>

<p>You may use this letter if you want to challenge the seizure of your things (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section3">section 3</a>). This includes cases where you claim excise goods were for your own use.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/659953/Notice_of_Claim_letter.pdf">notice of claim - example letter.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> If you want <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force to return the seized things</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force policy to return seized things</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and Border Force’s general policy is not to return seized excise goods (such as alcohol or tobacco products), vehicles used for commercial smuggling or anything that is prohibited (such as illegal drugs, offensive weapons or endangered plant and animal species) or where there has been an attempt to evade any duty. However, they will consider all requests for the return of seized things and take all relevant facts into account.</p>

<p>The process of returning a seized thing to someone is called restoration. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and Border Force normally only restore a thing to its rightful owner but they will take arrangements with third parties into consideration.</p>

<p>If you want goods returned because you believe they should not have been seized in the first place, perhaps because you claim excise goods are for your ‘own use’, the only avenue open to you is to challenge the legality of the seizure by sending a notice of claim (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section3">section 3</a>). You cannot use the restoration process for this.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> When you can ask for restoration</h3>

<p>You can ask <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force to consider returning the seized thing even if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you accept it was legally seized</li>
  <li>you have already challenged the seizure and you are waiting for a court hearing</li>
  <li>the time limit for challenging the seizure has expired and ownership of the thing has passed automatically to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force — this must be within a reasonable period</li>
</ul>

<p>Your goods will not be restored if your reason for that request is that things were not legally seized or, in the case of excise goods, they were imported for your ‘own use’. You should challenge the legality of the seizure instead bearing in mind the one calendar month time limit for doing that (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section3">section 3</a>).</p>

<p>If the seizure involves a vehicle, it may have been restored to you immediately after it was seized, perhaps on payment of a restoration fee.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> How to ask for restoration</h3>

<p>You should ask for restoration of a seized thing in writing. An example of a restoration request letter is at <a class="govuk-link" href="#paragraph-414">paragraph 4.14</a> of this notice. If you prefer to write in your own words, you must make it clear that you want the seized thing or things restored to you.</p>

<p>When posting a letter to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force, you should get proof of posting and keep it for your own records.</p>

<p>To help <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force deal with your request quickly, your letter should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be written in English</li>
  <li>include your full name and address</li>
  <li>quote any reference number shown on the seizure information notice or notice of seizure</li>
  <li>explain why you think the thing should be restored to you, giving the full circumstances and enclosing any available evidence to support your request</li>
  <li>include proof of ownership of the thing (such as purchase receipts)</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force will normally acknowledge your letter within 10 working days of receiving it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Where to send your restoration request</h3>

<p>It is important that you send your request for restoration to the appropriate office shown below to avoid any delay in dealing with it.</p>

<p>If the goods were seized by Border Force, perhaps for example on arrival in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> at a port or airport or at an import postal hub, you should write to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

National Post Seizure Unit
<br>Border Force
<br>3rd floor
<br>West point
<br>Ebrington Street
<br>Plymouth

<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>or email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:npsu@homeoffice.gov.uk">npsu@homeoffice.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>If the goods were seized by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, you should write to the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> office whose details are shown on the notice of seizure or seizure information notice. Exceptionally, where no details are shown on the notices, for excise goods you should write to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Solicitor’s Office and Legal Services
<br>HMRC
<br>Excise Reviews &amp; Litigation
<br>BX9 1ZT
<br>

<p>or email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:admin.excise.appeals.team@hmrc.gov.uk">admin.excise.appeals.team@hmrc.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Ensure you email the correct team or your email may be returned.</p>

<p>If the goods seized are customs, write to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Solicitor’s Office and Legal Services
<br>HMRC
<br>Customs Reviews &amp; Litigation
<br>BX9 1ZT

<p>or email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:sols.customsra@hmrc.gov.uk">sols.customsra@hmrc.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Ensure you email the correct team or your email may be returned.</p>

<p>When you are writing to either <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force, you should include any case reference numbers on the notice of seizure or seizure information notice that will help identify the goods and make sure your restoration request is directed to the correct place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Time limit for requesting restoration</h3>

<p>There is no time limit in law although <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force usually expects to receive a request for restoration of a seized thing within one calendar month of the date of seizure or the date on the Notice of Seizure. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#paragraph-46">paragraph 4.6</a> below about when <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and Border Force dispose of seized things. For the return of personal property see <a class="govuk-link" href="#paragraph-23">paragraph 2.3</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> When seized things are disposed of</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and Border Force will dispose of perishable goods (including tobacco, beer and all food products) as quickly as possible. They usually begin disposing of non-perishable things (such as vehicles and spirits) 45 days after the date of seizure unless the legality of the seizure is challenged or they receive a restoration request. In those cases they usually keep the goods until the challenge or restoration is decided.</p>

<p>We will normally dispose of vehicles if storage costs are likely to exceed the value of the vehicle and where a restoration request has been considered and refused, whether or not you have asked for a review (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#paragraph-48">paragraph 4.8</a>).</p>

<p>If the seized thing has been destroyed, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force cannot restore it to you but they will usually offer you an appropriate payment instead. This may be an amount equal to the sum paid by you for the goods in question or an amount equal to the proceeds of sale (where <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force have sold the goods in question) or an amount equal to the market value of the goods at the time of seizure and not including any additional compensation (for costs, travel expenses, interest).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span> What happens when <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force receives a restoration request</h3>

<p>When <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force receives a request for restoration, they consider all the facts and decide either to offer or refuse restoration.</p>

<p>If they offer to restore a seized thing, it will normally be on payment of a fee, which will vary depending on the specific circumstances. They may also ask you to pay any duty or VAT due. If you accept the offer and comply with any conditions related to it, the seized thing can be returned to you.</p>

<p>If you accept the restoration offer and take back possession of the seized thing but you are unhappy with the fee you paid, you can ask for a review of the restoration decision (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#paragraph-48">paragraph 4.8</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> What to do if <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force refuses restoration or you disagree with the restoration conditions</h3>

<p>If you do not agree with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s or Border Force’s restoration decision, you can ask for it to be reviewed by an officer not previously involved in the matter (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#paragraph-49">paragraph 4.9</a>). The letter giving you the restoration decision will tell you how to ask for a review. If you ask for a review, you should clearly set out the reasons why you disagree with the decision and include any supporting evidence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> What happens when a restoration decision is reviewed</h3>

<p>An impartial review officer, who was not involved in the decision on the restoration of the seized thing, will consider your case and go over all documents relating to it. The review officer may contact you to explain or to ask for more information.</p>

<p>The review officer can confirm, vary or cancel the original decision. If the decision to be reviewed involves a restoration fee, the review officer may increase or decrease the fee or vary the decision to non-restoration or cancel the original decision. They will write to you to tell you the outcome of the review, and what to do if you disagree with it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.10 </span> Time limits for restoration reviews</h3>

<p>Your letter asking for a review must be received by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force within 45 days of the date of the restoration decision letter, whether it is a request for a review of the decision to refuse restoration or of the restoration conditions, such as the decision to charge a fee.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force then have up to 45 days from the date they receive your letter to carry out a review and tell you the outcome.</p>

<p>If you ask for a review after the 45-day time limit has expired, it will not be accepted unless you can give a reasonable excuse. So if your review request is outside the time limit, you should explain why it is late when making your request. If appropriate, you should include proof of postage.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force does not agree that the reasons why your review request was late amount to a ‘reasonable excuse’, you can appeal to an independent tribunal against their refusal (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#paragraph-412">paragraph 4.12</a>). You must make that appeal within 30 days of the date of the refusal letter.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.11 </span> If you disagree with the outcome of the review</h3>

<p>If you disagree with the review officer’s decision you have the right to appeal to a tribunal within 30 days of the review conclusion. The tribunal is independent of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and Border Force. You should send your appeal against the review officer’s decision to the HM Courts and Tribunals Service and not to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force. You must include a copy of the original restoration decision by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force and a copy of the review officer’s letter telling you of the outcome of their review.</p>

<p>You can find more information about the tribunals service, including how to appeal to the tribunal, details of procedures leading up to a tribunal hearing, what happens at the hearing and how costs are treated, by visiting <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/tax-tribunal">appeal to the tax tribunal</a> or by contacting them on Telephone: 03000 123 1024 between 8.30am and 5pm.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.12 </span> You cannot appeal to the tribunal without having a review</h3>

<p>If you do not agree with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s or Border Force’s restoration decision you must first ask them to review their original decision. You can only appeal to the tribunal about decisions involving restoration when the review has been completed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.13 </span> You can have a restoration decision reviewed when you are challenging the seizure</h3>

<p>You can send a notice of claim challenging the legality of the seizure to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section3">section 3</a>) and still ask for restoration of seized things. You can then ask for a review of the restoration decision before condemnation proceedings take place in court. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the review of the restoration decision, you may then appeal to the tribunal.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> or Border Force usually asks for a tribunal hearing to be postponed until condemnation proceedings have taken place. This is because challenging the legality of a seizure and reviewing a restoration decision are 2 separate things that cannot be dealt with at the same hearing. In particular, if you challenge the legality of a seizure and are successful, it may mean a tribunal hearing to decide restoration is no longer necessary.</p>

<p>The legality of a seizure is decided by the magistrates’ court at condemnation proceedings. An appeal against <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s or Border Force’s decision about restoration is decided at a tribunal hearing. The tribunal has no authority to decide whether a seizure is lawful so that part is usually dealt with first by the magistrates’ court.</p>

<p>This does not infringe your human rights because you have clear ways to challenge the legality of the seizure and to ask for restoration. It is just that they are separate procedures that must be dealt with in different places.</p>
