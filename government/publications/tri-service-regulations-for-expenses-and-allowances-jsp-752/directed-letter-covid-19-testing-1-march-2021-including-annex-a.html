<p><strong>Directed Letter - <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Testing - version 3</strong></p>

<p>In parallel with ongoing announcements on <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> testing , am directed to inform you of the following interim arrangements for reimbursement for <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> testing requirements. This Directed Letter replaces version 1, dated 10 December 2020 and version 2 dated 12 January 2021.</p>

<p>Service personnel (<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr>) and their immediate families may be eligible to claim costs associated with <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> tests in the following circumstances:  the mandatory requirement to carry out a <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test prior to and on arrival in the UK; the Test to Release scheme; or those that for exceptional reasons, due to a Service requirement, have had to pay for testing.</p>

<p>The definition of ‘immediate families’ <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup> can be found at the reference but, for ease, has also been included in the annex. These arrangements are to be applied with an effective date of 1 December 2020 and will remain in place until reviewed or rescinded by <abbr title="Chief of Defence personnel">CDP</abbr> AF Rem Allowances.</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> are to ensure that they are aware of their necessary testing and quarantine arrangements and should refer to Defence Advice Note 18 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> ahead of travel.</strong></p>

<h3>
<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> returning to the UK – Mandatory Pre-Departure <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Testing</h3>

<p>Since 14 January 2021, passengers arriving from all international destinations have been required to present a negative <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test result before departing for the UK to help protect against new strains of coronavirus circulating internationally.</p>

<p><abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> and any immediate family who are required to travel to the UK on duty <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> can reclaim the costs of one private <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test per duty journey at the overseas location. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> must demonstrate to the chain of command that they were unable to arrange for a test through Service sources <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> or a free testing facility provided by the host nation. Defence will not reimburse testing costs for <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> returning to the UK on leave, unless the trip took place between 1 December 2020 and 31 January 2021, in accordance with version 1 of this Directed Letter <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Method of claim</h3>

<p>Costs are to be reclaimed via JPA using ‘Miscellaneous’ expense type then selecting ‘Medical, Dental, Opticians and Prescription fees’ from the dropdown menu. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> should record “Return to UK <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Test <abbr title="Defence Advice Note">DAN 18</abbr>” in the justification box.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> returning to the UK – Mandatory <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Testing on Arrival</h3>

<p>In addition to pre-departure testing requirements, from 15 February 2021, all passengers travelling to the UK are expected to take mandated <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> tests on day 2 and day 8 of quarantine. Passengers from some locations (Red List) are subject to Managed Quarantine and must purchase a quarantine package through a dedicated online portal that includes accommodation, food and a day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>. In England, those travelling from Amber List countries (for example, not on the Travel Corridor list or the Red List), are required to self-isolate at the location they specifiy on their Passenger Locator Form and abide by the same stringent testing regime. In both cases PCR tests must be booked from a list of Government approved test providers. Defence Advice Note (<abbr title="Defence Advice Note">DAN 18</abbr>) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> provides full details and lists all exemptions.</p>

<p>The situation remains fluid and the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Response and Recovery Team are working with TLBs to find an enduring Defence solution for affected <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> and their immediate family members. However, in the meantime, if <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> and/or their immediate family members have to return to the UK for duty reasons <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> and are required to pay for <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> tests, they will be eligible to claim back the costs of these tests.</p>

<h3>Method of Claim</h3>

<p><abbr title="Defence Advice Note">DAN 18</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup> recommends that extant J1/travel booking cell functions complete this action and process any necessary payments alongside organising other elements of travel. If these arrangements are not suitable, the costs incurred from ordering the day 2 and day 8 tests not as part of the Red List package can be claimed via JPA using ‘Miscellaneous’ expense type then selecting ‘Medical, Dental, Opticians and Prescription fees’ from the dropdown menu. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> should record “Return to UK <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Test <abbr title="Defence Advice Note">DAN 18</abbr> test on UK arrival” in the justification box.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> returning to the UK – Test to Release</h3>

<p>The Test to Release Scheme continues to be in operation for those arriving from certain countries and offers individuals an opportunity to reduce the self-isolation period on arrival in England. However, arrivals will still be required to purchase the 2-test package. If either the day 2 or day 8 test come back positive individuals will have to quarantine for a further 10 days from that point. If a positive test is received from the day 2 test, a day 8 test is not required. Further details can be found in <abbr title="Defence Advice Note">DAN 18</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> must ensure that they have read the most up to date guidance on the Test to Release scheme.</p>

<h3>Method of claim</h3>
<p>Costs are to be reclaimed via JPA using ‘Miscellaneous’ expense type then selecting ‘Medical, Dental, Opticians and Prescription fees’ from the dropdown menu <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> should record “<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Test &amp; Release <abbr title="Defence Advice Note">DAN 18</abbr>” in the justification box. Should the need to isolate be removed, Defence will no longer cover the costs of testing.</p>

<h3>Service requirement to conduct <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> testing at cost</h3>

<p>There have been a small number of occasions whereby <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> have been unable for Service reasons to arrange for a test through Service sources <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 10]</a></sup> or a free testing facility provided by the host nation, and have been required to pay for <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> tests.</p>

<p>Approval for reimbursement of <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> tests in this instance should be given on a case-by-case basis. TLBs are to satisfy themselves of the host-nation testing requirements <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11">[footnote 11]</a></sup> and the Service need for such a test to take place. If approval is granted, costs are to be reclaimed via JPA using ‘Miscellaneous’ expense type then selecting ‘Medical, Dental, Opticians and Prescription fees’ from the dropdown menu. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> should record “TLB approved <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test” in the justification box.</p>

<p>The terms of this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> will remain in place until replaced or rescined by <abbr title="Armed Forces Renumeration">AF REM</abbr>. Single Service enquiries on the contents of this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> should be directed initially to Unit HR staffs who, if necessary, should seek further guidance from the JPAC Enquiry Centre or their single Service allowance policy staff.
