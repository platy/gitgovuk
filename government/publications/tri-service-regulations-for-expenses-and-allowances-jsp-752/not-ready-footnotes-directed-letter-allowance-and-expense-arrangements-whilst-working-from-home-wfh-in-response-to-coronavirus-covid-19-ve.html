<p><strong>Dated: 2 November 2020</strong></p>

<p>I am directed to inform you of the following clarification for those in receipt of allowances or expenses whilst working from home (<abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr>) in response to Coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>). This letter supercedes the previous directed letter (<abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr>) dated 27 March 2020 and is an updated version which consists of changes. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> advice on staying at home (isolation) can be found in <a rel="external" href="https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/defnet/HOCS/Documents/2020810-DAN05_COVID19_Household%20Isolation.pdf" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Defence Advice Note 5</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> guidance on the recording of absences including how to record <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> are contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://defenceintranet.diif.r.mil.uk/Organisations/Orgs/HOCS/Organisations/Orgs/DBS/MilitaryPersonnel/JPAPortal/Library/Bulletins/Pages/2006-002.aspx" rel="external"><abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr> Operational Bulletin 2006-002</a>.</p>

<p>It is recognised that as the pandemic has evolved, so too have the working patterns of many. The advice contained in the initial <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> was based on the initial direction that resulted in the vast majority of <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> being directed to work exclusively from home. Further effort is currently being undertaken to address future working arrangements, remote working <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and the impact that these will have on allowance policy. However, at this moment, policy remains largely unchanged with exceptions being announced in the form of DLs to recognise the unique circumstances that <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> face during the pandemic.</p>

<p><abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> could have an impact on an individual’s eligibility to claim or continue to claim some allowances. Allowances are designed for a specific purpose or aim and where eligibility exists, it does so within carefully defined circumstances. If the circumstances change so that those aims are no longer met, entitlement should be reviewed. It is difficult to provide definitive guidance to address every scenario. The circumstances of each individual will vary and need to be considered on their own merit to ensure that appropriate provision is delivered.</p>

<p><abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> have a responsibility to notify Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> of any changes to their personal circumstances that could impact eligibility <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> and are advised to seek advice from Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> on the potential implications of <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr>. They should also check JSP 752 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 4]</a></sup> to ensure that they understand the eligibility criteria and conditions of the allowances that they claim (or wish to claim). Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> should be able to clarify (with the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr>’s Chain of Command) whether the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is required to return to the workplace or has chosen to. If there is any doubt or the policy does not appear to cover the specific circumstances, advice should be sought (<abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> from Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr>; Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> from single Service Pay Cols teams).</p>

<p>JSP 752 already provides guidance on when allowances should start, continue and cease, which varies by allowance. Although the Allowances Absence Matrix (Chap 2, Sect 3) shows the impact of various types of absence on allowances; it does not include the impact for those <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr>.</p>

<p>Allowances that compensate <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> for activities or tasks undertaken or environmental conditions endured (such as <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr>), will be earned only on the days when <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> experience the conditions intended to be compensated. However, under the same principle, <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> will receive location allowances (such as <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr>) for every day they are in the location (as they continue to bear the burden of living in that location whether at home or at workplace). Allowances that reimburse costs arising from duty expenses will continue provided the costs legitimately arise from duty, such as motor mileage for duty travel. Allowances that contribute towards additional costs incurred (such as Get You Home (Travel)) will continue <em>providing the underlying eligibility and entitlement rules still apply</em>. Personnel should interpret the regulations reasonably and intelligently taking into account the aim of the allowance, the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr>’s specific circumstances and the interests of Defence <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 6]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> provides additional guidance to the <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr> (noting that it is for the <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr> to determine <em>where</em> the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr>). It also clarifies entitlement in other areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Food and Incidental Allowance (<abbr title="Food and Incidentals Allowance">FIA</abbr>) – Chap 5 Sect 5</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is ordered or elects to work from home in the accommodation which gives <abbr title="Food and Incidentals Allowance">FIA</abbr> entitlement (for example <abbr title="Substitute Single Service Accommodation">SSSA</abbr>) then <abbr title="Food and Incidentals Allowance">FIA</abbr> remains in issue. However, if the <abbr title="Food and Incidentals Allowance">FIA</abbr> claimant is ordered to or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> from their own home or permanent residence then <abbr title="Food and Incidentals Allowance">FIA</abbr> entitlement ceases from the 11th day in accordance with para 05.0506 and 05.0505d. If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is <em>required</em> to return to their place of work then <abbr title="Food and Incidentals Allowance">FIA</abbr> will restart from the 1st day that the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> returns to the accommodation which gives the entitlement to <abbr title="Food and Incidentals Allowance">FIA</abbr> and existing policy applies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Longer Separation Allowance – Chap 10 Sect 1</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> (either <abbr title="Involuntary Separation">INVOLSEP</abbr> or <abbr title="Voluntary Separation">VOLSEP</abbr>) is ordered to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> from the location that gave entitlement to <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr>, then <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> remains in issue. However, as <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> is ordinarily paid to recognise the disadvantage of separation caused when return to the duty station, family home or permanent residence is precluded, if an existing <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> claimant is sent to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> from one of those locations, <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> ceases from the day <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> commences. <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> (either <abbr title="Involuntary Separation">INVOLSEP</abbr> or <abbr title="Voluntary Separation">VOLSEP</abbr>) will start from the 1st day that the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> returns to the location from which <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> was originally granted.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Special Messing Allowance – Chap 5 Sect 6</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> in the accommodation which gives <abbr title="Special Messing Allowance">SMA</abbr> entitlement (para 05.0604) then <abbr title="Special Messing Allowance">SMA</abbr> remains in issue. However, if the <abbr title="Special Messing Allowance">SMA</abbr> claimant is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> in their family home, permanent residence or a location where British Service messing facilities are available, then <abbr title="Special Messing Allowance">SMA</abbr> entitlement ceases from the 1st day in accordance with para 05.0605. If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is required to return to their place of work then <abbr title="Special Messing Allowance">SMA</abbr> will restart from the 1st day that the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> returns to the accommodation which gives the entitlement to <abbr title="Special Messing Allowance">SMA</abbr> and existing policy applies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Home to Duty Travel (Automatic) – Chap 7 Sect 3</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> until such time as they are required to return to their place of duty, then automatic <abbr title="Home to Duty Travel">HDT</abbr> is to cease from the date <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> commences in accordance with para 07.0310a. <abbr title="Home to Duty Travel">HDT</abbr> (Automatic) will restart from the 1st day that the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> ceases to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> and permanently restarts travelling to work daily. If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> travels to work during the <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> period, then manual claims are to be submitted in accordance with 07.0326a.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get You Home Travel – Chap 7 Sect 4</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> from their current duty station and is in receipt of <abbr title="Get You Home">GYH</abbr> to a Qualifying Residence (<abbr title="Qualifying Residence">QRes</abbr>) then <abbr title="Get You Home">GYH</abbr> remains in issue as long as the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> carries out such travel. However, if an existing <abbr title="Get You Home">GYH</abbr> claimant is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> from their <abbr title="Qualifying Residence">QRes</abbr> for which they receive <abbr title="Get You Home">GYH</abbr>, then <abbr title="Get You Home">GYH</abbr> ceases from the date when <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> commences. If the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is required to return to their place of work, <abbr title="Get You Home">GYH</abbr> will restart from the 1st day that the accommodation (which gives the entitlement to <abbr title="Get You Home">GYH</abbr>) is reoccupied and existing policy applies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reimbursement of Telephone Fees and Postal Fees – Chap 17 Sect 1</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> and makes official telephone calls then, actual receipted admissible costs may be reclaimed via <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr>. Telephone bills must be retained and annotated to <em>highlight</em> additional charges and the reason why services such as BT Meet Me and Skype could not be used. If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> incurs additional data costs through their personal broadband package whilst <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr>, <em>exceptional authority</em> is granted for actual receipted admissible costs to be reclaimed via <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recruitment and Retention Allowance (London) (<abbr title="Recruitment and Retention Allowance (London)">RRA(L)</abbr> - Chap 8 Sect 5</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> in their <abbr title="Residence at Work Address">RWA</abbr> then <abbr title="Recruitment and Retention Allowance (London)">RRA(L)</abbr> remains in issue. However, if the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> in their own home or permanent residence which is not their <abbr title="Residence at Work Address">RWA</abbr> then <abbr title="Recruitment and Retention Allowance (London)">RRA(L)</abbr> entitlement ceases from the 11th day. If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is required to return to their place of work then <abbr title="Recruitment and Retention Allowance (London)">RRA(L)</abbr> will restart from the 1st day that the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> returns to the accommodation which gives the entitlement to <abbr title="Recruitment and Retention Allowance (London)">RRA(L)</abbr> and existing policy applies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lodging Allowance (<abbr title="Lodging Allowance">LA</abbr>) - Chap 5 Sect 3</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> in the accommodation which gives <abbr title="Lodging Allowance">LA</abbr> entitlement (in accordance with para 05.0307) then <abbr title="Lodging Allowance">LA</abbr> remains in issue. However, if the <abbr title="Lodging Allowance">LA</abbr> claimant is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> from their family home or permanent residence then <abbr title="Lodging Allowance">LA</abbr> will remain in issue for 61 days. However, the <abbr title="Commanding Officer">CO</abbr> can grant exceptional authority to extend the 61-day limit in accordance with para 05.0318.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Northern Ireland Resident’s Supplement (<abbr title="Northern Ireland Resident's Supplement">NIRS</abbr>) - Chap 8 Sect 3</li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is ordered or elects to <abbr title="working from home">WFH</abbr> and remains in Northern Ireland, then <abbr title="Northern Ireland Resident's Supplement">NIRS</abbr> remains in issue. <abbr title="Northern Ireland Resident's Supplement">NIRS</abbr> will only cease for a unacc/single <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> in accordance with para 08.0307b, and will only cease for a married acc <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> in accordance with para 08.0308.</p>

<p>The terms of this Directed Letter will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by <abbr title="Armed Forces Remuneration">AF Rem</abbr> Allowances.</p>
