<p><strong>12 January 2021</strong></p>

<p>In parallel with a recent announcement on COVID-19 testing<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, am directed to inform you of the following interim arrangements for reimbursement for COVID-19
testing requirements. This Directed Letter replaces version 1, released on 10 December
2020. Amendments are written in blue. Service personnel (<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr>) and their immediate
families may be eligible to reimburse costs associated with COVID-19 tests in the
following circumstances: the mandatory requirement to to carry out a COVID-19 test
prior to returning to the UK; the Test to Release scheme; or those that for exceptional
reasons, due to a Service requirement, have had to pay for testing. The definition of
‘immediate families’ <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3">[footnote 3]</a></sup> can be found at the reference but, for ease, has also been
included in the annex. These arrangements are to be applied with an effective date of 1
December 2020 and will remain in place until 30 April 2021 or until rescinded. In some
cases, the eligibility period for previous exceptional authority described in v1 of this
Directed Letter has been reduced in response to the latest government restrictions.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> returning to the UK – Mandatory COVID-19 Testing</h2>

<p>With effect from 14 January 2021, passengers arriving from all international
destinations will be required to present a negative COVID-19 test result before
departing for England<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link">[footnote 4]</a></sup> to help protect against new strains of coronavirus circulating
internationally. This is in addition to the mandatory 10 day self-isolation for arrivals.</p>

<p><abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> and their immediate family who are assigned overseas and are required to
travel to the UK on duty <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5">[footnote 5]</a></sup> can reclaim the costs of one private COVID-19 test per duty
journey. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> must demonstrate to the chain of command that they were unable to
arrange for a test through Service sources <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link">[footnote 6]</a></sup> or a free testing facility provided by the host nation.</p>

<p>Method of claim. If approval is granted, costs are to be reclaimed via JPA using
‘Miscellaneous’ expense type then selecting ‘Medical, Dental, Opticians and Prescription fees’ from the dropdown menu. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> should record “Return to UK COVID-19 Test DAN 18” in the justification box.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> returning to the UK – Test to Release</h2>

<p>The Test to Release Scheme offers individuals an opportunity to reduce the selfisolation period on arrival in the UK. Travellers arriving from a destination not on the
Travel Corridor list can pay for a private COVID-19 test after 5 full days of self-isolation.
Further details can be found in Defence Advice Note (DAN) 18<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> Assigned Overseas</h3>

<p><abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> and their immediate family who are assigned
overseas and are required to travel to the UK on duty<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7">[footnote 7]</a></sup>, and required to isolate on arrival, can reclaim the costs of one private COVID-19 test per duty journey. This exceptional authority is effective between 1 December 2020 and 30 April 2021. Defence will not reimburse testing costs for <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> returning to the UK on leave, unless the trip took place between 1 December 2020 and 31 January 2021.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> returning from temporary duty overseas</h3>

<p><abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> who are assigned within the
UK who, for duty reasons, are required to temporarily travel overseas and on their
return to the UK are required to isolate on arrival, can reclaim the costs of one private
COVID-19 test per duty journey. This exceptional authority is effective between 1
December 2020 and when the policy is reviewed on 30 April 2021. Defence will not
cover test &amp; release costs for UK-based <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> who go overseas on holiday.</p>

<h3>Non-British passport holding <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Non-British passport holding <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr>, and
immediate families that permanently reside with them in the UK, that travel on leave to
their country of origin between 1 December 2020 and 31 January 2021<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="govuk-link">[footnote 8]</a></sup>, can reclaim
the cost of one private COVID-19 test per person on their return to the UK.</p>

<h3>Method of claim</h3>

<p>Costs are to be reclaimed via JPA using ‘Miscellaneous’
expense type then selecting ‘Medical, Dental, Opticians and Prescription fees’ from the
dropdown menu<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="govuk-link">[footnote 9]</a></sup>. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> should record “COVID-19 Test &amp; Release DAN 18” in the
justification box. Should the need to isolate be removed, Defence will no longer cover
the costs of testing.</p>

<h2>Service requirement to conduct COVID-19 testing at cost</h2>

<p>There have been a small number of occasions whereby <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> have been unable for
Service reasons to arrange for a test through Service sources<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10">[footnote 10]</a></sup> or a free testing facility provided by the host nation, and have been required to pay for COVID-19 tests.</p>

<p>Approval for reimbursements of COVID-19 tests in this instance should be given
on a case-by-case basis. TLBs are to satisfy themselves of the host-nation testing
requirements<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="govuk-link">[footnote 11]</a></sup> and the Service need for such a test to take place. If approval is granted, costs are to be reclaimed via JPA using ‘Miscellaneous’ expense type then selecting ‘Medical, Dental, Opticians and Prescription fees’ from the dropdown menu. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> should record “TLB approved COVID-19 test” in the justification box.</p>

<p>The terms of this Directed Letter will remain in place until rescinded or replaced
by AF Rem Allowances.</p>
