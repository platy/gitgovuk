<p>The UK will reach the end of the EU-exit transition period at 11pm on 31 December 2020. Although there are a number of uncertainties as to how this will affect Service Personnel (<abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>), one issue that has been identified is the increased likelihood that <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> relocating to and from overseas countries may experience a delay in reuniting
with their personal effects. This is due to changes in customs arrangements.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The following applies only to <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> assigned to and from countries that qualify for moves under the Furniture Movement Service (FMS) scheme[^1] and who are moving into unfurnished accommodation.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> relocating overseas on assigment</h3>

<p>As per existing policy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, where <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> unavoidably incur hotel expenses for themselves and their accompanying immediate family<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3">[footnote 3]</a></sup> on arrival at an overseas permanent assignment station<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup>, subsistence may be claimed for a period of up to 14 nights on arrival. The local CO, (or delegated officer), now has the exceptional
authority to extend this period up to a maximum of 56 nights<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. This is subject to a review every 7 days to confirm that the continued occupation of hotel accommodation is unavoidable (due to the the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>’s personal effects being delayed in transit). Eligibility will cease once the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> has been reunited with their personal effects and has moved into their accommodation.</p>

<p>Occupation of hotel accommodation beyond 56 nights requires authority from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6">[footnote 6]</a></sup>. As per existing policy, the application should give the reason for continued occupation of hotel accommodation and details of the family and anticipated costs involved.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> returning to the UK from overseas assignment</h3>

<p>There may be occasions whereby <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> and their families arrive back to the UK ahead of their personal effects. If the accommodation that the Service family is moving into is uninhabitable due to their personal effects being in transit, then the following courses of action are to be considered by the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>. It is expected that the lowest cost
option will be utilised. However, it is recognised that familial circumstances will vary and not every option will be practicable for every family. <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> should discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate and cost effective course of action.</p>

<h4>Service Families Accommodation (SFA) or Services Cotswold Centre (SCC)</h4>

<p>Service families may be offered temporary furnished SFA, if available, or may apply to be temporarily accommodated at the SCC at Corsham, (collectively referred to as service accommodation). Families wishing to occupy Service accommodation may apply for it via their chain of command responsible for welfare support as detailed in <a rel="external" href="https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/defnet/Corp/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B23233489-9B80-4244-B8EA-C77D6E5C5BC9%7D&amp;file=2019DIN01-141.docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true&amp;DefaultItemOpen=1&amp;cid=7bb91209-b312-44a0-9b30-e61d84609201" class="govuk-link">DIN2019 DIN01-141</a>. The provision of Service accommodation should be handled on a case by case basis taking into account the specific needs of each family. As Service accommodation will have self-catering facilities, no subsistence allowance is payable</p>

<h3>Serviced Apartments and Hotel Accommodation</h3>

<p>If Service accommodation is not available or practicable, the family may stay in a serviced apartment for the duration of the period that they are without their personal effects, within 50 miles of the declared address where their personal effects will be delivered. The serviced apartment must be booked by E-Mailing a completed form (see attachment to this DL) to Global Business Travel (GBT)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. Costs will be met by MOD and the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> will not be required to pay and claim. Since the serviced apartments have selfcatering facilities, no subsistence allowance is payable.</p>

<p>If there are no serviced apartments available within 50 miles of the declared address where their personal effects will be delivered, hotel accommodation may be substituted by GBT. In addition, actual subsistence costs may be claimed up to £25 for each day, for each member of the immediate family<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="govuk-link">[footnote 8]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is from the date on which they returned to the UK (up to 56 days (see para 9)), or until they are reunited with their personal effects at their new accommodation; whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>The continued occupation of serviced apartments or hotels will be subject to a review every 7 days to confirm that it remains unavoidable (due to the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>’s personal effects being delayed in transit). Eligibility will cease once the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> has been reunited with their personal effects and has moved into their accommodation. Occupation of serviced
apartments or hotel accommodation beyond 56 nights requires authority from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.</p>

<h4>Privately Arranged rate</h4>

<p>PAR allows <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> to make private arrangements for them and/or their family to stay with relatives or friends, when Service accommodation is not available. This is exceptionally extended to cover families whose personal effects are delayed in transit.</p>

<p>The daily rate of PAR is designed to cover a 24-hour period and contribute towards all expenses incurred during that period. Only one PAR claim is permissible per night, irrespective of the number of family members. Where <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> are in receipt of PAR, Day and Night Subsistence cannot be claimed. PAR may remain in issue for up to 56 days
(subject to a review every 7 days , see para 11) or until they are reunited with their personal effects at their new accommodation; whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>Eligibility to PAR will be subject to a review every 7 days to confirm that it remains unavoidable (due to the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr>’s personal effects being delayed in transit). Eligibility will cease once the <abbr title="Service personnel">SP</abbr> has been reunited with their personal effects and has moved into their accommodation. Eligibility to PAR beyond 56 nights requires authority
from DBS MIL PERS-MIL OPS PACCC.</p>

<p>The terms of this Directed Letter will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by AF Remuneration Allowances.</p>
