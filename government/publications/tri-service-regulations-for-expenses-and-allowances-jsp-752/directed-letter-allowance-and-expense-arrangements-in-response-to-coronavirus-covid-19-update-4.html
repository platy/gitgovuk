<p><strong>Dated: 24 March 2021</strong></p>

<p>I am directed to inform you of the following clarification for those in receipt of allowances or expenses in response to Coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>). These arrangements are effective immediately and will remain in place until further notice by Rem Allowances. This is an update to the previous DLs issued on 31 March, 21 July and 2 November 2020. Updated information has been added in below.</p>

<p>The individual circumstance of each <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> who is hospitalised, on sick leave or self-isolating must be considered on its own merit and assessed to ensure that appropriate provision is being delivered <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Units should interpret the regulations in JSP 752 reasonably and intelligently, taking into account the aim of each allowance <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>JSP 752 already provides guidance on when allowances should start, continue and cease, which varies by allowance. The Allowances Absence Matrix (Chap 2, Sect 3) shows the impact of various types of absence on allowances ‘at a glance’. This includes hospital in-patient and sick leave. For some allowances (for example, <abbr title="Home to Duty Travel">HDT</abbr>, <abbr title="Get You Home">GYH</abbr>, <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr>) the matrix guides Units to conduct a manual review and, in such cases, the relevant Chap/Sect in JSP 752 provides further detail, including any specific criteria/caveats <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. The latter should also be used to guide entitlement if <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> are temporarily working from home, as some allowances cease after a period of time <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There are some situations (for example, self-isolating/sick leave on unit/in <abbr title="Substitute Service Single Accommodation">SSSA</abbr>) that the regulations may not adequately cover under the current circumstances. This <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> provides additional guidance and, in some cases, flexibility to the <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr> (noting that it is for the <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr> to determine where the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> takes sick leave and/or self-isolates). It also clarifies entitlement in other areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Food and Incidental Allowance – Chap 5 Sect 5</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is hospitalised or sent on sick leave then the absence matrix and Chap 5, Sect 5, clarify entitlement. However, if the <abbr title="Food and Incidental Allowance">FIA</abbr> claimant is sent on sick leave or self-isolates in the accommodation which gives <abbr title="Food and Incidental Allowance">FIA</abbr> entitlement (for example, <abbr title="Substitute Service Single Accommodation">SSSA</abbr>), <abbr title="Food and Incidental Allowance">FIA</abbr> is authorised to remain in issue, but is to be reviewed by the <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr> every 14 days.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Longer Separation Allowance – Chap 10 Sect 1</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> (either <abbr title="Involuntary Separated">INVOLSEP</abbr> or <abbr title="Voluntary Separated">VOLSEP</abbr>) is hospitalised or sent on sick leave then the absence matrix and Chap 10, Sect 1 clarify entitlement. However:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><abbr title="Voluntary Separated">VOLSEP</abbr> (10.0117 to 10.0122).</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If an existing <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> recipient is on sick leave or self-isolates in their accommodation at the location for which <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> L1 was granted (for example, at the parent unit on a permanent voluntarily Unaccompanied assignment in a different Th to the UK family home) and is unable to return to their family home, exceptional authority is granted for <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> L1 to remain in issue, but is to be reviewed by the <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr> every 14 days.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><abbr title="Involuntary Separated">INVOLSEP</abbr> (10.0108 to 10.0112).</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If an existing <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> recipient is on sick leave or self-isolates in their accommodation at the location for which <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> on <abbr title="Involuntary Separated">INVOLSEP</abbr> terms was granted (for example, temporary duty location), is not joined by their immediate family and is unable to return to their permanent duty station, family home or permanent residence, <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr> is exceptionally authorised to remain in issue, but is to be reviewed by the <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr> every 14 days.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Get You Home (Overseas) – Chap 9 Sect 11</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> or immediate family have booked travel that is subsequently cancelled by either the airline or by country travel restrictions then the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is to reclaim costs via the airline, travel agent or their own travel insurance <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> are not to reclaim via <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr>. If the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> has already reclaimed costs in accordance with para 09.1127 (flight ticket values over £1000) then recovery action is to be taken by Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr>. For travel that is cancelled for unforeseen or unavoidable Service reasons, the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> may be entitled to reclaim costs via Refund of Nugatory Holiday Expenditure (Chap 17 Sect 6). The <abbr title="Commanding Officer">CO</abbr> can exceptionally authorise the carry forward of unused <abbr title="Get You Home (Overseas)">GYH (O)</abbr> journeys in accordance with para 09.1117.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Refund of Nugatory Holiday Expenditure – Chap 17 Sect 6</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> or immediate family have booked travel which is subsequently cancelled by either the airline or by country travel restrictions then the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is to reclaim costs via the airline, travel agent or their own travel insurance. <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> are not to reclaim via <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr>. For travel that is cancelled for unforeseen or unavoidable Service reasons, the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> may be entitled to reclaim costs in accordance with this chapter. Each case will be considered on its own merits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Special Messing Allowance – Chap 5 Sect 6</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is hospitalised or sent on sick leave then the absence matrix and Chap 5, Sect 6 clarify entitlement. However, if the <abbr title="Special Messing Allowance">SMA</abbr> claimant is sent on sick leave or self isolates in the accommodation which gives <abbr title="Special Messing Allowance">SMA</abbr> entitlement, <abbr title="Special Messing Allowance">SMA</abbr> is exceptionally authorised to remain in issue, but is to be reviewed by the <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr> every 14 days.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Subsistence Entitlements on Assignment – Chap 5 Sect 1</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If, due to travel restrictions, the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> and/or immediate family are unable to travel on assignment and no appropriate public accommodation is available (for example, Cotswold Centre, welfare accommodation, <abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr> or <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>), then <abbr title="Night Subsistence / Day Subsistence">NS/DS</abbr> or <abbr title="Private Arrangement Rate">PAR</abbr> is exceptionally authorised, but is to be reviewed by the <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr> every 14 days.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Duty Travel: Subsistence Entitlements in Quarantine – Chap 5 Sect 1</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From 15 February 2021, passengers from some locations (Red List) are subject to Managed Quarantine and must purchase a quarantine package through a dedicated online portal that includes accommodation, food and a day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test. Defence Advice Note (<abbr title="Defence Advice Note">DAN</abbr>)18 provides full details and lists all exemptions. <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> and immediate families travelling for duty reasons <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link">[footnote 6]</a></sup> and required to enter Managed Quarantine on arrival in the UK may, subject to Budget Holder approval, claim the costs of the quarantine package. As per <abbr title="Defence Advice Note">DAN</abbr> 18, the package should ideally be booked by Unit Travel Cells alongside other travel arrangements. If this option is not available, <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> may reclaim the costs under Night Subsistence, citing <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> <strong><abbr title="Defence Advice Note">DAN</abbr> 18</strong> Managed Quarantine in the justification box. As the quarantine package includes 3 meals per day, no additional subsistence costs may be claimed.</p>

<p>In England <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:7">[footnote 7]</a></sup>, those travelling from Amber List countries (for example, not on the Travel Corridor list or the Red List), are required to self-isolate at the location they specify on their Passenger Locator Form and abide by the same stringent testing regime. If during the course of duty travel <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> and immediate families are required to spend a period of time in self-isolation or quarantine outside of the family home and no appropriate public accommodation is available (for example, Cotswold Centre, welfare accommodation, <abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr> or <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>) then, with Budget Holder approval, <abbr title="Night Subsistence / Day Subsistence">NS/DS</abbr> or <abbr title="Private Arrangement Rate">PAR</abbr> is exceptionally authorised for the mandated period of self-isolation / quarantine only. Options must be discussed with the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr>’s <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The situation remains fluid and the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Response and Recovery Team are working with TLBs to find an enduring Defence solution for affected <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> and their immediate family members. <abbr title="Defence Advice Note">DAN</abbr> 18 should be read and understood ahead of any travel.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Duty Travel – Chap 6 Sect 7</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="Chain of Command">CoC</abbr> has determined that the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> must self-isolate away from the duty station, a return journey at public expense can be exceptionally authorised.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Movement and Storage of Personal Effects (<abbr title="Movement and Storage of Personal Effects">MSPE</abbr>) - Chap 12 Sect 4</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where an otherwise qualifying move, or a move that has been exceptionally authorised by the <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr> has been delayed due to the impact of <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, entitlement to <abbr title="Movement and Storage of Personal Effects">MSPE</abbr> can exceptionally be approved by the Commanding Officer up to 6 months after the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr>’s revised Report for Duty Date (<abbr title="Report for Duty Date">RDD</abbr>) as confirmed by the Career Manager or the date stated by the <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr> by which the move should have been completed. Additionally, if Commanding Officers have authorised a delayed move for 6 months in accordance with para 12.0412(b) or (d) and the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> can demonstrate that the move into the nominated <abbr title="Residence at Work Address">RWA</abbr> (para 12.0412(b)) or SPR (para 12.0412(d)) has been delayed further due to the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic then the Commanding Officer may grant a delayed move for 9 months after the reporting for duty date.</p>

<p>For medical discharges that meet the criteria in para 12.0417, exceptional authority is granted to these <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> to complete the move of their Personal Effects up to 3 months after their termination date without the need for casework. If the move is further delayed due to the impact of <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, the entitlement can exceptionally be approved by the Commanding Officer for a further 3 months without the need for casework. Should a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> accommodated in <abbr title="Substitute Service Single Accommodation">SSSA</abbr> be required to vacate their accommodation in the expectation that they will be working from home for a minimum of 6 months, then they will be entitled to claim <abbr title="Movement and Storage of Personal Effects">MSPE</abbr> as a Mid-Assignment Move iaw para 12.0413a.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Disturbance Expense (<abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr>) - Chap 12 Sect 1</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where an otherwise qualifying move has been delayed due to the impact of <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, entitlement to <abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr> can exceptionally be approved by the Commanding Officer up to 6 months after the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr>’s revised <abbr title="Report for Duty Date">RDD</abbr> as confirmed by the Career Manager.</p>

<p>Should an unaccompanied <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> who is accommodated in a multi-occupancy room be required to move <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> due to accommodation reorganisation as a result of COVID 19, as ordered by the establishment Commanding Officer following medical advice, they will exceptionally be entitled to the single rate of <abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr>. <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> may only claim <abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr> for one move for this reason, regardless of any required subsequent moves.</p>

<p>Should a <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> accommodated in <abbr title="Substitute Service Single Accommodation">SSSA</abbr> be required to vacate their accommodation in the expectation that they will be working from home for a minimum of 6 months, then they will be entitled to claim <abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr> as a Mid-Assignment Move iaw para 12.0117a. The <abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr> payment will be based upon the type of accommodation that the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> is going to occupy as per para 12.0114. <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> that subsequently return to a private property that they previously lived in or that their family continued to occupy whilst the <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> was accommodated in <abbr title="Substitute Service Single Accommodation">SSSA</abbr> would normally not be eligible to claim <abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr> under para 12.0107b, but will exceptionally be entitled to claim the <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> rate of <abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr>. <abbr title="Service Personnel">SP</abbr> that are required to vacate their <abbr title="Substitute Service Single Accommodation">SSSA</abbr> and move to a private residence for which they do not own or privately rent (for example, they move in with a parent) will exceptionally be entitled to claim the <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> rate of <abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr>.</p>

<p>In addition to these, a number of DLs have been released that give additional authority to claim allowances and expenses in specific conditions <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. These can be found at the <abbr title="Armed Forces">AF</abbr> Rem Allowances DEFNET and GOV.UK sites.</p>

<p>The terms of this Directed Letter will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by <abbr title="Armed Forces">AF</abbr> Rem Allowances. Single Service enquiries on the contents of this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> should be directed initially to Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> staffs who, if necessary, should seek further guidance from the JPAC Enquiry Centre or their single Service allowance policy staff.</p>
