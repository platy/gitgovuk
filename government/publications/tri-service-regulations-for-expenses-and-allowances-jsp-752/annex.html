<h2>Annex to directed letter for November 2020</h2>

<p>The following provisions should be read alongside <strong>JSP 752 Chapter 10 Section 2 – School Children’s Visits</strong>.</p>

<h4>What if flights are not available to/from my overseas assignment area due to <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions but it is possible to make a SCV journey by vehicle and I wish to do so?</h4>

<p>In this scenario, you may travel by car and claim the cost of ferry/Eurotunnel and terminal Motor Mileage Allowance (<abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr>) travel (up to the value of half the current Get You Home (Overseas) rate for the country in which the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> is assigned) in line with the regulations already in place for those assigned to North West Europe (JSP 752 Para 10.0211c refers). For the Christmas holiday period only, claims for each return journey made by the parent may be made up to the value of the full rate of <abbr title="Get You Home (Overseas)">GYH(O)</abbr> for the country in which the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> is assigned (rather than the existing provision for half of the <abbr title="Get You Home (Overseas)">GYH(O)</abbr> rate. In line with regulations (JSP 752 Para 10.0221) Subsistence Allowance is not authorised.</p>

<h4>What if, due to mandatory self-isolation provisions in either the UK or an overseas assignment area or due to a lack of an Unaccompanied Minors (<abbr title="Unaccompanied Minors">UNMIN</abbr>) service, it is not practicable for a child to travel to the overseas area on a SCV at the Christmas 2020 end of term school holiday period and the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> wishes to arrange a reverse SCV instead?</h4>

<p>SCV regulations (JSP 752 para 10.0228) already allow for a reverse visit for one parent for reasons of child welfare. Should a parent consider this to be the preferred option for them during the Christmas 2020 end of term school holiday period, then a reverse SCV may be authorised for both parents and any accompanying members of the immediate family <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup> in lieu of one SCV for each eligible child. This is in addition to the reverse visit already allowed for welfare reasons, which may already have been taken or which may be required later in the academic year.</p>

<h4>If I have to arrange a reverse SCV over the Christmas 2020 school holiday period (for both parents and any accompanying members of the immediate family1) can I claim any subsistence costs?</h4>

<p>Reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visits">SCVs</abbr> do not normally attract payment of subsistence. However, where a reverse SCV is necessary, accommodation arrangements may be authorised for the duration of any mandatory self-isolation period as well as the school holiday period as detailed below. Where this is applicable, it is expected that the lowest cost option will be utilised wherever possible. However it is recognised that personal circumstances will vary and not every option will be available to every family. The Government or devolved administrations’ <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions may also limit options for some families (for example rule of 6 and so on). <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> should therefore discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate course of action. The options for mandatory self-isolation have been listed, alongside the allowable expenses, in order, starting with the most cost-effective (Option 1).</p>

<h5>Parent(s) and child(ren) to use the Service Cotswold Centre or welfare housing</h5>

<p>The availability of this type of accommodation should be checked with the Welfare team by the Chain of Command. There would not be a second accommodation charge incurred to the individual Service person for this accommodation. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys may be claimed: from the point of arrival in the UK to the welfare accommodation; from the welfare accommodation to the school (twice, on pick up and drop off), and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure from the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0122 b(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations. No subsistence allowance is authorised.</p>

<h5>Parent(s) and child(ren) stay with friends or family</h5>

<p>Subsistence at twice the Private Arrangements Rate (<abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr>) (for example 2 x £35 = £70) may be claimed for the any mandatory self-isolation period as well as the duration of the school holiday <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. Only one <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> claim of 2 x £35 is permissible per night, per family and neither Day nor Night subsistence claims are admissible. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent(s) to transport the child(ren) to the home of the friend/family member; to take the child(ren) to the school (conducted by either the parent(s) or the guardian including the return journey), and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If neither of the above options are available or the family’s specific welfare needs as determined by Service welfare authorities dictate, then the parent(s) and child(ren) may stay in a Serviced Apartment (or hotel where no Serviced Apartment is available) for the duration of any mandatory self- isolation period and/or the school holiday period[^3].</p>
</div>

<p>The Serviced Apartment must be booked by emailing a completed form (see attachment to this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr>) to Global Business Travel (<abbr title="Global Business Travel">GBT</abbr>). Costs will be met by <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> will not be required to pay and claim <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. Since the Serviced Apartments have self-catering facilities, no subsistence allowance is payable. (If there are no Serviced Apartments available within reasonable travelling distance of the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr>’s preferred location, hotel accommodation may be substituted and actual subsistence costs (up to £25 per day, for each parent and each child) may be claimed <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup> for any mandatory self- isolation period only). Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the hotel; to take the child(ren) to the school, and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted where they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h4>If I have to arrange a reverse SCV (for one parent) at October 2020 or February 2021 half term or during the school year due to school closure, can I claim any subsistence costs?</h4>

<p>Reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visits">SCVs</abbr> do not normally attract payment of subsistence. However, where a reverse SCV is necessary, and there is a mandatory self-isolation period applied by the UK Government on travellers from the country the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> is assigned to, subsistence allowance may be claimed for the duration of the self-isolation period only as detailed below. Where this is applicable it is expected that the lowest cost option will be utilised wherever possible. However, it is recognised that personal circumstances will vary and not every option will be available to every family. The Government or devolved administrations’ <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions may also limit options for some families (for example rule of 6 and so on). <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> should therefore discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate course of action. The options for mandatory self-isolation have been listed, alongside the allowable expenses, in order, starting with the most cost-effective (Option 1).</p>

<h5>Parent(s) and child(ren) to use the Service Cotswold Centre or welfare housing</h5>

<p>The availability of this type of accommodation should be checked with the Welfare team by the Chain of Command. There would not be a second accommodation charge incurred to the individual Service person for this accommodation. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys may be claimed: from the point of arrival in the UK to the welfare accommodation; from the welfare accommodation to the school (twice, on pick up and drop off), and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure from the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0122 b(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations. No subsistence allowance is authorised.</p>

<h5>Parent(s) and child(ren) stay with friends or family</h5>

<p>Subsistence at the Private Arrangements Rate (<abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr>) may be claimed <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link">[footnote 6]</a></sup> for the mandatory self-isolation period only. Only one <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> claim is permissible per night, per family and neither Day nor Night subsistence claims are admissible. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent(s) to transport the child(ren) to the home of the friend/family member; to take the child(ren) to the school (conducted by either the parent(s) or the guardian including the return journey); and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If neither of the above options are available or the family’s specific welfare needs as determined by Service welfare authorities dictate, then the parent(s) and child(ren) may stay in a Serviced Apartment (or hotel where no Serviced Apartment is available) for the duration of any mandatory self- isolation period and/or the school holiday period.</p>
</div>

<p>The Serviced Apartment must be booked by emailing a completed form (see attachment to this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr>) to Global Business Travel (<abbr title="Global Business Travel">GBT</abbr>). Costs will be met by <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> will not be required to pay and claim <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. Since the Serviced Apartments have self-catering facilities, no subsistence allowance is payable. (If there are no Serviced Apartments available within reasonable travelling distance of the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr>’s preferred location, hotel accommodation may be substituted and actual subsistence costs (up to £25 per day, for each parent and each child) may be claimed5 for any mandatory self- isolation period only). Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the hotel; to take the child(ren) to the school; and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted where they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h4>What if airlines are not currently offering an <abbr title="Unaccompanied Minors">UNMIN</abbr> service and I wish to travel with the child(ren) to/from the overseas assignment country?</h4>

<p>Where a parent must accompany their child(ren) and comply with any mandatory self-isolation requirements on arrival in the UK, JSP 752 published policy applies. However, this will now be extended to cover dependant children <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="govuk-link">[footnote 8]</a></sup> who would normally travel unaccompanied, but may now require a parent to accompany them if they are required to self-isolate in a hotel in the UK prior to commencement of the school term. This includes those attending University if exceptional individual circumstances mean this is essential and is agreed by Chain of Command. The following options for subsistence should be considered, and it is expected that the lowest cost option will be utilised wherever possible. However, it is recognised that personal circumstances will vary and not every option will be available to every family. The Government or devolved administrations’ <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions may also limit options for some families (for example rule of 6 and so on). <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> should therefore discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate course of action. The options have been listed, alongside the allowable expenses, in order starting with the most cost-effective (Option 1).</p>

<p>##### Self-isolation period completed at boarding school for the child(ren) and the parent returns overseas immediately</p>

<p>Any additional costs incurred for the boarding element of school fees for a mandatory self-isolation period prior to the start of term, which are proportionate to regular boarding fees and charged to all parents for self-isolation, will be refunded in full. For claimants of Continuity of Education Allowance (<abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>), additional costs are to be claimed using a manual <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claim form clearly identified as <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Additional Costs. Defence Business Services (<abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr>) will process claims allowing <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> to be reimbursed above normal <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> ceilings. <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants should ensure that they have all the appropriate receipts, invoices and associated correspondence when submitting claims for additional costs. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys will be permitted (JSP 752 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are not permitted unless they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h5>Self-isolation carried out at the home of a nominated Guardian</h5>

<p>Where possible we would expect it to be just the child(ren) who self-isolates at the home of the nominated Guardian and the parent would be able to return overseas immediately. Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9">[footnote 9]</a></sup> is not normally payable under these circumstances but, exceptionally, under the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions it may be claimed for each day when the child is self-isolating with the Guardian and the parent is not present. Where it is necessary for the parent to remain with the child(ren) at the home of the Guardian for all or part of the mandatory self-isolation period, then <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> may be claimed. Only one <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> claim is permissible per night per family and Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians) is not payable on nights when <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> is claimed. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys will be permitted for: the parent to transport the child to the home of the guardian, to take the child to the school (conducted by either the parent or the guardian), and for the parent to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h5>Parent and child(ren) self-isolate in Service welfare housing</h5>

<p>The availability of this type of accommodation should be checked with the Welfare team by the Chain of Command. There will not be a second accommodation charge made to the individual Service person for this accommodation. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys may be claimed: from the point of arrival in the UK to the welfare accommodation, from the welfare accommodation to the school (twice, on pick up and drop off) and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure from the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0122 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations. No subsistence allowance is authorised.</p>

<h5>Parent and child(ren) self-isolate with friends or family</h5>

<p>Subsistence at the Private Arrangements Rate (<abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr>) may be claimed for the mandatory self-isolation period only. Only one <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> claim is permissible per night per family. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the home of the friend/family member, to take the child(ren) to the school (conducted by either the parent or the guardian), and for the parent to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted where they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h5>If none of the above options are available or the family’s specific welfare needs as determined by Service welfare authorities dictate, then the parent and child(ren) may stay in a Serviced Apartment (or hotel if no Serviced Apartments are available) for the duration of the mandatory self-isolation period</h5>

<p>A Serviced Apartment can be booked by emailing a completed form (see attachment to this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr>) to Global Business Travel (<abbr title="Global Business Travel">GBT</abbr>). Costs will be met by <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> will not be required to pay and claim<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="govuk-link">[footnote 10]</a></sup>. Since the Serviced Apartments have self-catering facilities, no subsistence allowance is payable. (If there are no Serviced Apartments available within reasonable travelling distance of the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr>’s preferred location, hotel accommodation may be substituted and actual subsistence costs (up to £25 per day, for each parent and each child) may be claimed<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="govuk-link">[footnote 11]</a></sup> for the mandatory self-isolation period only. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the hotel; to take the child(ren) to the school and for the parent to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted where they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of <abbr title="Motor Mileage Allowance">MMA</abbr> for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h4>What if a Service person (<abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr>) decides that their child should not travel to the overseas area on a SCV (through personal choice rather than because of <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions) and wishes to arrange a reverse SCV instead?</h4>

<p>The regulations at JSP 752 (para 10.0228) already allow for a reverse visit for one parent for reasons of child welfare. This is in addition to the reverse visit already allowed for welfare reasons which may already have been taken or which may be required later in the academic year. In line with regulations (JSP 752 para 10.0221) no subsistence is authorised.</p>

<h4>What if a Service person (<abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr>) and/or their spouse has been evacuated to UK from the overseas assignment area, or is unable to return to the overseas assignment area due to <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>. Can a SCV within the UK be permitted in lieu of the SCV to the overseas area?</h4>

<p>Yes, the regulations at JSP 752 (para 10.0211) should be followed to arrange travel within the UK to/from the child(ren)s school to the accommodation that the parent(s) will be occupying in the UK during the SCV. In line with regulations (JSP 752 para 10.0221) no subsistence is authorised.</p>

<h4>What if a <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> has already booked a SCV flight for a child to the overseas area but the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> situation changes and they need to cancel the flight because of official advice?</h4>

<p>If it is necessary to change travel plans because of official advice from the [UK Government(https://www.gov.uk), advice from the child(ren)’s school or from their local Commanding Officer or the Government of the country to which they are assigned, then flights can be cancelled. The costs of the cancelled flight will be met by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. The SCV can then be re-arranged for a later date or a reverse SCV can be authorised instead.</p>

<h4>What if a <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> has already booked a SCV flight for a child to the overseas area but due to the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> situation they would prefer to cancel the SCV?</h4>

<p>In this scenario, where the decision was based on preference rather than any official advice, parents could decide to cancel the SCV flights and <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> would meet the cost of the cancelled flights. However, this would count as one of the child’s <abbr title="School Children’s Visits">SCVs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>What if a child travels to the overseas area on a SCV but cannot return following the school holiday because of official travel advice, school closure or a mandatory self-isolation period has been imposed?</h4>

<p>In this scenario, parents could decide to cancel the flight back to the UK and re-arrange for a later date once the school re-opens or travel advice changes. Any cost incurred in the cancellation and re-booking would be met by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>.</p>

<h4>What if a parent travels to the UK on a reverse SCV but cannot return to the overseas area following the school holiday because of official travel advice or a mandatory self-isolation period has been imposed?</h4>

<p>In this scenario, parents would be permitted to cancel the flight back to the overseas area and re-arrange for a later date once the official advice permitted travel. Any cost incurred in the cancellation and re- booking would be met by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. There is no entitlement to subsistence or hotel costs during reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visits">SCVs</abbr> (but see provisions above for subsistence during a mandatory self-isolation period on arrival in UK). Any questions from displaced families should be directed through Chain of Command who will provide advice on assistance in these circumstances.</p>

<h1>]## What if a reverse SCV to the UK has been booked but a change to the COVID- 19 situation in UK means that the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> would prefer their child to travel to the overseas assignment area?</h1>

<p>If it is necessary to change travel plans because of advice from the [UK Government(https://www.gov.uk), advice from the children’s school or from their local Commanding Officer or the Government of the country to which they are assigned, then flights can be cancelled and the costs of the cancelled flight will be met by the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. If appropriate, a SCV could then be arranged for the child instead.</p>

<h4>What if a child cannot travel to the overseas assignment area due to official travel advice and the parent cannot travel to the UK due to official travel advice?</h4>

<p>The cost of return travel from the child’s school to a Guardian’s address<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12">[footnote 12]</a></sup> in the UK may be claimed (JSP 752 para 10.0211) less the normal parental contribution. Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13">[footnote 13]</a></sup> is not normally payable under these circumstances but, exceptionally, under the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions it may be claimed for each day when the child is with the Guardian and the parent is not present.</p>

<h4>What if a child is prevented from travelling to join their parents by governmental travel directive or the imposition of an isolation period. They are unable to join a designated Guardian for valid reasons (e.g. the Guardian is self- isolating) and continue to be accommodated at their school.</h4>

<p>In this case, where the child remains at the school out with the normal academic term times, <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants will be entitled to reclaim any additional fees providing they are proportionate to the routine boarding element of the school fees.</p>

<h4>If the government of the country to which I am assigned requires mandatory self-isolation in accommodation that is not my Service provided accommodation, and there is a cost, can I re-claim that cost?</h4>

<p>Yes, subject to Budget Holder Approval, you may claim the cost of any essential mandatory accommodation you, and any immediate family, have to occupy on return to the country to which you are assigned. This should be claimed under duty travel subsistence on JPA. If a child is required to self- isolate in accommodation that is not your Service provided accommodation, then a parent may join them in the accommodation, if necessary for welfare reasons, and the costs may also be claimed.</p>

<h4>If the government of the country to which I am assigned mandates a COVID- 19 test be carried out prior to re-entry, and there is a cost, can I re-claim that cost?</h4>

<p>Yes, any essential costs incurred (for the <abbr title="Service person">SP</abbr> and immediate family) can be claimed through JPA in accordance with JSP 752 Annex A to Section 1 of Chapter 17. Claims should be made to your UIN under a Miscellaneous Expenses Claim and then select ‘Medical, Dental, Opticians, Prescription Fees’ as the Expense Type. You should record ‘<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Test’ in the justification box.</p>
