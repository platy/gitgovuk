<p><strong>Dated: 2 November 2020</strong></p>

<p>I am directed to inform you of the following interim arrangements for Operational Allowance (<abbr title="Operational Allowance">OA</abbr>) and Campaign Continuity Allowance (<abbr title="Campaign Continuity Allowance">CCA</abbr>) in response to the Coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>) pandemic. This <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> replaces the previous <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> dated 3 July 2020. These arrangements are to be applied with an effective date of 1 April 2020 and will remain in place until further notice.</p>

<h2>Operational Allowance</h2>

<p>The aim of <abbr title="Operational Allowance">OA</abbr> is to recognise the significantly increased and enduring nature of the danger in specified operational locations (<abbr title="specified operational locations">SOL</abbr>), over and above that compensated for within the X-Factor <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> element of pay. Under the existing policy, <abbr title="Operational Allowance">OA</abbr> is paid for the duration of the planned length of the service person’s (<abbr title="service person's">SP</abbr>) assignment to the operational deployment if the recipient is hospitalised in theatre or elsewhere as a result of an attributable injury sustained whilst on the operational deployment <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In response to the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic, and to ensure that the risk posed to deployed forces from the virus is reduced to as low as reasonably practicable, <abbr title="specified operational locations">SOL</abbr> commanders have directed that <abbr title="service person's">SP</abbr> that contract the virus whilst in theatre are to be extracted and placed into quarantine external to SOLs, and return after the period of quarantine ends. This letter gives exceptional authority for <abbr title="service person's">SP</abbr> who are extracted from theatre and placed into quarantine outside of a recognised <abbr title="specified operational locations">SOL</abbr>, that otherwise would have been in receipt of <abbr title="Operational Allowance">OA</abbr>, to remain eligible for the allowance during the period of quarantine. Should the <abbr title="service person's">SP</abbr> exit quarantine and not re-deploy to the <abbr title="specified operational locations">SOL</abbr> then <abbr title="Operational Allowance">OA</abbr> is to cease from the date that the quarantine ended.</p>

<p>Additionally, it has been recognised that for the few <abbr title="service person's">SP</abbr> in receipt of <abbr title="Operational Allowance">OA</abbr> that are authorised a period of Rest and Recuperation (<abbr title="Rest and Recuperation">R&amp;R</abbr>) during their operational tour may then be required to conduct a period of quarantine prior to returning to the <abbr title="specified operational locations">SOL</abbr>. In this circumstance, exceptional authority has been granted to the continuation of payment of <abbr title="Operational Allowance">OA</abbr> to the <abbr title="service person's">SP</abbr> during post-<abbr title="Rest and Recuperation">R&amp;R</abbr> quarantine outside of the <abbr title="specified operational locations">SOL</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Campaign Continuity Allowance</h2>

<p>The aim of <abbr title="Campaign Continuity Allowance">CCA</abbr> is to recognise and compensate for the significantly increased burden placed on personnel assigned to specific campaign continuity posts <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link">[footnote 3]</a></sup> that result in longer operational tours that would normally be experienced. Existing policy allows <abbr title="service person's">SP</abbr> permanently assigned to <abbr title="Campaign Continuity Allowance">CCA</abbr> posts to be eligible for <abbr title="Campaign Continuity Allowance">CCA</abbr> after 228 days qualifying service in the relevant operational theatre <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. However, many of these <abbr title="service person's">SP</abbr> are required to undergo a period of Service-provided quarantine prior to undertaking these roles, thus extending the burden placed on the <abbr title="service person's">SP</abbr>. Exceptional authority has been granted for <abbr title="Campaign Continuity Allowance">CCA</abbr> qualifying periods to include the time spent in pre-handover Service-provided quarantine that is required due to the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic.</p>

<p>The terms of this Directed Letter will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by <abbr title="Armed Forces (Remuneration)">AF Rem</abbr> Allowances.</p>
