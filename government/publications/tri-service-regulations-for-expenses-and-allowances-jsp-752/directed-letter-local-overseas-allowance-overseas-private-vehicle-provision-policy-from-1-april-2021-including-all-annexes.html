<p><strong>This letter is version 2</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dated: 5 March 2021</strong></p>

<p>Changes to the Local Overseas Allowance (<abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr>) were announced on 1 February 2021 and will take effect from 1 July 2021 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. The package includes a new Overseas Private Vehicle Provision (<abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr>) to assist <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> with access to a private motor vehicle at the <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> area. This provision will be available from 1 April 2021 so that Service personnel (<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr>) assigned into the <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> area prior to the change taking effect on 1 July have the choice of which vehicle provision to utilise. This <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> gives advance notice of the <abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr> policy (at the Annex) and will be rescinded when Version 46 of JSP 752 is published on 1 April 2021.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The two existing schemes for assisting <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> with access to private vehicles when assigned overseas are:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Shipping vehicles to qualifying locations in receipt of Small Station <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> (<abbr title="Small Station Local Overseas Allowance (LOA)">SSLOA</abbr>)         <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. A car buy/sell (<abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr>) allowance paid as part of the daily rate of Main Station <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> (<abbr title="Main Station Local Overseas Allowance (LOA)">MSLOA</abbr>) to most <abbr title="Main Station Local Overseas Allowance (LOA)">MSLOA</abbr> locations <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. The <abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr> allowance provides some compensation for the extra cost of leaving the UK market, purchasing and selling in the overseas market, and re-entering the UK market on return. The current value of the <abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr> allowance is around £1,220 for accompanied <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> and around £1,100 for unaccompanied <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr>, paid at a daily rate across the length of the assignment, depending on the assumed tour length for each qualifying <abbr title="Main Station Local Overseas Allowance (LOA)">MSLOA</abbr> location.</p>

<h2>Overview of change</h2>

<p><abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr> will replace both schemes and will be available to <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> permanently assigned overseas from 1 April 2021 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. The rate of <abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr> is yet to be confirmed, but for planning purposes the indicative rate is approximately £800 which, depending on the circumstances of the <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr>, can be claimed on assignment into and out of the overseas assignment, meaning that in some cases <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> will be able to claim up to a total of circa £1600, a circa £300-£500 increase on the existing policy. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> will be able to use <abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr> in one of the following ways:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. To contribute towards administrative and vehicle depreciation costs when selling and buying a vehicle. The <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> must be able to demonstrate that two separate financial transactions have taken place. Or;   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. To contribute towards the charges incurred (up to the capped rate) when required to cancel a vehicle lease agreement. Or;     <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. To contribute towards the cost (up to the capped rate) of privately shipping one vehicle to and from the permanent overseas assignment location <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, current policy <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> gives <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> the option to drive their personal vehicle to eligible countries (Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) and claim Motor Mileage Allowance and one day’s subsistence as a contribution towards this journey. From 1 April 2021, qualifying locations will expand to include Italy, Spain, Portugal and Gibraltar.</p>

<p>There has also been an introduction of an augmented rate of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> which will be available to accompanied <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> who can demonstrate that they are running two private vehicles at the overseas location, with effect from 1 July 2021.</p>

<h2>Transitionary arrangements for <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> based at <abbr title="Main Station Local Overseas Allowance (LOA)">MSLOA</abbr> locations in receipt of <abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>
</h2>

<p>Transitionary arrangements have been made for <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> in receipt of the <abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr> element of <abbr title="Main Station Local Overseas Allowance (LOA)">MSLOA</abbr>. This is because it is recognised that as at 1 July 2021 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>, <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> serving at these locations will have received differing amounts of financial contribution depending on the length of time they have been assigned to the <abbr title="Main Station Local Overseas Allowance (LOA)">MSLOA</abbr> location <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. The transitionary arrangements are broken down as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. If the <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> is assigned into the overseas location from 1 April 2021, they will be eligible to claim <abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr> in accordance with the regulations listed at the Annex. This will have no impact on their rate of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> on arrival at the overseas location, and they will transition to the new rate of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> with effect from 1 July 2021 in accordance with the transition arrangements for that location.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. If, on 1 July 2021, the <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> has been assigned for more than 14 months at an overseas location and been in receipt of the <abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr> element of <abbr title="Main Station Local Overseas Allowance (LOA)">MSLOA</abbr>, they will have received at least half of the overall contribution that <abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr> is intended to cover. They will not receive any further vehicle-related contribution until they are assigned out of the overseas location, when they will be eligible to claim <abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr> in accordance with the policy at the Annex.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. If, on 1 July 2021, the <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> has been in receipt of the <abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr> element of <abbr title="Main Station Local Overseas Allowance (LOA)">MSLOA</abbr> for between 4 to 14 months then it will be considered that they have not received the appropriate compensation for vehicle provision on assignment into the overseas location. These <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> will, therefore, be eligible to claim a one-off ‘Car Buy/Sell Reimbursement’ based on the amount of time that they have spent in receipt of the <abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr> element of <abbr title="Main Station Local Overseas Allowance (LOA)">MSLOA</abbr>. The <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> must provide evidence that they sold a vehicle at their previous location and purchased a vehicle at their existing location. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> can claim this back using <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration">JPA</abbr> I-Expenses using the Disturbance Expense element. Eligibility is illustrated at table 1.</p>

<p>Due to these transitional arrangements and the fact that the <abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr> element of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> will continue to be paid until 30 June 2021, <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> that are already assigned in a post that is in receipt of the <abbr title="car buy/sell">CBS</abbr> element of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> will not become eligible to <abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr> on assignment from this location until 1 July 2021.</p>

<h2>Annex A: Overseas Private Vehicle Provision 16 February 2021</h2>

<h3>Overseas private vehicle provision policy - WEF 1 April 2021</h3>

<p><strong>Chapter 9 Section 4 – Overseas Private Vehicle Provision (<abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr>)</strong></p>

<h3>General</h3>

<h4>09.0401 -  Aim</h4>

<p>The aim of <abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr> is to assist Service Personnel (<abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr>) permanently assigned <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:11">[footnote 11]</a></sup> to or from an overseas location with access to a private motor vehicle. It replaces the vehicle provision in previous <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> policy <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>09.0402 -  Principles</h4>

<p>The following principles underpin <abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr> and should be applied when interpreting the regulations in this Section and its associated Annexes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. These regulations apply to <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> proceeding on and returning from a permanent overseas assignment for which they receive permanent rates of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr>. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> will be eligible to submit one claim per assignment order subject to meeting the specific requirements at Annexes A to C.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <abbr title="service personnel">SP</abbr> moving between assignments in the same <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> location will normally not be eligible for <abbr title="Overseas Private Vehicle Provision">OPVP</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 13]</a></sup>. Applications must be submitted to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DBSMilPers-MilOps-PACCC-Group@mod.gov.uk">DBSMilPers-MilOps-<abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr>-Group@mod.gov.uk</a>  for approval.</p>
