<h2>
<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> related deviation from <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> policy and claiming additional costs</h2>

<p>The circumstances that may require a deviation from current <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> policy include <strong>(but are not be limited to)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a) <strong>The child is prevented from travelling to join their parents by governmental travel directive and/or the imposition of a mandatory period of quarantine or isolation. They are unable to join a designated guardian for valid reasons (for example, the guardian is self-isolating) and continue to be accommodated at their school.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, where the child remains at the school, (outside of the normal academic term times), the <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant will be entitled to reclaim any additional fees without paying any parental contribution. This is providing they are proportional to the routine boarding element of the school fees.</p>

<ul>
  <li>b) <strong>Where the school has decided it is unsafe for a child to remain in the boarding environment at the school, but it is practicable for the child to convert to day-pupil status for the period covered by these arrangements.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, if the child can live with their parents or a designated guardian and travel to the school daily, the claimant may convert to claiming <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(Day) from the beginning of the next academic term <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. This will apply even if their child has not completed three consecutive academic terms at the same school as a full boarder. Should the school subsequently be required to close altogether, the child should stay with their parents or a designated guardian. In these circumstances <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> eligibility will not be adversely affected.</p>

<ul>
  <li>c) <strong>The child travels to an overseas area but is prevented from returning to their school because of a government travel restriction, school closure or the imposition of a mandatory period of quarantine or isolation.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a child is required to remain at the overseas duty station, the parent will continue to receive the appropriate accompanied rate of Local Overseas Allowance (<abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr>) until the child is able to return to their school. <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> eligibility will be unaffected.</p>

<ul>
  <li>d) <strong>Where a parent does not wish for their child to return to school following a School Children’s Visit (<abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr>) or other authorised absence because of restrictions placed (by the school) on future absences of the child from the school</strong> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances, if the school agrees to provide online tuition, the child may remain with the parents and <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> eligibility will be unaffected. Where the parent is assigned overseas, the appropriate rate of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> will remain in issue until the child returns to the school. This concession applies only until <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> lockdown restrictions are withdrawn or the end of Academic Term Spring 2021, whichever is sooner.</p>

<ul>
  <li>e) <strong>Where a parent does not wish for their child to return to school following a <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> or other authorised absence from school. There are no specific restrictions on the child returning to school (including mandatory periods of quarantine or self-isolation) and the school has not placed any restrictions on the child’s future absence from the school.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances, if the school agrees to provide online tuition, the child may remain with the parents and <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> eligibility will be unaffected. Where the parent is assigned overseas, the appropriate rate of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr> will remain in issue until the child returns to the school. This concession applies only until <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> lockdown restrictions are withdrawn or the end of Academic Term Spring 2021, whichever is sooner.</p>

<ul>
  <li>f) <strong>Where a claimant is about to complete their service and a delay in examinations causes an extension to an Academic year.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances the <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant will be entitled to reclaim any additional fees, (less the parental contribution). This is providing they are proportional to the routine boarding and tuition elements of the school fees. This must be authorised by the <abbr title="Commanding Officer">CO</abbr> and supported by advice from the Children’s Education Advisory Service (<abbr title="Children’s Education Advisory Service">CEAS</abbr>) with the <abbr title="Commanding Officer">CO</abbr> notifying the <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr> in the process. This provision will last for as many academic terms as necessary to complete the academic year.</p>

<ul>
  <li>g) <strong>Where <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> impacts on critical stages of education (GCSEs, A-Levels, B-TECs and Scottish Nationals and Highers or equivalents) and the school recommends an extra academic year.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the school has recommended an additional academic year, the claimant should make a written application to the <abbr title="Children’s Education Advisory Service">CEAS</abbr> (including the advice of the school). The <abbr title="Children’s Education Advisory Service">CEAS</abbr> will make its own recommendation and forward to the <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr> for a decision <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. Reimbursement of any additional school fees will be limited to those in respect of the subjects for which the child was studying before the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> crisis began and will be subject to the usual parental contribution.</p>

<ul>
  <li>h) <strong>For claimants of Guardians Allowance (<abbr title="Guardians Allowance">GA</abbr>) where the child must remain with the guardian after the end of the academic year.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances <abbr title="Guardians Allowance">GA</abbr> will remain in issue until the child is reunited with their parents or the travel restrictions are reversed; whichever is sooner.</p>

<ul>
  <li>i) <strong>Where the school has reduced its fees to below the appropriate <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> maximum, will Admissible Extras <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup> be payable?</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the revised net fee (less the appropriate parental contribution) is less than the appropriate maximum rate of <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>, then compulsory costs directly leading to public examinations <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup> will be considered admissible. Examples of such costs are, examination entrance fees (but not re-sits) or the cost of essential or compulsory textbooks. Only admissible extras included on the bill for the current academic term may be reclaimed <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>. Where there is any doubt Unit HR should review the advice on repayments at Annex B. Where doubt remains, they are to seek advice from the <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr> who should consult the <abbr title="Children’s Education Advisory Service">CEAS</abbr> if necessary. Any costs considered admissible are subject to the usual parental contribution.</p>

<ul>
  <li>j) <strong>Where <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants are preparing to submit a <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> Eligibility Certificate for their child’s 6th Form stage of education.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Under <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> regulations, claimants are advised to submit their <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> Eligibility Certificates (<abbr title="CEA Eligibility Certificates">CEA ECs</abbr>) during a window between 15 months and 6 months before the academic term in which their child is expected to enter the 6th form or “A” Level (or equivalent) stage of education <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. For those <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants with a child due to start 6th form in September 21, the window has been open since June 20; closing at the end of Mar 21. <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants should note, that due to potential future restrictions on the PACCCs ability to process <abbr title="CEA Eligibility Certificates">CEA ECs</abbr> due to <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, the response times for 6th Form applications may be longer than usual and may go beyond the 20-working day target for a response.</p>

<h2>Payments</h2>

<p>For the purposes of submitting routine <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claims and claiming back additional costs, the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants are to continue to claim for their main termly <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claims in accordance with routine procedures.</li>
  <li>Where <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants incur additional costs as detailed in this Annex, they are to be claimed using a manual <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claim form <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:8">[footnote 8]</a></sup>: clearly identified as <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Additional Costs. Defence Business Services (<abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr>) will process claims allowing <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> to be reimbursed above normal <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> ceilings.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants should ensure that they have all the appropriate receipts, invoices and associated correspondence when submitting claims for additional costs.</li>
  <li>Standard <abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr> response times may need to be extended to facilitate the processing of manual claims in the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> environment.</li>
