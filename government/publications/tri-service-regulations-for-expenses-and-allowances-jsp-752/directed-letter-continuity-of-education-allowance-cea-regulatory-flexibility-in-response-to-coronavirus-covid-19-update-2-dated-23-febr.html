<p><strong>Dated: 23 February 2021</strong></p>

<p>I am directed to inform and update you on the increased flexibility introduced to the arrangements for Continuity of Education Allowance (<abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>) in response to Coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>) and associated border control restrictions. This Directed Letter (<abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr>) replaces the previous <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> issued on 19 January 2021.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>These arrangements are effective immediately and will remain in place until further notice by Armed Forces Remuneration (Allowances).</p>
</div>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Under current circumstances it is necessary to introduce further flexibility into current <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> policy. This will reassure <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants that any deviation from <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> eligibility criteria caused, (or contributed to), directly by <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, will not adversely affect their <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> eligibility. Circumstances that may require a deviation from current <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> policy are detailed at Annex A of this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr>. Any other circumstances not covered by this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> should be declared to the <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr>, where consideration will be given to the ongoing circumstances brought about by <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants should continue to claim <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> and pay the school fees for each academic term as presented to them. If they subsequently become liable for any additional school fees, as a result of the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> related scenarios at Annex A, they will be eligible for reimbursement under the provisions of this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr>. Any claims for additional school fees for boarding and tuition relating to these scenarios will be considered separately from the main termly <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claims; the arrangements for reimbursement of additional costs are also detailed at Annex A.</p>

<p><strong>Similarly, any reimbursements from the school to the claimant that arise because of <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> must be declared to the department and (where necessary) repaid within 30 days of receipt.</strong> Failure to declare and repay any refund or reimbursement from the school may lead to disciplinary or administrative action. The arrangements for the repayment of reimbursed fees and the handling of fee reductions are detailed at Annex B.</p>

<h3>Accompanied Status</h3>

<p>Accompanied Status remains an underpinning principle of qualification for <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>. The guidance on Accompanied Status <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, requires that when a Service person’s spouse/civil partner is absent from the Residence at Work Address (<abbr title="Residence at Work Address">RWA</abbr>) for a period of 90 days or more during a 12-month period, their ongoing eligibility for <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> will be reviewed by their Commanding Officer (<abbr title="Commanding Officer">CO</abbr>) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If the circumstances relating to <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> cause or contribute to the spouse/civil partner being absent from the <abbr title="Residence at Work Address">RWA</abbr> for in excess of 90 days <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3">[footnote 3]</a></sup>, the <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant should remain assured that the <abbr title="Commanding Officer">CO</abbr> will acknowledge this during their assessment of their accompanied status <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Every reasonable effort must be made by the spouse/civil partner to re-join the Service parent as soon as is practicable once any <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> related travel restrictions are reversed <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>It is important to note that parents, or appointed Guardians, are responsible for the welfare of children attending boarding school in the UK at all times. It will be necessary for parents to keep up to date with the situation as it develops in the UK, as well as in host nation/overseas assignment areas for those assigned overseas. <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> should make decisions based on the facts and guidance published by the UK Government on their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">website</a>, Defence <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/defnet/HOCS/Pages/Defence-policy-statements.aspx">(Defence Advice Notes)</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link">[footnote 6]</a></sup> as well as any guidance and arrangements published by host nations. Parents should also ensure that they inform their <abbr title="Chain of Command">CofC</abbr> of any changes to their personal circumstances.</p>

<p>UK Self-isolation requirements are set out in the Government guidance available at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control" class="govuk-link">UK border control website</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>The terms of this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by Armed Forces Remuneration (Allowances).</strong> Details of any additional costs to <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> as a result of <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> are to be retained so the information is available for auditing purposes.</p>
</div>

<p>Single Service enquiries on the exceptional authority provided by this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> should be directed initially to Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> staffs who, if necessary, should seek further guidance from the <abbr title="Joint Personnel Administration Centre">JPAC</abbr> Enquiry Centre or their single Service allowance policy staffs.</p>
