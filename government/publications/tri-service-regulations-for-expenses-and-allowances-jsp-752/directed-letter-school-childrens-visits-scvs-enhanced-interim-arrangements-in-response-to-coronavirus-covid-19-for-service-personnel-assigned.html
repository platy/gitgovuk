<p><strong>2 November 2020</strong></p>

<p>Further to the Directed Letter dated 2 October, I am directed to inform you that further enhancements have been made to the interim arrangements for School Children’s Visits (<abbr title="School Children’s Visits">SCVs</abbr>) in response to Coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>). Further enhancements are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a.	Accommodation options now include Serviced Apartments rather than hotel <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> (where other accommodation options are not available)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>b.	Accommodation provision now includes the entire Christmas school holiday period as well as any mandatory self-isolation period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>c.	Greater provision for travel by vehicle, where this is in place of a flight, over the Christmas holiday period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>d.	A higher rate of <abbr title="Privately Arranged Rate">PAR</abbr> (Privately Arranged Rate) for the Christmas holiday period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>e.	Confirmation that costs for any host nation mandatory self-isolation accommodation and/or mandatory <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> testing can be claimed, subject to Budget Holder approval.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Details of these further enhancements are shown in the Annex to this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr>.</p>

<p>**This <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> replaces the SCV DLs issued on 9 and 16 March and 2 October 2020 and the <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> issued on border restrictions dated 4 June 2020 which are now rescinded. These arrangements are effective immediately and will remain in place until further notice by Rem Allowances. UK self-isolation requirements are set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control" class="govuk-link">Government guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Temporary provisions are listed at the Annex to this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> and should be read alongside JSP 752 Chapter 10 Section 2 – School Children’s Visits. <strong>It is emphasised that SP should submit any flight booking requests as soon as possible</strong>. Flights, where they are operating, may be limited and subject to the risk of cancellation.</p>

<p>It is important to note that parents, or appointed Guardians, are responsible for the welfare of children attending boarding school in the UK at all times, including whilst on <abbr title="School Children’s Visits">SCVs</abbr>. It will be necessary for parents to keep up to date with the situation as it develops in the UK, as well as in the host nation/overseas assignment area and make decisions based on the facts and guidance published by the <a href="www.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">UK Government</a> as well as any host nation guidance and arrangements.</p>

<p>The guidance on Accompanied Status (JSP 752, Annex A to Section 1 of Chapter 2) requires that when a Service person’s spouse/civil partner is absent from the Residence at Work Address (<abbr title="Residence at Work Address">RWA</abbr>) for a period of 90 days or more during a 12-month period, their accompanied status will be reviewed by their Commanding Officer (<abbr title="Commanding Officer">CO</abbr>). If the exceptional circumstances relating to <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> cause (or contribute to) the spouse/civil partner being absent from the <abbr title="Residence at Work Address">RWA</abbr> in excess of 90 days, the <abbr title="Commanding Officer">CO</abbr> should acknowledge this during their assessment of the claimant’s accompanied status. Every reasonable effort must be made by the spouse/civil partner to re-join the Service parent as soon as is practicable once any <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> related travel restrictions are reversed<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The arrangements in this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> do not extend to children over the age of 18 attending a nationally accredited establishment and entitled to <abbr title="School Children’s Visits">SCVs</abbr> under the terms of JSP 752 10.0210 b. Reverse visits are, however, permitted for one parent. In line with regulations (JSP 752 Para 10.0221) no subsistence is authorised.</p>

<p>For children over the age of 18 with Special Educational Needs and Disability (<abbr title="Special Educational Needs and Disability">SEND</abbr>), or with complex needs requiring specialist support (see JSP 752 10.0210 c. and d.) the provisions of this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> will apply.</p>

<p><strong>The terms of this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by <abbr>AF Rem</abbr> Allowances. The additional costs associated with the arrangements covered in this <abbr title="directed letter">DL</abbr> should be recorded so that they are available should this information be required at a later date</strong>.</p>
