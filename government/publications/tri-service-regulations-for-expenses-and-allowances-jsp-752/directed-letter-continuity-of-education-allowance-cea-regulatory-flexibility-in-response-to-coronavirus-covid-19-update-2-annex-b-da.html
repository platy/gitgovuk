<h2>Arrangements for the repayment of reimbursed <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>
</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants are advised of a reduction or refund in fees by their child’s school, they should immediately inform their Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> providing details of the original school bill and the reduced fees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The instructions detailed in this Annex were first introduced for Summer Term 2020. However, depending on current and future restrictions that may be caused by <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> and for how long those restrictions endure, these instructions should be considered (where necessary) to apply also to any subsequent academic terms until they are withdrawn or replaced by Armed Forces Remuneration (Allowances).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Claimants must bear in mind that <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> is publicly funded money and as such, refunds offered in any form in relation to school fees must be accepted and declared to their Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary or administrative action. There are various scenarios in which a reduction in fees may occur:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>a) <strong>The claimant has paid the school fees for the academic term and has subsequently received a revised bill indicating a refund.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances the claimant should declare the refund to their Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> and provide a copy of the original and reduced bills. Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> will then conduct an assessment and inform the claimant of the necessary repayment, copying to <abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr> Debt Management (Recovery &amp; Write-Off) by E-Mail (see details below). The claimant must then repay the <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> in accordance with the arrangements at paragraph 5 of this Annex.</p>

<ul>
  <li>b) <strong>The claimant has paid the school fees for the academic term but had not submitted a claim for <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> when they received a subsequent revised bill indicating a refund.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances, the claimant should declare the refund to their Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> providing a copy of the original and reduced bills. They should then submit their <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claim but for the reduced amount.</p>

<ul>
  <li>c) <strong>The <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant has paid the school fees for the academic term, has not received a revised bill but has received a payment direct from the school.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances, the claimant should declare the payment to their Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr>. They should provide copies of the original school bill and any documentation showing the payment made to them by the school. The Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> will then conduct an assessment and confirm the value of the necessary <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> repayment with the claimant, copying to <abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr> Debt Management (Recovery &amp; Write-Off) by E-Mail (see details below). The claimant must then repay the <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> in accordance with the arrangements at paragraph 5 of this Annex.</p>

<ul>
  <li>d) <strong>The <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant has paid the school fees for the academic term, the school has offered no reimbursement for the academic Term but has offered to reduce their fees for the next academic term.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances, if the claimant does not get a retrospective amendment to the bill for the current term, they should declare the intended fee reduction for the subsequent term to their Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr>. They should then claim the reduced fees for that term in accordance with the routine process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>e) <strong>Where the school has closed or entered administration.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances, the claimant should pay any outstanding bills to the school. They should then declare any unused <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> to their Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> providing a copy of the original and reduced bills. If necessary, Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> will then conduct an assessment and inform the claimant of the necessary repayment, copying to <abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr> Debt Management (Recovery &amp; Write-Off) by E-Mail (see details below). The claimant should then repay the unused <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> in accordance with the arrangements at paragraph 5 of this Annex. Any refund received by the claimant in respect of subsequent academic terms should be similarly declared.</p>

<p>Any other circumstances not covered by this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> should be considered on a case by case basis and submitted to <abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr> Debt Management (Recovery &amp; Write-Off) by E-Mail (see details below).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Examples of how Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> should assess any necessary repayments with guidance notes are detailed at Appendix 1 to this Annex.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where it is necessary for the <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant to repay <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> already received in the circumstances outlined in paragraphs 3.a, 3.c or 3.e above, separate payments should be made where they are claiming for more than one child. Payments must be made within 30 days of receipt as follows:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A) Each repayment must be clearly marked with a reference consisting of the individuals Service Number, the academic term to which it refers, the child’s name and “<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> Repayment; for example, 123456X Academic Term Smith, John <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> Repayment <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> Repayments - Unit <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> notes for guidance</h2>

<ol>
