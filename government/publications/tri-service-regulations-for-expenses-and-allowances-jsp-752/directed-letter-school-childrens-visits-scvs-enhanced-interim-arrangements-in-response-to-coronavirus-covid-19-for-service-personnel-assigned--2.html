<p>Further to the Directed Letter dated 2 November 2020, I am directed to inform you of the interim arrangements for School Children’s Visits (SCVs) in response to Coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>).</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> replaces the <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> DLs issued on 9 and 16 March, 2 October and 2 November 2020 and the <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> issued on border restrictions dated 4 June 2020 which are now rescinded. New provisions which have been added to this publication. These arrangements are effective immediately, and apply retrospectively to any mandatory accommodation or testing requirements from the date implemented by the UK or host nation government, and will remain in place until further notice by Rem Allowances. UK self-isolation requirements are set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control" class="govuk-link">UK Government guidance</a> and the <a href="https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/defnet/HOCS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE4512C00-58D6-4D90-A157-A6C63ABA99BA%7D&amp;file=20210216-DAN18_Border_Measures_v6.2-OS.docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true" rel="external" class="govuk-link">MODs guidance in Defence Advice note 18 - <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Health Measures at the Border and effects on delivering Defence tasks</a> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.

<p>Temporary provisions are listed at the Annex to this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> and should be read alongside JSP 752 Chapter 10 Section 2 – School Children’s Visits. It is emphasised that <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> should submit any flight booking requests as soon as possible. Flights, where they are operating, may be limited and subject to the risk of cancellation.</p>

<p>Please note that the costs for any UK Government or host nation mandated self-isolation accommodation and/or mandatory <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> testing can be claimed, subject to Budget Holder approval. The latest guidance on this can be found in <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/defnet/HOCS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE4512C00-58D6-4D90-A157-A6C63ABA99BA%7D&amp;file=20210216-DAN18_Border_Measures_v6.2-OS.docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true">MODs guidance in Defence Advice note 18 - <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Health Measures at the Border and effects on delivering Defence tasks</a> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9" class="govuk-link">[footnote 9]</a></sup> and in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/defnet/HOCS/Pages/Armed-Forces-Allowances-and-Expenses.aspx">Rem Allowances Directed Letter on COVID Testing</a> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9" class="govuk-link">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It is important to note that parents, or appointed Guardians, are responsible for the welfare of children attending boarding school in the UK at all times, including whilst on SCVs. It will be necessary for parents to keep up to date with the situation as it develops in the UK, as well as in the host nation/overseas assignment area and make decisions based on the facts and guidance published by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">UK Government</a> as well as any host nation guidance and arrangements.</p>

<p>The guidance on Accompanied Status (JSP 752, Annex A to Section 1 of Chapter 2) requires that when a Service person’s spouse/civil partner is absent from the Residence at Work Address (RWA) for a period of 90 days or more during a 12-month period, their accompanied status will be reviewed by their Commanding Officer (CO). If the exceptional circumstances relating to <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> cause (or contribute to) the spouse/civil partner being absent from the RWA in excess of 90 days, the CO should acknowledge this during their assessment of the claimant’s accompanied status. Every reasonable effort must be made by the spouse/civil partner to re-join the Service parent as soon as is practicable once any <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> related travel restrictions are reversed <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The arrangements in this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> do not extend to children over the age of 18 attending a nationally accredited establishment and entitled to SCVs under the terms of JSP 752 10.0210 b. Reverse visits are, however, permitted for one parent. In line with regulations (JSP 752 Para 10.0221), no subsistence is authorised except where specific UK Government or host nation self-isolation accommodation is mandated. Please refer to the FAQs covering mandatory accommodation and <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> testing (paras n-q). This provision for claims for essential mandatory accommodation/testing for those over the age of 18 entitled to SCVs was omitted from previous DLs and applies to any mandated accommodation and/or testing during the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions.</p>

<p>For children over the age of 18 with Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND), or with complex needs requiring specialist support (see JSP 752 10.0210 c. and d.) the provisions of this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> will apply.</p>

<p>Single Service enquiries on the exceptional authority provided by this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr> should be directed initially to Unit HR staffs who, if necessary, should seek further guidance from the JPAC Enquiry Centre or their single Service allowance policy staffs.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The terms of this DL will remain in place until rescinded or replaced by AF Rem Allowances. The additional costs associated with the arrangements covered in this DL should be recorded so that they are available should this information be required at a later date.</p>
</div>

<h2>Annex to Directed Letter</h2>

<p>The following provisions should be read alongside <strong>JSP 752 Chapter 10 Section 2 – School Children’s Visits</strong>.</p>

<h3>a. What if flights are not available to or from my overseas assignment area due to <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions but it is possible to make a <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> journey by vehicle and I wish to do so?</h3>

<p>In this scenario, you may travel by car and claim the cost of ferry/Eurotunnel and terminal Motor Mileage Allowance (MMA) travel (up to the value of half the current Get You Home (Overseas) rate for the country in which the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> is assigned) in line with the regulations already in place for those assigned to North West Europe (JSP 752 Para 10.0211c refers). In line with regulations (JSP 752 Para 10.0221) Subsistence Allowance is not authorised.</p>

<h3>b. What if, due to mandatory self-isolation provisions in either the UK or an overseas assignment area or due to a lack of an Unaccompanied Minors (UNMIN) service, it is not practicable for a child to travel to the overseas area on a <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> and the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> wishes to arrange a reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> instead?</h3>

<p><abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> regulations (JSP 752 para 10.0228) already allow for a reverse visit for one parent for reasons of child welfare. Should a parent consider this to be the preferred option for them at any of the school holidays during COVID restrictions, then a reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> may be authorised for one parent in lieu of one <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> for each eligible child. This is in addition to the reverse visit already allowed for welfare reasons, which may already have been taken or which may be required later in the academic year.</p>

<h3>c. If I have to arrange a reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> (for one parent) at any of the 2021 school holidays or during the school year due to school closure or welfare visit, can I claim any subsistence costs?</h3>

<p>Reverse SCVs do not normally attract payment of subsistence. However, where a reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> is necessary, and there is a mandatory self-isolation period applied by the UK Government on travellers from the country the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> is assigned to, subsistence allowance may be claimed for the duration of the self-isolation period only, as detailed in the options below. Where mandatory self-isolation is applicable, it is expected that the lowest cost accommodation option will be utilised wherever possible; however it is recognised that personal circumstances will vary and not every option will be available to every family. The Government or devolved administrations’ <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions may also limit options for some families. <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> should therefore discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate course of action. The options for mandatory self-isolation have been listed, alongside the allowable expenses, in order, starting with the most cost-effective (Option 1). These options apply to travellers who are not mandated to occupy specific self-isolation accommodation by the UK Government and who may therefore elect where to self-isolate (as per their Passenger Locator Form). Travellers from locations where the UK Government has mandated occupation of specific self-isolation accommodation (for example, Managed Quarantine for Red List countries) should refer to Para n.</p>

<p>1). <strong>Parent(s) and child(ren) to use the Service Cotswold Centre or welfare housing.</strong> The availability of this type of accommodation should be checked with the Welfare team by the Chain of Command. There would not be a second accommodation charge incurred to the individual Service person for this accommodation. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys may be claimed: from the point of arrival in the UK to the welfare accommodation; from the welfare accommodation to the school (twice, on pick up and drop off); and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure from the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0122 b(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations. No subsistence allowance is authorised.</p>

<p>2). <strong>Parent(s) and child(ren) stay with friends or family.</strong> Subsistence at the Private Arrangements Rate (<abbr title="Private Arrangements Rate">PAR</abbr>) may be claimed <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> for the mandatory self-isolation period only. <strong>Only one <abbr title="Private Arrangements Rate">PAR</abbr> claim is permissible per night, per family and neither Day nor Night subsistence claims are admissible.</strong> Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent(s) to transport the child(ren) to the home of the friend/family member; to take the child(ren) to the school (conducted by either the parent(s) or the guardian including the return journey); and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<p>3). <strong>If neither of the above options are available or the family’s specific welfare needs as determined by Service welfare authorities dictate, then the parent(s) and child(ren) may stay in a Serviced Apartment (or hotel if no Serviced Apartment is available) for the duration of the mandatory self-isolation period.</strong> A Serviced Apartment can be booked by emailing a completed form (see attachment to this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr>) to Global Business Travel (<abbr title="Global Business Travel">GBT</abbr>). Costs will be met by MOD and the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> will not be required to pay and claim <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. Since the Serviced Apartments have self-catering facilities, no subsistence allowance is payable. (If there are no Serviced Apartments available within reasonable travelling distance of the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr>’s preferred location, hotel accommodation may be substituted and actual subsistence costs (up to £25 per day, for each parent and each child) may be claimed <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup> for the mandatory self-isolation period only. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the hotel; to take the child(ren) to the school; and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted where they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h3>d. What if airlines are not currently offering an UNMIN service and I wish to travel with the child(ren) to or from the overseas assignment country?</h3>

<p>Where a parent must accompany their child(ren) and comply with any mandatory self-isolation requirements on arrival in the UK, JSP 752 published policy applies. However, this will now be extended to cover dependant children <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup> who would normally travel unaccompanied, but may now require a parent to accompany them if they are required to self-isolate in a hotel in the UK prior to commencement of the school term. This includes those attending University if exceptional individual circumstances mean this is essential and is agreed by Chain of Command. The following options for subsistence should be considered, and it is expected that the lowest cost option will be utilised wherever possible. However, it is recognised that personal circumstances will vary and not every option will be available to every family. The Government or devolved administrations’ <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions may also limit options for some <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> should therefore discuss their individual circumstances with their Chain of Command and agree the most appropriate course of action. The options have been listed, alongside the allowable expenses, in order starting with the most cost-effective (Option 1). These options apply to travellers who are not mandated to occupy specific self-isolation accommodation by the UK Government and who may therefore elect where to self-isolate (as per their Passenger Locator Form). Travellers from locations where the UK Government has mandated occupation of specific self-isolation accommodation (for example, Mandated Quarantine for Red List countries) should refer to Para n.</p>

<p>1). <strong>Self-isolation period completed at boarding school for the child(ren) and the parent returns overseas immediately.</strong> Any additional costs incurred for the boarding element of school fees for a mandatory self-isolation period prior to the start of term, which are proportionate to regular boarding fees and charged to all parents for self-isolation, will be refunded in full. For claimants of Continuity of Education Allowance (<abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>), additional costs are to be claimed using a manual <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claim form clearly identified as <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Additional Costs. Defence Business Services (<abbr title="Defence Business Services">DBS</abbr>) will process claims allowing <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> to be reimbursed above normal <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> ceilings. <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants should ensure that they have all the appropriate receipts, invoices and associated correspondence when submitting claims for additional costs. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys will be permitted (JSP 752 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are not permitted unless they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<p>2). <strong>Self-isolation carried out at the home of a nominated Guardian.</strong> Where possible we would expect it to be just the child(ren) who self-isolates at the home of the nominated Guardian and the parent would be able to return overseas immediately. Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">[footnote 6]</a></sup> is not normally payable under these circumstances but, exceptionally, under the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions it may be claimed for each day when the child is self-isolating with the Guardian and the parent is not present. Where it is necessary for the parent to remain with the child(ren) at the home of the Guardian for all or part of the mandatory self-isolation period, then <abbr title="Private Arrangements Rate">PAR</abbr> may be claimed. Only one <abbr title="Private Arrangements Rate">PAR</abbr> claim is permissible per night per family and Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians) is not payable on nights when <abbr title="Private Arrangements Rate">PAR</abbr> is claimed. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys will be permitted for: the parent to transport the child to the home of the guardian, to take the child to the school (conducted by either the parent or the guardian), and for the parent to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<p>3). <strong>Parent and child(ren) self-isolate in Service welfare housing.</strong> The availability of this type of accommodation should be checked with the Welfare team by the Chain of Command. There will not be a second accommodation charge made to the individual Service person for this accommodation. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys may be claimed: from the point of arrival in the UK to the welfare accommodation, from the welfare accommodation to the school (twice, on pick up and drop off) and for the parent(s) to return to the point of departure from the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0122 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted when they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations. No subsistence allowance is authorised.</p>

<p>4). <strong>Parent and child(ren) self-isolate with friends or family.</strong> Subsistence at the Private Arrangements Rate (<abbr title="Private Arrangements Rate">PAR</abbr>) may be claimed for the mandatory self-isolation period only. Only one <abbr title="Private Arrangements Rate">PAR</abbr> claim is permissible per night per family. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the home of the friend/family member, to take the child(ren) to the school (conducted by either the parent or the guardian), and for the parent to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 para 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted where they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<p>5). <strong>If none of the above options are available or the family’s specific welfare needs as determined by Service welfare authorities dictate, then the parent and child(ren) may stay in a Serviced Apartment (or hotel if no Serviced Apartments are available) for the duration of the mandatory self-isolation period.</strong> A Serviced Apartment can be booked by emailing a completed form (see attachment to this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr>) to Global Business Travel (<abbr title="Global Business Travel">GBT</abbr>). Costs will be met by MOD and the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> will not be required to pay and claim3. Since the Serviced Apartments have self-catering facilities, no subsistence allowance is payable. (If there are no Serviced Apartments available within reasonable travelling distance of the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr>’s preferred location, hotel accommodation may be substituted and actual subsistence costs (up to £25 per day, for one parent and each child) may be claimed4 for the mandatory self-isolation period only. Terminal travel costs up to the cost of MMA for the journeys is also permitted for: the parent to transport the child(ren) to the hotel; to take the child(ren) to the school and for the parent to return to the point of departure in the UK (JSP 752 10.0211 b.(3)). Hire car costs are only permitted where they fall within the total terminal travel costs claim which must not exceed the cost of MMA for the journey. This is in accordance with current regulations.</p>

<h3>e. What if a Service person (<abbr title="service person">SP</abbr>) decides that their child should not travel to the overseas area on a <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> (through personal choice rather than because of <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions) and wishes to arrange a reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> instead?</h3>

<p>The regulations at JSP 752 (para 10.0228) already allow for a reverse visit for one parent for reasons of child welfare. This is in addition to the reverse visit already allowed for welfare reasons which may already have been taken or which may be required later in the academic year. In line with regulations (JSP 752 para 10.0221) no subsistence is authorised.</p>

<h3>f. What if a Service person (<abbr title="service person">SP</abbr>) and/or their spouse has been evacuated to UK from the overseas assignment area, or is unable to return to the overseas assignment area due to <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>. Can a <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> within the UK be permitted in lieu of the <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> to the overseas area? Yes, the regulations at JSP 752 (para 10.0211) should be followed to arrange travel within the UK to or from the child(ren)s school to the accommodation that the parent(s) will be occupying in the UK during the <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr>. In line with regulations (JSP 752 para 10.0221) no subsistence is authorised.</h3>

<h3>g. What if a <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> has already booked a <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> flight for a child to the overseas area but the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> situation changes and they need to cancel the flight because of official advice? If it is necessary to change travel plans because of official advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk">UK Government</a>, advice from the child(ren)’s school or from their local Commanding Officer or the Government of the country to which they are assigned, then flights can be cancelled. The costs of the cancelled flight will be met by the MOD. The <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> can then be re-arranged for a later date or a reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> can be authorised instead.</h3>

<h3>h. What if a <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> has already booked a <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> flight for a child to the overseas area but due to the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> situation they would prefer to cancel the <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr>?</h3>

<p>In this scenario, where the decision was based on preference rather than any official advice, parents could decide to cancel the <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> flights and MOD would meet the cost of the cancelled flights. However, this would count as one of the child’s SCVs.</p>

<h3>i. What if a child travels to the overseas area on a <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> but cannot return following the school holiday because of official travel advice, school closure or a mandatory self-isolation period has been imposed?</h3>

<p>In this scenario, parents could decide to cancel the flight back to the UK and re-arrange for a later date once the school re-opens or travel advice changes. Any cost incurred in the cancellation and re-booking would be met by the MOD.</p>

<h3>j. What if a parent travels to the UK on a reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> but cannot return to the overseas area following the school holiday because of official travel advice or a mandatory self-isolation period has been imposed?</h3>

<p>In this scenario, parents would be permitted to cancel the flight back to the overseas area and re-arrange for a later date once the official advice permitted travel. Any cost incurred in the cancellation and re-booking would be met by the MOD. There is no entitlement to subsistence or hotel costs during reverse SCVs (but see provisions at para c. above for subsistence during a mandatory self-isolation period on arrival in UK). Any questions from displaced families should be directed through Chain of Command who will provide advice on assistance in these circumstances.</p>

<h3>k. What if a reverse <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> to the UK has been booked but a change to the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> situation in UK means that the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> would prefer their child to travel to the overseas assignment area?</h3>

<p>If it is necessary to change travel plans because of advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk">UK Government</a>, advice from the children’s school or from their local Commanding Officer or the Government of the country to which they are assigned, then flights can be cancelled and the costs of the cancelled flight will be met by the MOD. If appropriate, a <abbr title="School Children’s Visit">SCV</abbr> could then be arranged for the child instead.</p>

<h3>l. What if a child cannot travel to the overseas assignment area due to official travel advice and the parent cannot travel to the UK due to official travel advice?</h3>

<p>The cost of return travel from the child’s school to a Guardian’s address <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> in the UK may be claimed (JSP 752 para 10.0211) less the normal parental contribution. Continuity of Education Allowance (Guardians) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> is not normally payable under these circumstances but, exceptionally, under the <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions it may be claimed for each day when the child is with the Guardian and the parent is not present.</p>

<h3>m. What if a child is prevented from travelling to join their parents by governmental travel directive or the imposition of an isolation period. They are unable to join a designated Guardian for valid reasons (for example, the Guardian is self-isolating) and continue to be accommodated at their school.</h3>

<p>In this case, where the child remains at the school out with the normal academic term times, <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants will be entitled to reclaim any additional fees providing they are proportionate to the routine boarding element of the school fees.</p>

<h3>n. If I am travelling from a country where the UK Government has mandated occupation of specific self-isolation accommodation (e.g. Managed Quarantine for Red List countries) can I claim the costs?</h3>

<p>Yes, subject to Budget Holder approval, you may claim the cost of any essential mandatory accommodation you, or any immediate family member, have to occupy on arrival in the UK. Please refer to the <a href="https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/defnet/HOCS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE4512C00-58D6-4D90-A157-A6C63ABA99BA%7D&amp;file=20210216-DAN18_Border_Measures_v6.2-OS.docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true" rel="external" class="govuk-link">MODs guidance in Defence note 18 - <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Health Measures at the Border and effects on delivering Defence tasks</a> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.

Ideally any mandatory quarantine and testing package will be booked by the Unit Travel cell alongside other travel arrangements but if this option is not available, then costs may be claimed under night subsistence. Where the accommodation package includes 3 meals per day, then no additional subsistence costs may be claimed.</p>

<h3>o. If the UK Government mandates a <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test(s) be carried out prior to, or following, arrival in the UK, and there is a cost, can I re-claim that cost? Yes, any essential costs incurred (for the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> and immediate family) can be claimed through JPA in accordance with JSP 752 Annex A to Section 1 of Chapter 17. Claims should be made against your UIN under a Miscellaneous Expenses Claim and then select ‘Medical, Dental, Opticians, Prescription Fees’ as the Expense Type. You should record ‘<abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> Test’ in the justification box.

<h3>p. If the Government of the country to which I am assigned mandates the occupation of specific self-isolation accommodation that is not my Service provided accommodation, and there is a cost, can I re-claim that cost?</h3>

<p>Yes, subject to Budget Holder Approval, you may claim the cost of any essential mandatory accommodation you, and any immediate family member, have to occupy on return to the country to which you are assigned. This should be claimed under duty travel subsistence on JPA. If a child is required to self-isolate in accommodation that is not your Service provided accommodation, then a parent may join them in the accommodation, if necessary for welfare reasons, and the costs may also be claimed. Where the accommodation package includes 3 meals per day, then no additional subsistence costs may be claimed.</p>

<h3>q. If the Government of the country to which I am assigned, mandates a <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test(s) be carried out prior to or following re-entry, and there is a cost, can I re-claim that cost?</h3>

<p>Yes, any essential costs incurred (for the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> and immediate family) can be claimed through JPA in accordance with JSP 752 Annex A to Section 1 of Chapter 17. Claims should be made against your UIN under a Miscellaneous Expenses Claim and then select ‘Medical, Dental, Opticians, Prescription Fees’ as the Expense Type.
