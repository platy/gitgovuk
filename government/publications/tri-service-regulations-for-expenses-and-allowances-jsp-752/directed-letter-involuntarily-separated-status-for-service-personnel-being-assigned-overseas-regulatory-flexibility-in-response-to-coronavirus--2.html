<p><strong>Dated: 15 February 2021</strong></p>

<p>Originally, exceptional authority was granted on 23 Oct 20 to enable any Service
Person (<abbr title="service person">SP</abbr>) who was due to be assigned from the UK to an accompanied assignment
overseas and is either a <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant or will have children <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> accompanying them, to
serve unaccompanied. This exceptional authority to serve Involuntary Separated
(<abbr title="Involuntary Separated">INVOLSEP</abbr>) was initially granted up to the end of April 2021 with a review date of February 2021.
A review has been carried out and exceptional authority has been granted to extend the
original period from the end of Apr 21 to the end of August 2021.</p>

<p>This exceptional authority acknowledges the impact of <abbr title="Coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr> and associated
travel restrictions between the UK and overseas locations and/or the potential
imposition of mandatory periods of quarantine or isolation by either the UK government
or the governments of host nations overseas. The situation will be reviewed prior to the
end of June 2021 at which point the exceptional authority will either be extended or
withdrawn on the authority of Armed Forces Remuneration (Allowances).</p>

<p>Those that decide to take up the offer to serve unaccompanied will be entitled to
<abbr title="Involuntary Separated">INVOLSEP</abbr> rates of <abbr title="Longer Separation Allowance">LSA</abbr>, unaccompanied rates of <abbr title="Local Overseas Allowance">LOA</abbr>, <abbr title="Get You Home (Overseas)">GYH(O)</abbr> and retain eligibility for
movement of Personal Effects (<abbr title="Personal Effects">PE</abbr>) at public expense <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and the payment of Disturbance
Expense <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link">[footnote 3]</a></sup> (<abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr>) for a delayed move in accordance with JSP 752. The immediate family
will retain authority to be moved at public expense to the overseas location without the
need to submit <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr> casework.</p>

<p><abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimants must inform the Unit HR at their future overseas station that they
will be serving <abbr title="Involuntary Separated">INVOLSEP</abbr>, the Unit HR must then inform <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr> assurance
immediately for audit purposes.</p>

<p>When this exceptional authority is withdrawn, any <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> who has opted to serve
<abbr title="Involuntary Separated">INVOLSEP</abbr>, will be expected to be accompanied by their immediate family at the
earliest opportunity, but the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> will retain <abbr title="Involuntary Separated">INVOLSEP</abbr> status for 3 months from the date
of this authority being removed or until the <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> is accompanied, whichever is sooner.</p>

<p>Any <abbr title="Child Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> claimant who is not accompanied by their spouse/civil partner by the
commencement of the Spring term 22 will be considered Voluntary Separated
(<abbr title="Voluntary Separated">VOLSEP</abbr>) unless they have submitted casework to the <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr> to remain <abbr title="Involuntary Separated">INVOLSEP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Due to the vast array of overseas locations, the accommodation options and
provision for any <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> taking up this <abbr title="Involuntary Separated">INVOLSEP</abbr> status should be considered on a case
by case basis and advice sought if required. Retention of their current <abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr> will be
managed in line with JSP 464, Vol 1, Part 1, para 0725 (f). In the event that personnel
are living in Tied Ex-Officio <abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, they will be required to vacate and move to alternative
<abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, in line with JSP 464, Vol 1, Part 1, para 0725 (k), entitlement to <abbr title="Personal Effects">PE</abbr> and <abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr> is
authorised <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. Additionally a review of the accommodation requirements in the overseas
location will need to be considered as the unaccompanied <abbr title="service person">SP</abbr> may no longer have
entitlement to <abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr> whilst concurrently retaining <abbr title="Service Families Accommodation">SFA</abbr> in the UK.</p>

<p>Service personnel who have already claimed <abbr title="Disturbance Expense">DE</abbr> for the overseas move into public
accommodation <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup> may retain eligibility as long as the immediate family joins the Service
person at the duty station within the timeframe stipulated within this <abbr title="Directed Letter">DL</abbr>.</p>

<p>This exceptional authority is not automatically available to those already assigned
overseas and accompanied by their spouse/civil partner as different packages are
already in place to support them. Any retrospective requests to serve unaccompanied
should be staffed through Unit HR to the <abbr title="Pay and Allowances Casework and Complaints Cell">PACCC</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6">[footnote 6]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Single Service enquiries should be directed initially to Unit HR staffs who, if
necessary, should seek further guidance from their single Service allowance policy staff.</p>
