<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, and is not a substitute for independent legal advice. Neither Her Majestyâs Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage, or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information. The information contained in this guide is general and factual. You should contact local lawyers for independent legal advice</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you, but they cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer.</p>

<p>Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">support for British nationals abroad</a>.</p>

<p>This detention information pack is designed to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Argentina and who can help. A printed copy is provided to those in prison or in custody, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/emergency-help-for-british-nationals-argentina">an online version is available at GOV.UK</a>. We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h2>Contacting us</h2>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British Consulate (and must do so if you want them to)</li>
  <li>even if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself, and should do so, particularly if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</li>
  <li>friends or family can also contact the local British Consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 1500</li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British Consulate even if you donât want anyone to know that you have been arrested.  This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British Government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>

<p>Consular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London, and in British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates overseas.</p>

<p>You can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office on 0207 008 1500.</p>

<h2>What we can do</h2>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help. Once notified of your arrest or detention, consular staff will aim to contact you as soon as possible so that we can assess how we can help you.</p>

<p>We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions: our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>In Argentina, notification by the authorities to the Consulate normally takes place within 24 hours of arrest. Once we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a list of local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/argentina-list-of-lawyers/argentina-lawyers">English-speaking lawyers and interpreters</a>
</li>
  <li>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system (including if legal aid is available)</li>
  <li>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services</li>
  <li>keep in regular contact with you, either by visiting or by telephone/letter. The frequency of contact will depend on local conditions and your personal circumstances</li>
  <li>tell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including medication.</li>
  <li>put you, or your family, in touch with a prisonersâ welfare charity called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>in some circumstances we may be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards</li>
  <li>help to transfer money to you from your friends or family.  In places where phone or postal services arenât available, we can also pass on messages and deliver letters to the prison (but generally we cannot arrange for delivery directly to you).</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we canât do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>get you out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>help you get special treatment</li>
  <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>pay for any costs as a result of being arrested</li>
  <li>forward you packages sent by friends or family</li>
  <li>prevent authorities from deporting you after release</li>
</ul>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<h3>Telling family or friends</h3>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and can provide them with information about how to contact you in prison or detention.  With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your well-being.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider the impact that not doing so might have.  For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h3>Informing the UK police</h3>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police.  It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances in which information about you may need to be shared by ourselves or authorities in Argentina.</p>

<h3>Lawyers</h3>
<p>Although we cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime, we can offer basic information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available.</p>

<p>We can give you a list of local interpreters and a list of local English-speaking lawyers is attached to this pack. You will want to consider the benefits of local legal representation and to discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. In no circumstances can we pay your legal or interpretation costs.</p>

<h3>Can you get me out?</h3>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for you because you are British.  However if you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards we will consider whether to approach local authorities.</p>

<p>This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for fair trial or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h3>Other forms of assistance</h3>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families:</p>

<h2>Detention conditions in Argentina</h2>

<h3>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<p>We advise family members to contact us well in advance so that we can inform the prison administration and work on the visiting programme.</p>

<p>In order to receive visitors you should provide the prison with the names of the people visiting you for them to be added to the Prison Visiting list.</p>

<p>We will provide information on visiting procedures and details of what visitors can bring should family members decide to come to Argentina.</p>

<p>Only family members can visit you; friends are not allowed.</p>

<p>Internal regulations will establish the frequency and duration of ordinary visits, based on your behaviour, according to the prisonâs security level and the spaces available for this purpose.</p>

<p>If you have been penalised with a prohibition order that keeps you from receiving visitors or with permanent or non-permanent loss of individual quarters, you are entitled to a single two- hour visit from a next of kin who you will nominate upon being notified of your penalty.</p>

<p>Assistance visits may also be requested through health professionals and members or representatives of your religion, also diplomatic visitors and international institutions. For security reasons those persons will be checked as well as their belongings.</p>

<p>Those prisoners whose relatives or next of kin live in distant places, for example more than 100 km away from the prison, or if the prison is more than 300 km away from the place of residence of a husband, children, parents, brothers/sisters or partner with visiting rights, the Special Visit regime will apply.</p>

<p>If granted, you may be visited up to 5 consecutive days per month, for up to 3 hours each day. Consular staff can help your family to arrange this although these extra days are given by the prison administration, the decision is discretionary.</p>

<h3>What can visitors bring?</h3>

<p>Argentina has a large number of prison facilities and regulations about permitted items vary from one prison to another and the rules are frequently changed. Therefore, families should contact the FCDO in advance of their visit so we can provide them with an updated list.</p>

<h3>Visits: consular staff</h3>

<p>We aim to visit you every four months before you are sentenced, and every six months after trial. During our routine visits you will have the opportunity to discuss any health issues, security concerns, your treatment in prison and any other general issues that you wish to raise with our Consular staff.</p>

<p>At each Consular visit, our staff will complete a âVisit Report Formâ. If there is any information that you would prefer not to disclose to a Next of Kin you should let us know during the visit.</p>

<h3>Emergency trips outside of prison</h3>

<p>Health care teams in prison provide some aspects of health care on site. When the health care teams in prison are unable to provide the assistance required, they can arrange outpatient consultations with specialists and emergency admissions in public hospitals for critical emergencies.</p>

<p>It is possible to make a trip outside of prison if an urgent situation arises (eg. funerals and critical illness of a next-of-kin). You should contact your lawyer/public defender in order to submit this request to the authorities, who will assess each request on its merits.</p>

<h2>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h2>

<h3>Arrival at the police station and basic rights</h3>

<p>When arrested you should be read all your rights and be informed that you may choose to remain silent (apart from giving your name and address) until you have spoken to your legal representative, after which the judge will take your declaration (you will probably be taken to Court for this).</p>

<p>You have the right to be assisted by an official translator for free. You can expect to spend at least 2 days at the Police Station once arrested, before being transferred to a prison.</p>

<p>As a detainee, you have the right to ask for your diplomatic representative. The Embassy cannot become involved in the legal aspect of your incarceration and cannot assume the role of a legal advisor. This task is reserved for your lawyer. Should you not wish legal representation the choice and consequences are solely yours.</p>

<h3>Appearance at court</h3>

<p>The courts will inform you, your lawyer/public defender and the prison authorities of your charges. For drug trafficking offences you will be prosecuted by the prosecutorâs office. There will be three stages to your case:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Preliminary search</h3>

<p>Your case is handled by a Judge (âJuzgado Penal EconÃ³mico Federalâ or âJuzgado Criminal y Correccionalâ depending on the case). You are entitled to the assistance of a legal advisor from the time of arrest. A public defender (at no cost to yourself) is appointed by the Argentine State unless you wish to appoint your own private lawyer. In most cases you will have a different public defender for each stage of the process.</p>

<p>This first stage is handled by the first Public Defender (âDefensor de InstrucciÃ³nâ).</p>

<h3>Important:</h3>

<p>Private lawyers are very expensive and cannot guarantee your release, but you are free to investigate this option. In the case of a private lawyer, you will have to cover all legal costs. The Embassy cannot help you with this.</p>

<p>If you wish to transfer funds from the United Kingdom to Argentina in order to cover legal costs, this transaction is to be processed through your commercial bank in the UK to the legal representatives.</p>

<p>You can be taken to court to be questioned several times during the 6-8 months (could be less or more in some cases) before the trial commences.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Oral period trial</h3>
<p>Your case is handled by an Oral Tribunal (âTribunal Oralâ). Once all the preliminary procedures are completed at the Judgeâs office (âJuzgado Penal EconÃ³micoâ) the case is forwarded to an Oral Tribunal. When the case âphysicallyâ leaves the Judgeâs office, a Tribunal is allocated by means of a draw.</p>

<p>Your case will pass to that specific Oral Tribunal which will attend to your case. A date of trial will be set and a formal notification of the date of trial will be sent to you.</p>

<p>In a shortened law suit (âjuicio abreviadoâ), the average sentence for drug trafficking is usually 4 to 5 years. This means that you understand and accept willingly and under no pressure all the charges against you, declaring yourself guilty. If this is the case, you would not face an oral trial.</p>

<p>If you wish to stand for the long oral hearing (âjuicio oralâ) declaring yourself innocent, the sentence can be longer if you are found guilty. The sentence you receive starts counting from the moment you are detained for the first time.</p>

<p>If you are being assisted by a public defender you will probably get a new one at this stage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Execution of sentence</h3>

<p>Once you have been sentenced, your case will pass to a third judge. Your case will now be handled by the Executive Court (âJuzgado de EjecuciÃ³nâ). If you are being assisted by a public defender you will probably get a new one at this stage. This stage covers the serving of your sentence.</p>

<p>The Embassy cannot interfere with the Argentine judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged quickly, ask the authorities to waive any penalties, give or pay for legal advice, start legal proceedings on your behalf, investigate a crime or prevent the local authorities from deporting you at the end of your sentence, even if you were previously resident in the country.</p>

<p>Neither can we collect your belongings and/or monies, which might have been confiscated at the time of detention.</p>

<h3>Initial arrival at the prison</h3>

<p>After the judge passes the imprisonment or preventive custody sentence, you will be taken to a prison service facility. On arrival, the Prisoner Reception Centre will check your personal data and the judgeâs detention order. A new fingerprint card will be produced to certify your identity. You are likely to have your photo taken as well. All these documents will become your personal file.</p>

<p>When you first arrive, the authorities will take your money, and personal belongings that you are not allowed keeping for security reasons, for which you will be given a receipt. Keep the receipt in order for you to collect all your belongings once you leave prison.</p>

<p>You will be frisked on arrival to prevent any unauthorised substances or items from entering the facility. The storage of any belongings that are not part of the investigation, process, or evidence will need to be arranged privately.</p>

<p>The British Embassy cannot store your personal belongings on your behalf. The only property we can keep for you are your passport and driverâs license. However, these are usually retained at the courts until the end of your sentence.</p>

<p>Please note that your passport might be kept by the courts as evidence of the alleged crime or as a condition for your bail/parole. This measure is taken by the courts to prevent you from skipping bail.</p>

<p>A doctor will examine you to assess your general health and prescribe treatment, if needed. This will be the first entry on your medical record, where all medical appointments will be recorded. All of this will be reported to the judge in charge of your case.</p>

<p>Medical checks will be carried out by the prison health department in order to assess if you need any treatment for ongoing medical conditions (e.g. blood pressure, diabetes, HIV).</p>

<p>On arrival, you have the right to make a telephone call to a relative or next of kin to communicate your detention. You will be handed a brochure with the address of the facility, which you may give to your family. You may use the public telephones available at the compound within the established hours. Public telephones operate with cards, but you may also make a collect call (dial *19) which can be paid by the person receiving the call.</p>

<p>Another option is to send a letter by post, prepaying the stamp fee.The letter will be posted by the relevant prison office. It is important that on the back of the envelope you write your name and the address of the compound, to ensure that the letter is sent back to you if the recipient is not found.</p>

<p>If, for any reason, you cannot contact your family, you may ask the Social Security Section or Division of your compound for help. We can always contact your family or friends on your behalf with your express consent.</p>

<h2>Prison: conditions and daily life</h2>

<p>Overcrowding is a problem in most Argentine prisons so you cannot expect a single cell as a matter of course. For this reason, a request to be moved from one prison to another cannot always be granted. You should raise this issue with your lawyer.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Very few prisons in Argentina offer a special Module for foreigners, which are sometimes divided into different pavilions.</p>

<p>You are allowed to wear your own clothes with the exception of some colours like light blue, grey or black and you cannot wear hard shoes or boots (in the case of ladies, sleeve-less shirts or mini- skirts).</p>

<h3>Food and diet</h3>
<p>Prison management will be responsible for providing food. Special meals will be based on the individualâs health and dietary requirements. The prison authorities have assured us that the food they provide is a balanced diet supplying the necessary nutritional requirements.</p>

<p>You can supplement your diet by buying fruit and other food items from the prison canteen when available. Drinking water is available.</p>

<h3>Hygiene</h3>
<p>Personal hygiene is an imperative. Most Argentine prisons will provide basic toiletries and linen. Other items can be purchased directly from the prison canteen. Supply varies from one prison to another. If you need something in particular, ask whether your family can provide it. You are responsible for keeping your living quarters clean.</p>

<h3>Work and study</h3>
<p>You will be encouraged to acquire and improve your working habits and qualifications for your future life outside prison through activities suited to your intellectual and physical abilities. Depending on your behaviour you will be allowed to work and earn some money.</p>

<p>Paid work is one of the rights and duties of a convicted prisoner and a right while you are awaiting a final sentence. If you work you still have to co-operate in general maintenance activities. You may use up to 30% of your monthly salary to buy authorised personal items, provided you have shown good behaviour.</p>

<p>The full amount earned for your work, after statutory deductions, will constitute a reserve fund that will be given to you upon release. The salary you earn as a detainee shall not be less than 75% of the statutory minimum wage.</p>

<p>If you have not been sentenced yet, you may use up to 80% of your salary and the remaining 20% will be kept as a reserve fund which will be given to you on release without a final conviction.</p>

<p>The working system varies from one prison to another depending on their possibilities/financial situation. According to available information, there are more work possibilities at the Colonias Penales in the interior of the country than in the prisons located in Buenos Aires and surrounding areas.</p>

<p>There is education available for illiterate prisoners or for those who have not reached the minimum level of education established by law. You will also be encouraged to access other levels of education offered by the prisonâs Education Division.</p>

<p>You will be awarded the relevant certificates and diplomas issued by official authorities, without any mention of the place where they were obtained. These certificates will enable you to continue your studies when you are released.</p>

<p>You may also participate in recreational programmes, including sports, mainly team sports, and cultural activities. If you do not have the intellectual skills or physical conditions required, you may be exempted from participation in these activities.</p>

<p>In the library, you will find the necessary material for training and recreation.</p>

<h3>Contact and languages</h3>
<p>Depending on the prison (this only tends to happen in some of the prisons in Buenos Aires) you are likely to be put in a cell with other English-speaking inmates. The guards do not usually speak English. Also depending on the prison, you might have access to Spanish lessons.</p>

<p>Prisons often have a library with books available for inmates; you can also be part of recreational and cultural activities. Also, you will have access to radio broadcasts and TV shows, in compliance with the activitiesâ schedule. Depending on the prison, you can have your own small TV set/radio. You can also have your own books to read.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Prisoners are permitted to go outdoors a certain number of hours a day/week. This will depend on the facilities of each prison. Some prisons have a gym.</p>

<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>The climate in Argentina is very varied and you can find different climates depending on the location. Buenos Aires is hot and humid in the summer and moderately cold in winter.</p>

<p>The northern area of the country can be extremely hot in the summer and moderately cold and dry in winter, whereas the South can be extremely cold in winter and moderately hot in summer.</p>

<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Prisoners are entitled to visits from their local/home clergy or Minister (e.g. Priest; Imam; Rabbi or equivalent).</p>

<h3>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h3>
<p>It is widely known that drug trafficking between inmates in prisons is widespread. If you are caught with any kind of illegal drugs (marijuana, cocaine, etc) you will be punished accordingly. As a result you may lose your job or school place and might be sent to confinement for a period.</p>

<p>Tobacco cigarettes are allowed inside prisons.</p>

<h2>Prison: access to help and services</h2>

<h3>How to receive money</h3>

<p>There are two ways in which you can receive financial assistance while in prison.</p>

<ul>
  <li>private funds: diposited for you by your family or friends. Please contact us for instructions on how to send funds via the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;  Development Office</li>
  <li>Prisoners Abroad (UK Charity): If your family canât support you financially Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials</li>
</ul>

<p>Money received from the UK will be converted into local currency. Consular staff will either make a deposit at the prisonâs front desk (depending on our availability and distance from the prison). Alternatively we will transfer your funds to the prison as a Postal Mandate via Correo Argentino.</p>

<p>Money sent to you will be deposited in your prison account. Please note that consular staff cannot be responsible for the loss of funds by the Prison Authorities.</p>

<p>If you are to work in the prison (this will depend on the prison - normally a Colonia Penal in the interior of the country offers more possibilities than a prison in the city of Buenos Aires) and are to receive a âPeculioâ (small payment) as compensation, you will need to have a CUIL number (tax number).</p>

<p>A proof of identity will be required by the authorities to issue you with one. Ask your lawyer, he may have access to your passport which should be at the Court.</p>

<p>The British Government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.</p>

<h3>How to receive medical and dental treatment</h3>

<p>While you are in detention, Argentina is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met.
Any prescribed diagnostic studies, medical treatment and medication will be supplied to you at no cost. You may also seek private health care, at your own cost.</p>

<p>If you need medical or dental treatment you should make an appointment to see the prison doctor or dentist. In some large prisons it can be difficult to get an early appointment but if the situation is urgent you should contact the prison social worker, who may be able to get you an appointment more quickly than through the normal channels.</p>

<p>Prison doctors are often the equivalent of GPs in the UK, so unusual or complex problems may be referred to a specialist outside the prison.</p>

<p>All medical attention to detainees is provided by the Argentine equivalent of the UK National Health Service (NHS). As the system is relatively overwhelmed people can wait up to 2 months for a doctorâs appointment.</p>

<p>The transfer to a medical appointment outside prison will be handled by the prison authorities. There have been cases in the past were transfers were not available and appointments with doctors where missed.</p>

<p>If required, we can help you bring any health problems you may be experiencing to the attention of the prison doctors. Also, with your consent we may be able to liaise with your GP in the UK if the prison doctors request your medical records and if this is in your best interest. However, for data protection reasons, the GP may be limited as to what information can be released.</p>

<h3>Mail/ parcels</h3>
<p>There is usually no limit to the number of letters you may send (if you have paid the postage fee) or receive. Please be aware that the prison authorities might read your letters before sending to the recipient.</p>

<p>In some prisons it is easier to receive mail than to send it. You can hand your mail to a Consular Officer during a consular visit as long as the contents are checked with you first, and the proper postal fee is already paid.</p>

<p>Please be aware that the Embassy will not forward letters from prisoners by post.</p>

<p>You can receive parcels from your family. Please be aware that parcels should be sent directly to the prison; parcels sent to the Embassy will not be forwarded to you. Parcels must have the name and details of the sender and the sender must be registered on the visitors list (Hall de Visita); otherwise the parcel will be refused.</p>

<h3>Making telephone calls</h3>
<p>According to Argentine law, prisoners have the right to make phone calls. You can call anybody on the outside using a prison phone. Each prison facility has their own rules around the use of prison landlines. You may be required to purchase telephone cards to make calls. Mobile phones are strictly prohibited in Argentine prisons.</p>

<h3>Complaints about mistreatment</h3>
<p>If you have been mistreated, please inform Consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and inform you of any local complaints procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider.</p>

<p>With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally-accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, please try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible photos of the injuries you received.</p>

<p>You should also alert your lawyer if you would like to take legal action. The PROCUVIN (ProcadurÃ­a de Violencia Institucional) is the government department that will take your formal complaint forward.</p>

<h2>The Argentine judicial system</h2>

<p>The judicial system in Argentina is divided into two: Federal Courts and Provincial Courts also known as Ordinary Judicial Courts. Each system has lower courts, courts of appeal and supreme courts.</p>

<p>Most criminal offences in Argentina will be handled by the Provincial Courts (such us robberies, murders, sexual assaults, etc.) Ordinarily, there are up to 25 different judicial jurisdictions, depending on the location in country where the crime was committed and on the nature of the offences committed.</p>

<p>Because legal processes may differ from province to province we suggest that you consult with a professional legal adviser about the processes in place in the province where your case is being dealt with.</p>

<p>Offences such as drug trafficking, human trafficking and document fraud will be handled by the Federal Courts.
The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>

<p>The Embassy cannot become involved in the legal aspect of your incarceration and cannot assume the role of a legal advisor. This task is reserved for your lawyer. Should you choose not to appoint a private lawyer, the authorities will randomly appoint a state lawyer â also known as Public Defender- for you. A list of private English-speaking lawyers is provided at the end of this pack.</p>

<h3>After an arrest</h3>
<p>Police officers will read aloud the police caution (your rights) and only question you to establish your identity. Under no circumstances, a police officer can question the arrested person about the events of their suspected involvement in a criminal offence.</p>

<p>You will be informed in writing of the reason for the arrest, the location you will be transferred to and the details of the Court that will intervene in your case. You will be expected to sign this document as a way of acknowledging the information given.</p>

<p>In most cases, the Embassy will be informed of your detention once you have arrived at Court where the judge will take your initial statement. However, prosecutors should communicate to the arrested person about their right to contact the Embassy to inform where they are and why they are there. It is also your right to tell the police that you wish to contact the Embassy.</p>

<p>We aim to contact you within the first 24 hours of being notified of your detention, and to visit  you as soon as possible after that. How soon we visit will depend on your location and the prisonâs procedures.</p>

<p>Translation services may not be available immediately whilst in police custody. A consular officer may be required to assist (usually over the phone) to explain to you the circumstances of your arrest. However, should you have any questions concerning the legal aspects of your arrest, you must contact your lawyer.</p>

<h3>Custody</h3>

<p>You should expect to be taken to the Court to give your statement within 24 hours of your arrest. In some cases, it can be up to 48 hours. Normally the judge will hear the accused and the witnesses. If you are still in detention after 48 hours and the hearing has not taken place, you should contact your public defender/lawyer immediately if you have not yet done so.</p>

<p>For all federal offences, the Judge has 10 working days after the hearing to decide if the charges against you will be formalised and either order your immediate imprisonment or release you on bail. The judge may also decide not to charge you and release you immediately, but the prosecutor may continue with the investigation and eventually present further evidence to the judge and request that you are formally charged and, in some cases, imprisoned.</p>

<p>If the judge believes that there are enough reasons to believe you may flee justice or obstruct the investigation, you will be transferred to a prison facility and will remain in custody whilst you wait for the judgeâs decision on charges. In some cases, this may not always be possible, and you may remain in police custody at a police station instead.</p>

<p>You should ask your lawyer about the possibility of requesting your release while the legal process is in progress, but note that this may not always be granted. According to local law, after being charged you could spend up to two years in prison without a conviction (waiting for trial). There are some exceptions to this, so we suggest you ask your lawyer.</p>

<p>The time spent in prison prior to your sentence will count as part of the total sentence to be served.</p>

<h3>What happens when I am charged?</h3>

<p>The courts will inform you, your lawyer/public defender and the prison authorities of your charges.</p>

<p>For drug trafficking offences you will be prosecuted by the prosecutorâs office. There will be three stages to your case:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Preliminary search (âEtapa de InstrucciÃ³nâ)</h3>

<p>Your case is handled by a Judge (âJuzgado Penal EconÃ³mico Federalâ or âJuzgado Criminal y Correccionalâ depending on the case). In this initial stage of the process, the evidence is gathered and presented both by the defendant and the prosecutor. This stage is complete when the judge decides there are enough elements to confirm the charges and will pass on  the case to the Tribunal for trial.</p>

<p>In most jurisdictions, the judge delegates the responsibility of investigating and accusing the suspect to the prosecutor, whilst the judge only oversees the proceeding to ensure it is carried out correctly. In fewer jurisdictions, the first instance judge holds this responsibility.</p>

<p>You are entitled to the assistance of a legal advisor from the time of arrest. If you decide not to appoint a private lawyer, a public defender (at no cost to yourself) will be appointed by the Argentine tate. You will have a different public defender for each stage of the process.</p>

<p>This first stage is handled by the first Public Defender (âDefensor de InstrucciÃ³nâ).</p>

<h3>Important</h3>
<p>Private lawyers can be very expensive and cannot guarantee your release, but you are free to investigate this option. In the case of a private lawyer, you will have to cover all legal costs. The Embassy cannot help you with this. If you wish to transfer funds from the UK to Argentina in order to cover legal costs, this transaction is to be processed through your commercial bank in the UK to the legal representatives.</p>

<p>You can be taken to court to be questioned several times during the following 6-8 months before the trial commences (could be less or more in some cases).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Oral period trial (âJuicio Oralâ)</h3>
<p>Your case is handled by an Oral Tribunal (âTribunal Oralâ). Once all the preliminary procedures are completed at the Judgeâs office (âJuzgado Penal EconÃ³micoâ) the case is forwarded to an Oral Tribunal. When the case âphysicallyâ leaves the Judgeâs office, a Tribunal is allocated by means of a draw.</p>

<p>Your case will pass to that specific Oral Tribunal which will attend to your case. A date of trial will be set and a formal notification of the date of trial will be sent to you.</p>

<p>In a shortened law suit (âjuicio abreviadoâ), the average sentence for drug trafficking is usually 4 to 5 years. This means that you understand and accept willingly and under no pressure all the charges against you, pleading guilty. If this is the case, you will not face an oral trial.</p>

<p>If you wish to stand for the long oral hearing (âjuicio oralâ) declaring yourself innocent, and you are found guilty, you may be convicted to a longer imprisonment. . The time you have been remanded in custody already, will count as time served.</p>

<p>If you are being assisted by a public defender you will probably get a new one at this stage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Execution of sentence (âEjecuciÃ³n Penalâ)</h3>
<p>Once you have been sentenced, your case will pass to a third (and last) judge. Your case will now be handled by the Executive Court (âJuzgado de EjecuciÃ³nâ). This judge plays an important role in ensuring your rights are not violated during your serving.</p>

<p>If you are being assisted by a public defender you will probably get a new one at this stage. This stage covers the entire serving of your sentence.</p>

<h3>Provisions for bail</h3>

<p>When taking your initial statement (âetapa de instrucciÃ³nâ), the judge can decide to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>formally charge you and order your imprisonment</li>
  <li>formally charge you and release you on bail whilst you wait for trial</li>
  <li>not to charge you and release you. The prosecutor may continue with the investigation and eventually present further evidence to the judge and request you are formally charged and, in some cases, imprisoned</li>
</ul>

<p>A. If you have been charged, but released on bail whilst you wait for trial, the judge will impose several conditions to your release, including a âcauciÃ³nâ. There are different types of âcaucionesâ and the judge will have to ensure the one applied to you is feasible for you to comply with:A sole statutory declaration where you make a promise that you will faithfully comply with the conditions imposed by the judge during your bail, called âCauciÃ³n Juratoriaâ</p>

<p>B. An economic fine that you would only have to pay if you donât comply with the conditions of release imposed by the judge. In order for this to work, you will be required to present one or more solidary guarantors. This is called âCauciÃ³n Personalâ.</p>

<p>C. An economic fine that you will have to pay in advance, or mortgage a property up to a certain value fixed by the judge, as a way to secure payment if you donât comply with the conditions of release. This is called âCauciÃ³n Realâ.</p>

<p>The FCDO is not able to facilitate the transfer of bail funds.</p>

<h2>Trial and legal assistance</h2>

<h3>How to access legal assistance</h3>

<p>You are entitled to the assistance of a legal advisor from the time of arrest. A public defender (at no cost to yourself) is appointed by the Argentine State unless you wish to appoint your own private lawyer. If you wish to hire a private lawyer, a list of English-speaking lawyers is provided at the end of this pack. Prisoners Abroad can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>Please note that private lawyers can be very expensive and cannot guarantee your release, but you are free to investigate this option. Neither the Embassy nor the British government will bear the expense of your private lawyer.</p>

<p>If you wish to transfer funds from the United Kingdom to Argentina in order to cover legal costs, this transaction is to be processed through your commercial bank in the UK to the legal representatives.</p>

<p>The Embassy cannot help you with this, but a list of English-speaking lawyers will be given to you by a Consular officer.</p>

<h3>At the trial</h3>

<p>Prior to trial, court hearings can take place anytime throughout the process to either question judicial impartiality, celebrate agreements with the prosecutor, admission of proof, requests of appeal, etc. It is only mandatory for you to be present in those hearings where the charges against you are read, when proof against you is presented and when you decide to give a statement.</p>

<p>On your trial day/s you will be taken to the court office where your case is being handled. There will be a Tribunal in charge along with the public prosecutor and your lawyer or public defender.</p>

<p>In the initial stages of the trial the case file is verified, and both parties (defendant and prosecutor) present the evidence they will use during the trial. The Tribunal will decide which evidence is admitted for trial and which evidence is dismissed.</p>

<p>Parties are allowed to request an additional investigation to include evidence that may have been omitted previously.</p>

<p>The debate stage begins, you will be required to give a statement and the evidence is exposed (including witness statements, statement of experts, read out of documents, etc).</p>

<p>Lastly, the closing speeches are presented and the Tribunal will resolve the case after a private and secret debate.</p>

<p>If you donât speak Spanish the court will be responsible for hiring an interpreter to assist you during the trial.</p>

<h3>Sentences</h3>

<p>The judges from the Tribunal will vote taking all the admitted evidence into account and the allegations made during the trial. They must justify their decision based on the prescribed law and jurisprudence.</p>

<p>The Tribunal can use a degree of discretion to determine a sentence, allowing them to apply a certain principle for a specific case, as opposed to other principles generally used. Sentences in Argentina differ and will depend on the seriousness of the crime.</p>

<p>The courts will inform you, your lawyer/public defender and the prison authorities of your sentence and appeal process.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>You have the right to appeal against your sentence through your lawyer or public defender. It is usual for the public defender to appeal against your first sentence; however, the appeal process is usually very slow and can sometimes lead to the appellantâs release being delayed until the appeal is decided. In such cases the lawyerâs opinion of the case is strongly recommended before proceeding.</p>

<h2>Reaching the end of your sentence</h2>

<h3>Reduction of sentence (remission)</h3>

<p>The Act 24660 regulates the âEducational stimuliâ programme which helps prisoners reduce the satisfied terms needed to access the different levels of benefits (please see the section below) whenever they reach a certain level of education. These levels may include primary, secondary, university, postgraduate degrees â among others.</p>

<p>You should consult your lawyer about the reduction offered for each educational level.</p>

<h3>Early release (parole)</h3>

<p>The âbenefitsâ system in Argentina is similar to parole in the UK. The advantage of being released on benefit is that you would be outside of the prison, for at least some of the time, until you have served the remainder of your sentence. This might seem much better than spending the rest of your sentence in prison.</p>

<p>However, while the benefits system usually works quite well for those with a Resident status, being released on benefit can be really difficult for non-resident foreigners. You should ask your lawyer about this and should you be entitled to apply, it is up to you whether you decide to do so - we canât advise you either way.</p>

<p>Prisoners can apply for four different levels of âbenefitsâ according to how much of their sentence they have served (see box below). Please note that the British Embassy cannot ask the Argentine authorities to offer you benefits. This is something that you should raise with your lawyer.</p>

<h3>The four levels of benefits</h3>

<ol>
  <li>âDestacamento de Trabajoâ (work benefit): you work outside the prison during the day and go back to the prison at night. However in some prison facilities you will be allowed to work inside the prison and earn a small income</li>
  <li>âRegimen Abierto/ Destino a Establecimiento Abiertoâ (open prison): you live in a state- run community centre. You must work nearby and comply with the rules of the centre.</li>
  <li>âConfinamientoâ (confinement): a prisoner who has served three quarters of their sentence and has a record of good conduct can live outside the prison in a determined place. You must comply with rules established by the court.</li>
  <li>âLibertad Condicionalâ (parole): this benefit is granted for the final period of the sentence. You leave the prison and are supervised by a probation officer for a period equal to the remaining sentence.</li>
</ol>

<p>Before deciding whether to apply, you should be aware that, if released on parole:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you will probably not be able to work</li>
  <li>you will not get money from Prisoners Abroad</li>
  <li>the British government will not be able to give you financial support</li>
  <li>consular staff from the British Embassy will not be able to pass on âprison comfortsâ (e.g. money that your family has sent to you)</li>
  <li>consular staff from the British Embassy will no longer be able to visit you</li>
  <li>you will not get your passport back from the Argentine authorities, so you will not be able to leave the country</li>
  <li>you might be stuck in Argentina with no source of income. You might become destitute if you are unable to support yourself</li>
  <li>you might also feel really isolated if you do not know anyone, and you might not able to communicate with people very well if you do not speak Spanish fluently</li>
  <li>Ii you do apply for benefits, and you expect to get support from family or friends, you could warn them about the extra expense and ask them to save money in advance</li>
</ul>

<p>To be entitled to these benefits, you must not have committed serious crimes such as aggravated murder, sexual abuse, torture murder, kidnapping, human trafficking, terror attacks, drug trafficking, among others</p>

<h3>Clemency or pardon</h3>

<p>There are two non-legal remedies available outside the legal system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Presidential Pardon: The presidential faculty to diminish or pardon penalties related to Federal Offences. The defendant, and/or any other interested party can request the Presidential Pardon for the defendant. It would require admission of guilt from the defendant</li>
  <li>Amnesty Law: Only available through a Law sanctioned by the Congress. It exempts those involved from criminal liability for the crimes committed</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask your lawyer for detailed information on how the political authorities in Argentina can give pardon/clemency to those found guilty of committing a crime.</p>

<h3>Financial penalties</h3>
<p>There are different types of penalties in Argentine Criminal law. Depending on the crime committed, you may be forced to face a financial penalty decided by the Judge.</p>

<h3>Transferring to another prison within Argentina</h3>
<p>If you have been tried and convicted you will probably be sent to a prison outside Buenos Aires (âColonia Penitenciariaâ) where you can expect to serve your sentence. Other transfer requests are most likely to be permitted when there are exceptional and compassionate reasons for doing so.</p>

<h3>Transferring to the UK</h3>
<p>There is no Prisoner Transfer Agreement between the UK and Argentina.</p>

<h3>Procedures for release and deportation</h3>

<p>As soon as you are convicted, the judge will notify the Immigration Authority who will automatically issue a request for your expulsion. This request can be actioned or dismissed by  the judge at any stage of your serving and it will be considered on a case-by-case basis. You must speak to your lawyer about this.</p>

<p>If you are serving a sentence for a serious offence (ie. drugs) the judge will most likely dismiss the request and expect you to serve all of your sentence, after which the Immigration Authority can action your expulsion.</p>

<p>If the Judge accepts the expulsion request whilst you are serving your sentence, Immigration will make the necessary arrangements to deport you back to the UK.</p>

<p>If you are expelled you will be sent back to your country of origin. If the UK is not your country of residence, the authorities can look at the possibility of sending you to your country of residence but this can take longer as they will require authorisation from your country of residence and this may not always be granted. Speak to your lawyer about this.</p>

<p>The criminal case against you will be closed once expelled. If you have permanent or temporary residence in Argentina it will most likely be revoked as soon as you are convicted.</p>

<p>The detaineeâs transfer from Argentina to the country of origin or residence is considered as a public burden so the airline that has regular direct flights to the country of expulsion has to cover all the costs incurred in the trip.</p>

<p>This means you will not have to pay for your departure ticket when you are expelled (unless there are no direct flights in which case you might be asked to pay for a leg of the journey). Foreigners who are expelled are subject to a ban on re- entry.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. Possibly you have never lived in the UK and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may simply want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Prisoners Abroad you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing.</p>

<p>If you know your release date in advance it is best to write and tell your caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroadâs Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

  <li>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area.</li>

<h3>Criminal record in the UK</h3>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if youâre arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>

<h2>Additional information</h2>

<h3>Prisoners Abroad</h3>

<p>Since 1978 the charity Prisoners Abroad has offered practical support and advice to British citizens imprisoned overseas. It is the only UK charity providing this service and it is available to all, whether guilty or innocent, convicted or awaiting charge or trial.</p>

<p>Prisoners Abroad is concerned with your health and welfare, both during your imprisonment and also on your return to the UK, through their resettlement service (if you have registered whilst in prison).</p>

<p>They can also provide support and advice to your family during your imprisonment. In order to access any services, prisoners must first register with Prisoners Abroad by signing and returning their authorisation form.</p>

<p>Once you seek help from Prisoners Abroad, the Prisoner &amp; Family Support Service will be your point of contact for advice and information. The type of assistance they can offer will vary from country to country, but generally they can provide you with information, in English, on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your rights as a prisoner and issues that may affect you such as health or transfer to the UK</li>
  <li>obtaining magazines, newspapers, books and the regular Prisoners Abroad newsletter</li>
  <li>learning the language of your country of imprisonment</li>
  <li>translation of documents</li>
  <li>grants for food if you are in a developing country and donât have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>grants for essential medicines and toiletries if you donât have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>preparing for release</li>
  <li>help for your loved ones, including information, family support groups and, in a few cases, assistance with the cost of visiting</li>
</ul>

<p>In Spanish all nouns have a gender, either masculine or feminine (for example, the word for âhouseâ (casa) is a feminine noun so âa houseâ/âthe houseâ is translated as âuna casaâ/âla casaâ. The word for âbookâ (libro) is a masculine noun so âa bookâ/âthe bookâ is translated as âun libroâ/âel libroâ).</p>

<p>The gender of the word will affect adjectives which refer to that word. For example, if you want to say âthe red houseâ you would say âla casa rojaâ. If you wanted to say âa red bookâ you would say âun libro rojoâ.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, the gender of each form of the word has been given below: masculine forms of the word are denoted by â(m)â, feminine by â(f)â. The plural form of the word (i.e when there is more than one of the object concerned) is denoted by âplâ. So, âthese housesâ would appear as âestas casas (fpl)â and âthose booksâ would appear as âesos libros (mpl)â.</p>

<p>Accents may appear above certain vowels, helping pronunciation by indicating where the stress should be placed in that particular word (e.g. prisiÃ³n, miÃ©rcoles, telÃ©fono). In the absence of accents, words ending in either a vowel or â¦n / â¦s will have stress placed on the penultimate syllable (e.g. nosotros, transferido, urgente). If the word ends in a consonant other than â¦n / â¦s, the last syllable is stressed (e.g. necesitar, enfermedad, espanol)</p>

<p>(In Spanish, there are two verbs which translate as âto beâ: âserâ and âestarâ. âSerâ is meant to convey something permanent (e.g. âI am Englishâ, âI am a manâ), and âestarâ is meant to convey something more temporary like a mood or emotion (e.g. âI am illâ, or âI am happyâ).</p>
