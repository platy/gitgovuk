<p>On 4 January the Prime Minister announced a national lockdown for all of England. This guidance will be updated soon and does not reflect the latest changes. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#weddings-civil-partnerships-and-religious-services">up to date guidance on the national lockdown</a>. There is different advice for <a href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus">Wales</a> and <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-covid-19">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>This guidance is only applicable in England. For guidance in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, please refer to guidance from the relevant national governments.</p>

<p>This guidance is of a general nature and should be treated as a guide. In the event of any conflict between any applicable legislation (including the health and safety legislation) and this guidance, the applicable legislation shall prevail.</p>

<h2>Local restriction tiers</h2>

<p>The government has adopted a regionally-differentiated approach to controlling transmission of the virus, where different tiers of restrictions apply in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>We know that social contact spreads the virus. We need to impose these restrictions and it is right to target the toughest measures only in the areas where the virus is most prevalent or where we are seeing sharper increases in the rate of infection.</p>

<p>The government is committed to ensuring the right levels of intervention in the right places to manage outbreaks, suppress the virus and keep R below 1.</p>

<p>There are 4 tiers for local restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tier 1: Medium alert</li>
  <li>Tier 2: High alert</li>
  <li>Tier 3: Very High alert</li>
  <li>Tier 4: Stay at home</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-local-restrictions" class="govuk-link">Use the postcode checker to find out the restrictions in your area or an area you plan to visit</a>. The NHS <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> app was updated on 2 December.</p>

<p>You can also visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/full-list-of-local-restriction-tiers-by-area">local restrictions tiers page</a> to find out which tier your area is in and the restrictions that apply.</p>

<h3>How the local restriction tiers effect wedding receptions and celebrations</h3>

<p>Restrictions for wedding receptions and celebrations will vary according to the tier you are in.</p>

<h4>Tier 1 and Tier 2</h4>

<p>Up to 15 people may attend a wedding and civil partnership reception or celebration. This does not include anyone working at the venue. Wedding receptions and celebrations are one of the few exceptions where groups can be larger than 6 people, but they must not exceed 15.</p>

<p>Venues selling food or drink (including cafés, bars, pubs and restaurants) must be closed between 11pm and 5am, with last orders for food and drink having been placed by 10pm. An exception to this is that attendees may stay overnight at the wedding venue.</p>

<p>In venues which sell alcohol, food and drink must be ordered by, and served to, customers who are seated. This means that a business that sells alcohol must introduce systems to take orders from seated customers, instead of at a bar or counter. This applies to both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>

<p>In Tier 2, any alcohol served must only be served alongside a substantial meal, for example a wedding breakfast. No alcoholic drinks should be served separately to the meal.</p>

<h4>Tier 3</h4>

<p>Wedding and civil partnership receptions and celebrations are not permitted to take place.</p>

<p>When attending a wedding or civil partnership ceremony, there are no restrictions on travel and you may travel to another Tier in England or overseas, for this purpose. However, guests from a Tier 3 area must not attend a reception or celebration in Tier 1 or Tier 2 areas.</p>

<h4>Tier 4</h4>

<p>Wedding and civil partnership receptions and celebrations are not permitted to take place.</p>

<p>Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies must only take place with up to 6 people. Anyone working is not included. Where possible, these should only take place in exceptional circumstances, for example, an urgent marriage where one of those getting married is seriously ill and not expected to recover.</p>

<p>If you live in a Tier 4 area and are going to a wedding ceremony outside the Tier 4 area, the event must follow the Tier 4 gathering limit.</p>

<p>If you live outside a Tier 4 area and are going to a wedding ceremony inside the Tier 4 area, you must comply with the Tier 4 gathering limit.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK is currently experiencing a public health emergency as a result of the coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>) pandemic. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/transmission-characteristics-and-principles-of-infection-prevention-and-control">characteristics of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr></a> are outlined by Public Health England. The transmission of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> is thought to occur mainly through respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, and through contact with contaminated surfaces. Evidence on the most effective steps that can be taken to limit the transmission of the virus continues to be regularly reviewed.</p>

<p>Marriages and civil partnerships are a vital part of our society, uniting couples to start their new life together and affording certain legal rights. These ceremonies are often followed by receptions and other celebrations attended by guests who are known to one another. However, by their very nature, in bringing families and friends together, these events are particularly vulnerable to the spread of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>The government has been working closely with stakeholders in the wedding industry to consider how we are able to allow small wedding and civil partnership celebrations to take place safely.</p>

<p>This guidance remains under review and may be updated in line with the changing situation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Purpose of this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance is designed to assist venues that host wedding and civil partnership receptions and celebrations in England, and other businesses involved in these events, to prepare their activities in accordance with the associated legislation.</p>

<p>The guidance sets out how this can be done in a manner that is safe and in line with social distancing guidelines, in order to minimise the risk of exposure to infection for all individuals attending these events, including those who work at the venues.</p>

<p>This guidance applies only to marriage and civil partnership receptions and celebrations taking place in England. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-small-marriages-and-civil-partnerships/covid-19-guidance-for-small-marriages-and-civil-partnerships" class="govuk-link">government’s guidance on marriage ceremonies and civil partnership formations</a>.</p>

<p>From 2 December, venue managers will have discretion over when they consider it safe to open. At that time venues should decide to remain closed or not proceed with receptions or celebrations if they are not able to safely adhere to the guidelines outlined below. Where the legislation requires that a venue does not open then it must remain closed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Key principles</h2>

<p>On 2 December, the government introduced a system of local restriction tiers . The tiers have significant implications for wedding and civil partnerships receptions. Visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/full-list-of-local-restriction-tiers-by-area" class="govuk-link">local restriction tiers page</a> or use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-local-restrictions" class="govuk-link">postcode checker</a> to find out which tier your area is in.</p>

<p>Wedding and civil partnership receptions and celebrations are permitted in Tier 1, and Tier 2.</p>

<p>They are not permitted to take place in areas in Tier 3 or Tier 4.</p>

<h3>For areas in Tier 1 and Tier 2</h3>

<p>Wedding and civil partnership receptions and celebrations can take place with a maximum of 15 attendees. This limit includes the guests and the couple, but anyone working at the venue is not included. Receptions and celebrations should be a sit-down meal and must only take place in a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure environment/venue.</p>

<p>To address increasing virus transmission rates, the following legal restrictions apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>venues hosting wedding receptions and celebrations must be closed between 11pm and 5am, with last orders for food and drink having been placed by 10pm. An exception to this is that attendees may stay overnight at the venue</li>
  <li>employers must not knowingly allow someone who is being required to self-isolate to come to work</li>
  <li>guests must not attend a reception or celebration in Tier 1 or Tier 2 from a Tier 3 or Tier 4 area, unless they are also attending the ceremony</li>
  <li>guests from different households and support bubbles attending a wedding or civil partnership reception or celebration must maintain social distancing while travelling to and from the venue</li>
</ul>

<p>It is crucial that all staff, attendees and third-party suppliers visiting wedding reception or celebration venues are not showing any symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. Anyone displaying symptoms should stay at home and get tested.</p>

<p>If anyone becomes unwell with symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> at a venue they should go home and be advised to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>. If they need clinical advice they should go online and access <a class="govuk-link" href="https://111.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS online</a> (or call 111 if they don’t have internet access). In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk. They should not visit a GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital except for emergency access as above.</p>

<p>People who may have been in contact with a person who has become unwell should wash their hands thoroughly after the interaction, but they do not need to take any other specific action unless they develop symptoms themselves or are advised to do so by NHS Test and Trace. If they do develop symptoms they should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Social distancing measures</h3>

<p>During all activities linked to the reception or celebration, all parties, especially people from separate households/bubbles, should adhere to social distancing guidelines; 2 metres or 1 metre with risk mitigation (where 2 metres is not viable) such as wearing face coverings.</p>

<p>Wherever possible attendees should remain seated to support social distancing safety measures. They should be reminded at key points during the events to maintain social distancing and to avoid physical contact with individuals from different households.</p>

<p>Attendees and staff must wear a face covering (except when eating or drinking) in line with the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/791/contents" rel="external" class="govuk-link">face coverings legislation</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">guidance on face coverings</a>.</p>

<p>Employers must not, by law, prevent their staff or any other person present from wearing a face covering where they are required to do so.</p>

<p>Venue managers should provide hand sanitiser at convenient points throughout the venue and encourage attendees to use it.</p>

<p>Attendees, including children, should frequently throughout the day wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with running water and soap, or use hand sanitiser ensuring that all parts of the hands are covered.</p>

<p>Any shared facilities for children, such as play corners, soft furnishings, soft toys and toys that are hard to clean, should be removed or closed. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-playgrounds-and-outdoor-gyms/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-playgrounds-and-outdoor-gyms" class="govuk-link">Outdoor playgrounds are permitted to open</a> where venue managers risk assess that it is safe to do so and ensure facilities are cleaned regularly. Particular attention should be paid to cleaning frequently touched surfaces and those that are at child height.</p>

<h3>Serving and consuming food and drink</h3>

<p>Staff should serve all food and drinks to minimise customer self-service, in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/restaurants-offering-takeaway-or-delivery">guidance for restaurants, pubs, bars and takeaway services</a> and attendees should remain seated in hospitality settings.</p>

<p>In Tier 2, venues that serve alcohol should function as restaurants, and alcohol should only be served alongside a substantial meal.</p>

<p>Seating arrangements should follow social distancing guidance, meaning social distancing is maintained between different households (including any support bubbles), which must be at least 2 metres, or if certain <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> security measures are in place, at least 1 metre. Outdoor table service is also preferable.</p>

<p>In licensed premises, food and drink must be ordered from, and served to, customers who are seated. This means that a business that sells alcohol must introduce systems to take orders and payment from seated customers, instead of at a bar or counter. Any premises wishing to avoid this requirement would need to stop serving alcohol. This applies to both indoor and outdoors settings. This has been introduced to prevent crowding and social contact in licensed premises.</p>

<p>Businesses selling food or drink (licensed or not) must take all reasonable steps to prevent customers consuming food or drink on the premises unless they are seated. This means that in unlicensed premises, food and drink can be purchased or ordered at a counter, but customers must sit down to consume it, even in outdoor settings.</p>

<p>Regulations now require certain businesses to implement specific aspects of this guidance, or face a fixed penalty notice of up to £10,000. The regulations require that businesses where face coverings are required by law to be worn must inform people of the requirements in relation to face coverings, for instance using signage or taking other measures to ensure people are informed.</p>

<p>Employers must not knowingly allow a worker (including where their worker is an agency worker) who is being required to self-isolate to come to work or attend any other place for work.</p>

<h3>Entertainment</h3>

<p>Dancing should not be permitted due to the increased risk of transmission and dancefloors may be repurposed for additional customer seating or other relevant purposes, ensuring this is in line with the social distancing guidelines. The only exception to this is the couple’s ‘first dance’, which has been exempted from the regulations prohibiting dancing.</p>

<p>Socially distanced indoor and outdoor performances to a live audience, with strict social distancing arrangements in place, can take place in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts" class="govuk-link">guidance on performing arts</a>.</p>

<p>To minimise risk of droplet and aerosol transmission from the combined attendees including the performer/s, audience, wedding party and associated staff and site providers, outdoor performances are always preferable. Where any indoor performances are planned they should be limited in size, implement strict social distancing rules, only take place where high rates of air flow can be maintained, should use amplification systems to create volume rather than natural voices, and the audience cannot join in. A solo or small number of performers is preferable and all should be socially distanced. Those planning the wedding should consider how the performers will impact the total size of the wedding party and therefore the safety of their event.</p>

<p>All venues should ensure that steps are taken to mitigate the increased risk of virus transmission associated with aerosol production from raised voices, such as when speaking loudly or singing loudly, particularly in confined and poorly ventilated spaces. This includes, but is not limited to, lowering the volume of background music, and refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, particularly if played at a volume that makes normal conversation difficult. Evidence on the most effective steps that can be taken to limit the transmission of the virus continues to be reviewed. This guidance may be updated in the future in response to changing scientific understanding.</p>

<h3>Other activities</h3>

<p>Any other activities, including those that involve or are watched by attendees (such as cake cutting and the playing of games) should take place with social distancing being maintained at all times and the numbers of guests involved limited wherever possible, with people remaining in their households/bubbles.</p>

<p>Activities that involve objects being thrown (such as confetti or a bouquet toss) or passed from person to person should be avoided to reduce the likelihood of transmission.</p>

<p>Speeches should be undertaken outside or in well ventilated areas wherever possible. Ventilation with external air should be maximised in all buildings where people are gathering. For example, windows and doors should be opened as much as possible, and the sides of marquees removed or rolled up, throughout the event and when groups of staff are preparing and clearing away. Air conditioning systems using recirculated air are not advised. PA systems should be utilised wherever possible to help amplify speeches without speakers needing to raise their voices. Social distancing between the speaker and observers should be maintained at all times and neither speakers nor participants should raise their voices, to avoid the increased risk from aerosol transmission.</p>

<p>Where faith and belief marriage rituals or ceremonies are being undertaken under the legal provisions for a wedding reception, these ceremonies must not exceed 15 people, and should adhere to all social distancing and other safety measures provided in this guidance. Those taking part in the ritual or ceremony do not need to remain seated at tables for this, but should be seated for any other aspects of a reception. If a faith or belief marriage ritual or ceremony is taking place as a wedding reception, it should take place within a reasonable timeframe alongside the legal solemnisation of the marriage.</p>

<h3>Objects in the venue</h3>

<p>Other objects in the venue being touched by several people (such as guest books, polaroid camera stations or games) should be minimised and hand sanitisation encouraged both before and after contact. The exchange of cards and gifts during receptions and celebrations should be minimised wherever possible.</p>

<h3>Third-party suppliers</h3>

<p>For suppliers present during the wedding reception or celebration, they and the venue managers should ensure that all activities undertaken are subject to a risk assessment and that they maintain social distancing during any activities the suppliers are responsible for.</p>

<p>Venue managers should ensure that all third-party suppliers follow the guidance on inbound and outbound goods as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/restaurants-offering-takeaway-or-delivery">guidance on restaurants, pubs, bars and takeaway services</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Guidance for venue managers</h2>

<p>This guidance has been developed specifically for venues hosting wedding and civil partnership receptions and celebrations, and should be read in conjunction with other published <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure guidance (see above).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on capacity</h3>

<p>In Tier 1 and Tier 2, the number of people at a wedding or civil partnership reception or celebration (including the couple and guests) must be no more than 15, safely accommodated with social distancing in a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure venue. Tables must be 2 metres apart, or no more than 1 metre apart if there are <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Secure measures such as barriers, screens or other measures to limit transmission are taken.</p>

<p>Anyone working, for example officiants, staff employed by the venue, any third-party suppliers, photographers, security personnel, or catering staff, are not included in this figure. Wedding receptions and celebrations are one of the few exceptions to the gatherings limit of 6 people.</p>

<p>Wedding and civil partnership receptions and celebrations are not permitted to take place in Tier 3 or Tier 4 areas.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Test and Trace</h2>

<p>Opening of the economy and public services is reliant on NHS Test and Trace being used to minimise transmission of the virus. In order to ensure that businesses and local services are able to remain open, we are now mandating that organisations in designated sectors (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">guidance on maintaining records to support NHS Test and Trace</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask at least one member of every party of customers or visitors (up to 6 people) to provide their name and contact details</li>
  <li>keep a record of the contact details for all suppliers visiting the venue on a given day, including those visiting prior to or following the event</li>
  <li>keep a record of all staff working on their premises and shift times on a given day and their contact details</li>
  <li>keep these records of customers, visitors, suppliers and staff for 21 days and provide data to NHS Test and Trace or other local public health officials if requested</li>
  <li>display an official NHS QR code poster so that customers and visitors can ‘check in’ using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details; and</li>
  <li>adhere to General Data Protection Regulations.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the hospitality sector will be required to ensure that anyone visiting pubs, restaurants and other venues provides their contact information or checks in using the official NHS QR code before being allowed entry to the venue.</p>

<p>Any designated venue that is found not to be compliant with these regulations will be subject to financial penalties.  It is vital that relevant venues comply with these regulations to help keep people safe, and to keep businesses open.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Enforcement</h2>

<p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the Health and Safety Executive or your local authority, identifies employers or venues who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation to control public health risks, or with health and safety legislation, they are empowered to take a range of actions to improve control of venue risks. Enforcement officers will take relevant guidance into account.</p>

<p>Failure to complete a risk assessment which takes account of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, or completing a risk assessment but failing to put in place sufficient measures to manage the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, could constitute a breach of existing <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/legislation/hswa.htm" rel="external" class="govuk-link">health and safety legislation</a>. A wedding or civil partnership reception is only exempted from the rule of 6 limit if a risk assessment has been carried out as required by the relevant regulations.</p>

<p>The actions the enforcing authority can take include the provision of specific advice to venues to support them to achieve the required standard, through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements. Breaches of the legal requirements and failure to comply with enforcement notices can constitute a criminal offence, with serious fines and even imprisonment for up to 2 years. Penalties increase for repeated breaches under the various regulations in place for coronavirus measures. There is also a wider system of enforcement, which includes specific obligations and conditions for licensed premises.</p>

<p>Venue managers are expected to respond to any advice or notices issued by enforcing authorities rapidly and are required to do so within any timescales imposed by the enforcing authorities. Our expectation is that venues and venue managers will act responsibly and join with the UK’s fight against <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> by working with the government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, regulators are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers and venues are taking the necessary steps.</p>
