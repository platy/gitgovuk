<p>Applies to: England (see guidance for <a href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Wales</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/" class="govuk-link">Scotland</a>, and <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-covid-19">Northern Ireland</a>)</p>
</div>

<p>This guidance is of a general nature and should be treated as a guide. In the event of any conflict between any applicable legislation (including the health and safety legislation) and this guidance, the applicable legislation shall prevail.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK is currently experiencing a public health emergency as a result of the coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>) pandemic.      Marriages and civil partnerships are a vital part of our society, uniting couples to start their new life together and affording certain legal rights. These ceremonies are often followed by receptions and other celebrations attended by guests who are known to one another. However, by their very nature, in bringing families and friends together, these events are particularly vulnerable to the spread of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>The government has been working closely with stakeholders in the wedding industry to consider how we are able to allow small wedding and civil partnership celebrations to take place safely.</p>

<p>This guidance for receptions and civil partnership celebrations has been drafted on the basis of the scientific evidence available and will be updated in line with the changing situation and as more data becomes available on <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Purpose of this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance is designed to assist venues that host wedding and civil partnership receptions and celebrations in England, and other businesses involved in these events, to prepare their activities in accordance with the associated legislation.</p>

<p>The guidance sets out how this can be done in a manner that is safe and in line with social distancing guidelines, in order to minimise the risk of exposure to infection for all individuals attending these events, including those who work at the venues.</p>

<p>This guidance applies only to marriage and civil partnership receptions and celebrations taking place in England. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-small-marriages-and-civil-partnerships/covid-19-guidance-for-small-marriages-and-civil-partnerships" class="govuk-link">governmentâs guidance on marriage ceremonies and civil partnership formations</a>.</p>

<h3>Definitions for the purpose of this guidance</h3>

<p>A gathering of people to mark the occasion of the marriage or civil partnership of a couple, usually involving a sit-down meal.</p>

<h4>âOfficiantâ</h4>

<p>A person acting in an official capacity. This could be a person with certain legal responsibilities at the ceremony, such as a registration official or authorised person, or a minister of religion solemnising the marriage.</p>

<h4>âVenue managersâ</h4>

<p>The person or persons responsible for the management of a venue, including assessment of compliance with the following guidelines.</p>

<p>Individuals entering a venue for the purpose of attending a ceremony, reception or celebration.</p>

<h4>âThird-party supplierâ</h4>

<p>Any other individuals providing a service on site for receptions and celebrations. This can be either during the event itself, or prior to/following the event for the purposes of preparing and/or tidying up.</p>

<h4>âMustâ</h4>

<p>Where the guidance states that an activity must take place this is because it is a legal requirement.</p>

<h4>âShouldâ</h4>

<p>Where the guidance states that an activity should take place this is not a legal requirement, however it is strongly advised that consideration is given to following the advice being given to reduce the risk of transmission of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<h4>âHouseholdâ</h4>

<p>A household is a person or a group of people who live together in the same accommodation.</p>

<h4>âSupport bubbleâ</h4>

<p>A support bubble is a support network which links 2 households. The 2 households that form a support bubble count as 1 household for the purposes of this guidance. For further information, including on eligibility, refer to      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">guidance on making a support bubble with another household</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Restrictions at each step</h2>

<p>The government has published the â<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021/covid-19-response-spring-2021"><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Response - Spring 2021</a>â setting out the roadmap out of the current lockdown for England. This explains how restrictions will be eased over time, including a staged return of wedding receptions and civil partnership celebrations as below.</p>

<p>At each step anyone working is not included in the limit for ceremonies or receptions.</p>

<p>At each stage, the progress to the next will be guided by data not dates and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021/covid-19-response-spring-2021#the-four-tests">4 tests set out in the roadmap</a>. A weekâs notice will be provided before any step is taken.</p>

<p>This guidance will remain under review and be updated ahead of each step.</p>

<h3>Step 1 - from 8 March</h3>

<h4>From 8 March</h4>

<p>Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies of 6 can take place but these should only be in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Receptions and celebrations are not permitted.</p>

<h4>From 29 March</h4>

<p>Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies can continue to take place for up to 6 people only but will no longer be limited to exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Receptions and celebrations are not permitted. However, small gatherings can take place in line with social contact limits. Therefore, they may take place outdoors in a group of 6, or 2 households (including support bubbles, if eligible to form one).</p>

<h3>Step 2 - no earlier than 12 April</h3>

<p>Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies are permitted for up to 15 people, in <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-secure venues that are permitted to open, or where a broader exemption applies.</p>

<p>Receptions and celebrations can take place outside with up to 15 people. This should be in the form of a sit-     down meal. They may take place in any <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-secure outdoor venue that is permitted to open.</p>

<p>Outdoor venues may be partially sheltered, such as marquees, but cannot be enclosed or substantially enclosed. For example, at least 50% of the wall area of the marquee must be open for it to be considered outdoors.</p>

<p>Such receptions must not take place in private gardens or public outdoor spaces.</p>

<p>However, small gatherings can take place in other outdoor spaces including private gardens in line with social contact limits: in a group of 6, or 2 households (including support bubbles, if eligible to form one).</p>

<h3>Step 3 - no earlier than 17 May</h3>

<p>Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies are permitted for up to 30 people in <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-secure venues that are permitted to open.</p>

<p>Receptions can also proceed with up to 30 people in a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-secure indoor venue, or outdoors.</p>

<p>Further details on receptions at this step will be updated in due course.</p>

<h3>Step 4 - no earlier than 21 June</h3>

<p>At Step 4, the government aims to remove all limits on weddings, civil partnership ceremonies, receptions and celebrations.</p>

<p>This will be subject to the outcome of the scientific Events Research Programme, which will include a series of pilots using enhanced testing approaches and other measures to run events of larger sizes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Key principles</h2>

<p>It is crucial that all staff, attendees and third-party suppliers visiting wedding reception or celebration venues are not showing any symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. Anyone displaying symptoms should stay at home and get tested.</p>

<p>If anyone becomes unwell with symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> at a venue they should go home and be advised to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a>. If they need clinical advice they should go online and access <a rel="external" href="https://111.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS online</a> (or call 111 if they donât have internet access). In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk. They should not visit a GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital except for emergency access as above.</p>

<p>People who may have been in contact with a person who has become unwell should wash their hands thoroughly after the interaction, but they do not need to take any other specific action unless they develop symptoms themselves or are advised to do so by NHS Test and Trace. If they do develop symptoms they should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Social distancing measures</h3>

<p>During all activities linked to the reception or celebration, all parties, especially people from separate households/bubbles, should adhere to social distancing guidelines; 2 metres or 1 metre with risk mitigation (where 2 metres is not viable) such as wearing face coverings.</p>

<p>To help control increasing virus transmission rates, guests from different households and support bubbles attending a wedding or civil partnership reception or celebration must also maintain social distancing while travelling to and from the venue.</p>

<h4>At Step 2</h4>

<p>Receptions are only permitted outdoors. They should be a sit-down meal and take place in a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-secure venue. In line with social contact limits, guests should remain seated in groups of 6 or 2 households.</p>

<p>Attendees should be reminded at key points during the events to maintain social distancing and to avoid physical contact with individuals from different households.</p>

<h4>At Step 3</h4>

<p>Further details on the social distancing requirements at Step 3 will be updated in due course.</p>

<h3>Face coverings and hygiene</h3>

<p>Attendees and staff must wear a face covering (except when eating or drinking) in line with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/791/contents" class="govuk-link">face coverings legislation</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">guidance on face coverings</a>.</p>

<p>Employers must not, by law, prevent their staff or any other person present from wearing a face covering where they are required to do so.</p>

<p>Venue managers should provide hand sanitiser at convenient points throughout the venue and encourage attendees to use it.</p>

<p>Attendees, including children, should frequently throughout the day wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with running water and soap, or use hand sanitiser ensuring that all parts of the hands are covered.</p>

<p>Any shared facilities for children, such as play corners, soft furnishings, soft toys and toys that are hard to clean, should be removed or closed. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-playgrounds-and-outdoor-gyms/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-playgrounds-and-outdoor-gyms" class="govuk-link">Outdoor playgrounds are permitted to open</a> where venue managers risk assess that it is safe to do so and ensure facilities are cleaned regularly. Particular attention should be paid to cleaning frequently touched surfaces and those that are at child height.</p>

<h3>Serving and consuming food and drink</h3>

<p>Staff should serve all food and drinks to minimise customer self-service, in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/restaurants-offering-takeaway-or-delivery" class="govuk-link">guidance for restaurants, pubs, bars and takeaway services</a>.</p>

<h4>At Step 2</h4>

<p>Attendees should be seated. Seating arrangements should follow social distancing guidance, meaning keeping tables at least 2 metres apart, or if certain <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-secure measures are in place, at least 1 metre apart.</p>

<p>In Step 2, if a venue serves alcohol then all food and drink (including non-alcoholic drink) must be ordered, served and consumed at a table outdoors.</p>

<p>If a venue doesnât provide alcohol, then food and drink can be ordered and collected from a counter indoors, but should be consumed at a table outdoors. This means that a business that sells alcohol must introduce systems to take orders and payment from seated customers, instead of at a bar or counter. Any premises wishing to avoid this requirement would need to stop serving alcohol. This has been introduced to prevent crowding and social contact.</p>

<p>Businesses selling food or drink (licensed or not) must take all reasonable steps to prevent customers consuming food or drink on the premises unless they are seated. This means that in unlicensed premises, food and drink can be purchased or ordered at a counter, but customers must sit down to consume it, even in outdoor settings.</p>

<p>Regulations now require certain businesses to implement specific aspects of this guidance, or face a fixed penalty notice of up to Â£10,000. The regulations require that businesses where face coverings are required by law to be worn must inform people of the requirements in relation to face coverings, for instance using signage or taking other measures to ensure people are informed.</p>

<p>Employers must not knowingly allow a worker (including where their worker is an agency worker) who is being required to self-isolate to come to work or attend any other place for work.</p>

<h4>At Step 3</h4>

<p>Further details on Step 3 will be provided in due course.</p>

<h3>Entertainment</h3>

<p>Dancing should not be permitted due to the increased risk of transmission and dancefloors may be repurposed for additional customer seating or other relevant purposes, ensuring this is in line with the social distancing guidelines. The only exception to this is the coupleâs âfirst danceâ.</p>

<p>Socially distanced outdoor performances to a live audience, with strict social distancing arrangements in place, can take place in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts" class="govuk-link">guidance on performing arts</a> from Step 2, and can take place indoors from Step 3.</p>

<p>To minimise risk of droplet and aerosol transmission from the combined attendees including the performer/s, audience, wedding party and associated staff and site providers, outdoor performances are always preferable. Where any indoor performances are planned they should be limited in size, implement strict social distancing rules, only take place where high rates of air flow can be maintained, should use amplification systems to create volume rather than natural voices, and the audience cannot join in. A solo or small number of performers is preferable and all should be socially distanced. Those planning the wedding should consider how the performers will impact the total size of the wedding party and therefore the safety of their event, although those working at the event are not included in the limits on attendees at each step.</p>

<p>All venues should ensure that steps are taken to mitigate the increased risk of virus transmission associated with aerosol production from raised voices, such as when speaking loudly or singing loudly, particularly in confined and poorly ventilated spaces. This includes, but is not limited to, lowering the volume of background music, and refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, particularly if played at a volume that makes normal conversation difficult. Evidence on the most effective steps that can be taken to limit the transmission of the virus continues to be reviewed. This guidance may be updated in the future in response to changing scientific understanding.</p>

<h3>Other activities</h3>

<p>Any other activities, including those that involve or are watched by attendees (such as cake cutting and the playing of games) should take place with social distancing being maintained at all times and the numbers of guests involved limited wherever possible.</p>

<p>Activities that involve objects being thrown (such as confetti or a bouquet toss) or passed from person to person should be avoided to reduce the likelihood of transmission.</p>

<p>Speeches should be undertaken outside or in well ventilated areas wherever possible. Ventilation with external air should be maximised in all buildings where people are gathering. For example, windows and doors should be opened as much as possible, and the sides of marquees removed or rolled up throughout the event and when groups of staff are preparing and clearing away. At Step 2, at least 50% of the wall area of the marquee must be open for the venue to be classed as âoutdoorsâ. Air conditioning systems using recirculated air are not advised. <abbr title="public address systems">PA systems</abbr> should be utilised wherever possible to help amplify speeches without speakers needing to raise their voices. Social distancing between the speaker and observers should be maintained at all times and neither speakers nor participants should raise their voices, to avoid the increased risk from aerosol transmission.</p>

<p>Where faith and belief marriage rituals or ceremonies are being undertaken under the legal provisions for a wedding reception, these ceremonies must follow the guidance for that step, including the limit on attendees, social distancing and any other safety measures provided in this guidance.</p>

<p>If a faith or belief marriage ritual or ceremony is taking place as a wedding reception, it should take place within a reasonable timeframe alongside the legal solemnisation of the marriage.</p>

<h3>Objects in the venue</h3>

<p>Other objects in the venue being touched by several people (such as guest books, polaroid camera stations or games) should be minimised and hand sanitisation encouraged both before and after contact. The exchange of cards and gifts during receptions and celebrations should be minimised wherever possible.</p>

<h3>Third-party suppliers</h3>

<p>For suppliers present during the wedding reception or celebration, they and the venue managers should ensure that all activities undertaken are subject to a risk assessment and that they maintain social distancing during any activities the suppliers are responsible for.</p>

<p>Venue managers should ensure that all third-party suppliers follow the guidance on inbound and outbound goods as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/restaurants-offering-takeaway-or-delivery">guidance on restaurants, pubs, bars and takeaway services</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Guidance for venue managers</h2>

<p>This guidance has been developed specifically for venues hosting wedding and civil partnership receptions and celebrations, and should be read in conjunction with other published <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-secure guidance (see above).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on capacity</h3>

<p>Where there is a requirement for the reception or celebration to be a sit-down meal, tables must be 2 metres apart, or no more than 1 metre apart if there are <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-secure measures such as barriers, screens or other measures to limit transmission are taken.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> NHS Test and Trace</h2>

<p>Opening of the economy and public services is reliant on NHS Test and Trace being used to minimise transmission of the virus. In order to ensure that businesses and local services are able to remain open, we are now mandating that organisations in designated sectors (see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace" class="govuk-link">guidance on maintaining records to support NHS Test and Trace</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask each attendee over 16 years of age to provide their name and contact details</li>
  <li>keep a record of the contact details for all suppliers visiting the venue on a given day, including those visiting prior to or following the event</li>
  <li>keep a record of all staff working on their premises and shift times on a given day and their contact details</li>
  <li>keep these records of customers, visitors, suppliers and staff for 21 days and provide data to NHS Test and Trace or other local public health officials if requested</li>
  <li>display an official NHS <abbr title="Quick Response code">QR code</abbr> poster so that customers and visitors can âcheck inâ using this option as an alternative to providing their contact details</li>
  <li>adhere to General Data Protection Regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the hospitality sector will be required to ensure that anyone visiting pubs, restaurants and other venues provides their contact information or checks in using the official NHS <abbr title="Quick Response code">QR code</abbr> before being allowed entry to the venue.</p>

<p>Any designated venue that is found not to be compliant with these regulations will be subject to financial penalties. It is vital that relevant venues comply with these regulations to help keep people safe, and to keep businesses open.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Enforcement</h2>

<p>Where the enforcing authority, such as the Health and Safety Executive or your local authority, identifies employers or venues that are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation to control public health risks, or with health and safety legislation, they are empowered to take a range of actions to improve control of venue risks. Enforcement officers will take relevant guidance into account.</p>

<p>Failure to complete a risk assessment which takes account of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, or completing a risk assessment but failing to put in place sufficient measures to manage the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, could constitute a breach of existing <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/legislation/hswa.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">health and safety legislation</a>.</p>

<p>The actions the enforcing authority can take include the provision of specific advice to venues to support them to achieve the required standard, through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements. Breaches of the legal requirements and failure to comply with enforcement notices can constitute a criminal offence, with serious fines and even imprisonment for up to 2 years. Penalties increase for repeated breaches under the various regulations in place for <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> measures. There is also a wider system of enforcement, which includes specific obligations and conditions for licensed premises.</p>

<p>Venue managers are expected to respond to any advice or notices issued by enforcing authorities rapidly and are required to do so within any timescales imposed by the enforcing authorities. Our expectation is that venues and venue managers will act responsibly and join with the UKâs fight against <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> by working with the government and their sector bodies to protect their workers and the public. However, regulators are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers and venues are taking the necessary steps.</p>
