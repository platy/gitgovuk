<p>Last updated: 1 April 2021</p>

<p>This privacy notice covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the online service, previously available at https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus-shielding-support</li>
  <li>the earlier version of the online service, available at www.gov.uk/coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable and the automated telephone service (both of which took registrations up to 17 July 2020)</li>
  <li>communications to and from our user support teams, including the National Shielding Service call centre and user support teams at local authorities</li>
  <li>online surveys and other tools we may use to get your feedback on the service</li>
</ul>

<h2>About this service</h2>

<p>This service is run by the Cabinet Office, working with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government</li>
  <li>the Department for Environment Food &amp; Rural Affairs</li>
  <li>the Department for Work &amp; Pensions</li>
  <li>the National Health Service (NHS)</li>
</ul>

<p>The service is no longer open for new registrations because people in England are not being advised to shield from 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>This means we are no longer collecting personal information through the online service or the automated telephone service. But we still receive personal information about individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus from the NHS and we will continue to hold personal information we have already collected through the service.</p>

<p>This page explains what personal information we’re still getting and how we’re protecting the personal information we’ve already collected.</p>

<h2>Personal information</h2>

<p>The NHS is still providing us with the following personal information about individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>phone numbers</li>
  <li>NHS number</li>
  <li>gender</li>
</ul>

<p>We will retain the information we’ve already collected through the online service and automated telephone system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>contact details</li>
  <li>NHS number</li>
  <li>details of the support you need (for example, care needs or help getting essential supplies)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lawful basis for processing your personal information</h2>

<p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we are processing this information on the basis that we’re carrying out a task in the public interest and to protect the vital interests of people more vulnerable to coronavirus.</p>

<p>This lawful basis applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our processing of information shared with us by the NHS and other organisations which support the shielding service</li>
  <li>our processing of information you provide to us through the service and through your communications with us</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the information we hold is sensitive health and care information. This is classed as ‘special category’ personal data within the meaning of Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 2018, meaning we must state a further lawful basis for processing it. We’re relying on substantial public interest and governmental purpose to process this special category personal data.</p>

<p>If you provide any information through the surveys or other tools we may use to get your feedback, we’ll process this information on the basis that we’re carrying out a task in the public interest.</p>

<h2>What we do with your information</h2>

<p>The service is closed to new registrations, but we’ll continue to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive information from the NHS about people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus</li>
  <li>hold personal information we previously collected through registrations on the service</li>
</ul>

<p>We use this information to make sure that we have accurate, up to date records and to maintain a level of readiness should we need to restart the service in the future.</p>

<p>If you contact us about the service, we may ask you to confirm some of the information you provided when you registered to confirm your identity.</p>

<p>Where necessary, we will continue to share your information with other organisations which support the service. This includes sharing your information with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authorities until - or just after - 23 April 2021, so they have accurate information on clinically extremely vulnerable people in their area and can provide support to people who need it</li>
  <li>participating supermarkets until the end of June, so they can continue to prioritise shopping orders for those who have previously registered and indicated that they need help getting supplies (when we do this, we share only the minimum information necessary to get support to you as quickly as possible - and we do not share confidential health and care information)</li>
  <li>organisations that we may engage to get your feedback on how well the service worked - for example, by carrying out a survey</li>
  <li>other government departments, NHS bodies, public sector and private sector organisations where it’s necessary and proportionate to do so to in order to provide clinically extremely vulnerable people with support</li>
</ul>

<p>We may use your information to produce de-identified data and share this data with other government departments to improve services, understand changing patterns of support needs or identify new support needs. Any data we share for this purpose won’t identify you personally.</p>

<h2>How long we keep your information</h2>

<p>We and the organisations we share your information with will only keep your personal information for as long as we need it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to make sure that people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus have access to the support they need, while there’s a chance that people will be asked to ‘shield’ because of coronavirus</li>
  <li>to make sure this service is meeting overall demand from clinically extremely vulnerable people</li>
  <li>to help with the overall government response to coronavirus</li>
</ul>

<p>We keep these arrangements under review to make sure they remain appropriate and proportionate.</p>

<h2>Where your information is processed and stored</h2>

<p>Your personal information may be transferred outside the UK while being processed. If this happens, we’ll make sure your information is given the same level of technical and legal protection as it has within the UK. For example, by making sure a party we transfer the information to is contractually required to provide the same level of protection.</p>

<h2>How we protect your information</h2>

<p>We’re committed to doing all that we can to keep your information secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access to or disclosure of the data we collect about you. For example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.</p>

<p>All third parties that process personal information as part of delivering the service are required to keep that information secure. Our data processor is Amazon Web Services, who provide cloud hosting services. We also work with Methods Consulting who assist with the design of the service.</p>

<h2>NHS login</h2>

<p>While the service was open for new registrations, users had the option of creating an NHS login to confirm their identity when you use the service online.</p>

<p>By creating and using an NHS login, you will have provided personal information to NHS Digital. NHS Digital is the data controller for any personal information you provide to create or access your NHS login. Our role is as a processor of this information - meaning that we act according to NHS Digital’s instructions when processing this information.</p>

<p>See the <a rel="external" href="https://access.login.nhs.uk/privacy" class="govuk-link">NHS login privacy notice</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>

<p>In certain circumstances you have the right to ask for your information to be deleted by contacting us. We may need to refuse your request if the information is needed as part of the emergency response to coronavirus.</p>

<p>You also have the right to request:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information about how your personal information is processed, and to request a copy of that personal data</li>
  <li>that any inaccuracies in your personal information are rectified without delay</li>
  <li>that any incomplete personal information is updated - you can include the missing information in your request</li>
  <li>that the processing of your personal information is restricted in certain circumstances - for example, where accuracy is contested</li>
</ul>

<p>You also have the right to object to the processing of your data.</p>

<p>If you want to make any of these requests, contact us using the details below.</p>
