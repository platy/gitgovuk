<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Reminder: Lifelong Loan Entitlement (LLE) consultation</h2>

<p>We currently have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/lifelong-loan-entitlement/lifelong-loan-entitlement-consultation/" rel="external">live consultation on the LLE</a> which is open until the 6 May and would encourage you to respond with your views to help us realise the potential of the LLE.</p>

<p>In 2025, we hope to revolutionise the current student finance system (for levels 4 to 6) by delivering the LLE. Our aim is to have a flexible approach to skills development that meets the needs of learners and employers. The LLE will equal four years of post-18 education study. Learners will be able to use the fund to study flexibly, choosing relevant modules or studying as-and-when they want throughout their life. The LLE is for both further and higher education.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/lifelong-loan-entitlement/lifelong-loan-entitlement-consultation/" rel="external">consultation</a> is an opportunity for everyone to take part in the discussion. Please do get in touch by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:LLEteam@education.gov.uk">LLEteam@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
