<p>If you’ve been sexually assaulted it’s important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals make informed decisions about whether and how to seek medical advice and attention, report to local police and engage with local legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault in Dominican Republic.</p>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/victim-of-rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>First steps</h2>
<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>reach out to the Tourist Police +1 809 222 2026, or in person if they are nearby</li>
  <li>contact the local emergency number 911: the service is available in most of the country</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-santo-domingo">British Embassy in Santo Domingo</a> +1 809 472 7111 option “Help for British People”. This option is available 24/7.</li>
</ul>

<p>Embassy staff will be empathetic, and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in Dominican Republic</h2>

<p>In the Dominican Republic the General Attorney’s Office (Procuraduría General de la República) provides Specialised Victims Units (SVU) which are located throughout the country, to deal with Rape and Sexual Assault cases. Victims that report incidents to the police would be referred to the nearest SVU after taking down details and making an initial report.</p>

<p>The SVU’s regular office hours are: 8:30am-4:30pm Monday-Friday</p>

<p>They are normally able to provide translators, however these arrangements may take time.</p>

<p>You must report the crime before returning to the UK if you want it to be investigated. For this, the protocol set out by the Attorney General’s SVU in Dominican Republic must be completed.</p>

<p>The Specialised Victims Unit Protocol:</p>

<p>At the Specialised Victim’s Unit (SVU), the District Attorney will take your declaration to file a formal report.</p>

<p>They will proceed with evidence collection that will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sexual assault medical forensic examination</li>
  <li>Psychological evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a minor you must be accompanied by an adult either parent or guardian.</p>

<p>The medical and psychological evaluations are part of the evidence gathering process and are free.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can report the incident to them or your hotel and ask for their assistance. They may be able to arrange for someone to accompany you to the police/SVU. The same applies for the Tourist Police who may then help you to reach your tour operator/hotel or take you to the police or SVU.</li>
  <li>The British Embassy can also try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7.</li>
  <li>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the British Embassy in Santo Domingo on +1 809 472-7111, option ‘Help for British people’, which will enable the Embassy to provide you with consular support.</li>
  <li>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</li>
  <li>Tell the police/SVU if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>Insist you get a police report. This will be provided in Spanish therefore you would have to have it translated into English if applicable. The British Embassy in Santo Domingo provides a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dominican-republic-list-of-translators/list-of-translators-in-dominican-republic">list of translators in the Dominican Republic</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Victims do not run a risk of being penalised when reporting an RSA to local police. Extramarital sex and homosexuality are not crimes in the Dominican Republic and there are established processes for handling rape and sexual assault. Drinking is not a crime but drug taking however is a crime, and will be penalised.</p>

<p>You can request to be interviewed by a police officer of a particular gender although there is no guarantee one will be available. It is very rare that local police officers speak English. You might consider having your own interpreter with you when you visit the police station.</p>

<p>Investigations are led by the District Attorney’s Office and victims will not have to surrender their passport whilst any investigation is carried out.</p>

<p>A consular officer may be able to accompany you while you file the report with the police as well as during subsequent visits to the SVU, where timing and location allow.</p>

<p>Local legal procedures differ from those in the United Kingdom. You are not required to appoint a lawyer as the public prosecutor is responsible for prosecuting the case. At times, the local legal system may experience peaks in workload that can affect their delivery capability.</p>

<p>You can appoint a local lawyer to help with following up on the legal processes as well as progress of the case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in the Dominican Republic</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The British embassy or consulate will be able to help you. This includes helping you to contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.</li>
  <li>They can provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators:</li>

<ul>
  <li>If you are travelling with one, you can also report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. If you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. If you wish, and depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you.</li>
  <li>It is your choice on whether to report the crime. If you don’t report it, your case will not be investigated in the Dominican Republic.</li>
  <li>If you do not report the crime, you can seek medical attention, but if it is due to RSA the hospital have an obligation to report it to the authorities and refer to the SVU. At any point, victims of RSA may decline to take the police report forward.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, including the Dominican Republic, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>, or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened.  However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Reporting the crime in Dominican Republic - what happens next?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence.</li>
  <li>If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages.</li>
  <li>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to make a statement about the incident including a description of the attacker(s).</p>

<p>The police/District Attorney will keep any clothes or electronic equipment, which may be evidence of your attack to present to a forensic examiner.</p>

<p>The police will refer you to the nearest SVU after taking an initial report. There are SVUs located throughout the country.</p>

<p>In the Dominican Republic, local police/District Attorney will not as a matter of course inform UK police nor ask UK police to undertake police checks on the victim.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>The medical examination – what to expect</h3>

<p>Medical treatment for RSA victims is available from the SVU. It is mandatory in the Dominican Republic that hospitals report any RSA cases they receive to the District Attorney’s Office. These cases will also be a referred to the nearest SVU.</p>

<p>Medical examinations are performed with the victim’s consent, by the Forensic Doctor at the SVU as part of their RSA protocol. The victim can request to be examined by a male or female doctor and the SVU may provide for this, subject to availability.</p>

<p>The examiner will ask some questions and may take photographs of any injuries. During the examination, s/he will normally check the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bruising and external injuries on all areas of the body</li>
  <li>internal injuries by examination and internal swabs</li>
  <li>possible DNA testing and tests relating to date rape drugs or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).</li>
</ul>

<p>A consular officer may be able to accompany you during your visits to the SVU, where timing and location allow. Also, local tour operators are likely to assist.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Treatment</h3>

<p>If you seek medical attention due to RSA, the hospital will have to report it to the authorities and refer you to the nearest Special Victims Unit (SVU), where post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment is part of their protocol. The PEP kit will be provided at a local nearby hospital indicated by the SVU. This is medically prescribed and you will have to follow the recommendations provided.</p>

<ul>
  <li>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28-day treatment on return to the UK.</li>
  <li>Emergency contraception can be purchased at a local pharmacy over the counter. It is also part of the PEP kit provided by the SVU protocol, in which case it would bear no cost.</li>
  <li>Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</li>
  <li>Hospital treatment and tests have no cost when provided within the SVU protocol. If these are obtained on a private basis, they will bear a cost and the incident may be reported to the authorities by the hospital.</li>
  <li>If you have had medication administered overseas, you should keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Police investigations in Dominican Republic – what to expect</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The police may take the victim to the scene of the crime, or where the victim thinks the attacker is located, to try to identify and arrest the person, if they deem this necessary as this could help the investigation.</li>
  <li>If a suspect is brought to the police station, the victim will be asked to make an identification.</li>
  <li>If the police make an arrest, they take the suspect before the District Attorney The District Attorney should present the case to the court within 48 hours.</li>
  <li>The victim will have to file a report with the District Attorney to complete the SVU protocol. Although not obligatory, the victim may appoint a lawyer to continue with the judicial process from there on. Lawyers in Dominican Republic generally do not offer pro bono service.</li>
  <li>The victim may leave the country once the case is filed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Court procedures – what to expect</h3>

<ul>
  <li>· If a suspect is ordered to trial the victim may have to testify in court. The victim may be able to testify from the UK via the Dominican Embassy and this would be arranged by the District Attorney’s office.</li>
  <li>· Though victims are not required to appoint a local lawyer, he/she will be able to follow up on the process and keep the victim informed when the local judicial system’s workload may result in delays on the delivery of updates. They will also be able to submit or make requests to the court.</li>
  <li>· The charge of rape is an automatic state prosecution that cannot be dropped.</li>
  <li>· The alleged assailant is able to press counter charges claiming false accusations.</li>
  <li>· The courts do not order the offender to pay compensation for any injuries or losses after they have been convicted in a criminal court.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Additional Legal information</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>How can my case be taken to trial?</h3>

In this case, the court issues an arrest warrant. If the perpetrator is found and arrested, the District Attorney’s office will arrange for the victim to identify them. If the victim has left the country this could be done remotely.</li>
  <li>The Judge can either instruct the suspect’s imprisonment or release them on bail, pending trial.</li>

  <li>Both the defendant and the District Attorney can appeal a sentence. Sentences can be appealed in three instances: Court of Appeals; Supreme Court of Justice; Constitutional Court. The basis to appeal is established in the law. Appeals trials generally do not have a set number of hearings.</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Communication</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The District Attorney’s Office should maintain contact with the victim as and when necessary. Communications will be in Spanish.

  <li>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you. You should do this even if you have been tested in the country that the assault took place in.</li>
  <li>It is your choice to let people know. If you are ready to talk about it, there are organisations in the UK that may be able to help you. They can be found on: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/victim-of-rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a>.</li>
