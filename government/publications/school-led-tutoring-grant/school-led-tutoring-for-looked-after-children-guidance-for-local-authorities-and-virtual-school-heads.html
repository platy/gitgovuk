<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This guidance provides additional information to local authorities and Virtual School Heads (<abbr title="Virtual School Heads">VSHs</abbr>) on how to manage the school-led tutoring grant in relation to looked after children (<abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr>).</p>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with the following:</p>

<h2>School-led tutoring grant</h2>

<p>School-led tutoring (<abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr>) grant is part of the tuition offer from the National Tutoring Programme (<abbr title="National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr>) and it is intended to help close the education gap which widened as a result of COVID-19. Schools have received a ring-fenced <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> grant for around 60% of pupils eligible for the Pupil Premium. They can source their own tutoring provision to support disadvantaged and vulnerable pupils catch up on their learning using either internal school staff or external tutoring provision.</p>

<p>Local authorities have also been provided with <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> funding for their <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils. This guidance sets out how we expect local authorities to use this <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> funding for <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils, and should be read in conjunction with the documents linked to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#overview">overview</a>.</p>

<h2>Funding allocations</h2>

<p>Allocations are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant"><abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> allocations</a>. The allocation for each local authority can be found in the tab entitled ‘<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> summary’, column F titled ‘<abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> paid to <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’ which sets out the specific amounts of funding for <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils.</p>

<p>Allocations are calculated on the basis that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the academic year 2021 to 2022, the grant provided has been calculated to cover 75% of the cost of tuition, based on an average cost of £18 per hour and a pupil receiving a package of 15 hours of tuition, totalling £202.50 per pupil</li>
  <li>from the average cost of £18 per hour, per pupil, we will provide a maximum of £13.50 for tutoring and the <abbr title="Virtual School Heads">VSHs</abbr> will be required to contribute the remaining £4.50 from their Pupil Premium Plus funding</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Virtual School Heads">VSHs</abbr> can offer provision at a lower rate than £18, in which case we will fund 75% of that cost or, if needed, at a higher unit rate than £18 but they will need to cover the costs beyond £13.50</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional weighting has been applied to the following institutions in recognition of the higher per pupil costs they face for tutoring. Eligible pupils who attend any of these institutions will receive a higher rate of funding.</p>

<p>Pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>) who attend a mainstream school are only eligible for the standard rate of funding.</p>

<p>Institutions eligible for the higher rate of funding include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authority-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>special academies and free schools</li>
  <li>special schools not maintained by a local authority, including independent special 
 schools where the placement is funded by the local authority</li>
  <li>pupil referral units</li>
  <li>alternative provision academies and free schools</li>
  <li>local authority-maintained hospital schools and academies</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> units within mainstream schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Funding is based on the average cost of £47, we will provide a maximum of £35.25 per pupil per hour and <abbr title="Virtual School Heads">VSHs</abbr> will be required to contribute the remaining £11.75 from their Pupil Premium Plus budget.</p>

<p>To date, all <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils have been paid based on the £18 per pupil, per hour unit cost. We will provide an uplift to reflect the higher rate of funding to eligible <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils in the April 2022 payment. This will be backdated for the two previous payments in September and December 2021. To provide clarity we will publish allocations in April 2022 which will show the split of the funding for both mainstream funded and <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> funded <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils.</p>

<h2>Conditions of funding</h2>

<p>The full <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant">conditions of grant</a> are published separately. Local authorities should note the following conditions in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allocations in the academic year 2021 to 2022 are ring-fenced for expenditure on <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> only and must be used within that academic year</li>
  <li>use of the grant is voluntary, however, should local authorities decide not to use some or all of the <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> grant allocated to them <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> will recover the unspent amount back as an overpayment</li>
  <li>the funding is provided to cover 75% of the anticipated costs, local authorities must contribute 25% of the costs from their own budgets, with a maximum of £13.50 per hour for mainstream pupils and a maximum of £35.25 per hour for pupils in special schools</li>
  <li>local authorities must complete and return a year-end statement detailing expenditure even if they choose not to use all or some of the school-led tutoring grant</li>
  <li>local authorities will need to complete the year-end statement via an online form to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> which will become available in June 2022, further information about this process will be available in the coming months</li>
</ul>

<p>We understand that tuition provision is a routine intervention which is commonly used by <abbr title="Virtual School Heads">VSHs</abbr> for their <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils and is funded by their Pupil Premium Plus funding. However, any tuition funded by the <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> grant must be in addition to this provision.</p>

<h2>Use of <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> for <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils and the role of Virtual School Heads</h2>

<p>We expect local authorities to pass the <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> funding for their <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils to their <abbr title="Virtual School Head">VSH</abbr>. The <abbr title="Virtual School Head">VSH</abbr> should decide, in line with the <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> guidance, how best to use the funding to provide tuition support for the pupils they are responsible for, working with relevant schools as necessary. Tuition support can include interventions which support improving educational attainment, for example, English for speakers of other languages (<abbr title="English for speakers of other languages">ESOL</abbr>) where subjects such as maths and English may not be appropriate.</p>

<p>It will be the responsibility of the <abbr title="Virtual School Head">VSH</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decide which <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils to support, how many hours tuition they will receive and the subjects - we expect that this will be done in close cooperation with appropriate schools as necessary</li>
  <li>comply with the conditions of grant, in particular:
    <ul>
      <li>the requirement to contribute 25% of the cost of tuition</li>
      <li>the requirement to comply with the data collection requirements by completing the year-end statement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We understand that in some cases <abbr title="Virtual School Heads">VSHs</abbr> will want the flexibility to pass on funding directly to the relevant schools who will be able to arrange tuition provision locally. However, it is important to remember that the <abbr title="Virtual School Head">VSH</abbr> will still be responsible for contributing the required 25% and completing the year-end statement to report the use of the grant (not the school).</p>

<h2>Data collection via the school-led tutoring year-end statement</h2>

<p>In June 2022, <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> will release the school-led tutoring year-end statement, and all local authorities (via their <abbr title="Virtual School Heads">VSHs</abbr>) will be expected to complete and return the statement detailing how much tuition has been delivered for <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils in relation to the <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> grant provided. This is a mandatory return. Whilst the final form is not currently available, to help <abbr title="Virtual School Heads">VSHs</abbr> prepare, we will ask for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the total amount your local authority has spent on school-led tutoring for <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils in the academic year 2021 to 2022 (by mainstream funded pupils and specialist provision funded pupils)</li>
  <li>the total number of <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils who have received tuition through the school-led tutoring grant in the academic year 2021 to 2022</li>
  <li>the total number of hours of funded tuition through the school-led tutoring grant funding in the academic year 2021 to 2022 (hours by of mainstream funded <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils and specialist funded <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils)</li>
  <li>confirmation that the information outlined is correct and you have met the conditions of the grant</li>
</ul>

<p>This form is expected to go live in June 2022 and information will become in the coming months. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/schools/school-led-tutoring/frequently-asked-questions/" rel="external">National Tutoring Programme frequently asked questions</a> are also updated regularly. All <abbr title="Virtual School Heads">VSHs</abbr> will be required to complete this form for their <abbr title="looked after children">LAC</abbr> pupils by the end of July 2022, even if they decided not to use all or some of the school-led tutoring grant.</p>

<h2>Calculating overpayments</h2>

<p>Where funding is not utilised fully (or at all) it will be recovered from the local authority by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> as an underspend after the end of this academic year (2021 to 2022) and this will be offset against future payments.</p>

<p>We will use the information provided in the year-end statement to calculate this. Refer to the ‘calculating overpayments’ section in the <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> guidance for further information including detailed examples which set out how overpayment will be calculated in different scenarios.</p>

<h2>Audit</h2>

<p><abbr title="Virtual School Heads">VSHs</abbr> are expected to keep records of all payments related to the <abbr title="school-led tutoring">SLT</abbr> grant. These will be required in the event of an audit. Any audit will occur between the department and the local authority.</p>
