<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make decisions about whether and how to seek medical advice and attention; report to local police; and engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</p>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the emergency/rescue number 112, public ambulance on 103 or police on  102 (if you do not speak Russian or Kazakh you will need somebody’s assistance to make a call)</li>
  <li>contact the 24/7 confidential helpline 150 or WhatsApp +77081060810 to speak to a trained adviser, who can offer general support, advice on next steps, legal and psychological assistance (if you do not speak Russian or Kazakh you will need somebody’s assistance to make a call)</li>
  <li>contact the helpline aimed at underage victims of domestic or sexual violence on 111 (if you do not speak Russian or Kazakh you will need somebody’s assistance to make a call)</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-nur-sultan">British Embassy Nur-Sultan</a>. Our telephone number is +7 7172 556200. Embassy staff will be patient, sensitive and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information on British Embassy Nur-Sultan can be found on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-nur-sultan">website</a>.</p>

<h2>Reporting the incident to the police in Kazakhstan</h2>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator and you are in an area where there is a British embassy or consulate they will try to send a consular officer to support you.</p>

<p>You do not have to report the rape or sexual assault to the police, however if you would like it to be investigated, you will need to report it to the nearest police station. The duty police officer must accept reports of crime 24/7 regardless of where the crime took place and when.</p>

<p>You can report the crime by calling 102 and you can request the police to come and take measures against the offender if required. Anonymous reports over the phone will be registered too, but cannot be used to initiate a criminal investigation.</p>

<p>The ambulance will notify the police in most rape or sexual assault cases, but you will be able to decide on whether you want to officially report the crime or not.</p>

<p>Reporting crimes to the police in Kazakhstan can be a complex and time consuming process, you should be prepared to spend several hours in the police station. Local officers may not have specific training in supporting victims of sexual assault.</p>

<p>You may find the process of reporting the assault difficult at times, and quite different from what you would expect of UK police procedures.</p>

<p>Rape and sexual assault are both criminal offences in Kazakhstan, but conviction rates remain low, and judicial proceedings are likely to be protracted. It is very likely that victims will be asked to testify in front of third parties, and there is no legislation to punish those violating the confidentiality of a victim.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is not a crime but may be perceived negatively. A victim can be criticised if drugs or alcohol were involved.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so that forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence.</p>

<p>If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the British Embassy or you can contact the Embassy yourself. If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you.</p>

<p>If you do not have a tour operator and you are in an area reachable by the British Embassy we will try to send a consular officer to support you.</p>

<p>Consular staff can accompany you to the police station should you so wish and where possible. However, we cannot provide interpretation and might not be allowed to stay with you during a police interview.</p>

<p>You can request to be interviewed by a police officer of a particular gender although there is no guarantee one will be available. It is very rare that local police officers speak English.</p>

<p>An interpreter can be provided by the local police but this may take long time to arrange and there is no guarantee of quality of translation. In order to save time, you may consider having your own interpreter with you when you visit the police station.</p>

<p>The British Embassy Nur-Sultan can provide you with a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/kazakhstan-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">local interpreters</a>.</p>

<p>Once an initial verbal report is made to the police, you will be required to give a full statement. Not all police stations will have private rooms for taking a statement. Generally, interviews will take place in the office of the duty investigators and there are likely to be several people working in one office.</p>

<p>You will be told to sign your statement so make sure you understand what you are signing. There have been cases when victims complained that police put pressure on them, so you may want to consider having a lawyer or someone else accompany you.</p>

<p>You should insist the police give you a copy of the report, and request a translation in English, this however may not be readily available in Kazakhstan. Get the copy of your written statement describing the incident signed by the police officer once you submit the original, and retain the copy.</p>

<p>The police officer will register the crime report and should issue you a paper slip with a reference number of the case. Ask the police officer to write down the phone number of the relevant department that will be dealing with your case so you can contact them later for updates.</p>

<p>The case will be cascaded to other departments, therefore, you may have to make a statement several times and sometimes visit the incident site together with the police officers.</p>

<p>All your clothes you had at the time of attack will be kept by the police as an evidence and will be sent for forensic examination. The police will send you to the local hospital or a forensic examination centre if you haven’t sought medical assistance in the first instance.</p>

<p>You will be required to undergo a series of tests, including gynaecologist, external injuries examination, swabs and STI tests. The results of the examination will be reflected in a separate protocol and photographic evidence of face and body injuries will be taken.</p>

<p>You will not have to surrender your passport whilst the investigation is carried out. The police will take a copy of your passport and full contact details.</p>

<h3>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Kazakhstan</h3>

<p>The British Embassy Nur-Sultan will be able to help you. This includes helping you make arrangements to contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK. They can provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with one, you can report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital.</p>

<p>Consular staff can accompany you to the hospital should you wish so and where possible. In the interests of patient confidentiality, we will wait in reception during your medical examination.</p>

<p>It is your choice whether to report the crime, but if you do not report it, forensic evidence will not be collected and your case may not be investigated without it. You have to report the crime in-country for it to be investigated.</p>

<p>Even if you do not report the crime, you are still able to get medical attention.  You should go to the nearest hospital, a local doctor or gynaecologist, but you will not be entitled to a forensic examination. You would be asked by the doctor whether or not you wish to report the crime.</p>

<h2>Reporting the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>It is possible to report the crime to police in the UK. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction. UK police forces cannot investigate crimes committed overseas.</p>

<p>Foreign police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed and is a very lengthy process. It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be accessed without reporting the crime locally. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a> after rape or sexual assault abroad for more information.</p>

<h2>The medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<p>Hospitals in Kazakhstan tend to specialise in specific areas of health, however they are generally able to refer patients to facilities with relevant specialists. There are several medical clinics most commonly used by foreigners that are able to offer medical support to victims of rape and sexual assault.</p>

<p>They can offer medical support including external injuries examination, gynaecological examination with swabs and tests on STIs (sexually-transmitted infection). The Embassy can provide you with a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/kazakhstan-list-of-medical-facilities">list of medical facilities in Kazakhstan</a>.</p>

<p>Some medical practices will automatically pass details of people they believe to be victims of rape or sexual assault to the police. The British Embassy Nur-Sultan can talk to local healthcare providers on your behalf to check a clinic’s policy in this matter before you attend the clinic.</p>

<p>Hospital medical staff can give you advice on HIV PEP medication (‘Post-exposure prophylaxis’, a treatment that can prevent HIV infection) should you or they feel it is necessary. PEP is available via the Centres on Prevention and Control of AIDS in each city.</p>

<p>The centres provide PEP therapy free of charge but the patient will have to meet the cost for the testing. HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK. More information on risks is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/" rel="external">NHS website</a>.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception can be obtained from a pharmacy, though you may require a prescription and it is not free. Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</p>

<p>Abortion is available in Kazakhstan for a gestational period up to 12 weeks for non-medical reasons, up to 22 weeks for family/societal reasons. This period can be extended if there are medical complications.</p>

<p>Emergency medical assistance is free of charge in Kazakhstan, any subsequent treatment will be charged in accordance with hospitals price list. Most hospitals accept payment by card, though some local hospitals may accept only cash payments in local currency.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered whilst overseas, keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication and let your local UK health provider know.</p>

<h2>Police investigations in Kazakhstan: what to expect</h2>

<p>After you report the crime and with enough evidence to initiate investigation, the case will be registered and assigned to an investigator.</p>

<p>When the investigating authorities are satisfied with the evidence, they issue a statement to officially recognise you as a victim.</p>

<p>You have the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>know if the charges or allegations have been pressed against the suspect</li>
  <li>testify in your own language and be provided with a translator</li>
  <li>provide evidence and make requests (pleadings)</li>
  <li>have a representative or lawyer</li>
  <li>have access to the investigation reports and all case materials after the end of pre-trial investigation</li>
</ul>

<p>Police may take you to the crime scene to get more details on the incident. They may interview the suspect at the same time and you can meet in the corridors or waiting areas of the police station.</p>

<p>You will be asked to identify a suspect at the police station. Many police stations do not have two way mirrors installed so it is likely that you will be asked to make an identification face to face. You will also be required to attend a face-to-face questioning with the suspect. It is therefore recommended to have a legal representative with you.</p>

<p>Criminal investigations in Kazakhstan tend to progress very slowly. If someone is arrested under suspicion of criminal offence, they may be detained without charges for no longer than 48 hours (or 72 in some cases).</p>

<p>After that the suspect will be released unless, and depending on the circumstances, the court sanctions arrest of the suspect for the duration of investigation. In some cases, mainly when the abuser is the victim’s partner or spouse, the police can issue a restraining order up to 30 days.</p>

<p>You are entitled to be aware of the case developments. However, having legal representation from the early stages of a case increases the likelihood that your rights will be respected during initial interviews with police and further investigation stages.</p>

<p>The lawyer can speak before the prosecutor on behalf of the victim, but personal presence may still be required. The lawyer will be able to request access to the case materials such as case notes, expertise results etc.</p>

<p>The British embassy can provide you the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers&amp;country=Kazakhstan" rel="external">list of local English speaking lawyers</a>. Some lawyers can offer pro-bono services, or you can request a state appointed lawyer. Your presence in country may be required throughout the investigation. If you leave the country this may trigger the closure of the case.</p>

<p>It is your choice if you would like to seek help from or involve other organisations such as for example the NGO ‘Ne molchi’ (Don’t be silent) to represent you or advise on the legal process.</p>

<p>The investigations of rape and sexual assault cases often take longer than it is expected due to the various complications and can take several months before reaching the trial stage. The investigator with clearance from the public prosecutor may request to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extend the period of the investigation, e.g. when further expertise is required</li>
  <li>file the case, if there are insufficient grounds or evidence to prosecute</li>
  <li>order a trial</li>
</ul>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>Rape and sexual assault charges are regulated under Articles of 120-124 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In 2019 rape and sexual assault have been re-classified from medium gravity to serious offences category with charges of 5 to 8 years of imprisonment for rape, 9 to 15 years in case of aggravating circumstances, 15 to 20 years if the victim is under age of 18, and up to a life sentence if the crime is committed against a child under 14 years old.</p>

<p>The judge can order the offender to pay compensation to the victim of rape and sexual violence including for emotional trauma. Settlement between the parties in rape cases is not allowed.</p>

<p>If the case goes to trial, you will be expected to testify in court. Testimony will be in front of the suspect. Questions are often asked around the details of sexual acts and might be uncomfortable. In local law the absence of consent is considered as rape, however in practice the absence of torn clothes or physical injury may be seen as consent, although in all cases it will be subject to investigation.</p>

<p>The suspect’s family members are allowed to attend the court hearing. There is rarely more than one entrance to a court building so victims and suspects might meet around the building.</p>

<p>If the case is referred for further investigation, you might have to give an additional statement. If you wish, it is possible to drop charges once they are filed by providing a written statement and explaining the reasons behind your decision.</p>

<p>The charge of rape is not an automatic state prosecution in Kazakhstan and when the victim drops charges the criminal case is often terminated by the authorities.</p>

<p>It is illegal in Kazakhstan to make false statements or accusations. Therefore the suspect may press counter charges against you claiming that you have made false accusations, including during the investigation stage. The court will investigate these claims and decide on proceedings.</p>

<p>If you do not speak Kazakh or Russian, a translator will be provided by the court and you should inform them of this requirement in advance to allow them to make suitable arrangements. You can also have your own interpreter. The Embassy can provide a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/kazakhstan-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">list of translators and interpreters</a>.</p>

<p>Consular staff will not normally be able to attend the trial with you. You may wish to be accompanied by a friend or member of your family for the court hearing.</p>

<p>Victims of criminal offences are eligible for a state-funded compensation scheme from the Victims Support Fund depending on the crime committed against them. You will not receive it automatically, but will need to apply for it. Depending on the charges, the compensation may vary between 30 and 50 monthly calculation index (MCI in 2022 is 3180 KZT).</p>

<p>Personal information of the victim may be shared illegally with other parties and it is not rare that victims suffer from psychological pressure from investigating authorities, suspect and their family. Rape cases often become hot topics in social media and depending on the circumstances and information available, the general public may be quick to judge and criticise the victim.</p>

<p>However, lately and with help of NGOs raising awareness of sexual and domestic abuse, people tend to be on the victim’s side.</p>

<h2>When you return to the UK</h2>

<p>Read our advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">returning to the UK after rape and sexual assault abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice.</p>

<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually-transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you, even if you have been tested in the country where the assault took place.</p>

<p>The Kazakh police will not inform UK police of a crime.</p>

<h2>Support organisations in Kazakhstan and UK</h2>

<p>It is your choice whether you let people know. If you are ready to talk about it, the following organisations may be able to help you. Some of these organisations can offer psychological or legal support, some will be able to represent and act as your defender in a court, or provide shelter.</p>

<p>There are crisis centres for women and children in each big city in Kazakhstan, below are the contact details of some of the centres. The centres have limited capacity to shelter victims of sexual and domestic abuse for up to 6 months.</p>

<p>Crisis centres cannot accommodate male victims but would still be able to provide psychological support and legal advice. State supported crisis centres can accommodate victims only if the case has been reported to the Police, private shelters will not require the victim to report to the Police.</p>

<p>Each region has a Commission for women, family and demographic policy, that can also provide support.</p>

<p>Assistance may not be available in English, so you will need help of Russian or Kazakh speaker or a translator.</p>
