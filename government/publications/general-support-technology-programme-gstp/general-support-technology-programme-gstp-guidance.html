<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>The General Support Technology Programme addresses new needs and emerging applications. Its objectives are to enable activities at ESA and National Programmes by developing technology, to support the competitiveness of UK and European industry, foster innovation and transfer non-space technology (spin-in) to use in the design of new space systems and enhance European technology non-dependence and the availability of European resources for critical technologies.</p>

<p>The GSTP is split in to three elements:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK has subscribed €40m at the 2019 Space19+ to the ESA General Support Technology Programme.  This programme covers all technology projects (with the exception of Telecoms payloads).</p>

<p>There are two basic routes through which GSTP projects are initiated;</p>

<p>1 .	The classic route is activities proposed by ESA, these are listed in themed compendia which are available online on ESA’s online tendering system ESA STAR <a class="govuk-link" href="https://esastar-publication-ext.sso.esa.int/" rel="external">https://esastar-publication-ext.sso.esa.int/</a> under ‘Publications’. Projects which attract the interest of one or more Member States are then generally proposed for approval by the ESA Industrial Policy Committee (IPC), following which Member States are invited to subscribe funding to individual activities within a relatively short timescale. An ITT (or in some cases direct negotiation) will then be initiated by ESA and these can also be found on ESA STAR.</p>

<p>Please note - Member States endorse the project - not the company that has indicated interest in the activity.</p>

<p>2 .	The second route, which is becoming increasingly popular, is for activities that are proposed directly by companies (including start-ups and SMEs) or research organisations, these proposals must be supported by the Member State; unsolicited applications directly to ESA will not be considered. These consist of smaller de-risk activities (up to €200k) and building block activities (up to €500k). These are not subject to IPC approval, however, larger projects will require match funding and approval by IPC.</p>

<p>Request for support for these activities (from January 2022) will be reviewed twice per year by the UKSA GSTP Review Panel</p>

<p>To endorse a potential UK project UKSA needs to appraise its merit. The governance procedure looks at projects proposed and decides whether to reject, accept, or review them pending further information.</p>

<p>The procedure takes account of the way in which GSTP is run by ESA, and ensures that robust, but timely, decisions can be made to underpin an optimum portfolio of UK projects.</p>

<p>Proposals may be made by collaborations, across industry with or without academic institutions’ involvement, which may include involvement of companies and organisations from other ESA Member States. However, should a collaboration include a party from another Member State that participant will need to secure their delegate’s support for their financial share.</p>

<p>Discussions are also welcomed regarding proposals that fall into Elements 2 and 3.</p>

<p>A completed Statement of Interest form must be submitted for each GSTP funding proposal, including all follow-on activities. </p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Procedure</h2>

<p>1 .	UK industry including start-ups and SMEs, universities and research organisations are invited to engage with the UKSA GSTP team to discuss their areas of interest including activities listed in the GSTP compendia, De-risk and Building Block activities and ITTs that have been issued and any other potential activities that are likely to sit in either Element 2 or 3. When contacting the UKSA GSTP team they will be required to supply a completed Expression of Interest (EOI) form which can be found on the UK Space Agency website.</p>

<p>2 .	De-risk activities are smaller projects with a maximum level of support of €200k and Building Block activities have a maximum support level of €500k – the panel will consider support for these activities twice per year, as indicated in GSTP Statement of Interest Submission Dates document</p>

<p>De-risk activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Smaller activities with the aim to unblock barriers in the way of larger critical technologies</li>
  <li>All contracts are under €200k (or under €80k for studies)</li>
  <li>Projects can last a maximum of nine months</li>
  <li>Initial activity is fully funded</li>
  <li>Match funding of up to 50% will be required for the follow-on activity, which is subject to discussion with the GSTP Programme Lead</li>
</ul>

<p>Activities include at least one of the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analysis of specifications, development actions, schedule and cost</li>
  <li>Assessment of the benefits and disadvantages of the solution with respect to the state-of-the-art</li>
  <li>Assessment of critical issues related to using a given technology for a specific application, using analysis/simulation and/or breadboarding</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no guarantee that the follow-on activity will be supported, as this is dependent on the view of the Review Panel once the Statement of Interest (SOI) for the follow-on activity has been received and assessed, as well as the recommendation received from the ESA technical department.</p>

<p>Building Block activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Targets the building of capabilities</li>
  <li>To prepare and develop enabling capabilities and the associated building blocks for space related systems and the associated sub-systems</li>
  <li>Up to €500k per activity</li>
  <li>Up to 18 months</li>
  <li>Nominal technology development activities, with typical deliverables</li>
</ul>

<p>3 .	All activities must now have a minimum start level of TRL 3, any requests for support for activities with a lower TRL will be declined without being evaluated by the GSTP Review Panel.</p>

<p>An alternative support mechanism for lower TRL activities, is the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ideas.esa.int/servlet/hype/IMT?documentTableId=45087648409564402&amp;userAction=Browse&amp;templateName=&amp;documentId=d43f47acc4ff42c1a58d463ce4518622" rel="external">ESA Open Discovery Ideas Channel</a> which supports co-funded research, early technology developments and system studies. The ESA panel meets monthly, which enables applications to be fast tracked and applications do not require the UK delegate’s support.</p>

<p>4 .	Once a completed SOI form has been submitted this will be assessed by the GSTP Review Panel. Review panel meetings will be held a minimum of four times per year.</p>

<p>5 .	Programme Leads from across UKSA, including members of the technology team will form the basis of the Review Panel, which will consist of between five and seven participants. The panel is chaired by the GSTP Programme Lead.</p>

<p>6 .	Where a proposal has been received which does not relate to a Compendium activity or an ITT, section 2 of the SOI will be reviewed by the ESA Technical Team, who will provide an initial assessment for consideration by the panel once the panel has reviewed the information contained in section 1 of the SOI.</p>

<p>7 .	The panel will be responsible for recommending which projects UKSA should support through the GSTP programme with the final decision being made by the UKSA GSTP Team in accordance with the Technology Team’s strategic priorities.</p>

<p>Please note that you may be required to appear before the GSTP Review panel via MS Teams to respond to any questions and/or provide a short presentation relating to the proposal.</p>

<p>If you are not available to appear before the panel on the dates advertised please do not apply for support.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Application Process</h2>

<p>Step 1</p>

<p>Submission of a completed Expression of Interest (EOI) document followed by an initial conversation with the GSTP programme lead.</p>

<p>Step 2</p>

<p>Submission of a correctly completed Statement of Interest (SOI) application form outlining the proposed project should be to the GSTP programme lead.This must provide factual evidence to support the answer to each question.</p>

<p>Section 1</p>

<p>This must be completed for all applications and it will be assessed by the GSTP Review Panel, which consists of up to seven programme leads from across the UK Space Agency, external reviewers are not used. The panel meets every two months and all dates relating to submission of documentation, the panel convening and expected response dates can be found on the UK Space Agency website.</p>

<p>Section 2</p>

<p>This section should only be completed if support is being sought for a De-risk activity, De-risk follow-on activity, Building Block activity, Element 2 or 3 proposal. This section will be reviewed by the ESA Technical Department, who will provide the GSTP programme lead with a recommendation as to whether the proposal should be supported from a technical viewpoint.
Section 2 should NOT be completed when responding to an activity listed in the Compendia or an ITT.</p>

<p>Step 3</p>

<p>Completed SOI proformas should be submitted electronically in Word format to either the GSTP programme lead or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:gstp@ukspaceagency.gov.uk">gstp@ukspaceagency.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Step 4</p>

<p>You will be informed of the outcome once your proposal has been considered by the panel. A final decision will not be made regarding De-risk, Building Block, Element 2 and Element 3 proposals until the panel has considered the recommendation received from the relevant ESA Technical Department.</p>

<p>Please note that the timescale for a decision may be in the region of 3 – 6 months after the panel has convened if a recommendation is required from ESA regarding the technical viability of a proposal before a final decision will be made.</p>

<p>Please ensure that your application form is fully completed and it does not exceed the maximum number of pages stated on the application form. Annexes are permitted but may not be reviewed by the panel due to the high number of applications being assessed.</p>

<p>The decision of the UK Space Agency is final and there are no grounds for appeal. Feedback will not be provided. <br>
SOIs are required by UKSA to help plan its investment in the ESA GSTP programme. The information provided will be treated as commercially sensitive, but may be used within the UK Space Agency to enhance awareness of UK capabilities. The relevant parties will be fully consulted prior to publication of any part of the information contained therein.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Successful Proposals</h2>

<p>If you are successful in securing UKSA’s support for the proposed activity, you will be required to:</p>

<p>1 .	Inform the GSTP Lead within 5 working days that contracts have been finalised with ESA and the anticipated start date of the project.</p>

<p>2 .	Submit monthly progress reports (a template will be provided) in a timely manner to the GSTP Programme Lead.</p>

<p>3 .	Provide an end of project closure report (a template will be provided) to the GSTP Programme Lead within one month of completion of the project.</p>

<p>4 .	Ensure that the GSTP Programme  Lead is invited to attend the project closure meeting with ESA.</p>

<p>These requirements apply to all projects where support has been secured through GSTP.</p>
