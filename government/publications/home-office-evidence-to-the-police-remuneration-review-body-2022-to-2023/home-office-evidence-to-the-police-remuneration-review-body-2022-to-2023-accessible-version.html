<h2>I. Executive summary</h2>

<p>1. The Government recognises the determination and commitment shown by police officers across the country. Police officers have played a crucial role in helping stop the spread of the coronavirus, working to enforce the Covid-19 regulations to protect the public while continuing with investigations and keeping our streets safe.</p>

<p>2. The Chancellor announced at the last Spending Review that the pay pause has ended and public sector workers will see pay rises over the next three years as the recovery in the economy and labour market allows the Government to return to a normal pay setting process.</p>

<p>3. The Government is committed to supporting the police and giving them the resources that they need to protect the public and has committed to recruiting 20,000 additional police officers. As at 31 December 2021, over 11,000 additional police officers have been recruited through the Police Uplift Programme. The Government remains on track to meet its target of 12,000 officers by March 2022 with the remaining officers towards the target of 20,000 additional officers set to be recruited by March 2023.</p>

<p>4. Cutting crime is a priority for the Government and is central to the mission of levelling up the country. The ‘Beating Crime Plan’ sets out the Government’s strategic approach to cutting crime: cutting homicide, serious violence and neighbourhood crime; exposing and ending hidden harms; and building capability and capacity to deal with fraud and online crime. A skilled and motivated police workforce is integral to the delivery of the plan.</p>

<p>5. The Government has published a total police funding settlement of up to £16.9 billion for policing in 2022/23. This includes funding to PCCs, counter-terrorism policing and national priorities, such as dismantling County Lines and reducing violent crime. Overall funding available to PCCs will increase by up to £796 million next year - an increase of up to 5.8% when compared to the 2021/22 funding settlement – if PCCs make full use of their flexibility to increase precept.</p>

<p>6. The Home Secretary’s remit letter refers the following matters to the PRRB in the 2022/23 pay round:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to apply the pay award for 2022/23 for police officers of all ranks, including chief officers</li>
  <li>to provide commentary and observations on the National Police Chiefs’ Council’s reference document that will provide a detailed explanation of: the methodologies used to benchmark the pay of all ranks including chief officers; the factors used to determine the P-factor and the methodology used to value it; the interaction of benchmarking and the P-factor; its overall purpose; and example calculations, addressing the points raised in your last report</li>
  <li>to provide updated views on force readiness to implement the pay progression standard</li>
</ul>

<h2>II. Pay proposals</h2>

<p>7. The Chancellor announced at the last Spending Review that the pay pause has ended and public sector workers will see pay rises over the next three years as the recovery in the economy and labour market allows the Government to return to a normal pay setting process. The PRRB is asked to consider HM Treasury’s ‘Economic Evidence to the Pay Review Bodies’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> that sets out the economic, labour market and fiscal context when making its recommendations on pay awards for 2022/23.</p>

<p>8. The Government must balance the need to ensure fair pay for public sector workers
with protecting funding for frontline services, including the police service, which plays a vital part in the criminal justice system, and ensuring affordability for taxpayers. We must ensure that the affordability of a pay award is taken into consideration so that police forces are able to maximise the number of additional officers that they can recruit and ensure the ambition to recruit 20,000 officers by March 2023 is met.</p>

<p>9. Overall, entry level recruitment remains strong with enough officers being recruited to backfill vacancies and deliver the uplift. Some forces are also delivering on plans to recruit officers outside of the uplift through local council tax precept. As the Police Uplift Programme enters its final year in 2022/23, it is important that the total pay and reward package remains competitive against other apprentice and graduate labour markets to ensure the ambitious target to recruit 8,000 additional officers is met.</p>

<p>10. Retention of experienced officers is just as important. Cutting crime is high priority for the Government and is central to the mission of levelling up the country. The ‘Beating Crime Plan’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> introduces bold new measures to drive down crime and requires a skilled and motivated police workforce. We note the PRRB’s comments in its last report that decreasing pay differentials with comparator groups may risk a detrimental effect on the morale and motivation of officers. We welcome updated commentary from the PRRB on this important issue in light of changes to the labour market since its last report.</p>

<h3>Basic pay</h3>

<p>11. The Government has published the police funding settlement for 2022/23. This is met in part by additional Government grant funding, as well as precept flexibility. Our current assessment is that the settlement provides funding for a pay uplift of at least 2% in the 2022/23 financial year, but we look to the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) to make a strong case on affordability if they believe funding for a higher award is available. We ask the PRRB to recommend how to apply the pay award for 2022/23 for police officers of all ranks, including chief officers.</p>

<p>12. There continues to be anecdotal evidence about recruitment difficulties and increased attrition rates for some specialist roles. We have not received robust evidence about the nature of the problem and whether a variable pay award would be appropriate. However, we welcome the NPCC’s ‘strategic assessment of workforce’ that will help to better understand the composition of the current workforce and where there are skills gaps. The assessment will enable the NPCC and policing partners to consider the recruitment challenges ahead and help to ensure that the right skills are developed and retained so that policing is able to respond to changing crime types and demand. It may also help to determine whether pay awards should be targeted at those whose skills are in most demand in future pay rounds. Taking these factors into account, we propose the same pay uplift should be applied to all ranks and pay points in 2022/23.</p>

<p>13. We note the PRRB’s concerns raised in its last report about considering individual pay changes in isolation. We expect to see proposals for changes to the pay structure presented as a coherent package for all ranks. Proposals to make changes to individual pay points in isolation must be supported by robust evidence from the NPCC and APCC that demonstrates why targeted interventions are required in the 2022/23 pay round. The costs associated with any proposals from the NPCC and APCC to change the current pay scales, such as increasing or removing individual pay points, will need to be funded from within the existing allocation and will affect the overall affordability of a pay award.</p>

<p>14. The Government will undertake a further assessment of affordability when the PRRB submits its recommendations. However, it is important to emphasise that pay awards that exceed affordability will require challenging decisions to be taken to re-prioritise resources from elsewhere in policing. The scope to reprioritise funding and resources is limited, especially as PCCs work to deliver an additional 8,000 officers in 2022/23. Further, any recommendation this year will have an impact on future financial years and limit flexibility in later years of the Spending Review period.</p>

<h3>London Weighting and the Dog Handlers’ Allowance</h3>

<p>15. Historically, London Weighting and the Dog Handlers’ Allowance have increased in line with annual pay increases. We ask the PRRB to consider the evidence put forward by policing partners on whether there is a case for increasing these in 2022/23.</p>

<h3>Pay reform</h3>

<p>16. The Government is clear that progress must be made to reform police officer pay. The proposals submitted by the NPCC in the last pay round to introduce a pay progression standard (PPS) are a positive step forward that will help to drive up the importance of PDRs, line management and effective supervision, and officer development. The PRRB’s last report noted concerns around force readiness for the PPS. The NPCC has continued to engage with forces to ensure they are aware of the PPS requirements and implementation dates. We welcome updated views from the PRRB on force readiness to implement the pay progression standard.</p>

<p>17. In the last pay round, the PRRB provided updated commentary and observations on benchmarking and valuation of the P-factor. We agree that the overall purpose of benchmarking and the valuation of the P-Factor must be defined, and the methodologies clear, transparent and robust, and illustrated and described in a way that is accessible to all police officers. We ask the PRRB to provide commentary and observations on the NPCC’s reference document that will provide a detailed explanation of benchmarking and the P-factor, addressing the points raised in its last report.</p>

<h2>III. Context</h2>

<h3>The policing environment</h3>

<p>18. Figures from the survey ‘Crime in England and Wales’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> show that patterns of crime in the year ending June 2021 were significantly affected by Covid-19 and Government instructions to limit social contact. Periods of national lockdown led to decreases in the incidence of many types of crime. This has generally been followed by a return towards previous incidence levels once lockdowns ended.</p>

<p>19. For the year ending June 2021, compared with the pre-Covid-19 year ending June 2019, the survey shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a 12% increase in total crime, driven by a 43% increase in fraud and computer misuse</li>
  <li>a 14% decrease in total crime excluding fraud and computer misuse, largely driven by an 18% decrease in theft offences</li>
  <li>little change in the total number of incidents of violence but a 27% decrease in the number of victims of violent crime, largely driven by falls in violence where the offender was a stranger, in part reflecting the closure of the night-time economy for several months of the year. It is important to note that this is not indicative of levels of domestic abuse during the pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>20. Police recorded crime data also show similar patterns, with overall reductions in the reporting and recording of many crime types during periods of lockdown.</p>

<p>21. While there has been a significant drop in many types of crime as offenders’ movements were limited, there has been an increased demand on police to enforce lockdown restrictions. Criminals also took their activity online and sought to exploit digital opportunities for fraud and crime<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>22. HMICFRS’s ‘State of Policing’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> report, published in July 2021, set out how crime patterns have changed over the last year, with more crime committed online. The report also describes how the pandemic increased vulnerability in other ways, such as lockdowns leading to more calls for help from those suffering from domestic abuse.</p>

<h3>Beating Crime Plan</h3>

<p>23. Cutting crime is a priority for the Government and is central to the mission of levelling up the country. The ‘Beating Crime Plan’ sets out the Government’s strategic approach to cutting crime: cutting homicide, serious violence and neighbourhood crime; exposing and ending hidden harms; and building capability and capacity to deal with fraud and online crime.</p>

<p>24. The Beating Crime Plan spans work across the police, courts, prison and probation service to drive down and prevent crime, improve confidence in the criminal justice system and rehabilitate offenders. It introduces bold new measures to drive down crime, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>reconnecting the police with the public, ensuring every person living in England and Wales will have access to the police digitally through a national online platform, allowing them to access a range of interactive police services in one coordinated place, including details about their neighbourhood police officers and their contact details so that they can raise any concerns with their neighbourhood officers directly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improving the responsiveness of local police to 101 and 999 calls, by working with HMICFRS to develop league tables for answering calls and ensuring that the public know how responsive their local force is when they call them for help</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>intervening early to keep young people safe and away from violence, including a new £17 million package focused on those admitted to A&amp;E with a knife injury or following contact with police</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>investing over £45 million in specialist teams in both mainstream schools and alternative provision in serious violence hotspots, to support young people at risk of involvement in violence to re-engage in education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>expanding the use of electronic monitoring for serious acquisitive offenders to a further 13 police force areas and ensuring that many more neighbourhood criminals have their movements tracked upon release from prison, supporting probation and the police to deter and detect further acquisitive crimes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>trialling the use of alcohol tags, which detect alcohol in the sweat of offenders guilty of drink-fuelled crime, on prison leavers in Wales to help change behaviour and reduce violence and other alcohol related crime</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>encouraging prison leavers to turn their backs on crime by securing employment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>empowering the police to take more knives off the streets and to prevent serious violence by permanently relaxing conditions on the use of section 60 stop and search powers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>expanding the role for Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs), launching the second part of the PCC Review to equip PCCs with the tools and levers they need to drive down crime and anti-social behaviour in their local areas</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>25. A skilled and motivated police workforce is integral to the delivery of the plan. While recruitment and retention are currently healthy overall, we must ensure that pay and reward remains competitive to continue to attract new officers and retain existing officers.</p>

<h3>Police funding</h3>

<p>26. The Government has published a total police funding settlement of up to £16.9 billion for policing in 2022/23<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>. This includes funding to PCCs, counter-terrorism policing and national priorities, such as dismantling County Lines and reducing violent crime.</p>

<p>27. Overall funding available to PCCs will increase by up to £796 million next year - an increase of up to 5.8% when compared to the 2021/22 funding settlement – if PCCs make full use of their flexibility to increase precept.</p>

<p>28. The funding package includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an additional £550 million Government funding to PCCs, including funding to drive the recruitment of the final 8,000 extra officers to reach the 20,000 recruitment target by the end of March 2023</li>
  <li>up to an additional £246 million from council tax precept, subject to decisions by PCCs</li>
  <li>£1.4 billion for national policing programmes and priorities. This delivers on the national priorities of taking down more County Lines, reducing violent crime, child sexual abuse and exploitation, fraud and modern slavery.</li>
  <li>£152.6 million to help police pay increased pensions costs. Of this, £142.6 million will go directly to PCCs and £10 million to counter-terrorism policing and the National Crime Agency</li>
</ul>

<h3>Efficiency and effectiveness</h3>

<p>29. With continued investment in policing, it is only right that the Government holds the policing sector to account on delivering for the public. The police must demonstrate to taxpayers that they are using this funding effectively, meeting the needs of their community and ensuring the public receive the highest possible quality of service.</p>

<p>30. As part of the Spending Review settlement, the Government will expect to see over £100 million of cashable efficiency savings delivered from force budgets by 2024/25. For 2022/23, we expect to see £80 million of efficiency savings - which have been reflected in the funding set out as part of the settlement.</p>

<p>31. Ensuring the value of the Government’s investment in policing goes beyond efficiencies. Following greater investment in modern technology infrastructure and interoperable systems, we expect to see an increase in productivity. This will enable more efficient data sharing and analysis, reduce the risk of service disruptions, and provide a foundation for future enhancements and innovations. We will continue to work with and support the policing sector through the Efficiency in Policing Board with a renewed focus on improving the measurement and delivery of productivity gains.</p>

<p>32. The 2022/23 police settlement supports the police to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>accelerate progress on the Government’s key policing priorities: reducing crime, ensuring the Criminal Justice System works for all, driving forward improvements in the service the public receive, and transforming critical capabilities and infrastructure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure an increase in productivity using enhanced technology and investigative tools. In return for this significant investment, we expect police leaders to become more efficient and effective with officers’ time, and in the fight against national threats</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Police Uplift Programme</h3>

<p>33. As at 31 December 2021, over 11,000 additional police officers have been recruited through the Police Uplift Programme.</p>

<p>34. A significant part of the previous two years of funding for the Uplift was intended to enable forces to make the necessary long-term investments to support the large-scale recruitment of 20,000 additional officers over three years. This included recruitment of additional civilian staff for a wide range of supporting functions, as well the necessary investments in additional fleet, estates and ICT. The final year’s Uplift funding also includes money for these associated costs. We expect forces to continue to invest in sustainable workforce growth but it is up to Chief Constables to decide on how that funding is spent in force.</p>

<p>35. Based on management information provided as at 31 December 2021, 179,086 applications had been received since the start of the programme. Recruitment, training, and entry standards are set by the College of Policing and all new recruits will have met the high standards required.</p>

<h3>Recruitment and retention</h3>

<p>26. Outside of the Uplift programme, recruitment and retention at a national level remains stable over the past year. Police Workforce statistics<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> show the majority of those leaving the police service do so via normal retirement. Voluntary resignations account for less than 2% of the workforce.</p>

<p>27. There continues to be anecdotal evidence about recruitment difficulties and increased attrition rates for some specialist roles. We have not received robust evidence about the nature of the problem and whether pay is a contributory factor. We welcome the NPCC’s ‘strategic assessment of workforce’ that will help to better understand the composition of the current workforce and where there are skills gaps. The assessment will enable the NPCC and policing partners to consider the recruitment challenges ahead and help to ensure that the right skills are retained so that policing is able to respond to changing crime types and demand. It may also help to determine whether pay awards should be targeted at those whose skills are in most demand in future pay rounds, alongside other interventions.</p>

<p>28. As part of their assessment, many forces reported that they had experienced difficulties in recruiting and retaining detectives. Wellbeing, pay and working conditions have been cited as the primary reasons for the levels of attrition in this area. There are, however, positive signs that the new Detective Degree Holder Entry Programme and general intake from the Uplift programme have the potential to improve the situation over the next two to three years.</p>

<p>29. Retaining new officers is integral to the Police Uplift Programme. With the NPCC and College of Policing, we have designed and conducted an onboarding survey to provide insights into the experience of new officers joining the service during the Uplift. This will be used to inform more relevant and tailored retention activity.</p>

<p>30. Retaining experienced officers is just as important. We continue to work with forces to support the retention and progression of existing officers as well as new entrants. We welcome the work led by the NPCC to improve understanding of the factors that prompt officers to resign, which will help to inform the development of initiatives to help retain skilled and experienced officers.</p>

<p>31. A focus on ensuring strong leadership, a consistent standard of line management and equal access to career development opportunities are key factors in the retention of officers. That is why we have provided the College of Policing with over £1 million to develop a National Leadership Centre to set clear standards for all forces which is also a key part of police workforce reform.</p>

<h3>Diversity</h3>

<p>32. Police forces that reflect the communities they serve are crucial to tackling crime and maintaining public trust and confidence in a modern diverse society. The police need to understand communities if they are to tackle crimes that affect them. More than ever, diversity is an important part of operational effectiveness. While the police workforce is more representative in terms of gender and ethnicity than it has ever been, there is still much more to be done. Of the 139,908 headcount officers in the 43 territorial police forces as at 30 September 2021, 47,425 (33.9%) were female. This is a small increase since March 2021, when female representation was at 33.4% and is the highest number on record. Of the officers in post who stated their ethnicity, 10,690 (7.9%) identified as being from a Black, Asian, Mixed or Other ethnicity.</p>

<p>33. Rates of voluntary resignations and dismissals (which also include cases where a contract was terminated for reasons other than misconduct) are higher amongst officers belonging to Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups. It is vital that we develop our understanding of why this disparity exists and we are working closely with the College of Policing and forces to address this.</p>

<h2>IV. Police workforce reform</h2>

<p>34. Workforce reform remains an important element of ensuring the police have the right people and skills and is a key strand of work in the Policing Vision 2025, agreed by Police and Crime Commissioners and Chief Constables. It will ensure the policing system has the capability, capacity and wellbeing support to meet the challenges of emerging and changing types of crime efficiently and effectively.</p>

<h3>Pay reform</h3>

<p>35. The Government is clear that progress must be made to reform police officer pay. The NPCC’s proposals to introduce a pay progression standard (PPS) are a positive step forward that will help to drive up the importance of PDRs, line management and effective supervision, and officer development. The PPS will support the drive to embed continuous professional development in policing and ensure officers are better supported throughout their career, as well as providing an objective basis for holding leaders to account for their performance and management skills. A workforce supported by robust performance management processes will be more capable and able to deliver more effective policing.</p>

<p>36. We are grateful to the staff associations for their engagement and constructive feedback on the PPS policy proposals that have been developed by the NPCC since the PRRB’s last report. We have recently consulted on amendments to determinations made under the Police Regulations 2003 to implement the PPS with effect from 1 April 2022. The NPCC has also drafted guidance to accompany the determination and confirmed that the PPS can be implemented without additional funding.</p>

<p>37. The PRRB’s last report noted concerns around force readiness for the PPS, including evidence that forces’ use of PDRs is inconsistent and that they do not feel ready for implementation. The NPCC has continued to engage with forces to ensure they are aware of the PPS requirements and implementation dates. However, we recognise that some forces may benefit from additional support, guidance or targeted interventions. We welcome updated views from the PRRB on force readiness to implement the pay progression standard.</p>

<p>38. In the last pay round, the PRRB provided updated commentary and observations on benchmarking and valuation of the P-factor. We agree with the PRRB’s comments that the overall purpose of benchmarking and the valuation of the P-Factor must be defined, and the methodologies clear, transparent and robust. These matters must be illustrated and described in a way that is accessible to all police officers. We ask the PRRB to provide commentary and observations on the NPCC’s reference document that will provide a detailed explanation of: the methodologies used to benchmark the pay of all ranks including chief officers; the factors used to determine the P-factor and the methodology used to value it; the interaction of benchmarking and the P-factor; its overall purpose; and example calculations, addressing the points raised in your last report.</p>

<p>39. We note the PRRB’s concerns about considering individual pay changes in isolation. We expect to see proposals for changes to the pay structure presented as a coherent package for all ranks, fully costed and supported by a robust evidence base. While we recognise there may be benefits to delivering changes as an incremental approach, it is important that a consistent approach is taken across all ranks and that the effect of measures applied to specific pay points are fully considered.</p>

<p>40. We also note the PRRB’s concerns about future funding and governance of pay reform. In 2022/23, the Home Office will continue to fund priority NPCC projects including the NPCC Operating Model, which is building a stronger central strategic co-ordinating function for policing. The continued investment will further strengthen the NPCC Operating Model’s strategic hub to drive and coordinate strategy, planning and performance management for NPCC’s portfolios, and provide business support for enabling functions such as finance, workforce and communications. As in 2021/22, the grant will require the NPCC to continue to deliver on key aspects of pay reform. It is for the NPCC to determine how to allocate the funding it receives to meet the grant conditions.</p>

<h3>Review of chief officer remuneration</h3>

<p>41. We welcome the NPCC and APCC’s continued work to review chief officer remuneration and follow up on the points raised by the PRRB in its last report.</p>

<p>42. In its last report, the PRRB sought further detailed evidence to substantiate how the number of Chief Constable and Deputy Chief Constable pay bands was agreed upon. We understand this detail has now been provided by the NPCC. It is important that any proposals to implement these proposed pay bands form part of the coherent plan referred to in paragraph 39.</p>

<p>43. We understand a working group has been established to develop a standardised contract for chief officers. This will help to increase transparency and ensure a consistent approach is taken across the country.</p>

<p>44. There is continued disagreement between parties on whether Deputy Chief Constables’ contractual arrangements should be amended from Fixed Term Appointments to the same status as all other ranks (excluding Chief Constables). We recognise the need for parties to reach consensus and ensure that the impact of maintaining or changing the current position is supported by robust evidence.</p>

<h3>Entry routes</h3>

<p>45. The Police Education Qualifications Framework (PEQF) new entry routes are being implemented across the 43 forces of England and Wales. As of 1 November 2021, 37 forces are recruiting via the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship (PCDA), 32 are recruiting via the Degree Holder Entry Programme (DHEP) and 17 are running the specific Detective DHEP entry route. 35 forces have now stopped using the Initial Policing Learning and Development Programme (IPLDP), the previous standard entry route for police constables.</p>

<h3>Morale and wellbeing</h3>

<p>46. The Government continues to fund the National Police Wellbeing Service, with £3m provided in 2021/22 The Service provides support and training to forces as well as individual officers and staff. There is a key emphasis on resilience and trauma support.</p>

<p>47. In recognition of the sacrifices police officers make, the Government has introduced a Police Covenant. This recognises the bravery and commitment of current and former members of the police workforce, and will ensure they get the support and protection they need. The Covenant will be enshrined in law through an annual reporting requirement, which was introduced to Parliament as part of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill on 9 March 2021.</p>

<p>48. Integral to this is the robust governance structure which we have put in place. We have now had three meetings of the Police Covenant Oversight Board, attended by key policing representatives, working with the Home Office to develop a well-defined programme of work. This governance structure will also support the Home Secretary’s annual report, once the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill receives Royal Assent.</p>

<p>49. Initial priorities, for the Covenant will be: health and wellbeing, physical protection and support for families. We have identified key work streams for each of these areas and have begun taking action to ensure progress is made. This includes in the areas of occupational health, mental health support and training GPs to better support their patients who have been or are serving police officers or members of staff.</p>

<p>50. Through the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill the Government is also doubling the maximum penalty for common assault and battery against an emergency worker from 12 months to two years. In November 2021, the Government also announced its intention to introduce ‘Harper’s Law’, which will mean anyone convicted of killing an emergency worker whilst committing a crime will face a mandatory life sentence.</p>

<h3>Talent management</h3>

<p>51. The Home Office have provided the College of Policing with over £1 million to develop a National Police Leadership Centre to set clear standards for all forces. Work has begun, with the creation of a pilot standards and leadership development framework for sergeants to support the Uplift programme in ensuring that the right support is in place for new recruits. We have also funded the development of a new Frontline Leadership Programme (FLP) with Police Now aimed at creating the very best cadre of sergeants and inspectors possible, with an explicit objective to increase the diversity of those at higher ranks from under-represented groups. Police Now already recruit a significantly higher percentage of individuals from under-represented groups into policing than other entry routes and will use this advantage to target the FLP at current and former participants on their programmes.</p>

<p>52. The College of Policing is undertaking a review of promotion and progression at all ranks up to and including Chief Superintendent. This forms part of its wider work to develop a National Police Leadership Centre. The review was undertaken for a number of reasons, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the need to ensure that promotion processes for sergeants and inspectors remain fit for purpose in light of the additional demand for effective supervisors created by the 20,000 Uplift Programme</li>
  <li>the need to consult with the service on the future role of talent development initiatives in policing, specifically fast track and direct entry programmes. The five-year evaluation of the Fast Track and Direct Entry programmes published in 2020 highlighted key areas of consideration for the programmes including demand from the service, financial viability and improving the representation of people from underrepresented groups in police leadership roles</li>
  <li>achieving our ongoing aim of improving the consistency, efficiency and effectiveness of the overall framework for promotion in policing, introducing reform where required</li>
</ul>

<p>53. The College has engaged comprehensively with police forces and key policing stakeholders throughout 2021, working in partnership with the service in these areas of review. We expect the report, including recommendations on talent management in policing to be published in early 2022.</p>

<p>54. The College will also undertake an independent review of progression to chief officer ranks. The review will pay particular attention to increasing the pipeline and diversity of those qualified to be appointed as chief officers by ensuring appropriate assessment and development models support progression to chief officer. The review will also explore the role of the College and forces in preparing candidates for the assessment process. The College will complete the review by summer 2022 with short term improvements embedded as the review progresses and transformational recommendations will be implemented by 2023.</p>

<p>55. The College is also undertaking a Fundamental Review into its role, effectiveness and how it operates alongside other organisations in the policing landscape. The review will ensure that, as the professional body for policing, the College is highly valued by every section of policing, from frontline officers and staff to chief constables and police and crime commissioners. We expect the review to be published in early 2022.</p>

<h3>Other developments</h3>

<h4>Targeted variable payments</h4>

<p>56. In 2019 we introduced time-limited targeted payments of up to £4,000 a year to help attract and retain officers in hard to fill roles in the federated ranks and demanding superintending roles. In the 2020/21 pay round, the NPCC submitted proposals to the PRRB to make them a permanent discretionary pay lever, increase their value and widen their use.</p>

<p>57. On 1 July 2021 amendments to determinations made under the Police Regulations 2003 took effect to provide Chief Constables with flexibility to make payments of up to £5,000 a year, in addition to basic pay, to recruit and retain officers in service critical (where the role requires a skill set that is in demonstrably short supply or is hard to fill) or demanding roles. The payments have been introduced for an initial period of two years. During this time, we expect the use of these payments to be very closely monitored, robust data collected on how they are used and subject to formal review both locally and nationally.</p>

<p>58. Data collected by the NPCC for the period July to September 2021 suggests that 3,751 officers in 14 forces were in receipt of a targeted variable payment. Payments were targeted at those in detective, firearms, tutor, public protection and demanding superintending roles. The NPCC will continue to collect quarterly data on the use of these payments.</p>

<p>59. We are also clear that is it important to collect data on roles defined as service critical and demanding, and vacancy rates for these roles, so that the effectiveness of targeted variable payments to address recruitment and retention pressures can be fully assessed.</p>

<p>60. ‘Workforce Transformation in the Police Service’, published by the NPCC and College of Policing, outlines the programmes, services, reforms and initiatives which support the delivery of the Policing Vision 2025. It set out an ambition for base pay to be determined according to officer rank and to the level of competence and skills, rather than time served. A mechanism for benchmarking pay would also be determined, based on comparable roles with one or more similar skills or qualifications, building on the professional profiles developed by the College of Policing. We understand there is now no appetite amongst Chief Constables to vary base pay in this way and that instead, they favour the use of targeted variable payments.</p>

<p>61. However, we consider that these principles should be used to ensure targeted variable payments are used in a way that is consistent and fair. Roles should be assessed or evaluated to determine what the appropriate levels of pay should be, based on the skills, qualifications and levels of expertise required to ensure consistency in approach both within and across forces. We have set out our expectation that these types of allowances should be subject to consistent, national processes that allow objective decisions to be made, rather than being entirely at chief officer discretion. This should be considered during the initial two year period that targeted variable payments are in place.</p>

<p>62. We recognise that recruitment and retention issues will vary across forces and that chief officers welcome flexibility to determine how payments are made. While discretionary payments have been available since 2019, there continues to be anecdotal evidence about recruitment difficulties and increased attrition rates for some specialist roles. We welcome views from the PRRB on whether these discretionary payments are the most appropriate tool to recruit and retain officers into these roles, or whether there is evidence to suggest that further targeted interventions are required.</p>

<p>63. As set out in our last evidence submission, we are keen that forces consider a range of strategies to understand and address issues with recruiting and retaining officers into hard to fill, service critical and demanding roles. We would also emphasise the importance of culture and leadership in tackling these issues, recognising that pay is unlikely to be the primary factor.</p>

<h2>V. Overall remuneration package</h2>

<h3>Basic pay</h3>

<p>64. The starting salary for police officers is between £21,654 and £24,780 for constables, depending on skills and experiences. Chief Constables have the flexibility to appoint those joining on the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship scheme on a starting salary of between £19,164 and £24,780.</p>

<p>65. Median basic pay is close to the pay scale maximum of £41,130 for police constables, reflecting the fact that more than half are on the top of the pay scale. A table setting out the headcount and salaries for each rank is provided in Annex B.</p>

<h3>Additional allowances</h3>

<p>66. Police officers in London currently receive London Weighting of £2,568 and London Allowance of up to £5,338 per annum in addition to basic pay. Officers in Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey or Thames Valley may receive regional allowances of up to £3,000 per annum. Those in Bedfordshire, Hampshire or Sussex may receive a regional allowance of up to £2,000 per annum.</p>

<p>67. Officers meeting the relevant criteria may also receive additional allowances, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unsocial Hours Allowance – 10% of hourly rate</li>
  <li>On Call Allowance – £20</li>
  <li>Away from Home Overnight Allowance - £50</li>
  <li>Hardship Allowance – £30</li>
  <li>Replacement Allowance (only available to officers who joined before September 1994, and rates have been frozen since then) – between £1,777.66 and £5,126.7</li>
  <li>Dog Handlers’ Allowance - £2,400</li>
</ul>

<p>68. With the exception of London Weighting and the Dog Handlers’ Allowance, we are not seeking recommendations from the PRRB in this pay round on whether allowances should be increased.</p>

<h3>Pay progression</h3>

<p>69. Federated and superintending ranks, assistant chief constables, and commanders in the Metropolitan Police Service currently receive pay progression. Those who have not reached the top of their pay scale receive annual incremental pay worth at least 2% of salary, and often 4-6%, in addition to annual pay awards. This is dependent upon an officer’s performance having been graded as either ‘satisfactory’ or above in the annual appraisal.</p>

<p>70. Dependent on satisfactory performance, a constable will typically reach the top of their pay scale in 5-7 years; other ranks in 3-4 years. Most police officers enter as police constables. A typical constable will receive a salary of £41,130 within 7 years of joining.</p>

<p>71. With effect from 1 April 2022, it is anticipated that officers will be required to meet the pay progression standard to receive annual incremental pay.</p>

<h3>Pensions</h3>

<p>72. Police officers are entitled to membership of a valuable defined benefit pension scheme. Members benefit from significant employer contributions on top of their own contribution. All contributing members can retire with their pension by age 60. The majority can take a pension sooner, but this may be partial or with a reduction for early payment.</p>

<p>73. The pension also comes with ancillary benefits, for example, spouse/partner pensions, child pensions and a death in service lump sum.</p>

<p>74. There are currently three schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legacy schemes: Police Pension Scheme 1987 and New Police Pension Scheme 2006.</li>
  <li>Reformed scheme: Police Pension Scheme 2015 (Career Average Revalued Earnings).</li>
</ul>

<p>75. The Government encourages all employees to join occupational pension schemes. We have recently published a factsheet with information on the range of benefits available to members of the 2015 police pension scheme<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>McCloud/Sargeant legal cases</h4>

<p>76. In December 2018, the Court of Appeal ruled that transitional protection provisions in the legacy schemes offered to some members of the judges’ and firefighters’ pension schemes as part of the 2015 public sector pensions reforms, gave rise to unlawful discrimination. In July 2019, the Government confirmed that the judgment read across to all main public service pension schemes, including the police, and committed to provide a legal remedy across the schemes.</p>

<p>77. The Government is committed to providing public sector pensions that are fair to both public-sector workers and taxpayers and understands how important this issue is for police officers. We are being open and fair in our approach and are committed to considering all views. This is important given the complexity of the problem we are addressing.</p>

<p>78. The Home Office, as the Responsible Authority for the police pension scheme, is now considering how best to implement the scheme level changes. The Remedy is delivered via primary legislation (through the Public Service Pensions &amp; Judicial Offices Bill (PSPJO), introduced on 19 July 2021, and via a forthcoming Finance Bill) and two sets of secondary legislation led by the Home Office.</p>

<p>79. In November 2021, Home Office published a consultation on the scheme regulation changes needed to enact the prospective remedy, including moving all members to the reformed scheme (“the 2015 scheme”) from 1 April 2022 and closing the legacy schemes to future accrual from 31 March 2022. This will mean that all members are treated equally in respect of any pensionable service rendered after 31 March 2022. There will be an additional consultation in due course on to address those elements of the remedy that will be retrospective in effect (i.e. relating to the remedy period, 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2022). The Government intends that the provisions for the deferred choice underpin will be implemented by 1 October 2023.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p>80. Officers receive a minimum of 22 days of annual leave, rising with service to 30 days, plus bank holidays as well as access to flexible working schedules and career breaks.</p>

<p>81. Further benefits include enhanced maternity pay and leave and parental support pay (up to two weeks), paid allowances to compensate for disruption to family life and the demands of the role, and sick leave on full pay for up to six months.</p>

<h2>VI. Data provision</h2>

<h3>Published data</h3>

<p>82. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2021">Police workforce data</a> includes data on: workforce numbers; promotions; joiners and leavers; age, sex and ethnicity; police functions; long term absence; recuperative and adjusted/restricted duties; and length of service.</p>

<p>83. The Home Office, the NPCC and the College of Policing have been collaborating in developing a National Standard for Workforce Data. These data standards draw on existing harmonised standards set out by the Government Statistical Service and aim to bring more standardisation within policing for the collection of data on protected characteristics (and some other demographic information). The variables currently covered by the standards are: ethnicity, age, religion or belief, disability, sexual orientation, gender, sex, and gender reassignment.</p>

<p>84. Information on their protected characteristics is self-reported by officers on police force HR systems. Recent changes to police force HR systems to align with the new data standards have allowed all officers the opportunity to review existing records and declare further information on protected characteristics. However, many officers are yet to update their profiles and, as such, data are not currently complete. Work is ongoing to improve data quality.</p>

<p>85. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/police-officer-uplift-statistics">Quarterly statistics on the progress towards recruiting an additional 20,000 officers</a>.</p>

<h3>Police workforce and pay census</h3>

<p>86. The Police Workforce Census is a record-level dataset which collects information on all officers in England and Wales. Data are collected on basic demographics of the officer, the rank and pay point, as well as allowances and overtime, as at the end of March each year. Given the sensitivities of the data collected, this dataset is not shared or published. However, aggregate data tables on pay are provided to the PRRB secretariat separately, and the HR data is published in the annual police workforce statistics.</p>

<h3>Workforce Data Group</h3>

<p>87. The Workforce Data Group, a sub-group of the NPCC Workforce Co-ordination Committee, is a cross-organisation group led by DCC Janette McCormick. The group includes representatives from the NPCC, police HR and finance teams, Home Office, HMICFRS and the College of Policing. The group discusses data issues with the aim to improve the quality, consistency and availability of data across policing. A key objective of the group is to advance collection of record-level data collection, primarily by further developing the Police Workforce Census, with the ambition of tracking officers throughout their careers using Unique Reference Numbers (URNs).</p>

<h3>Strategic Assessment of Workforce</h3>

<p>88. The NPCC’s Workforce Co-ordination Committee is conducting a strategic assessment to better understand the composition of the current workforce, where there are skills gaps, and identify how they are best addressed. The assessment will help to ensure that forces are able to effectively respond to demands and provide an evidence base for future growth and workforce priorities.</p>

<p>*Pay for chief officer ranks is determined by the size of the force and level of crime demand.</p>
