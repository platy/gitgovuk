<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you’ve been sexually assaulted it’s important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make informed decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention</li>
  <li>report to local police</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 999</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-kuala-lumpur">contact the British High Commission in Malaysia</a> at +603 2170 2200. This number is available 24/7. High Commission staff will be empathetic, and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Malaysia</h2>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you are in an area where there is a British High Commission, they will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7.</p>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the nearest British High Commission +603 2170 2200 and they can offer you consular support.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or text messages.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>

<p>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</p>

<p>Definition of rape under the Malaysian law is defined as sexual intercourse with a woman against her will or without her consent. Sexual intercourse with a woman is also rape when her consent is obtained by putting her in fear or when she is unable to understand the nature of what she is consenting to, or she is under 16 years of age.</p>

<p>Malaysian law does not specifically define sexual assault, however, there are various laws that cover different forms of sexual assault or use of criminal force on a person or use of criminal force on a person with the intent to outrage modesty.</p>

<p>Where possible a female officer can be requested, but this might not always be possible depending on the size and/or location of the police station. English-speaking officers are usually available upon request.</p>

<p>You may be asked for explicit details of the incident.</p>

<p>The consular officer will accompany you to the police station and/or to the hospital if there is a need for support.</p>

<p>You will not automatically be assigned a lawyer. You may wish to appoint one. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malaysia-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers-in-malaysia">list of English speaking lawyers</a> is available online.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Malaysia</h2>

<p>The British High Commission will be able to help you. This includes helping you to contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.</p>

<p>They can provide you with lists of English-speaking <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malaysia-list-of-medical-facilities">medical facilities</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malaysia-list-of-lawyers">lawyers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malaysia-list-of-translators-interpreters">translators</a>.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with one, you can report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. If you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. If you wish, and depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you.</p>

<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime. You have to report the crime in-country for it to be investigated.</p>

<p>If you do not report the crime you are still able to access medical attention from the local hospital. There will be a minimal fee for this.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>The support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence.</p>

<p>If you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>, or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London.</p>

<p>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police.</p>

<p>The UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened.  However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</p>

<p>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed</p>

<h2>Reporting the crime in Malaysia: what happens next?</h2>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. The police will take the victim to the local hospital for a forensic examination.</p>

<p>If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>

<p>You will need to make a statement about the incident, including a description of the attacker.</p>

<p>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English.</p>

<p>The Royal Malaysian Police will formally inform the British High Commission of the crime, however this can take weeks, so if you require immediate support you should contact the British High Commission.</p>

<h2>Medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<p>It is important to go as soon as possible to the ‘One Stop Crisis Centre’ (OSCC) which is located at the emergency room of government and state hospitals in the area where the incident happened. If the police are involved they will take you there.</p>

<p>At the OSCC, you can receive treatment, contraceptives, screening for STIs, have medical evidence collected and receive psychiatric counselling. If the police have not been involved and you want them to be, please mention this to the team and they will guide you further. This may include police attending the hospital.</p>

<p>In respect of the physical examinations, this could involve a number of different doctors and it is possible to request a female doctor, but this is not always possible depending on the size of the hospital. The examinations can take some time to arrange as this will depend on doctor availability.</p>

<p>If you are over 18yrs of age and do not wish to make a police report, you will be counselled and advised to make a report. If you choose not to do so, the doctor shall do a physical examination, treat injuries and check for STI’s.</p>

<p>Consular staff or anyone you choose can accompany you to the hospital.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>

<p>If it is possible that you may have been exposed to the HIV virus, you should go to a hospital urgently to obtain “Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)”, a treatment than may stop HIV replicating in the body and so prevent the virus from attacking the immune system (Treatment Post Exposition - TPE). This can be prescribed at any hospital. More information on risks is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/HIV" rel="external">NHS website</a>.</p>

<p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception can be prescribed at the hospital. Emergency contraception can also be purchased at most pharmacies.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception is medically warranted and needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</p>

<p>If the crime is reported to the police, all treatment is free. If the crime is not reported there is a minimal fee.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h2>Police investigations in Malaysia: what to expect</h2>

<p>The Investigating Officer will open an investigation based on the police report you have made. The Investigating Officer may interview witnesses, suspects and may also ask you to give further statement at the police station.</p>

<p>The Investigating Officer presents the case to the Magistrate to determine whether there is a case to charge the perpetrator and if there is an appropriate charge decided.</p>

<p>If the police make an arrest they will take the accused, if Malaysian, within 24 hours to appear before a Magistrate. If the accused is a foreign national, the accused can be held for up to 14 days by the police, depending on the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>Your statement will be taken by the Investigating Officer and this is then presented to the Magistrate as part of the investigation report. Lawyers at this point are not allowed to interfere with the police investigation but are allowed to have access to general notes of the investigation and your statement.</p>

<p>You are allowed to leave the country after statements are given. However, you are encouraged to stay in the country where possible in case further statements are needed. Not being in country will most likely slow down the proceedings in the case.</p>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>While it is not mandatory for you to testify in court unless witness summons has been issued, it is expected for you to testify in court because without your participation in trial, it would be very unlikely that the charge against accused can be proven.</p>

<p>You may ask for a report of the status of the investigation directly from the Investigating Officer. There may however be a language barrier or problem with different time zones. Engaging a lawyer will help you gain a better grasp in the investigation process and a lawyer would be able to advise and explain to you at each stage of the proceedings. You may hire a lawyer to hold a “Watching Brief” for the subsequent trial to protect your interest and ensure that the trial is conducted fairly.</p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances of the case, there may be instances where an additional statement is needed from you.</p>

<p>In Malaysia cases can take some time for trials to begin and when they do the trial could take place over a number of different dates.</p>

<p>It is possible for you to withdraw the complaint by lodging another police report but the decision to charge the accused, or to continue proceedings will rest within the discretion of the prosecution.</p>

<p>Withdrawing a complaint does not necessarily mean that you have made an initial false report. As such, there would not be any automatic legal repercussion against you.</p>

<p>Courts can make an order against the convicted accused for the payment of compensation to you in respect of any injury to you or your character, or loss of your income, or property resulting from the offence.</p>

<p>There is currently no state-funded compensation scheme in Malaysia.</p>

<p>You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice.</p>
