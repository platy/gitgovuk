<h2>General description of the measure</h2>

<p>This measure introduces an Income Tax exemption for payments from Covid-19 support scheme: working households receiving tax credits.</p>

<p>These changes give certainty to Tax Credits claimants, that payments made under Covid-19 support scheme: working households receiving tax credits will not give rise to charges to Income Tax.</p>

<h2>Background to the measure</h2>

<p>In March 2020, the Chancellor announced a temporary uplift of £20 per week to the Universal Credit (UC) standard allowance and Working Tax Credits basic element for the 2020 to 2021 financial year. These payments provided extra support to low-income workers during the coronavirus pandemic, where they may have had unexpected falls in incomes.</p>

<p>A one-off payment - Covid-19 support scheme: working households receiving tax credits of £500 is being made to Tax Credits recipients to cover a six-month period from April to September 2021 to continue this government support.</p>

<h2>Detailed proposal</h2>

<h3>Operative date</h3>

<p>The measure will have effect from 6 April 2021.</p>

<h3>Current law</h3>

Payments made under Section 76 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 are subject to Income Tax as coronavirus support payments under Section 106(2)(c) of Finance Act 2020.</p>

<h3>Proposed revisions</h3>

<p>Legislation will be introduced in Finance Bill 2021 to exempt from Income Tax Covid-19 support scheme: working households receiving tax credits payments made to tax credit recipients.</p>

<h2>Summary of impacts</h2>

<h3>Exchequer impact (£m)</h3>
