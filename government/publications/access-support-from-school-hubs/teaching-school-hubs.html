<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teaching-school-hubs">Teaching school hubs</a> are lead schools that deliver evidence-based professional development to schools in a designated area of the country.</p>

<p>This professional development covers every stage of a teacher’s career and is designed to work for all subjects, phases and schools.</p>

<h2>Trainee teachers</h2>

<p>Teaching school hubs deliver high quality <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-criteria/initial-teacher-training-itt-criteria-and-supporting-advice">school-based initial teacher training</a>, underpinned by the initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>) core content framework, either as an accredited <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider or a partner school.</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>Where applicable, there will be individual funding arrangements in place between the accredited <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider and their placement schools. This reflects the additional roles and responsibilities associated with hosting an <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> trainee, such as the placement school providing a mentor for the trainee.</p>

<h2>Early career teachers</h2>

<p>Teaching school hubs deliver free, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-funded training to early career teachers and their mentors to ensure their practice is based in the evidence set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework-reforms-overview/early-career-framework-reforms-overview">Early Career Framework</a>.</p>

<p>They can also quality assure the statutory induction that the early career teacher receives through the appropriate body role.</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>Early career teachers and mentors in state-funded schools and 16 to 19 organisations are funded by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to complete the Early Career Framework full induction programme.</p>

<h2>More experienced teachers and leaders</h2>

<p>Teaching school hubs deliver the full suite of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://professional-development-for-teachers-leaders.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">national professional qualifications (<abbr title="national professional qualifications">NPQs</abbr>)</a>, consisting of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://professional-development-for-teachers-leaders.education.gov.uk/#:~:text=Broaden%20your%20expertise,of%20the%20classroom" rel="external">specialist <abbr title="national professional qualifications">NPQs</abbr></a> for teachers and leaders to enhance and develop their existing skills and knowledge both inside and outside of the classroom</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://professional-development-for-teachers-leaders.education.gov.uk/#:~:text=Develop%20your%20leadership,more%20senior%20roles" rel="external">leadership <abbr title="national professional qualifications">NPQs</abbr></a> for existing and aspiring leaders to develop their knowledge and skills for leadership roles in schools and multi-academy trusts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>Teachers and leaders working in state-funded schools and 16 to 19 organisations can access fully funded training scholarships for all <abbr title="national professional qualifications">NPQs</abbr>. Full details of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms#funding">scholarship eligibility</a> are available. This includes&nbsp;eligibility in early years and other settings.</p>

<p>Some small settings may also be eligible for a £200 grant payment to help access the courses.</p>

<h2>Teachers at every stage in their career</h2>

<p>Teaching school hubs promote and deliver other high-quality continuing professional development (<abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr>) for school leaders and teachers in their local area.</p>

<p>This additional <abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr> complements existing <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>-approved programmes and existing hub offers, to meet local needs.</p>

<p>A total of 87 teaching school hubs have been designated across all areas of the country, meaning all schools have access to the professional development that hubs offer.</p>

<h3>Who can access this support</h3>

<p>Any state-funded school, 16 to 19 organisation, special school, alternative provision setting, or early years setting in England can access a teaching school hub.</p>

<h3>How to access this support</h3>
