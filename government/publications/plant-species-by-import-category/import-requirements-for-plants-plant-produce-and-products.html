<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide applies to plants and plant products which need phytosanitary control to be imported from a third country to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales).</p>

<p>It will not fully apply to imports from the EU to Great Britain until the end of the phased import process in July 2022. Read the guide on how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-plants-and-plant-products-from-the-eu-to-great-britain-and-northern-ireland">import plants and plant products from the EU to Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> for more detail on the phased approach.</p>

<p>If you need help with import notifications, you can call the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) helpline on 03300 416 999 or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:APHAServiceDesk@apha.gov.uk">APHAServiceDesk@apha.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>It is divided into 5 categories of phytosanitary control and 6 commodity groups, explaining which category and commodity groups different products fall into.</p>

<p>This guide is based on ‘The Plant Health (Phytosanitary Conditions) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020’ and references other legislation where appropriate, for example in the cases of genera that have species exemptions or when a derogation applies to certain countries only.</p>

<p>Plants, fruit, vegetables, cut flowers, soil and other regulated objects (for example, machinery) fall into 5 categories of phytosanitary control:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Prohibited’ - Can only bring into Great Britain if a scientific research license or derogation is obtained.</li>
  <li>‘Prohibited (pending risk assessment)’ - Can only bring into Great Britain if risk assessed by Defra. Excludes in vitro material, naturally or artificially dwarfed woody plants for planting of those genera.</li>
  <li>‘Regulated and notifiable’ - Can only bring into Great Britain if accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate and advanced notification of landing.</li>
  <li>‘Regulated’ - Can only bring into Great Britain if accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate. After applicants complete a customs entry, a small number of these consignments may need advanced notification on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-request-for-chief-access-c1800"><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> (Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight)</a>.</li>
  <li>‘Unregulated’ - Can bring into Great Britain without a phytosanitary certificate or advanced notification.</li>
</ul>

<p>The guide is divided into the following commodity groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plants for planting</li>
  <li>fruit</li>
  <li>seeds for planting</li>
  <li>cut flowers, parts of plants and vegetables</li>
  <li>tubers (including potatoes)</li>
  <li>other</li>
</ul>
