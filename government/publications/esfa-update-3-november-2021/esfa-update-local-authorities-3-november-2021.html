<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Information: teachers pay grant (TPG) and teachers’ pension employer contribution grant (TPECG) allocations for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>We have now published the allocations for September 2021 to March 2022 for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pay-grant-allocations-for-2021-to-2022-financial-year">teachers pay grant (TPG)</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-grant-2021-to-2022-allocations" class="govuk-link">teachers’ pension employer contribution grant (TPECG)</a>.</p>

<p>As explained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-for-schools-and-high-needs">national funding formulae (NFF) policy document</a>, from the 2021 to 2022 financial year most of the TPG and TPECG has been paid through the schools and high needs national funding formulae, instead of as separate grants. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link">high needs operational guide 2021 to 2022</a> sets out how local authorities should distribute this to high needs settings and explains the additional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2021-to-2022/dsg-conditions-of-grant-2021-to-2022">DSG condition of grant</a> relating to this funding.</p>

<p>In the 2021 to 2022 financial year, we will continue to provide maintained nursery schools, school nurseries, sixth forms, 16 to 19 schools, non-maintained special schools and new special and alternative provision free schools which opened after 1 September 2020 with TPG, paid separately to core allocations.</p>

<p>This grant funding for maintained schools is paid to local authorities, who will be required to pay it to individual schools. Funding for new special and alternative provision free schools (excluding non-maintained special schools) is aggregated and paid at local authority level, for local authorities to distribute according to local circumstances.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-grant-2021-to-2022-allocations">Allocations for the full 2021 to 2022 financial year are published on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: PE and sport premium allocations and conditions of grant 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>We have now published the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/view-latest-funding/">allocations for PE and sport premium 2021 to 2022</a> together with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pe-and-sport-premium-conditions-of-grant-2021-to-2022">conditions of grant</a> for maintained schools, academies and non-maintained special schools (NMSS).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: increase to time permitted for Universal Credit claimants to attend training – extended until April 2022</h2>

<p>In April 2021 the Minister for Employment announced that Universal Credit claimants in the intensive work search group will be able to attend full-time, work-related training courses lasting up to 12 weeks across Great Britain and up to 16 weeks for a skills bootcamp as part of their work search activity. This flexibility has now been extended until 28 April 2022.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity for FE providers to work with their local Jobcentre Plus and Partnership Managers to offer full-time, work-related training courses. Universal Credit Claimants will need to get agreement from their work coach to ensure this is the right support for them and appropriate for the local labour market.</p>

<p>For further information please refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/free-courses-for-jobs" class="govuk-link">Free courses for jobs information page</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: consultation on reforming how local authorities’ school improvement functions are funded</h2>

<p>On 29 October, we issued <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-improvement-monitoring-and-brokering-grant-allocations" class="govuk-link">school improvement monitoring and brokering grant allocations</a> to local authorities covering the period September 2021 to March 2022.</p>

<p>We have also launched a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-how-local-authority-school-improvement-functions-are-funded" class="govuk-link">consultation</a> on proposals to reform how local authorities’ school improvement functions are funded in future, and propose to phase in these changes from April 2022.</p>

<p>We are keen to hear your views.</p>
