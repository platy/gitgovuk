<span class="number">4. </span>Information: teachers pay grant (TPG) and teachers’ pension employer contribution grant (TPECG) allocations for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>We have now published the allocations for September 2021 to March 2022 for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pay-grant-allocations-for-2021-to-2022-financial-year">teachers pay grant (TPG)</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-grant-2021-to-2022-allocations">teachers’ pension employer contribution grant (TPECG)</a>.</p>

<p>As explained in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-for-schools-and-high-needs" class="govuk-link">national funding formulae (NFF) policy document</a>, from the 2021 to 2022 financial year most of the TPG and TPECG has been paid through the schools and high needs national funding formulae, instead of as separate grants. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link">high needs operational guide 2021 to 2022</a> sets out how local authorities should distribute this to high needs settings and explains the additional <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2021-to-2022/dsg-conditions-of-grant-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link">DSG condition of grant</a> relating to this funding.</p>

<p>In the 2021 to 2022 financial year, we will continue to provide maintained nursery schools, school nurseries, sixth forms, 16 to 19 schools, non-maintained special schools and new special and alternative provision free schools which opened after 1 September 2020 with TPG, paid separately to core allocations.</p>

<p>This grant funding for maintained schools is paid to local authorities, who will be required to pay it to individual schools. Funding for new special and alternative provision free schools (excluding non-maintained special schools) is aggregated and paid at local authority level, for local authorities to distribute according to local circumstances.</p>
