<p>If you have been sexually assaulted it is important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make informed decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention</li>
  <li>report to local police</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/victim-of-rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad">guidance for victims of rape and sexual assault abroad</a>.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 112 or 999 from a UK mobile</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact your nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-athens">British embassy or consulate in Greece</a>. Embassy staff will be polite, patient, sensitive and non-judgemental. They can provide information on local police and medical procedures, and can contact your family or friends for you if you wish</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Greece</h2>

<ul>
  <li>if you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you are in an area where there is a British embassy or consulate, they will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7</li>
  <li>if you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the nearest British embassy or consulate on +30 210 7272600 and they can offer you consular support</li>
  <li>if you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts</li>
  <li>tell the police if you think you have been drugged</li>
  <li>insist you get a document from the police to confirm that you have reported the crime, with a police reference number and the police’s contact details so that you are able to follow up with them later</li>
  <li>if you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained</li>
  <li>you must report the crime in Greece before returning to the UK if you want it to be investigated</li>
  <li>you can take a person of trust or a legal adviser to the police station , if you wish</li>
  <li>note that you will not automatically be assigned a lawyer, if you wish to have a legal adviser you have to instruct your own lawyer. A list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers&amp;country=greece" rel="external">English-speaking lawyers</a> is available</li>
  <li>a female police officer may be available to attend</li>
  <li>you will be asked to give details of any witnesses to the crime or persons you spoke to after the assault. In most cases you will be asked for the clothes you were wearing, your mobile phone (as it could contain material relevant to the investigation) as well as other items which the perpetrator may have touched</li>
  <li>you will be asked to show formal identification, such as your passport. The document will be returned to you as soon as the police have established your identity</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Greece</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the British embassy or consulate will be able to help you. This includes helping you to contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK</li>
  <li>they can also provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators</li>
  <li>if you are travelling with one, you can also report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. If you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. If you wish, and depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you</li>
  <li>it is your choice on whether to report the crime. If you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated</li>
  <li>if you do decide not to report the crime to the police, you will still be able to get medical attention</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence</li>
  <li>if you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>, or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London</li>
  <li>if you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police</li>
  <li>the UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action</li>
  <li>you can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting the crime in Greece: what happens next?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>if you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence</li>
  <li>if you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages</li>
  <li>tell the police if you think you have been drugged</li>
  <li>insist you get a document from the police confirming that you have reported the crime, with a police reference number and the police’s contact details so that you are able to follow up with them later</li>
  <li>during the interview with the police, you will be asked questions to help them conduct their investigations. This could include making a statement about the incident and giving a description of the perpetrator(s)</li>
  <li>evidence such as the clothes and underwear you were wearing and other items that the offender has touched will be retained. It will help the police to gather evidence and build a criminal case</li>
  <li>electronic equipment such as mobile phones and tablets will also be taken temporarily to secure data that might serve as evidence in the investigations and in a court case. Devices will then be returned to you</li>
  <li>the police will send you (or take you if they have the available personnel but this is not part of their duties) to the local state hospital or medical forensic suite for a forensic examination</li>
  <li>the Greek police will not normally inform the UK police about the assault</li>
  <li>you can request an officer of a particular gender although there is no guarantee one will be available. An interpreter will be provided by the local police; this may be another police officer</li>
</ul>

<h2>The medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>not all hospitals and medical centres provide help and medical treatment to victims of rape and sexual assault</li>
  <li>the forensic medical examination to secure possible evidence will be carried out by a qualified medical practitioner. In Greece, this is a forensic examiner on notification via the Greek Police</li>
  <li>if a forensic examiner is not available, he/she will determine the medical physician who will carry out the examination</li>
  <li>if you prefer to be examined by a female, the hospital will try to arrange this, but it cannot be guaranteed</li>
  <li>swabs will be taken and there will be a gynaecological or urological examination. Tests for sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) will be carried out as well as a pregnancy test, where appropriate. Photographs will also be taken to document any injuries, for which you will receive emergency treatment. During the examination, the forensic examiner will normally check the following: bruising and external injuries on all areas of the body, internal injuries by examination and internal swabs, possible DNA testing and tests relating to date rape drugs or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). These may be performed by another doctor or department of the hospital</li>
  <li>ask to be advised about what treatment is recommended in your particular case to prevent sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs), and pregnancy, if applicable</li>
  <li>if you are in an area where there is a British embassy or consulate, they will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>hospital staff can give you advice on HIV PEP medication (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection after unprotected sexual intercourse) should you or they feel it is necessary</li>
  <li>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. It is subject to availability in Greece. It is medically prescribed and closely monitored</li>
  <li>the NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK</li>
  <li>emergency contraception also known as the ‘morning after pill’ can be bought from most chemists at your own cost without a prescription or medical referral. It needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident to be effective</li>
  <li>hospital treatment and tests are normally covered by your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external">Global or European Health Insurance Card</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Police investigations in Greece: what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the police may take you to the scene of the crime or where you believe the perpetrator to be located, in order to try to identify and arrest them</li>
  <li>if a suspect has been arrested and brought to the police station, you will be asked to make an identification</li>
  <li>if the police make an arrest, the suspect must be taken before the court within 24 to 48 hours. At this stage the judge will decide whether to commit the perpetrator to prison pending further investigation, release the perpetrator provisionally with or without bail pending further investigation, or release them without charge if s/he believes there is insufficient evidence to prosecute</li>
  <li>after the police and the public prosecutor have concluded their investigations, the public prosecutor must decide whether there is enough evidence to take the case to court</li>
  <li>you usually make your statement to the police. The public prosecutor or investigating magistrate may also ask to interview you. Your lawyer cannot do this on your behalf</li>
  <li>the police usually ask how long you intend to remain in Greece if you live abroad</li>
</ul>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>if a suspect is ordered to summary trial, you will usually be expected to testify in court. If you are in the UK, it is not possible for you to testify in a Greek court via video link</li>
  <li>if the case is referred to further investigation you may be asked to give an additional statement</li>
  <li>if the case does not go to trial immediately, you may be summoned to appear at a trial. You may be expected to attend court in person. A lawyer can advise you further on this matter and explain the process of possible reimbursement of travel expenses</li>
  <li>a victim of crime, including rape and other forms of sexual assault, in Greece does not have the right of access to the case file and will not be kept informed of case developments by the court. To acquire this right you will need to become a civil claimant. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers&amp;country=greece" rel="external">speak to a lawyer in Greece</a> about this application process</li>
  <li>if you change your mind about pressing charges or you are not sure if you want to continue, you can retract your statement. To do this you must tell the police or the public prosecutor</li>
  <li>the assailant may press counter charges against you claiming that you have made false accusations. The court will investigate these claims and decide on proceedings</li>
  <li>the charge of rape is an automatic state prosecution and will not be dropped. Your revised statement will be considered during a trial and will support the assailant’s defence</li>
  <li>if anyone intentionally makes false accusations to the police or withholds the truth, they can be prosecuted</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional legal information</h2>

<h3>How long the case will take to trial</h3>

<p>Once you have made a police report and have given evidence, it will be for the police and public prosecutor to investigate the crime, to build a case and to take it to court. It will be for the court to decide whether the trial will go ahead, or if further investigations are necessary for this to happen.</p>

<h3>Trial procedures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>a court summons will be served to your address in the UK or to your appointed lawyer in Greece when the trial date is set</li>
  <li>the language in the court will be Greek however the court will provide an interpreter for you</li>
  <li>costs for travel to Greece and accommodation will be covered by the court. Normally, you will have to make your own arrangements and advance these costs, but you will be able to reclaim them. You need to keep all relevant documents and receipts to do this. If you do not have the funds for travel and/or accommodation, you should contact the court</li>
  <li>the length of time it takes for a final sentence to be passed in a rape or sexual assault case depends on a number of factors: if the suspect has been remanded in custody until the trial, the case should go to trial no later than 18 months after arrest. In cases where the suspect has not been remanded in custody awaiting trial, it can take longer for the case to go to trial. After the sentence has been passed, the defendant has the right to at least one appeal</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hiring a lawyer</h3>

<p>A lawyer can assist you in asserting your rights in a rape or sexual assault case.  See list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers&amp;country=greece" rel="external">English-speaking lawyers</a> and list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/translators-and-interpreters-list">translators and interpreters</a>.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<ul>
  <li>during the police investigations, you will primarily communicate with the police. At all stages of the case, you will be able to communicate with your lawyer, if you have appointed one</li>
  <li>if you do not reside in Greece and have appointed a lawyer, the lawyer’s address will be sufficient to receive correspondence. Otherwise the authorities will need your home address in the UK</li>
  <li>a victim of crime, including rape and other forms of sexual assault, in Greece does not have the right of access to the case file and will not be kept informed of case developments by the Court. To acquire this right you will need to become a civil claimant. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers&amp;country=greece" rel="external">speak to a lawyer in Greece</a> about this application process</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sentencing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>in deciding whether sentences are weighted in favour of punishment or rehabilitation, judges have to consider both aspects</li>
  <li>depending on the case, the sentence for a convicted adult perpetrator can be imprisonment</li>
  <li>if the perpetrator is found not guilty, they will be acquitted</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you return to the UK</h2>

<p>You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice where you live.</p>

<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually transmitted disease (STD), you should ask your local health provider to test you. You should do this even if you have been tested in the country that the assault took place in.</p>
