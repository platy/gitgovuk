<h2>COVID-19 deaths</h2>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published statistics on deaths in people with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 since 29 April 2020. In this report we present the latest data on COVID-19 mortality. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-data-series-on-deaths-in-people-with-covid-19-technical-summary">Further information on the data series can be found here</a>.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<p>Cases of laboratory diagnosed COVID-19 resident in England were identified from the Second Generation Surveillance System (<abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Fact and date of death were derived from combined sources: NHS England hospital deaths, Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) death registrations, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Health Protection Team direct reporting and Demographic Batch Service tracing of laboratory-confirmed cases.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>In this report deaths are defined as a death in a person with a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>died within 60 days of the first specimen date</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>died more than 60 days after the first specimen date with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>This data does not include deaths in people where COVID-19 is suspected but not confirmed by testing (SARS-CoV-2 PCR either negative or not tested).</p>

<p>This data does not report cause of death, and as such represents all deaths in people with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, not just those caused by COVID-19.</p>

<p>In this report, data is reported from 29 June 2020 to 28 February 2021.</p>

<p>Mortality rates are calculated using 2019 <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> population estimates data.</p>

<p>Age-standardised rates adjust for differences in the age structure of populations. The standard used throughout this report is the European Standard Population 2013.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Mortality rates presented for different time periods have been annualised in order to enable comparisons. This method involves adjusting the population data used to calculate rates for the time period covered, these are expressed as mortality rates per 100,000 population per year. These rates cannot be compared with rates that do not have this adjustment.</p>

<p>Mortality rates by region, local authority, sex, ethnic group and Index of Multiple Deprivation (<abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr>) have been age-standardised to account for the different age distributions within different populations.</p>

<p>All figures displaying mortality rates have been calculated using a 7-day rolling average, to allow for smoothing of fluctuating data.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 mortality rates</h2>

<p>Within the period 29 June 2020 to 28 February 2021, 3,425,333 cases of COVID-19 were detected in England.</p>

<p>In the same period, there have been 83,848 deaths in persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This represents a crude mortality rate of 222.8 per 100,000 population. From 29 June 2020 onwards, the highest recorded number of daily deaths was 1,370 deaths on 19 January 2021.</p>

<h2>Deprivation</h2>

<p>Relative deprivation was assessed using quintiles of the <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> linked to residential lower super output area, with <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> 1 representing the most deprived. Overall, the age-adjusted annualised mortality rate is highest among those living in the most deprived areas, with a gradual decrease in mortality rate seen with decreasing deprivation. The mortality rate in all deprivation groups in February was higher than the adjusted rate for the total period 29 June 2020 to 28 February 2021.</p>

<h2>Case fatality risk</h2>

<p>Case fatality risk (<abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr>) describes the risk of death following a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test. For this report, <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> has been calculated within 60 days of an individual’s first positive specimen. <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> is reported on data from week 27 (29 June 2020) up to and including 3 January 2021. Cases diagnosed in the last 60 days were excluded from this analysis, due to incomplete follow-up period. Deaths are excluded from the <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> calculation if they cannot be linked to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case data.</p>

<p><abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> is sensitive to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes in testing coverage and detection rate of COVID-19 infections (Dudel et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Harman et al., 2021)</li>
  <li>changes in the demographics of the infected population</li>
  <li>changes in the effectiveness of treatment and the health system’s ability to care for severe COVID-19 cases</li>

<h3>Place of death</h3>

<p>This analysis describes the setting in which deaths in persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 have occurred. The place of occurrence of each death has been determined using information provided from death registrations from <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>, supplemented by reports of hospital deaths by NHS trusts using the COVID-19 Patient Notification System.</p>

<p>Place of death has been classified into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hospital – deaths that have occurred in a hospital setting
<br>
<br>
</li>
  <li>care home – deaths that have occurred within care homes, including:
    <ul>
      <li>homes for the chronic sick</li>
      <li>nursing homes</li>
      <li>homes for people with mental health problems</li>
      <li>non-NHS multi-function sites
<br>
<br>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>home – deaths that have occurred at the usual residence of the deceased‚ where this is not a communal establishment
<br>
<br>
</li>
  <li>other settings – deaths that have occurred in other communal establishments, including:
    <ul>
      <li>hospices</li>
      <li>schools for people with learning disabilities</li>
      <li>holiday homes and hotels</li>
      <li>common lodging houses</li>
      <li>aged persons’ accommodation</li>
      <li>assessment centres</li>
      <li>schools</li>
      <li>convents and monasteries</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Deaths among individuals with unknown place of death have not been presented in demographic breakdown figures but have been included in calculations of proportion of deaths by place of death.</p>

<p>In this section of the report, data is reported from 29 June 2020 (week 27) to 14 February 2021 (week 6) to account for reporting delay in death registrations.</p>

<h4>Figure 8.a. Number of deaths in laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 by place of death, from week 27 onwards*†</h4>

<p>†Deaths within 60 days of a positive COVID-19 test or where COVID-19 is mentioned on the death certificate.</p>

<p>From week 27 onwards, the majority of deaths (54,350; 69.5%) have occurred in a hospital setting, with peaks in September 2020 and January 2021 (Figure 8.a.). 12,823 (16.4%) deaths occurred in a care home setting, with a peak in January 2021 (week 3). This corresponded with an increase in COVID-19 outbreaks observed in care home and increased pressures on NHS services.  During the same period there were 3,619 deaths at home and 1,419 deaths in other settings.</p>

<p>In Figure 8.b., the proportion of deaths in each setting varied during Summer 2020 (week 27-week 36) when the total number of deaths were low. From September 2020 onward (week 37), the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in hospitals remained stable between 65-75%, and the proportion of deaths at home and in care homes were comparatively low.</p>

<p>From week 27 onwards, the majority of deaths among both males and females have occurred in hospital. A higher proportion of care home deaths occurred in females compared to males (22.4% and 11.0%, respectively) (Table 8). Figure 9 shows that hospital was the most common setting of death across all age groups.</p>

<p>One in 9 (11.1%, 538/4,843) people aged under 60 died at home, and 1 in 4 (25.9%, 11,118/42,981) people aged 80 and over died in a care home.</p>

<p>*Data are presented from 29 June 2020 to 14 February 2021.</p>

<p>†Deaths within 60 days of a positive COVID-19 test or where COVID-19 is mentioned on the death certificate.</p>

<p>Residential property type categorisation was obtained though address matching against national reference databases (Ordnance Survey Address Base Premium) to assign a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN).  In this report, residential property type is categorised to: Residential dwelling, care/nursing home and other property classifications (including prisons, residential institutions, and homeless). Deaths without residential property categories have been included in the calculation of the proportion of deaths in hospital.</p>

<p>From week 27 onwards, among care home residents who died with COVID-19, 1 in 3 (35.3%) died in hospital and 2 in 3 (64.7%) died outside the hospital setting. In comparison, 81.7% of deaths in people who lived in residential dwellings occurred in hospital.</p>
