<h2>COVID-19 deaths</h2>

<p>Public Health England has published national statistics on deaths in people with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 since 29 April 2020. In this report we present the latest data on COVID-19 mortality. Further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-data-series-on-deaths-in-people-with-covid-19-technical-summary">information on the data series can be found here</a>.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<p>Laboratory diagnoses of COVID-19 (pillar 1 and 2) were derived from SGSS cases resident in England.</p>

<p>Fact and date of death were derived from combined sources: NHS England hospital deaths, Office for National Statistics death registrations, PHE HPT direct reporting, DBS tracing of laboratory-confirmed cases.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>In this report deaths are defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a death in a person with a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test and either died within 60 days of the first specimen date</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>died more than 60 days after the first specimen date, only if COVID-19 is mentioned on the death certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>This data does not include deaths in people where COVID-19 is suspected but not confirmed by testing (SARS-CoV-2 testing either negative or not done).</p>

<p>This data does not report cause of death, and as such represents deaths in people with COVID-19 and not necessarily caused by COVID-19.</p>

<p>In this report, data is reported to 31 December 2020. The first wave of the epidemic in England is defined as the period up to week 27 (from 30 January to 28 June 2020).</p>

<p>Mortality rate is calculated using 2019 ONS population estimates data.</p>

<p>Age-standardised rates adjust for differences in the age structure of populations. The standard used throughout this report is the European Standard Population 2013.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>Comparisons between the first wave of the epidemic and the time following this should be interpreted with caution considering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes in testing coverage and detection rate of COVID-19 infections:
    <ul>
      <li>the first wave of the epidemic was associated with very limited case detection, therefore with a very limited number of COVID-19 cases being confirmed.</li>
      <li>due to relatively unconstrained testing laboratory capacity following the first wave of the epidemic, far more cases have been detected and confirmed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>changes in demographics of infected population</li>
  <li>changes in the effectiveness of treatment and health systems ability to care for severe COVID-19 cases</li>
</ul>

<h2>COVID-19 mortality rates</h2>

<p>Within the period from 30 January to 31 December 2020, 2,280,658 cases of COVID-19 have been detected in England.</p>

<p>In the same period, there have been 72,178 deaths in persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, with the first death occurring on 2 March 2020. This represents a mortality rate of 128.2 per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>Data from the first wave of the pandemic (to week 27) and the period of after the first wave (week 27 onwards) covers different lengths of time, therefore, comparisons should consider this.</p>

<h4>During the epidemic in England:</h4>

  <li>the highest peak recorded in daily deaths was 975 (1.73 per 100,000 population) during the first wave of the epidemic (to week 27)</li>
  <li>from week 27 we have seen a high of 545 (0.97 per 100,000 population) daily deaths.</li>

<h2>Case fatality risk</h2>

<p>Case fatality risk (<abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr>) describes the risk of death within 60 days of a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test. Cases diagnosed in the last 60 days were excluded from this analysis due to incomplete follow-up period.</p>

<p>For this report, <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> has been calculated within 60 days of an individual’s first positive specimen. <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> is reported on data from the period of transitioning into mass testing, week 29 (4 May 2020) up to and including the 1 November 2020. Laboratory confirmed deaths are excluded from the <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> calculation if they cannot be linked to the confirmed COVID-19 case data held by PHE.</p>

<p><abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> is sensitive to change in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>testing coverage and detection rate of COVID-19 infections (Dudel et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020)</li>
  <li>demographics of infected population (which can be mitigated by age- and gender-stratification)</li>
  <li>the effectiveness of treatment and health systems ability to care for severe COVID-19 cases</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The time period presented covers a period where there has been improved testing availability, therefore apparent changes in estimated case fatality should be interpreted with caution</p>

<p>Numbers of cases and deaths are stacked by week. Cases are presented by week of specimen date. Deaths are presented by week of death.</p>
