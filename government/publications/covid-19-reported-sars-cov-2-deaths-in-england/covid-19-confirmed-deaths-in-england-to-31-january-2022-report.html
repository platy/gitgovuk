<h2>COVID-19 deaths</h2>

<p>UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), formerly Public Health England (PHE), has published statistics on deaths in people with positive coronavirus (COVID-19) specimens since 29 April 2020. In this report we present the latest data on COVID-19 mortality.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-data-series-on-deaths-in-people-with-covid-19-technical-summary">Read further information on the data series</a>.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<p>COVID-19 cases resident in England were identified from the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS).</p>

<p>Fact and date of death were derived from combined sources: NHS England hospital deaths, Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) death registrations, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Health Protection Team direct reporting and Demographic Batch Service tracing of COVID-19 specimens.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>As of 1 February 2022, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has begun reporting deaths following COVID-19 re-infections. From this point, reported deaths in people with COVID-19 are considered from the first positive specimen date of the most recent episode of infection, rather than an individual’s first ever positive specimen date.</p>

<p>In this report deaths are defined as a death in a person with a COVID-19 specimen and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>died within 60 days of the first specimen date of the most recent infection
or</li>
  <li>died more than 60 days after the first specimen date of the most recent infection with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>This data does not include deaths in people where COVID-19 is suspected but not confirmed by testing (SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> either negative or not tested).</p>

<p>This data does not report cause of death, and as such represents all deaths in people with a COVID-19 specimen, not just those caused by COVID-19.</p>

<p>In this report, data is reported from 1 February 2021 to 31 January 2022.</p>

<p>Mortality rates are calculated using 2020 <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> population estimates data.</p>

<p>Age-standardised rates adjust for differences in the age structure of populations. The standard used throughout this report is the European Standard Population 2013.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Mortality rates presented for different time periods have been annualised to enable comparisons. This method involves adjusting the population data used to calculate rates for the time covered, these are expressed as mortality rates per 100,000 population per year. These rates cannot be compared with rates that do not have this adjustment.</p>

<p>Mortality rates by region, local authority, sex, ethnic group, and Index of Multiple Deprivation (<abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr>) have been age-standardised to account for the different age distributions within different populations.</p>

<p>All figures displaying mortality rates have been calculated using a 7-day rolling average, to allow for smoothing of fluctuating data.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 mortality rates</h2>

<p>Within the period 1 February 2021 to 31 January 2022, 11,561,049 cases of COVID-19 were detected in England.</p>

<p>In the same period, there have been 53,356 deaths in persons with a COVID-19 specimen. This represents a crude mortality rate of 94 per 100,000 population. From 1 February 2021 onwards, the highest recorded number of daily deaths was 926 deaths on 1 February 2021.</p>

<h2>Deprivation</h2>

<p>Relative deprivation was assessed using quintiles of the <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> linked to residential lower super output area, with <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> 1 representing the most deprived. Overall, from 1 February 2021, the age-adjusted annualised mortality rate was highest among those living in the most deprived areas, with a gradual decrease in mortality rate seen with decreasing deprivation.</p>

<p>In January 2022, the age-adjusted annualised mortality rate was highest among those living in areas of <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> quintile 1, and the lowest mortality rate was seen among those in the least deprived quintile, quintile 5.</p>

<h2>Case fatality risk</h2>

<p>Case fatality risk (<abbr title="Case fatality risk">CFR</abbr>) describes the risk of death following a positive COVID-19 specimen. For this report, <abbr title="Case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> has been calculated within 60 days of an individual’s first positive specimen (from <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>, <abbr title="loop mediated isothermal amplification">LAMP</abbr>, and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests) <abbr title="Case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> is reported on data from 1 February 2021 up to and including 10 December 2021.</p>

<p>Cases diagnosed in the last 60 days were excluded from this analysis, due to incomplete follow-up period. Deaths are excluded from the <abbr title="Case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> calculation if they cannot be linked to COVID-19 case data.</p>

<p><abbr title="Case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> is sensitive to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes in testing coverage and detection rate of COVID-19 infections (Dudel and others, 2020; Wu and others, 2020; Harman and others, 2021)</li>
  <li>changes in the demographics of the infected population</li>
  <li>changes in the effectiveness of treatment and the health system’s ability to care for severe COVID-19 cases</li>
