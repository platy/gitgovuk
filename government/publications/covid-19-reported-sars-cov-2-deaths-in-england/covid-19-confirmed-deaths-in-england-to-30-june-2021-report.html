<p>Due to a misclassification of 2 subgroups within the Asian and Asian British and Black and Black British ethnic categories, the mortality rates reported for these ethnic groups were incorrect in this report, published on 14 July 2021.&nbsp;These have been corrected since 12 August 2021.&nbsp;The impact of the correction specifically affects the mortality rates presented for those of Asian and Asian British and/or Black and Black British ethnic categories, no other ethnic groups were affected by this error. The total number of deaths and other mortality rate calculations reported are unaffected.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 deaths</h2>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published statistics on deaths in people with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 since 29 April 2020. In this report we present the latest data on COVID-19 mortality. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-data-series-on-deaths-in-people-with-covid-19-technical-summary">Further information on the data series can be found here</a>.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<p>Cases of laboratory diagnosed COVID-19 resident in England were identified from the Second Generation Surveillance System (<abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Fact and date of death were derived from combined sources: NHS England hospital deaths, Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) death registrations, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Health Protection Team direct reporting and Demographic Batch Service tracing of laboratory-confirmed cases.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>In this report deaths are defined as a death in a person with a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>died within 60 days of the first specimen date</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>died more than 60 days after the first specimen date with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>This data does not include deaths in people where COVID-19 is suspected but not confirmed by testing (SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> either negative or not tested).</p>

<p>This data does not report cause of death, and as such represents all deaths in people with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, not just those caused by COVID-19.</p>

<p>In this report, data is reported from 29 June 2020 to 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>Mortality rates are calculated using 2019 <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> population estimates data.</p>

<p>Age-standardised rates adjust for differences in the age structure of populations. The standard used throughout this report is the European Standard Population 2013.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Mortality rates presented for different time periods have been annualised in order to enable comparisons. This method involves adjusting the population data used to calculate rates for the time period covered, these are expressed as mortality rates per 100,000 population per year. These rates cannot be compared with rates that do not have this adjustment.</p>

<p>Mortality rates by region, local authority, sex, ethnic group and Index of Multiple Deprivation (<abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr>) have been age-standardised to account for the different age distributions within different populations.</p>

<p>All figures displaying mortality rates have been calculated using a 7-day rolling average, to allow for smoothing of fluctuating data.</p>

<p>To note, from 6 July, ethnicity data has been updated based on a new method for assigning ethnicity developed by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>. The previous method used the most recent ethnicity recorded through linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics and was supplemented by self-reported ethnicity recorded on test request forms. The new method uses self-reported ethnicity from test request forms and supplements this with the most frequent ethnicity recorded through linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics, unless the most frequent was âOtherâ when the second most frequent was chosen. The new method has resulted in a reduction in the number of cases allocated to the âOtherâ ethnic group and a slight increase in the % allocated to all other ethnic groups.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 mortality rates</h2>

<p>Within the period 29 June 2020 to 30 June 2021, 3,974,558 cases of COVID-19 were detected in England. 
In the same period, there have been 92,011 deaths in persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This represents a crude mortality rate of 163.0 per 100,000 population. From 29 June 2020 onwards, the highest recorded number of daily deaths was 1,504 deaths on 19 January 2021.</p>

<h2>Deprivation</h2>

<p>Relative deprivation was assessed using quintiles of the <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> linked to residential lower super output area, with <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> 1 representing the most deprived. Overall, the age-adjusted annualised mortality rate is highest among those living in the most deprived areas, with a gradual decrease in mortality rate seen with decreasing deprivation.</p>

<h2>Case fatality risk</h2>

<p>Case fatality risk (<abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr>) describes the risk of death following a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test. For this report, <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> has been calculated within 60 days of an individualâs first positive specimen (from <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>, LAMP, and LFD tests) <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> is reported on data from week 27 (29 June 2020) up to and including 6 May 2021. Cases diagnosed in the last 60 days were excluded from this analysis, due to incomplete follow-up period. Deaths are excluded from the <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> calculation if they cannot be linked to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case data.</p>

<p><abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> is sensitive to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>changes in testing coverage and detection rate of COVID-19 infections (Dudel and others, 2020; Wu and others, 2020; Harman and others, 2021)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>changes in the demographics of the infected population</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>changes in the effectiveness of treatment and the health systemâs ability to care for severe COVID-19 cases</p>
