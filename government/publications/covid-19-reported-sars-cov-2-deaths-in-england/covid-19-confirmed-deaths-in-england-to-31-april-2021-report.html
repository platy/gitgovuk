<h2>COVID-19 deaths</h2>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has published statistics on deaths in people with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 since 29 April 2020. In this report we present the latest data on COVID-19 mortality. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-data-series-on-deaths-in-people-with-covid-19-technical-summary">Further information on the data series can be found here</a>.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<p>Cases of laboratory diagnosed COVID-19 resident in England were identified from the Second Generation Surveillance System (<abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Fact and date of death were derived from combined sources: NHS England hospital deaths, Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) death registrations, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Health Protection Team direct reporting and Demographic Batch Service tracing of laboratory-confirmed cases.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>In this report deaths are defined as a death in a person with a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>died within 60 days of the first specimen date</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>died more than 60 days after the first specimen date with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>This data does not include deaths in people where COVID-19 is suspected but not confirmed by testing (SARS-CoV-2 PCR either negative or not tested).</p>

<p>This data does not report cause of death, and as such represents all deaths in people with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, not just those caused by COVID-19.</p>

<p>In this report, data is reported from 29 June 2020 to 30 April 2021.</p>

<p>Mortality rates are calculated using 2019 <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> population estimates data.</p>

<p>Age-standardised rates adjust for differences in the age structure of populations. The standard used throughout this report is the European Standard Population 2013.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Mortality rates presented for different time periods have been annualised in order to enable comparisons. This method involves adjusting the population data used to calculate rates for the time period covered, these are expressed as mortality rates per 100,000 population per year. These rates cannot be compared with rates that do not have this adjustment.</p>

<p>Mortality rates by region, local authority, sex, ethnic group and Index of Multiple Deprivation (<abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr>) have been age-standardised to account for the different age distributions within different populations.</p>

<p>All figures displaying mortality rates have been calculated using a 7-day rolling average, to allow for smoothing of fluctuating data.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 mortality rates</h2>

<p>Within the period 29 June 2020 to 30 April 2021, 3,624,305 cases of COVID-19 were detected in England.</p>

<p>In the same period, there have been 90,931 deaths in persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This represents a crude mortality rate of 161.6 per 100,000 population. From 29 June 2020 onwards, the highest recorded number of daily deaths was 1,504 deaths on 19 January 2021.</p>

<p>Overall, the age-adjusted annualised mortality rate from 29 June 2020 onwards was highest among those of Other ethnic groups (annualised rate of 875.3 per 100,000 population per year) followed by those of Asian or Asian British ethnic groups (annualised rate of 391.9 per 100,000 population per year). Although 87.2% deaths have been reported among those of White or White British ethnic groups, the age-adjusted mortality rate is lowest among this ethnic group (annualised rate of 188.0 per 100,000 population per year).</p>

<h2>Deprivation</h2>

<p>Relative deprivation was assessed using quintiles of the <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> linked to residential lower super output area, with <abbr title="Index of Multiple Deprivation">IMD</abbr> 1 representing the most deprived. Overall, the age-adjusted annualised mortality rate is highest among those living in the most deprived areas, with a gradual decrease in mortality rate seen with decreasing deprivation.</p>

<h2>Case fatality risk</h2>

<p>Case fatality risk (<abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr>) describes the risk of death following a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test. For this report, <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> has been calculated within 60 days of an individualâs first positive specimen (from PCR, LAMP, and LFD tests) <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> is reported on data from week 27 (29 June 2020) up to and including 6 March 2021.</p>

<p>Cases diagnosed in the last 60 days were excluded from this analysis, due to incomplete follow-up period. Deaths are excluded from the <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> calculation if they cannot be linked to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case data.</p>

<p><abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> is sensitive to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes in testing coverage and detection rate of COVID-19 infections (Dudel and others, 2020; Wu and others, 2020; Harman and others, 2021)</li>
  <li>changes in the demographics of the infected population</li>
  <li>changes in the effectiveness of treatment and the health systemâs ability to care for severe COVID-19 cases</li>

<h2>
<abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> by age and sex</h2>

<p>Between 29 June 2020 and 28 February 2021, <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> peaked approximately 2 weeks after the highest case numbers, reflecting the pressures on the healthcare system.</p>

<p>Overall <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> was highest among those aged over 80 (<abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> 30.8% (95% CI: 30.5, 31.0)), this trend is seen among both males and females. The <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> in males in the 80+ age group is 39.0% (95% CI: 38.6, 39.5), in comparison, the <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> in females aged 80+ was slightly lower at 26.0% (95% CI: 25.7, 26.3). The <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> for people aged under 40 years old remains very low, at less than 0.3%.</p>

<p>Since December 2020, the <abbr title="case fatality risk">CFR</abbr> has declined in the oldest age group (80+) and a decline has been seen in those aged 70 to 79 since January 2021. This is likely to reflect both the vaccination roll out and national lockdown, resulting in decreased pressure on healthcare services as cases decline.</p>
