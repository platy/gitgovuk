<p>This factsheet tells you about compliance checks into large and complex businesses. It’s one of a series of compliance checks factsheets. For the full list, go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘HMRC compliance checks factsheets’.</p>

<h2>How we work with large and complex businesses</h2>

<p>The tax affairs of the largest and most complex businesses are looked after by the Large Business part of HMRC. Each is allocated a Customer Compliance Manager (<abbr title="Customer Compliance Manager">CCM</abbr>) because of their size or the complexity of their tax affairs. The <abbr title="Customer Compliance Manager">CCM</abbr> manages HMRC’s compliance activities and the relationship between the business and HMRC across all taxes and duties. Our <abbr title="Customer Compliance Managers">CCMs</abbr> work with these large business customers to identify, check and manage tax risk.</p>

<p>Our goal is to build an open and trusting relationship with these businesses. To do this, we’ll:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be open and transparent in our dealings with you</li>
  <li>expect you to co-operate openly and transparently with us</li>
  <li>work with you to explore tax risks that we, or you, identify</li>
  <li>discuss those risks with you in the first instance, before considering the use of formal powers</li>
</ul>

<p>We may however need to use our formal powers or issue an assessment notice under certain circumstances. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you prefer a formal approach</li>
  <li>where a time limit for making an assessment is approaching</li>
  <li>if we’ve been unable to resolve an issue and need to formally request information from you</li>
  <li>if the issue is likely to be taken before an independent appeal tribunal for a decision</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are compliance checks</h2>

<p>We carry out checks into returns or other documents to make sure that our customers pay the right amount of tax at the right time and receive the right allowances and tax reliefs. We call these checks ‘compliance checks’.</p>

<p>If we start a check, we’ll tell you what we’re checking. We’ll ask you to give us any information or documents that we may need. If you are not sure why we’re asking for something, please tell us and we’ll explain why we need it.</p>

<p>Please tell us if you cannot do what we ask, or if you think that something we’ve asked for is unreasonable or not relevant to the check. We’ll consider your reasons carefully and if we still think that we need it, we’ll tell you why.</p>

<h2>The benefits of helping us with a check</h2>

<p>If you help us with the compliance check, we can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete it quickly and reduce any inconvenience to you</li>
  <li>reduce the amount of any penalty we charge you if we find there’s something wrong</li>
</ul>

<p>If we find something wrong, we’ll work with you to put it right, and tell you if you need to pay any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>additional tax and late payment interest</li>
  <li>penalties</li>
</ul>

<p>If we’re considering charging you a penalty, we’ll look at how much assistance you’ve given us during the check. We call this assistance the ‘quality of disclosure’, or ‘telling, helping and giving’.</p>

<p>We measure the quality of disclosure by considering how much:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you tell us about what’s wrong</li>
  <li>help you give us to work out what’s wrong</li>
  <li>access you give us to the information or documents we need to complete the check</li>
</ul>

<p>If there are ways that you can help us with the check, but you choose not to, this will affect our view on the quality of disclosure. For example, if we ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to visit your business premises to inspect your business records, assets or premises, or to carry out a valuation but you do not let us</li>
  <li>for information or documents, but you do not give us everything we’ve asked for</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use of open source material during a compliance check</h2>

<p>We may observe, monitor, record and retain internet data which is available to anyone. This is known as ‘open source’ material and includes news reports, internet sites, Companies House and Land Registry records, blogs and social networking sites where no privacy settings have been applied.</p>

<h2>How to get the maximum penalty reduction if something is wrong</h2>

<p>If there’s something wrong and you do everything you can to assist us, we’ll reduce the penalty by the maximum amount possible.</p>

<p>If you know or suspect that there’s something wrong, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell us everything you know about it immediately</li>
  <li>work with us to calculate the right amount of tax</li>
</ul>

<p>If we find something wrong that you did not know about, to get the maximum reduction possible, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have given us as much assistance as we needed, up to the point we found something wrong</li>
  <li>immediately tell the officer dealing with the check everything about it, let them see any records they ask for, and help them to work out the right amount of tax</li>
</ul>

<p>To work out the quality of disclosure, we also consider how long it’s taken you to tell us about anything that’s wrong. If it’s taken you a long time, for example 3 years or more, we usually restrict the maximum reduction we give for the quality of disclosure to 10 percentage points above the minimum of the penalty range. This means you will not benefit from the lowest penalty percentage that’s normally available.</p>

<p>For more information about penalties, go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘HMRC compliance checks factsheets’ then select ‘Penalties’.</p>

<h2>If you’ve deliberately done something wrong</h2>

<p>We may carry out a criminal investigation with a view to prosecution if you’ve deliberately done something wrong, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>given us information that you know is not true, either verbally or in a document</li>
  <li>dishonestly misrepresented how much tax you owe, or claimed payments you’re not entitled to</li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing serious defaulters</h3>

<p>If you deliberately got your tax affairs wrong, and we find this during the check, we may monitor your tax affairs more closely. We have an enhanced monitoring programme called ‘managing serious defaulters’. For more information, read factsheet CC/FS14, ‘Managing serious defaulters’. Go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘CC/FS14’.</p>

<h3>Publishing details of deliberate defaulters</h3>

<p>We may publish your details if you deliberately got your tax affairs wrong, but we will not do this if we’ve given you the maximum penalty reduction. For more information, read factsheet CC/FS13, ‘Publishing details of deliberate defaulters’. Go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘CC/FS13’.</p>

<h2>If you disagree</h2>

<p>If there’s something that you do not agree with, please tell us. In most Large Business cases you should expect the <abbr title="Customer Compliance Manager">CCM</abbr> to work with you to resolve disputes.</p>

<p>If we make a decision that you can appeal against, we’ll write to you about the decision and tell you what to do if you disagree. You’ll usually have 3 options. Within 30 days you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send new information to your <abbr title="Customer Compliance Manager">CCM</abbr> and ask them to take it into account</li>
  <li>have your case reviewed by an HMRC officer who has not been involved in the matter</li>
  <li>arrange for an independent tribunal to hear your appeal and decide the matter</li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever you choose, you may also be able to ask for an HMRC specialist officer to act as a neutral facilitator to help resolve the dispute. We call this ‘Alternative Dispute Resolution’ (<abbr title="Alternative Dispute Resolution">ADR</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Alternative Dispute Resolution">ADR</abbr> is only available for disputes that relate to specific tax areas. The officer dealing with the check will tell you if <abbr title="Alternative Dispute Resolution">ADR</abbr> is available for your dispute. For more information about appeals and <abbr title="Alternative Dispute Resolution">ADR</abbr>, read factsheets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HMRC1, ‘HM Revenue and Customs decisions — what to do if you disagree’</li>
  <li>CC/FS21, ‘Alternative Dispute Resolution’</li>
</ul>

<p>Go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘HMRC1’ or ‘CC/FS21’.</p>

<h2>Your principal rights and obligations</h2>

<p>You have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the right to be represented — you can appoint anyone to act on your behalf</li>
  <li>an obligation to take reasonable care to get things right — if you have an adviser, you must still take reasonable care to make sure that any returns, documents or details they send us on your behalf are correct</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘HMRC Charter’ explains what you can expect from us and what we expect from you. For more information, go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘HMRC Charter’.</p>

<h2>Your rights if we’re considering penalties</h2>

<p>We’ll tell you if there’s something wrong and we’re considering penalties. To find out what rights you have when we consider penalties, read factsheet CC/FS9, ‘The Human Rights Act and penalties’. Go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘CC/FS9’.</p>
