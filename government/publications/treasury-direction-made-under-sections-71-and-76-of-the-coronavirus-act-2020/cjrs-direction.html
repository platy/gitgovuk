<h4>Schedule - Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</h4>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>1.1 This Schedule sets out modifications to the scheme known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme {“CJRS”) established by the CJRS directions.</p>

<p>1.2 In particular-</p>

<p>(a) part 1 of this Schedule makes provision extending CJRS for the period beginning on 1 November 2020 and ending on 31 January 2021;</p>

<p>(b) part 2 of this Schedule modifies CJRS by withdrawing the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme {Job Retention) Bonus {“CJRS(JR)B”) established by part 2 of the Schedule to the direction made on 1 October 2020 by the Treasury in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 71 and 76 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 (“the CJRS(JR)B direction”) because the purpose of CJRS(JR)B has been superseded by the provision made by part 1 of this Schedule.</p>

<p>1.3 The provision made by part 1 of this Schedule in relation to CJRS is without prejudice to any matter in connection with the provision made by the CJRS directions.</p>

<h4>Purpose of CJRS</h4>

<p>2.1 The purpose of CJRS is to provide for payments to be made to employers on a claim made in respect of them incurring costs of employment in respect of employees who are within the scope of CJRS arising from the health, social and economic emergency in the United Kingdom resulting from coronavirus and coronavirus disease.</p>

<p>2.2 The extension of CJRS by this direction is necessary for the purpose of CJRS described in paragraph 2.1 arising from the emergency resulting from the resurgence of the incidence of coronavirus and coronavirus disease and the measures taken to reduce further transmission, loss of life, demands upon healthcare resources and damage to economic activity in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>2.3 Integral to the purpose of CJRS is that the amounts paid to an employer pursuant to a CJRS claim are only made by way of reimbursement of the expenditure incurred or to be incurred by the employer in respect of the employee to which the claim relates whose employment activities have been adversely affected by the coronavirus and coronavirus disease or the measures taken to prevent or limit its further transmission.</p>

<p>2.4 CJRS claims must be made in such form and manner and contain such information as HMRC may require at any time (whether before or after payment of the claim) to establish entitlement to payment under CJRS.</p>

<p>2.5 Before making payment of a CJRS claim, HMRC must, by publicly available guidance, other publication generally available to the public, or such other means considered appropriate by HMRC, inform a person making a CJRS claim that, by making the claim, the person making the claim accepts that-</p>

<p>(a) a payment made pursuant to such claim is made only for the purpose of CJRS (and, in particular, as provided for by paragraph 2.3),</p>

<p>(b) the payment must be returned to HMRC immediately upon the person making the CJRS claim becoming unwilling or unable to use the payment for the purpose of CJRS, and</p>

<p>(c) HMRC must publish information about an employer who has received a payment pursuant to a CJRS claim made under this direction in respect a CJRS claim period occurring-</p>

<p>(i) in December 2020, or</p>

<p>(ii) in January 2021.</p>

<p>2.6 No CJRS claim may be made in respect of an employee if it is abusive or is otherwise contrary to the exceptional purpose of CJRS.</p>

<p>(c)	the employee-</p>

<p>(i)	does no work in relation to their employment during the CJRS claim period, or</p>

<p>(ii)	does not work the full amount of the employee’s usual hours in relation to their employment during the CJRS claim period,</p>

<p>(d)	the instruction is given by reason of circumstances arising as a result of coronavirus or coronavirus disease or measures taken to prevent or limit its further transmission, and</p>

<p>(e)	there is an agreement in accordance with paragraphs 7.1 to 7.3 having effect for the period covered by the CJRS claim period.</p>

their employment,</p>

<p>(c)	the agreement (including a collective agreement)-</p>

<p>(b)	relates to-</p>

<p>(i)	a period of 7 or more consecutive days, or</p>

<p>(b)	ends on the last day of a CJRS extension calendar month.</p>

<p>8.4 A CJRS claim in relation to an employee may only be made in respect of an orphan period if the employer also makes a CJRS claim in respect of that employee for a CJRS claim period ending immediately before that orphan period.</p>

<p>8.5 A CJRS claim must not be made if the CJRS claim period would include a day that is not a permitted CJRS day.</p>

<p>8.6 A day is a permitted CJRS day if that day-</p>

<p>(a)	falls in a period that is (or will be) covered by a CJRS claim period (“relevant CJRS claim period”), and</p>

<p>(b)	does not fall in a period covered by a CJRS claim period that-</p>

<p>(i)	begins on a different day to the day on which the relevant CJRS claim period begins, or</p>

<p>(ii)	ends on a different day to the day on which the relevant CJRS claim period ends.</p>

<p>8.7 The CJRS extension calendar months are-</p>

<p>(a)	November 2020;</p>

<p>(b)	December 2020;</p>

<p>(c)	January 2021.</p>

<h4>Qualifying costs</h4>

<p>9.1 The costs of employment in respect of which an employer may make a CJRS claim are costs which-</p>

<p>(a)	relate to an employee who is a flexibly-furloughed employee for the CJRS claim
period,</p>

<p>(b)	relate to the payment of earnings to the employee during that period, and</p>

<p>(c)	meet the condition in paragraph 9.2 in relation to the employee’s furloughed hours occurring in the CJRS claim period.</p>

<p>9.2 The condition referred to in paragraph 9.1(c) is that the amount payable to the employee in relation to the employee’s furloughed hours occurring in the CJRS claim period is an amount equal to or more than an amount determined in accordance with-</p>

<p>(a)	the formula set out in paragraph 9.3, or</p>

<p>(b)	if the amount payable to the employee in relation to the employee’s furloughed
hours occurring in the CJRS claim period is less than the amount determined in
accordance with the formula set out paragraph 9.3, the formula set out in paragraph 9.4.</p>

<p>9.3 The formula referred to in paragraph 9.2(a) is-
A x F / U</p>

<p>9.4 The formula referred to in paragraph 9.2(b) is-
B x F / U</p>

<p>9.5 For the purposes of paragraphs 9.3 and 9.4-</p>

<p>(a) A is-</p>

<p>(i) £2500 if the CJRS claim period covers the whole of the CJRS extension calendar month to which the CJRS claim relates, or</p>

<p>(ii) if the CJRS claim period is for a period that does not cover the whole of the CJRS extension calendar month to which the claim relates, the appropriate pro-rata;</p>

<p>(c) F is the number of furloughed hours in the CJRS claim period;</p>

<p>(d) U is the number of usual hours in the CJRS claim period.</p>

<p>9.6 Paragraph 9.7 applies where the period of time covered by a CJRS claim period in respect of an employee is not the same as, or comparable to, the period of time covered by the salary period by reference to which the employee’s reference salary is determined in accordance with paragraphs 13.2, 14.2 or 14.3.</p>

<p>9.7 For the purposes of determining the amount B (see paragraph 9.5(b)), the employee’s reference salary must be adjusted proportionately to ensure that the reference salary fairly reflects the proportion attributable to the period covered by the CJRS claim period.</p>

<p>9.8 For the purposes of paragraph 9.6, the period of time covered by a CJRS claim period and  the period of time covered by a salary period are comparable if-</p>

<p>(a) the CJRS claim period is for the whole of a CJRS month, and</p>

<p>(b) the period of time covered by the salary period is no less than 28 days and no more than 31 days.</p>

<p>9.9 The condition in paragraph 9.2 is not met if the amount payable in respect of the employee is not paid to the employee.</p>

<h4>Simplification of a CJRS claim allowable where an employee does no work in a CJRS claim period</h4>

<p>10.1 Where an employee does no work in a CJRS claim period, paragraph 9.2 may be applied as if the condition in that paragraph required the amount payable to the employee in respect of the CJRS claim period to be an amount equal to or more than an amount determined in accordance with-</p>

<p>(a)	the amount A (see paragraph 9.5(a)), or</p>

<p>(b)	the amount B (see paragraph 9.5(b)) if the amount payable in respect of the CJRS claim period is less than the amount A.</p>

<p>10.2 Where paragraph 9.2 is applied as described in paragraph 10.1, the provision made by Part 1 of this Schedule (in particular, paragraphs 9.5 to 9.8, 24 and 25.1 must be construed accordingly.</p>

<p>11.4	In determining whether paragraph 11.3 applies to an employee-</p>

<p>(a) 	a return is delivered to HMRC on the day that the return is received by HMRC;</p>

<p>(b)	a payment made to an employee reported to HMRC in a return delivered to HMRC on or before 19 March 2020 must be disregarded if-</p>

<p>(i) 	the employee’s employer has reported to HMRC a cessation of the employee’s employment,</p>

<p>(ii)	the cessation of the employee’s employment occurred after the making of the payment, and</p>

<p>(iii)	the cessation of the employee’s employment occurred on or before 23 September 2020.</p>

<p>11.5	This paragraph applies to an employee if the employee’s employer-</p>

<p>(a)	has made a CJRS claim in relation to the employee by virtue of a relevant provision, and</p>

<p>(b)	on or before 23 September 2020.</p>

<p>11.8	The relevant reference day in relation to an employee to whom neither paragraph 11.3 nor paragraph 11.5 applies is 30 October 2020.</p>

<h4>Reference salary</h4>

<p>12.1	The reference salary of an employee must be determined in accordance with-</p>

<p>(a)	paragraphs 13.1 to 13.8 and 15.1 to 15.7 if the employee is a fixed rate employee, and</p>

<p>(b)	paragraphs 14.1 and 14.2 and 15.1 to 15.7 if the employee is not a fixed rate employee.</p>

<h4>Reference salary – fixed rate employees</h4>

<p>13.1	A person is a fixed rate employee if-</p>

<p>(a)	the person is-</p>

<p>(i) 	an employee, or</p>

<p>(ii)	treated as an employee for the purposes of CJRS by virtue of paragraph 35.3(a) (member of a limited liability partnership),</p>

<p>(b)	the person is entitled under their contract to be paid an annual salary,</p>

<p>(c)	the person is entitled under their contract to be paid that salary in respect of a number of hours in a year whether those hours are specified in or ascertained in accordance with their contract (“the basic hours”),</p>

<p>(d)	the person is not entitled under their contract to a payment in respect of the basic hours other than an annual salary,</p>

<p>(e)	the person is entitled under their contract to be paid, where practicable and regardless of the number of hours actually worked in a particular week or month in equal weekly, multiple of weeks or monthly instalments, and</p>

<p>(f)	the basic hours worked in a salary period do not normally vary according to business, economic or agricultural seasonal considerations.</p>

<p>13.2	The reference salary of a fixed rate employee is the amount payable to the employee in the latest salary period ending on or before the employee’s relevant reference day (but disregarding anything which is not regular salary or wages as described in paragraph 15.1).</p>

<p>13.3	In paragraph 13.1, “contract” means a legally enforceable agreement as described in paragraph 15.2(b).</p>

<p>13.4	In respect of a fixed rate employee, where a period by reference to which the reference salary is determinable (“reference salary period”) includes a period of unpaid sabbatical or unpaid leave (“unpaid period”), the reference salary must be determined on the basis of what would have been paid to the employee during the unpaid period if the sabbatical or leave had been granted on the same terms as the employee’s paid leave during the reference salary period taking account of the matters described in paragraphs 13.5 to 13.8 as are appropriate.</p>

<p>13.5	In paragraph 13.4-</p>

<p>(a)	the reference to the terms of an employee’s paid leave during a reference salary period is a reference to the terms applying in respect of the annual leave to which the employee would have been entitled to be paid pursuant to regulation 16 of the Working Time Regulations 1998 or regulation 20 of the Working Time (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2016 (“paid annual leave”) if the period of unpaid leave had been a period of paid annual leave;</p>

<p>(b)	the references to unpaid sabbatical and unpaid leave also include references to-</p>

<p>(i) 	statutory payment leave, and</p>

<p>(ii)	reduced rate paid leave.</p>

<p>13.6	In paragraph 13.5(b)(i), “statutory payment leave” means a period of leave-</p>

<p>(a)	in respect of which statutory sick pay or any of the statutory payments specified in paragraph 26.2 is in payment or due to be paid, or</p>

<p>(b)	which is a period of shared parental leave as provided for by regulations made pursuant to sections 75E and 75G of the Employment Rights Act 1996 or articles 107E and 107G of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (whether or not statutory shared parental pay described in paragraph 26.2(d) is in payment or due to be paid in respect of that period).</p>

<p>13.7	In paragraph 13.5(b)(ii), “reduced rate paid leave” means a period of leave granted immediately following the ending of a period of statutory payment leave on terms that are not the terms which would have applied to that period of leave if the leave had been granted on the same terms that would have applied if the leave had been a part of the employee’s statutory leave entitlement.</p>

<p>13.8	For the purposes of paragraph 13.6(a), it does not matter if, by virtue of a legally enforceable agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions, the person described in that paragraph has been paid an amount in excess of the amount otherwise payable by way of statutory sick pay or the statutory payments specified in paragraph 26.2 to which the statutory payment leave relates.</p>

<h4>Reference salary – employees other than fixed rate employees</h4>

<p>14.1	The reference salary of an employee (or a person treated as an employee for the purposes of CJRS by virtue of paragraph 35.3(a) (member of a limited liability partnership)) who is not a fixed rate employee must be determined in accordance with-</p>

<p>(a)	paragraph 14.2 in relation to an employee whose relevant reference day is 19 March 2020, and</p>

<p>(b)	paragraph 14.3 in relation to an employee whose relevant reference day is 30 October 2020.</p>

<p>14.2	The reference salary of an employee (or a person treated as an employee for the purposes of CJRS by virtue of paragraph 35.3(a) (member of a limited liability partnership)) whose relevant reference day is 19 March 2020 is the greater of-</p>

<p>(a)	the average monthly (or daily or other appropriate pro-rata) amount payable to the employee in the period comprising the tax year 2019-20 (or, if less, the period of employment) before the period covered by a CJRS claim began, and</p>

<p>(b)	the amount earned by the employee in the corresponding calendar period in the previous year.</p>

<p>14.3	The reference salary of an employee (or a person treated as an employee for the purposes of CJRS by virtue of paragraph 35.3(a) (member of a limited liability partnership)) whose relevant reference day is 30 October 2020 is the average monthly (or daily or other appropriate pro-rata) amount payable to the employee in the period-</p>

<p>(a)	beginning on the later of-</p>

<p>(i) 	6 April 2020, and</p>

<p>(ii)	the day when the employee’s employment with the employer began, and</p>

<p>(b)	ending immediately before the first period covered by a CJRS claim made pursuant to this direction began.</p>

<p>14.4 	The period of time by reference to which an employee’s reference salary is determined in accordance with paragraph 14.2 or 14.3 must be treated as the salary period by reference to which the employee’s reference salary is determined for the purposes of paragraphs 9.6 to 9.8.</p>

<h4>Reference salary – general provisions</h4>

<p>15.1	The following must not be included in the calculation of an employee’s reference salary for the purposes of paragraphs 13.2, 14.2 and 14.3-</p>

<p>(a)	benefits in kind;</p>

<p>(b)	anything provided or made available in lieu of a cash payment otherwise payable to the employee (including salary sacrifice schemes);</p>

<p>(c)	anything which is not regular salary or wages.</p>

<p>15.2	In paragraph 15.1(c) “regular” in relation to salary or wages means so much of the amount of the salary or wages as-</p>

<p>(a)  	cannot vary according to a relevant matter except where the variation in the amount arises from a non-discretionary payment (see paragraph 15.4), and</p>

<p>(b) 	arises from a legally enforceable agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions.</p>

<p>15.3	For the purposes of paragraph 15.2(a), the following are relevant matters-</p>

<p>(a) 	the performance of or any part of any business of the employer or any business of a person connected with the employer;</p>

<p>(b) 	the contribution made by the employee to the performance of, or any part of any business;</p>

<p>(c) 	the performance by the employee of any duties of the employment;</p>

<p>(d)	any similar considerations or amounts otherwise payable at the discretion of the employer or any other person (such as a gratuity).</p>

<p>15.4	A variation in an amount of wages or salary arises from a non-discretionary payment (see paragraph 15.2(a)) only if-</p>

<p>(a) 	the payment-</p>

<p>(i)	is in respect of overtime, fees, commissions or a piece rate,</p>

<p>(ii)	is made in recognition of the employee undertaking additional or exceptional responsibilities,</p>

<p>(b)	a legally enforceable agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions prescribe the method of calculating the amount of wages or salary payable in respect of the payment (whether or not that method involves the exercise of discretion by the employer or a person connected with the employer).</p>

<p>15.5	In calculating an employee’s reference salary in accordance with paragraphs 13.2, 14.2 or 14.3 in the case of a person (“P”) treated as an employee for the purposes of CJRS by virtue of paragraph 35.3(a) (member of a limited liability partnership) then, in addition to the matters described in paragraphs 15.1 to 15.3, no account is to be taken of an amount payable to P unless, by virtue of arrangements described in section 863B(5) of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, that amount-</p>

<p>(a) 	is fixed,</p>

<p>(b) 	is variable, but is varied without reference to the overall amount of the profits or losses of the limited liability partnership, or</p>

<p>(c) 	is not, in practice, affected by the overall amount of those profits or losses.</p>

<p>15.6	Where paragraph 15.7 applies, the sum of the original payment described in paragraph 15.7(a) and the further amount described in paragraph 15.7(c) must be treated as having been paid at the time of the payment of the original payment for the purposes of paragraph 9.2.</p>

<p>15.7	This paragraph applies where-</p>

<p>(a) 	an amount by way of wages or salary is paid in respect of a period of employment (“the original payment”) to an employee,</p>

<p>(b) 	the original payment is less than the amount required by paragraph 9.2 for the purpose of claiming CJRS,</p>

<p>(c) 	the employer has paid (or intends to pay within a reasonable period after receiving the payment claimed under CJRS) the employee a further amount (“the further amount”) in respect of the period of employment to which the original payment relates, and</p>

<p>(d) 	the sum of the original payment and the further amount meets the requirements of paragraph 9.2.</p>

<h4>CJRS claim period – meaning of usual hours</h4>

<p>16.1	The usual hours of an employee (whether or not the employee is a fixed rate employee) for a CJRS claim period must be determined-</p>

<p>(a)	on the fixed hours basis if paragraph 16.2 applies in relation to the employee, and</p>

<p>(b)	on the variable hours basis in any other case.</p>

<p>16.2	This paragraph applies in relation to an employee whose contract-</p>

<p>(a)	requires the employee to work a specific number of hours over a period of time prescribed by the contract, and</p>

<p>(b)	does not require the employee’s pay in respect of the period of time prescribed by the contract to vary according to the number of hours actually worked in that period.</p>

<p>16.3 	References to an employee’s contract in paragraphs 16.2, 17.4, 17.5, 20.4, 20.5 and 27.8 are to a legally enforceable agreement as described in paragraph 15.2(b).</p>

<p>(a)	the number of hours the employee must work over the course of the cycle before the next cycle begins, and</p>

<p>(b)	the number of calendar days in the cycle over which the hours must be worked (including days on which the employee is not required to work) before the next cycle begins.</p>

<p>17.5	The relevant repeating shift pattern is that having effect in relation to the employee under the terms of a contract having effect at the end of the latest salary period ending on or before the employee’s relevant reference day.</p>

<p>17.6	In determining the usual hours of an employee in relation to a period of time, an hour that would otherwise be counted as a usual hour determined on the fixed hours basis in respect of an employee must not be excluded from the total number of the employee’s usual hours solely because that hour is-</p>

<p>(a) 	statutory payment leave as described in paragraph 13.6, or</p>

<p>(b)	reduced rate paid leave as described in paragraph 13.7.</p>

<p>17.7	Paragraph 17.8 applies where-</p>

<p>(b)	the making of a CJRS claim would be facilitated by the provision made by paragraph 17.8, and</p>

<p>(c)	the amount of a CJRS claim determined in accordance with the facilitation permitted by paragraph 17.8 is not abusive or otherwise contrary to the purpose of CJRS.</p>

<p>17.8	Where this paragraph applies, the formula in paragraph 17.2 may be applied in respect of each salary period falling wholly or partly within the CJRS claim period as if CP referred to the number of calendar days covered by the salary period (or part thereof) falling within the CJRS claim period.</p>

<p>17.9	Where the formula in paragraph 17.2 is used to determine the usual hours for a salary period falling wholly or partly within a CJRS claim period (“relevant part CJRS claim period”), the amounts determined in accordance with the formulae in paragraphs 9.3 and 9.4 in respect of all relevant part CJRS claim periods must be totalled for the purposes of determining the amount claimable for the CJRS claim period of the CJRS claim.</p>

<p>17.10 In respect of a relevant part CJRS claim period-</p>

<p>(a)	paragraph 22.1 applies as if it provided that an amount of time that is less than an hour must be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number, and</p>

<p>(b)	appropriate and proportionate adjustments must be made in respect of all matters relevant to determining the amount claimable in respect of the CJRS claim period of the CJRS claim so as to ensure the claim is not abusive or otherwise contrary to the purpose of CJRS.</p>
