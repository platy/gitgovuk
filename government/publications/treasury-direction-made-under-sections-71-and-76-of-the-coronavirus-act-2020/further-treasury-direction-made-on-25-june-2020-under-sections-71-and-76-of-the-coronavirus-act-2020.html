<p>Signed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>

<p>Her Majesty’s Treasury</p>

<p>25 June 2020</p>

<h4>Schedule: Coronavirus job retention scheme</h4>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>1.1 This Schedule sets out modifications to the scheme known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (“CJRS”) established by the original CJRS directions.</p>

<p>1.2 In particular:</p>

<p>(a) part 1 of this Schedule makes provision in respect of CJRS as set out in the original CJRS directions, and</p>

<p>(b) part 2 of this Schedule makes provision in respect of CJRS for the period beginning on 1 July 2020 and ending on 31 October 2020.</p>

<p>1.3 The provision made by part 2 of this Schedule in relation to CJRS is without prejudice to any matter in connection with the provision made: by the original CJRS directions or part 1 of this Schedule.</p>

<p>1.4 Except as necessary to give effect to CJRS as set out in part 2 of this Schedule, the provision made by the original CJRS directions and part 1 of this Schedule is without prejudice to any matter in connection with the provision made by part 2 of this Schedule.</p>

<h4>Purpose of CJRS</h4>

<p>2.1 The purpose of CJRS is to provide for payments to be made to employers on a claim made in respect of them incurring costs of employment in respect of employees who are within the scope of CJRS arising from the health, social and economic emergency in the United Kingdom resulting from coronavirus and coronavirus disease.</p>

<p>2.2 Integral to the purpose of CJRS is that the amounts paid to an employer pursuant to a CJRS claim are used by the employer to continue the employment of employees in respect of whom the CJRS claim is made whose employment activities have been adversely affected by the coronavirus and coronavirus disease or the measures taken to prevent or limit its further transmission.</p>

<p>2.3 CJRS claims must be made in such form and manner and contain such information as HMRC may require at any time (whether before or after payment of the claim) to establish entitlement to payment under CJRS.</p>

<p>2.4 Before making payment of a CJRS claim, HMRC must, by publicly available guidance, other publication generally available to the public, or such other means considered appropriate by HMRC, inform a person making a CJRS claim that, by making the claim, the person making the claim accepts that:</p>

<p>(a) a payment made pursuant to such claim is made only for the purpose of CJRS (and, in particular, as provided for by paragraph 2.2), and</p>

<p>(b) the payment must be returned to HMRC immediately upon the person making the CJRS claim becoming unwilling or unable to use the payment for the purpose of CJRS.</p>

<p>2.5 No CJRS claim may be made in respect of an employee if it is abusive or is otherwise contrary to the exceptional purpose of CJRS.</p>

<p>15.2 An employee is a claimed-for employee if a CJRS claim is made in respect of the employee for all or part of a CJRS claim period.</p>

<p>15.3 An employee is a relevant claimed-for employee if a relevant CJRS claim has been made in respect of the employee for all or part of the period covered by that claim.</p>

<p>15.4 A CJRS claim is a relevant CJRS claim if it is made in accordance with the original CJRS directions.</p>

<p>15.5 The number of allowable claimed-for employees for a CJRS claim is the high-watermark number.</p>

<p>15.6 The high-watermark number is the number of relevant claimed-for employees for a relevant CJRS claim that is a high-watermark claim.</p>

<p>15.7 A relevant CJRS claim is a high-watermark claim if the number of relevant claimed -for employees for that claim is not lower than the number of relevant claimed-for employees for any other relevant CJRS claim.</p>

<p>15.8 For the purposes of determining the number of allowable claimed -for employees in respect of a CJRS claim for a CJRS claim period that includes a day falling on or after a return to work day of a returning employee, paragraphs 15.1to 15.7 apply as if the returning employee falls as a relevant claimed-for employee in relation to all relevant CJRS claims made by the employer.</p>

<p>15.9 An employee is a returning employee if:</p>

<p>(a) the employee is an armed forces reservist employee, or</p>

<p>(b) the employee is a family leave returner.</p>

<p>15.10 A day is a return to work day of a returning employee if:</p>

<p>(a) that day falls after 10 June 2020, and</p>

<p>(b) that day is the first day the returning employee undertakes work for the employer after the relevant event in respect of that employee.</p>

<p>15.11 The relevant event in respect of a family leave returner is the ending of a period of family leave (see paragraph 11.l (b)).</p>

<p>15.12	The relevant event in respect of an armed forces reservist employee is the ending of the employee’s called out service after 10 June 2020 (see paragraph 12.l (c)).</p>

<p>15.13	Paragraph 15.8 must not be construed as requiring a CJRS claim to be made in respect 
of a returning employee.</p>

<h4>Qualifying costs</h4>

<p>16.1 The costs of employment in respect of which an employer may make a CJRS cl aim are costs which:</p>

<p>(a) relate to an employee who is a flexibly-furloughed employee for the CJRS claim period,</p>

<p>(b) relate to the payment of earnings to the employee during that period, and</p>

<p>(c) meet the condition in paragraph 16.2 in relation to the employee’s furloughed hours occurring in the CJRS claim period.</p>

<p>16.2 The condition referred to in paragraph 16.l(c) is that the amount payable to the employee in relation to the employee’s furloughed hours occurring in the CJRS claim period is an amount equal to or more than an amount determined in accordance with:</p>

<p>(a) the formula set out in paragraph 16.3, or</p>

<p>(b) if the amount payable to the employee in relation to the employee’s furloughed hours occurring in the CJRS claim period is less than the amount determined in accordance with the formula set out paragraph 16.3, the formula set out in paragraph 16.4.</p>

<p>16.3 The formula referred to in paragraph 16.2(a) is A x (F/U)</p>

<p>16.4 The formula referred to in paragraph 16.2(b) is B x (F/U)</p>

<p>16.5 For the purposes of paragraphs 16.3 and 16.4:</p>

<p>(a) A is</p>

<p>(i) £2500 if the CJRS claim period covers the whole of the CJRS calendar month to which the CJRS claim relates, or</p>

<p>(ii) if the CJRS claim period is for a period that does not cover the whole of the CJRS calendar month to which the claim relates, the appropriate pro-rata</p>

<p>(b) B is the amount which is 80% of the employee’s reference salary attributable to the CJRS claim period of the CJRS claim</p>

<p>(c) F is the number of furloughed hours in the CJRS claim period</p>

<p>(d) U is the number of usual hours in the CJRS claim period.</p>

<p>16.6 Paragraph 16.7 applies where the period of time covered. by a CJRS claim period in respect of an employee is not the same as, or comparable to, the period of time covered by the salary period by reference to which the employee’s reference salary is determined in accordance with paragraph 19.2 or 20.1.</p>

<p>16.7 For the purposes of determining the amount B (see paragraph 16.5(b)), the employee’s reference salary must be adjusted proportionately to ensure that the reference salary fairly reflects the proportion attributable to the period covered by the CJRS claim period.</p>

<p>16.8 For the purposes of paragraph 16.6, the period of time covered by a CJRS claim period and the period of time covered by a salary period are comparable if:</p>

<p>(a) the CJRS claim period is for the w hole of a CJRS month, and</p>

<p>(b) the period of time covered by the salary period is no less than 28 days and no more than 31days.</p>

<p>16.9 The condition in paragraph 16.2 is not met if the amount payable in respect of the employee is not paid to the employee.</p>

<h4>Simplification of a CJRS claim allowable where an employee does no work in a CJRS claim period</h4>

<p>17.1 Where an employee does no work in a CJRS claim period, paragraph 16.2 may be applied as if the condition  in that paragraph required the amount payable to  the employee in respect of the CJRS claim period to be an amount equal to or more than an amount determined in accordance with:</p>

<p>(a) the amount A (see paragraph 16.S(a)), or</p>

<p>(b) the amount B (see paragraph 16.S(b)) if the amount payable in respect of the CJRS claim period is less than the amount A.</p>

<p>17.2 Where paragraph 16.2 is applied as described in paragraph 17.1, the provision made by Part 2 of this Schedule (in particular, paragraphs 16.5 to 16.8, 30 and 31.1 to 31.4) must be construed accordingly.</p>

<h4>Reference salary</h4>

<p>18 The reference salary of an employee must be determined in accordance with:</p>

<p>(a) paragraphs 19.1 to 19.8 and 21.1to 21.7 if the employee is a fixed rate employee, and</p>

<p>(b) paragraphs 20.1and 20.2 and 21.1 to 21.7 if the employee is not a fixed rate employee.</p>

<h4>Reference salary - fixed rate employees</h4>

<p>19.1 A person is a fixed rate employee if:</p>

<p>(a) the person is</p>

<p>(i) an employee, or</p>

<p>(ii) treated as an employee for the purposes of CJRS by virtue of paragraph 41.3(a) (member of a limited liability partnership),</p>

<p>(b) the person is entitled under their contract to be paid an annual salary,</p>

<p>(c) the person is entitled under their contract to be paid that salary in respect of a number of hours in a year whether those hours are specified in or ascertained in accordance with their contract (“the basic hours”),</p>

<p>(d) the person is not entitled under their contract to a payment in respect of the basic hours other than an annual salary,</p>

<p>(e) the person is entitled under their contract to be paid, where practicable and regardless of the number of hours actually worked in a particular week or month in equal weekly, multiple of weeks or monthly instalments, and</p>

<p>(f) the basic hours worked in a salary period do not normally vary according to business, economic or agricultural seasonal considerations.</p>

<p>19.2 The reference salary of a fixed rate employee is the amount payable to the employee in the latest salary period ending on or before 19 March 2020 (but disregarding anything which is not regular salary or wages as described in paragraph 21.1).</p>

<p>19.3 In paragraph 19.1, “contract’’ means a legally enforceable agreement as described in paragraph 21.2(b).</p>

<p>19.4 In respect of a fixed rate employee, where a period by reference to which the reference salary is determinable (“reference salary period”) includes a period of unpaid sabbatical or unpaid leave (“unpaid period”), the reference salary must be determined on the basis of what would have been paid to the employee during the unpaid period if the sabbatical or leave had been granted on the same terms as the employee’s paid leave during the reference salary period taking account of the matters described in paragraphs 19.5 to 19.8 as are appropriate.</p>

<p>19.5 In paragraph 19.4</p>

<p>(a) the reference to the terms of an employee’s paid leave during a reference salary period is a reference to the terms applying in respect of the annual leave to which the employee would have been entitled to be paid pursuant to regulation 16 of the Working Time Regulations 1998 or regulation 20 of the Working Time (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2016 (“paid annual leave”) if the period of unpaid leave had been a period of paid annual leave:</p>

<p>(b) the references to unpaid sabbatical and unpaid leave also include references to</p>

<p>(i) statutory payment leave, and</p>

<p>(ii) reduced rate paid leave.</p>

<p>19.6 In paragraph 19.S(b)(i), “statutory payment leave” means a period of leave:</p>

<p>(a) in respect of which statutory sick pay or any of the statutory payments specified in paragraph 32.2 is in payment or due to be paid, or</p>

<p>(b) which is a period of shared parental leave as provided for by regulations made pursuant to sections 75E and 75G of the Employment Rights Act 1996 or articles 107E and 107G of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland)Order 1996 (whether or not statutory shared parental pay described in paragraph 32.2(d) is in payment or due to be paid in respect of that period).</p>

<p>19.7 In paragraph 19.S(b)(ii), “reduced rate paid leave” means a period of leave granted immediately following the ending of a period of statutory payment leave on terms that are not the terms which would have applied to that period of leave if the leave had been granted on the same terms that would have applied if the leave had been a part of the employee’s statutory leave entitlement.</p>

<p>19.8 For the purposes of paragraph 19.6(a), it does not matter if, by virtue of a legally enforceable agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions, the person described in that paragraph has been paid an amount in excess of the amount otherwise payable by way of statutory sick pay or the statutory payments specified in paragraph 32.2 to which the statutory payment leave relates.</p>

<h4>Reference salary - employees other than fixed rate employees</h4>

<p>20.1 In relation to an employee who is not a fixed rate employee, the reference salary of an employee or a person treated as an employee for the purposes of CJRS by virtue of paragraph 41.3(a) (member of a limited liability partnership) is the greater of:</p>

<p>(a) the average monthly (or daily or other appropriate pro-rata) amount payable to the employee in the period comprising the tax year 2019-20 (or, if less, the period of employment) before the period of furlough began, and</p>

<p>(b) the amount earned by the employee in the corresponding calendar period in the previous year.</p>

<p>20.2 The period of time by reference to which an employee’s reference salary is determined in accordance with paragraph 20.1must be treated as the salary period by reference to which the employee’s reference salary is determined for the purposes of paragraphs 16.6 to 16.8.</p>

<h4>Reference salary - general provisions</h4>

<p>21.1 The following must not be included in the calculation of an employee’s reference salary for the purposes of paragraphs 19.2 and 20.1:</p>

<p>(a) benefits in kind</p>

<p>(b) anything provided or made available in lieu of a cash payment otherwise payable to the employee (including salary sacrifice schemes)</p>

<p>(c) anything which is not regular salary or wages.</p>

<p>21.2 In paragraph 21.l(c) “regular” in relation to salary or wages means so much of the amount of the salary or wages as:</p>

<p>(a) cannot vary according to a relevant matter except where the variation in the amount arises from a non-discretionary payment (see paragraph 21.4), and</p>

<p>(b) arises from a legally enforceable agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions.</p>

<p>21.3 For the purposes of paragraph 21.2(a), the following are relevant matters:</p>

<p>(a) the performance of or any part of any business of the employer or any business of a person connected with the employer;</p>

<p>(b) the contribution made by the employee to the performance of, or any part of any business;</p>

<p>(c) the performance by the employee of any duties of the employment;</p>

<p>(d) any similar considerations or otherwise payable at the discretion of the employer or any other person (such as a gratuity).</p>

<p>21.4 A variation in an amount of wages or salary arises from a non-discretionary payment only if:</p>

<p>(a) the payment</p>

<p>(i) is in respect of overtime, fees, commissions or a piece rate,</p>

<p>(ii) is made in recognition of the employee undertaking additional or exceptional responsibilities,</p>

<p>(iii) is made in recognition of the circumstances in which the employee undertakes the employee’s duties or time when they are undertaken, or</p>

<p>(iv) is made in recognition of other matters similar to those described in paragraph 21.4(a)(i) to</p>

<p>(iii), and</p>

<p>(b) a legally enforceable agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions prescribe the method of calculating the amount of wages or salary payable in respect of the payment (whether or not that method involves the exercise of discretion by the employer or a person connected with the employer).</p>

<p>21.5 In calculating an employee’s reference salary in accordance with paragraph 19.2 or 20.1 in the case of a person (“P”) treated as an employee for the purposes of CJRS by virtue of paragraph 41.3(a) (member of a limited liability partnership) then, in addition to the matters described in paragraphs 21.1to 21.3, no account is to be taken of an amount payable to P unless, by virtue of arrangements described in section 8638(5) of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, that amount:</p>

<p>(a) is fixed,</p>

<p>(b) is variable, but is varied without reference to the overall amount of the profits or losses of the limited liability partnership, or</p>

<p>(c) is not, in practice, affected by the overall amount of those profits or losses.</p>

<p>21.6 Where paragraph 21.7 applies, the sum of the original payment described in paragraph:</p>

<p>21.7(a) and the further amount described in paragraph 21.7(c) must be treated as having been paid at the time of the payment of the original payment for the purposes of paragraph 16.2.</p>

<p>21.7 This paragraph applies where:</p>

<p>(a) an amount by way of wages or salary is paid in respect of a period of employment (“the original payment”) to an employee</p>

<p>(b) the original payment is less than the amount required by paragraph 16.2 for the purpose of claiming CJRS</p>

<p>(c) the employer has paid (or intends to pay within a reasonable period after receiving the payment claimed under CJRS) the employee a further amount (“the further amount”) in respect of the period of employment to which the original payment relates, and</p>

<p>(d) the sum of the original payment and the further amount meets the requirements of paragraph 16.2.</p>

<h4>CJRS claim period - meaning of usual hours</h4>

<p>22.1 The usual hours of an employee (whether or not the employee is a fixed rate employee) for a CJRS claim period must be determined:</p>

<p>(a) on the fixed hours basis if paragraph 22.2 applies in relation to the employee;</p>

<p>(b) on the variable hours basis in any other case.</p>

<p>22.2 This paragraph applies in relation to an employee whose contract:</p>

<p>(a) requires the employee to work a specific number of hours over a period of time prescribed by the contract, and</p>

<p>(b) does not require the employee’s pay in respect of the period of time prescribed by the contract to vary according to the number of hours actually worked in that period.</p>

<p>22.3 References to an employee’s contract in paragraphs 22.2, 23.4, 23.5, 26.4, 26.5 and 27.8 are to a legally enforceable agreement as described in paragraph 21.2(b).</p>

<h4>CJRS claim period - usual hours - fixed hours basis</h4>

<p>23.1 The formula in paragraph 23.2 applies to determine the usual hours for a CJRS claim period in respect of an employee whose usual hours must be determined on the fixed hours basis.</p>

<p>23.2 The formula referred to in paragraph 23.1 is CP x (H/P)</p>

<p>23.3 For the purposes of paragraph 23.2:</p>

<p>(a)	CP is the number of calendar days covered by the CJRS claim period;</p>

<p>(b)	H is the number of working hours of the relevant repeating shift pattern;</p>

<p>(c)	P is the number of calendar days covered by that repeating shift pattern.</p>

<p>23.4 A repeating shift pattern is the regular working pattern a contract requires an employee to undertake in a periodic cycle in the course of the employee’s employment that specifies:</p>

<p>(a) the number of hours the employee must work over the course of the cycle before the next cycle begins, and</p>

<p>(b) the number of calendar days in the cycle over which the hours must be worked (including days on which the employee is not required to work) before the next cycle begins.</p>

<p>23.5 The relevant repeating shift pattern is that having effect in relation to the employee under the terms of a contract having effect at the end of the latest salary period ending on or before 19 March 2020.</p>

<p>23.6 In determining the usual hours of an employee in relation to a period of time, an hour that would otherwise be counted as a usual hour determined on the fixed hours basis in respect of an employee must not be excluded from the total number of the employee’s usual hours solely because that hour is:</p>

<p>(a) statutory payment leave as described in paragraph 19.6, or</p>

<p>(b) reduced rate paid leave as described in paragraph 19.7.</p>

<p>23.7 Paragraph 23.8 applies where:</p>

<p>(a) the first and last days of a CJRS claim period do not correspond exactly with the first and last calendar days of a single salary period</p>

<p>(b) the making of a CJRS claim would be facilitated by the provision made by paragraph 23.8, and</p>

<p>(c) the amount of a CJRS claim determined in accordance with the facilitation permitted by paragraph 23.8 is not abusive or otherwise contrary to the purpose of CJRS.</p>

<p>23.8 Where this paragraph applies, the formula in paragraph 23.2 may be applied in respect of each salary period falling wholly or partly within the CJRS claim period as if CP referred to the number of calendar days covered by the salary period (or part thereof) falling within the CJRS claim period.</p>

<p>23.9 Where the formula in Paragraph 23.2 is used to determine the usual hours for a salary period falling wholly or partly within a CJRS claim period (“relevant part CJRS claim period”), the amounts determined in accordance with the formulae in paragraphs 16.3 and 16.4 in respect of all relevant part CJRS claim periods must be totalled for the purposes of determining the amount claimable for the CJRS claim period of the CJRS claim.</p>

<p>23.10 In respect of a relevant part CJRS claim period:</p>

<p>(a) paragraph 28.1applies as if it provided that an amount of time that is less than an hour must be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number, and</p>

<p>(b) appropriate and proportionate adjustments must be made in respect of all matters relevant to determining the amount claimable in respect of the CJRS claim period of the CJRS claim so as to ensure the claim is not abusive or otherwise contrary to the purpose of CJRS.</p>

<h4>CJRS claim period - usual hours - variable hours basis</h4>

<p>24 The usual hours for a CJRS claim period in respect of an employee whose usual hours must be determined on the variable hours basis must be determined using the higher of:</p>

<p>(a) the averaging method (see, in particular, paragraphs 26.1 to 26.10), or</p>

<p>(b) the calendar look-back method (see, in particular, paragraphs 27.1to 27.12).</p>

<h4>CJRS claim period - usual hours - variable hours basis (relevant output work employee)</h4>

<p>25.1 For the purposes of paragraphs 26.4(a), 27.4(a) and 27.8(a), an employee is a relevant output work employee if paragraph 25.2 applies in relation to an employee.</p>

<p>25.2 This paragraph applies in relation to an employee:</p>

<p>(a) whose contract provides for the employee to be paid by a measure of output by the worker (including a number of pieces made or processed or a number of tasks performed) which does not fall as time work within regulation 30 of the NMWR 2015, and</p>

<p>(b) whose employer does not know how many hours the employee works in any given period of time.</p>

<h4>CJRS claim period - usual hours - variable hours basis (averaging method)</h4>

<p>26.1 The formula in paragraph 26.2 applies to determine usual hours using the averaging method.</p>

<p>26.2 The formula referred to in paragraph 26.1 is CP x (H/D)</p>

<p>26.3 For the purposes of paragraph 26.2:</p>

<p>(a) CP is the number of calendar days covered by the CJRS claim period</p>

<p>(b) H is the number of relevant worked hours</p>

<p>(c) D is the number of relevant employed days.</p>

<p>26.4 For the purposes of paragraph 26.3(b) an hour is a relevant worked hour if:</p>

<p>(a) the hour</p>

<p>(i) falls, (in respect of a relevant output work employee), as an hour of output work (determined in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 5 of the NMWR 2015) undertaken by the employee for the employer making the CJRS claim, or</p>

<p>(ii) in any other case, is an hour when the employee undertook paid work as an employee for the employer making the CJRS claim for that hour pursuant to a contract between the employer and the employee</p>

<p>(b) the hour occurred in the tax year 2019/20, and</p>

<p>(c) the hour occurred before a time when the employee ceased all work in relation to their employment relevant for the making of a CJRS claim by the employer in respect of the employee in accordance with the original CJRS directions.</p>

<p>26.5 For the purposes of paragraph 26.3(c),a day is a relevant employed day if:</p>

<p>(a) the day is a day on which a contract between the employer making the CJRS claim and the employee has effect</p>

<p>(b) the day occurred in the tax year 2019/20</p>

<p>(c) the day occurred before a time when the employee ceased all work in relation to their employment as described in paragraph 26.4(c)</p>

<p>(d) the day does not fall in a period of statutory payment leave described in paragraph 19.6, and</p>

<p>(e) the day does not fall in a period of reduced rate paid leave described in paragraph 19.7.</p>

<p>26.6 For the purposes of paragraph 26.S(a), it does not matter if the employee undertook no work for the employer on that day.</p>

<p>26.7 Paragraph 26.8 applies where:</p>

<p>(a) the first and last days of a CJRS claim period do not correspond exactly with the first and last calendar days of a single salary period</p>

<p>(b) the making of a CJRS claim would be facilitated by the provision made by paragraph 26.8, and</p>

<p>(c) the amount of a CJRS claim determined in accordance with the facilitation permitted by paragraph 26.8 is not abusive or otherwise contrary to the purpose of CJRS.</p>

<p>26.8 Where this paragraph applies, the formula in paragraph 26.2 may be applied in respect of each salary period falling wholly or partly within the CJRS claim period as if CP referred to the number of calendar days covered by the salary period (or part thereof) falling within the CJRS claim period.</p>

<p>26.9 Where the formula in paragraph 26.2 is used to determine the usual hours for a salary period falling wholly or partly within a CJRS claim period (“relevant part CJRS claim period”), the amounts determined in accordance with the formulae in paragraphs 16.3 and 16.4 in respect of all relevant part CJRS claim periods must be totalled for the purposes of determining the amount claimable for the CJRS claim period of the CJRS claim.</p>

<p>26.10 In respect of a relevant part CJRS claim period:</p>

<p>(a) paragraph 28.1 applies as if it provided that an amount of time that is less than an hour must be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number, and</p>

<p>(b) appropriate and proportionate adjustments must be made in respect of all matters relevant to determining the amount claimable in respect of the CJRS claim period of the CJRS claim so as to ensure the claim is not abusive or otherwise contrary to the purpose of CJRS.</p>

<h4>CJRS claim period- usual hours - variable hours basis (calendar look-back method)</h4>

<p>27.1 Where paragraph 27.3 applies, paragraph 27.4 applies to determine usual hours using the calendar look-back method.</p>

<p>27.2 Where paragraph 27.3 does not apply, paragraph 27.5 applies to determine usual hours using the calendar look-back method.</p>

<p>27.4 Where this paragraph applies, the usual hours are:</p>

<p>(a) in relation to a relevant output work employee, the number of hours of output work (determined in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 5 of the NMWR 2015) occurring in the salary period mentioned in paragraph 27.3</p>

<p>(b) in any other case, the number of hours of relevant worked hours occurring in the salary period mentioned in paragraph 27.3.</p>

<p>27.5 Where this paragraph applies, the usual hours in respect of the CJRS claim period must be determined in accordance with the following steps:</p>

<p>(a) Step 1: the calendar days occurring in 2019 corresponding to the calendar days covered by the CJRS claim period (“the 2019 calendar days”) must be identified</p>

<p>(b) Step 2: the salary periods occurring in 2019 that include one or more of the 2019 calendar days (“the 2019 salary periods”) must be identified</p>

<p>(c) Step 3: the formula in paragraph 27.6 must be applied separately to each of the 2019 salary periods identified in step 2 to establish the number of usual hours referable to each of those salary periods</p>

<p>(d) Step 4: the usual hours referable to each of the 2019 salary periods must be totalled to determine the number of usual hours for the purposes of the CJRS claim.</p>

<p>27.6 The formula referred to in paragraph 27.5(c) is H x (CD/SP)</p>

<p>27.7 For the purposes of paragraph 27.6:</p>

<p>27.8 For the purposes of paragraph 27.7(a):</p>

<p>(a) in relation to a relevant output work employee, an hour is a re levant worked hour if it is an hour of output work (determined in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 5 of the NMWR 2015)</p>

<p>(b) in any other case, an hour is a relevant worked hour if the employee undertook paid work as an employee for the employer making the CJRS cl aim for that hour pursuant to a contract between the employer and the employee.</p>

<p>27.9 Paragraph 27.10 applies where:</p>

<p>(a) paragraph 27.S applies to determine the usual hours in respect of the CJRS claim period,</p>

<p>(b) the making of a CJRS claim would be facilitated by the provision made by paragraph 27.10, and
(c) the amount of a CJRS claim determined in accordance with the facilitation permitted by paragraph 27.10 is not abusive or otherwise contrary to the purpose of CJRS.</p>

<p>27.10 Where this paragraph applies, paragraph 27.5 may be applied in respect of each salary period falling wholly or partly within the CJRS claim period as if:</p>

<p>(a) that paragraph made provision for determining the usual hours in respect of a salary period falling wholly or partly within a CJRS claim period</p>

<p>(b) the reference in paragraph 27.S(a) to the calendar days covered by the CJRS claim period were a reference to the calendar days covered by the salary period, and</p>
