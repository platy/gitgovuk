<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance advises an employer how to conduct a right to work check and sets out the specific actions you can take to prevent liability for a civil penalty. This is called ‘establishing a statutory excuse against liability for a penalty’.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to right to work checks conducted on or after 6 April 2022 to establish or retain a statutory excuse from having to pay a civil penalty for employing a person who is not permitted to do the work in question.</p>

<h2>Previous versions of this guidance</h2>

<p>Where the employment commenced on or after 29 February 2008, and a statutory excuse was established for the duration of that person’s employment before 16 May 2014, the document checks set out in the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-illegal-working-guidance-for-employers-october-2013">Full guide for employers on preventing illegal working i</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-illegal-working-guidance-for-employers-october-2013">n</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-illegal-working-guidance-for-employers-october-2013">the U</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-illegal-working-guidance-for-employers-october-2013">K</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-illegal-working-guidance-for-employers-october-2013">’</a> published in October 2013 continue to apply.</p>

<p>Where the employment commenced on or after 16 May 2014, and a statutory excuse was established for the duration of that person’s employment before 28 January 2019, the document checks set out in the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20180716120916mp_/https:/www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/720858/29_06_18_Employer_s_guide_to_right_to_work_checks.pdf" rel="external">Employer’s guide to right to work check</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-employers-guide">s</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-employers-guide">’</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-employers-guide">,</a> last published on 29 June 2018, continue to apply.</p>

<p>For example, since 16 May 2014, for those people in the UK who require permission to work and reside, an immigration endorsement must be in a current passport to demonstrate a right to work. However, if you conducted a check between 29 February 2008 and 15 May 2014 and accepted an immigration endorsement in a passport that had expired or has since expired, your statutory excuse continues because this was an acceptable document at the time you conducted the check. You are only required to conduct follow up checks on an employee if their right to work is time-limited.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>All employers in the UK have a responsibility to prevent illegal working. You do this by conducting simple right to work checks before you employ someone, to make sure the individual is not disqualified from carrying out the work in question by reason of their immigration status.</p>

<p>This guidance provides information on how and when to conduct a right to work check. You should also refer to the following documents:</p>

<p>· <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">Code of practice on preventing illegal working: Civil penalty scheme for employers</a></p>

<p>· <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-code-of-practice-on-avoiding-discrimination">Code of practice for employers: avoiding unlawful discrimination while preventing</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-code-of-practice-on-avoiding-discrimination">illegal working</a></p>

<p>If you conduct the checks as set out in this guide and the code of practice, you will have a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty in the event you are found to have employed someone, who is disqualified from carrying out the work in question, by reason of their immigration status. This means that if we find that you have employed someone who does not have the right to do the work in question, but you have correctly conducted right to work checks as required, you will not receive a civil penalty for that illegal worker.</p>

<p>In addition to the codes of practice and this guidance, there are a range of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/right-to-work-checks-employer-guidance">tools availabl</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/right-to-work-checks-employer-guidance">e</a>  on GOV.UK  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/right-to-work-checks-employer-guidance">t</a>o support you in conducting right to work checks.</p>

<h3>Why do we need to prevent illegal working?</h3>

<p>The ability to work illegally is a key driver of illegal migration. It leaves people vulnerable to exploitation and results in unscrupulous employers undercutting compliant businesses. It can also negatively impact on the wages of lawful workers and is linked to other labour market abuse such as tax evasion, breach of the national minimum wage and exploitative working conditions, including modern slavery in the most serious cases.</p>

<h3>Legislation</h3>

<p>The law on preventing illegal working is set out in sections 15 to 25 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/13/contents" rel="external">Immigration,</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/13/contents" rel="external">Asylum and Nationality Act 200</a><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/13/contents" rel="external">6</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/13/contents" rel="external">(</a>the 2006 Act), <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/contents" rel="external">section 24B of the Immigration Act 1971</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/19/contents/enacted" rel="external">Schedule 6 of the Immigration Act 2016</a>.</p>

<p>The 2006 Act replaced section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 (the 1996 Act) in respect of employment commencing on or after 29 February 2008. The civil penalty provisions in the 2006 Act do not apply to continuous employment with the same employer that commenced before 29 February 2008, for which a statutory excuse is, therefore, not required. Under section 15 of the 2006 Act, an employer may be liable for a civil penalty if they employ someone who does not have the right to undertake the work in question if that person commenced employment on or after 29 February 2008.</p>

<h3>Who is this guidance relevant for?</h3>

<p>Employers, including their Human Resource staff and those staff within the same business with delegated responsibility for the recruitment and employment of individuals, should read this guidance to understand their responsibility to correctly carry out right to work checks, and, therefore, ensure compliance with the law.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to employers who employ staff under a contract of employment, service or apprenticeship, whether express or implied and whether oral or in writing.</p>

<p>As the employer, you (and not the members of your staff carrying out the checks, whether they are your employees or workers engaged by your business) are liable for the civil penalty. Where you have used an Identification Document Validation Technology (IDVT) service provider to carry out digital identity checks on British and Irish citizens who hold a valid passport (including Irish passport cards), you will retain obligations set out in this guidance to ensure compliance under the Scheme. If you choose to use an Identity Service Provider (IDSP), you (rather than the IDSP) are still liable for the civil penalty should the employee later be found to be working without the requisite permission and it is reasonably apparent the check has not been completed correctly. Other than where you use an IDSP, you cannot establish a statutory excuse if the check is performed by a third party, such as a recruitment agency or your professional adviser.</p>

<p>Even if you are not the direct employer of the workers involved in your business, there are compelling reasons why you should seek to know that your workers have a right to work. If illegal workers are removed from your business, it may disrupt your operations and result in reputational damage. There could be adverse impacts on your health and safety and safeguarding obligations, as well as the potential invalidation of your insurance if the identity, qualifications, and skill levels of your workers are not as claimed. Accordingly, you may wish to check that your contractors conduct the correct right to work checks on people they employ.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> How to establish a statutory excuse for right to work checks</h2>

<p>You should conduct a right to work check before you employ a person to ensure they are legally allowed to do the work in question for you. If an individual’s right to work is time limited, you should conduct a follow-up check shortly before it is due to come to an end.</p>

<p>A statutory excuse is an employer’s defence against a civil penalty. In order to establish a statutory excuse against a civil penalty in the event that an employee is found to be working illegally, employers must do one of the following before the employee commences employment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>a manual right to work check</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a right to work check using IDVT via the services of an IDSP</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a Home Office online right to work check</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Conducting any of these checks as set out in this guidance and in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">code of practic</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">e</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">w</a>ill provide you with a statutory excuse.</p>

<p>You can also use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">Employer Checking Service</a>  where an individual has an outstanding application, administrative review or appeal, or if their immigration status requires verification by the Home Office, for example in the case of Crown Dependencies.</p>

<h3>Conducting a manual document-based right to work check</h3>

<p>There are three steps to conducting a manual document-based right to work check. You need to complete all three steps before employment commences to ensure you have conducted a check in the prescribed manner, in order to establish a statutory excuse.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Obtain</h4>

<p>You must obtain original documents from either List A or B of the acceptable documents at <a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexA">Annex A</a>.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Check</h4>

<p>You must check that the documents are genuine and that the person presenting them is the prospective or existing employee, the rightful holder and allowed to do the type of work you are offering. You must check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>photographs and dates of birth are consistent across documents and with the person’s appearance in order to detect impersonation;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>expiry dates for permission to be in the UK have not passed;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any work restrictions to determine if they are allowed to do the type of work on offer (for students who have limited permission to work during term-times, you must also obtain, copy and retain details of their academic term and vacation times covering the duration of their period of study in the UK for which they will be employed);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the documents are genuine, have not been tampered with and belong to the holder; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the reasons for any difference in names across documents can be explained by providing evidence (for example, original marriage certificate, divorce decree absolute, deed poll). These supporting documents must also be photocopied and a copy retained.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 3: Copy</h4>

<p>You must make a clear copy of each document in a format which cannot manually be altered and retain the copy securely: electronically or in hardcopy. You must also retain a secure record of the date on which you made the check. Simply writing a date on the copy document does not, in itself, confirm that this is the actual date when the check was undertaken. If you write a date on the copy document, you must also record that this is the date on which you conducted the check.</p>

<p>You must copy and retain copies of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Passports: any page with the document expiry date, the holder’s nationality, date of birth, signature, immigration permission, expiry date, biometric details, photograph and any page containing information indicating the holder has an entitlement to enter or remain in the UK (visa or entry stamp) and undertake the work in question (the front cover no longer has to be copied).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All other documents: the document in full, including both sides of an Immigration Status Document and an Application Registration Card.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All copies of documents taken should be kept securely for the duration of the worker’s employment and for two years afterwards. The copy must then be securely destroyed.</p>

<p>We recommend you use our:</p>

<p>· employers’ <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checklist">‘Right to Work Checklist’</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checklist">to e</a>nsure you have correctly carried out all the steps you need to; or</p>

<p>· online interactive tool ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/legal-right-work-uk">Check if someone can work in the U</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/legal-right-work-uk">K</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/legal-right-work-uk">’</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/legal-right-work-uk">,</a> which will take you through the process by asking you a series of questions.</p>

<p>Both will help you to confirm that you have undertaken each step correctly to establish your statutory excuse.</p>

<h3>Acceptable documents</h3>

<p>The documents you may accept from a person to demonstrate their right to work are set out in two lists – <a class="govuk-link" href="#ListA">List A</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#ListB">List B</a>. These are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexA">Annex A</a> to this guidance.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#ListA">List A</a> contains the range of documents you may accept for a person who has a continuous right to work in the UK (including British and Irish citizens). If you conduct the right to work checks correctly before employment begins, you will establish a continuous statutory excuse for the duration of that person’s employment with you. You do not have to conduct any further checks on this individual.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#ListB">List B</a> contains a range of documents you may accept for a person who has a temporary right to work in the UK. If you conduct the right to work checks correctly, you will establish a time-limited statutory excuse. You will be required to conduct a follow-up check in order to retain your statutory excuse.</p>

<h3>Checking the validity of documents</h3>

<p>When you are checking the validity of the documents, you should ensure that you do this in the presence of the holder. This can be a physical presence in person or via a live video link. In both cases you must be in physical possession of the original documents. For example, an individual may choose to send their documents to you by post to enable you to conduct the check with them via live video link. You may not rely on the inspection of the document via a live video link or by checking a faxed or scanned copy of the document.</p>

<p>The responsibility for checking the document is yours. Whilst it may be delegated to your members of staff (this includes agency workers engaged by you and working under your control), you will remain liable for the penalty in the event the individual is found to be working illegally and the prescribed check has not been correctly carried out. You may not delegate this responsibility to a third party where you are carrying out a manual check of original documents.</p>

<p>Whilst you may use a third party to provide support in terms of technical knowledge or specialised equipment to prevent the employment of illegal workers, the responsibility for performing the check (in order to obtain a statutory excuse from a civil penalty) will remain with you as the employer.</p>

<p>If you are given a false document, you will only be liable for a civil penalty if it is reasonably apparent that it is false. This means that a person who is untrained in the identification of false documents, examining it carefully, but without the use of technological aids could reasonably be expected to realise that the document in question is not genuine.</p>

<p>You will not obtain a statutory excuse if:</p>

<p>· it is reasonably apparent that the person presenting the document is not the person referred to in that document, even if the document itself is genuine.</p>

<p>· you know that the individual is not permitted to undertake the work in question; or</p>

<p>· you know that the documents are false or do not rightfully belong to the holder.</p>

<p>You may wish to read the online guidance about recognising fraudulent identity documents. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recognising-fraudulent-identity-documents">Guidance on examining identity documents</a>  can be found on GOV.UK<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recognising-fraudulent-identity-documents">.</a>  You can also compare identity and travel documents against the images published on:</p>

<p>If someone gives you a false document or a genuine document that does not belong to them, you should use this link to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-immigration-crime">report the individual to u</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-immigration-crime">s</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-immigration-crime">,</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-immigration-crime">o</a>r call our Employer Enquiry helpline on 0300 790 6268 (Monday to Thursday, 9am to 4:45pm; Friday 9am to 4:30pm).</p>

<h3>Retaining evidence</h3>

<p>You must keep a record of every document you have checked. This can be a hardcopy or a scanned copy in a format which cannot be manually altered, such as a jpeg or pdf document. You should keep the copies securely for the duration of the person’s employment and for a further two years after they stop working for you. You should also be able to produce these document copies quickly in the event that you are requested to show them to demonstrate that you have performed a right to work check and retain a statutory excuse.</p>

<p>You must also make a note of the date on which you conducted the check. This can be by either making a dated declaration on the copy or by holding a separate record, securely, which can be shown to us upon request. This date may be written on the document copy as follows: ‘the date on which this right to work check was made: [insert date]’ or a manual or digital record may be made at the time you conduct and copy the documents which includes this information. You must be able to show this evidence if requested to do so in order to demonstrate that you have established a statutory excuse. You must repeat this process in respect of any follow up check.</p>

<p>You may face a civil penalty if you do not record the date on which the check was performed. Simply writing a date on the copy document does not, in itself, confirm that this is the actual date when the check was undertaken. If you write a date on the copy document, you must also record that this is the date on which you conducted the check.</p>

<h3>Using an Identity Service Provider (IDSP)</h3>

<p>From 6 April 2022, employers can use Identity Document Validation Technology (IDVT) via the services of an IDSP to complete the digital identity verification element of right to work checks for British and Irish citizens who hold a valid passport (including Irish passport cards).</p>

<p>Digital identity verification conducted by IDSPs is the process of obtaining evidence of the prospective employee’s identity, checking that it is valid and belongs to the person who is claiming it.</p>

<p>If you use the services of an IDSP for digital identity verification, holders of valid British or Irish passports (or Irish passport cards) can demonstrate their right to work using this method. This will provide you with a continuous statutory excuse. It is your responsibility to obtain the IDVT check from the IDSP. You will only have a statutory excuse if you reasonably believe that the IDSP has carried out their checks in accordance with this guidance.</p>

<p>You must not treat less favourably those who do not hold a valid passport, or do not wish to prove their identity using an IDSP. You must provide individuals with other ways to prove their right to work and should carry out a manual document-based right to work check in these circumstances.</p>

<p>For a detailed guide on how to complete a right to work check, using an IDSP, please refer to Annex D of this guidance.</p>

<h4>Basic steps to conducting a RTW check using an IDSP:</h4>

<p>· IDSPs can carry out digital identity verification to a range of standards or levels of confidence. The Home Office recommends that employers only accept checks via an IDSP that satisfy a minimum of a Medium Level of Confidence. A list of certified providers is available for you to choose from on GOV.UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks">Digital identity certification for right to work, right to rent and criminal record checks</a>. It is not mandatory for you to use a certified provider; you may use a provider not featured within this list if you are satisfied that they are able to provide the required checks.</p>

<p>· Satisfy yourself that the photograph and biographic details (for example, date of birth) on the output from the IDVT check are consistent with the individual presenting themselves for work (i.e. the information provided by the check relates to the individual and they are not an imposter).</p>

<p>· You must retain a clear copy of the IDVT identity check output for the duration of employment and for two years after the employment has come to an end.</p>

<p>Should you be found to be employing individuals without their identity and eligibility being verified correctly in the prescribed manner, you will not have a statutory excuse in the event the individual is found to be working illegally by reason of their immigration status. The employer remains liable for any civil penalty if there is no statutory excuse.</p>

<h3>Conducting a Home Office online right to work check</h3>

<p>A Home Office online right to work check will provide you with a statutory excuse against a civil penalty in the event of illegal working involving the subject of the check. You can do an online check by using the online service, entitled ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">View a job applicant’s right to work detail</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">s</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">’</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>It will not be possible to conduct a Home Office online right to work check in all circumstances, as not all individuals will have an immigration status that can be checked online. The online right to work checking service sets out what information you will need to complete an online check. In circumstances in which an online check is not possible, you should conduct the manual check.</p>

<p>Currently, the Home Office online service supports checks for a range of individuals, depending on the type of immigration documentation they are issued with. The use of digital proof of immigration status forms part of our move towards a UK immigration system that is digital by default. This will be simpler, safer and more convenient.</p>

<p>Some individuals have been issued with an eVisa and can only use the online service to prove their right to work.</p>

<p>Biometric Residence Card (BRC), Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) and Frontier Worker Permit (FWP) holders are also only able to evidence their right to work using the Home Office online service. This means you cannot accept or check a physical BRC, BRP or FWP as proof of right to work.</p>

<h4>How does the service work?</h4>

<p>Individuals using the service must select one of the three reasons for sharing their immigration status. For prospective or existing employees, they must select choose to prove their right to work in the UK.</p>

<p>After selecting the correct option, in this case ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-work">prove your right to work to an employer</a>’, the individual can then generate a 9-character long share code that can be passed on to an employer which, when entered alongside the individual’s date of birth, enables you to access the information.</p>

<p>The share code will be valid for 90 days from the point it has been issued and can be used as many times as needed within that time.</p>

<p>Share codes can only be used for the purpose they were originally selected for. Since 10 January 2022, all share codes begin with a letter denoting the purpose the share code can be used for. Where a share code begins with the letter ‘W’, this will indicate that the share code has been generated by a prospective or existing employee to evidence their right to work.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Employers will not be able to accept or use share codes which begin with the letter ‘R’ or ‘S’ as these are designed for other services.</p>
</div>

<p>If a share code has expired, or the individual has used a code generated by another service, you must ask them to resend you a new right to work share code.</p>

<p>Where an individual provides you with a share code via the Home Office online service, you must carry out the check by accessing the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">View a job applicant’s right to work details</a>’ page on GOV.UK in order to obtain a statutory excuse against a civil penalty.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>It is not sufficient to view the details provided by the prospective or existing employee on the migrant part of the service.</p>
</div>

<p>The online service allows checks to be carried out by video call. You do not need to see physical documents as the right to work information is provided in real time directly from Home Office systems.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Use the Home Office online service</h4>

<p>The individual may provide the share code to you directly, or they may choose to send this to you via the service. If they choose to send it to you via the service, you will receive an email from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:right.to.work.service@notifications.service.gov.uk">right.to.work.service@notifications.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>To check the person’s right to work details, you will need to:</p>

<p>• access the service ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">View a job applicant’s right to work details</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">’</a> via GOV.UK</p>

<p>• enter the ‘share code’ provided to you by the individual, and</p>

<p>• enter their date of birth</p>

<p>It is not sufficient to simply view the details provided to the individual on the migrant part of the service and doing so will not provide you with a statutory excuse.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Screenshot of an email providing the share code. The email has the following title: &quot;You can now view Felicia Thais' right to work details&quot;. Underneath there is a bullet point which reads &quot;share code W73 GZX YF6&quot;." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148327/Felicia_Thais_resized.png"></div></figure>

<p>The above image is an example of the message an employer receives when an individual has sent their share code to the employer via the online service.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Check</h3>

<p>You must check that the photograph on the online right to work check is of the individual presenting themselves for work (i.e. the information provided by the check relates to the individual and they are not an imposter).</p>

<p>You must only employ the person, or continue to employ an existing employee, if you are conducting a follow-up check, if the online check confirms they have the right to work and are not subject to a condition preventing them from doing the work in question.</p>

<p>If the online right to work check does not confirm that the individual has the right to work in the UK and do the work in question, you will not have established a statutory excuse from this check if you proceed to employ them. If you know or have reasonable cause to believe that they do not have the right to work, and employ them anyway, you risk being found guilty of a criminal offence.</p>

<p>If you employ someone on the basis of the online check, but it is reasonably apparent from the photograph that the individual working is not the individual to whom the information provided in the check relates, you may face a civil penalty in the event of illegal working.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Screenshot from the online service showing the individual has a continuous right to work." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148328/Erika_Musterman_resized.png"></div></figure>

<p>The above image is from the online service and shows the individual has a continuous right to work.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Screenshot from the online service showing the individual has a time-limited right to work and confirms the date that their permission to enter or stay expires. " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148329/Image_3_resized.png"></div></figure>

<p>The above image is from the online service and shows the individual has a time-limited right to work and confirms the date that their permission to enter or stay expires.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Screenshot from the online service showing the individual has a restricted, time-limited right to work. It confirms the hours they can work and the date that their permission to enter or stay expires. " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148330/Image_4_resized.png"></div></figure>

<p>The above image is from the online service and shows the individual has a restricted, time-limited right to work. It confirms the hours they can work and the date that their permission to enter or stay expires.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Retain evidence of the online check</h3>

<p>You must retain evidence of the online right to work check. For online checks, this should be the ‘profile’ page confirming the individual’s right to work. This is the page that includes the individual’s photo and date on which the check was conducted. You will have the option of printing the profile or saving it as a PDF or HTML file.</p>

<p>You should store this securely, (electronically or in hardcopy) for the duration of employment and for two years afterwards. The file must then be securely destroyed.</p>

<p>Should illegal working be identified, you will need to be able to evidence that you have conducted a right to work check in order to have a statutory excuse and avoid a civil penalty. By retaining evidence of the check as above, you will be able to present this to an Immigration Officer in the event of illegal working.</p>

<h3>Biometric Residence Permits</h3>

<p>BRPs provide evidence of the holder’s immigration status in the UK. They contain the holder’s unique biometric identifiers (fingerprints, digital photograph) within the chip. They also display a photograph and biographical information on the face of the document and details of entitlements, such as access to work and/or public funds.</p>

<p>For migrants overseas, who are granted permission to enter the UK for more than six months, they are issued with a vignette (sticker) in their passport which will be valid for 30 days to enable them to travel to the UK. Following their arrival, they will have 10 days or before their vignette expires (whichever is later) to collect their BRP from the Post Office branch detailed in their decision letter.</p>

<p>BRP holders must still collect their card, but they prove their right to work using the Home Office online service rather than showing the physical document. Those permitted to work in the UK are strongly encouraged to collect their BRP before they start work in order to use the information to generate a right to work share code. If they need to start work for you prior to collecting their BRP, they will be able to evidence their right to work by producing the short validity vignette in their passport which they used to travel to the UK. You will need to conduct a manual right to work check on the basis of this vignette, which must be valid at the time of the check. However, as this will expire 30 days from issue, you will have to repeat the check using the online service, for the statutory excuse to continue.</p>

<p>If you employ someone on the basis of the short validity vignette and they are unable to access their BRP information to use the online service when the vignette time expires, you are not required to immediately terminate the employment if you believe the employee continues to have the right to work. However, once the 30 days has expired, you will not be able to establish a statutory excuse if it transpires that the employee is working illegally.</p>

<h3>Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs) and National Insurance numbers</h3>

<p>We are introducing an aligned BRP and National Insurance Number (NINo) process, on a phased basis, for those aged 16 or over. This currently applies to most migrants and dependants who have been granted permission to enter in any skilled worker category or as a refugee and dependants, including those granted settled status through a protection route. In such cases, the NINo will appear in the remarks on the reverse of the BRP or on their online status, therefore, there is no need for the migrant or the employer to make a separate application to the Department for Work and Pensions to obtain one.</p>

<h3>Changes to the way in which biometric cards are used to evidence right to work</h3>

<p>The way in which Biometric Residence Card (BRC), Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) and Frontier Worker Permit (FWP) holders evidence their right to work has changed.</p>

<p>Since 6 April 2022, BRC, BRP and FWP holder are required to evidence their right to work using the Home Office online service only. Employers cannot accept physical cards for the purposes of a right to work check even if it shows a later expiry date. BRCs, BRPs and FWPs have been removed from the lists of acceptable documents used to conduct a manual right to work check.</p>

<p>Retrospective checks will not be required on biometric card holders who, before 6 April 2022, used their physical card to demonstrate their right to work. Employers will maintain a statutory excuse against a civil penalty if the initial checks were undertaken in line with the guidance that applied at the time the check was made.</p>

<p>If an employer chooses to undertake a retrospective check and identifies an existing employee who no longer has a right to work, they are required to take the appropriate action. If the employee is an EEA citizen or non-EEA family member, further information on what steps to take is available in Annex B of this guidance.</p>

<h3>When to contact the Home Office Employer Checking Service to verify right to work</h3>

<p>In certain circumstances, you will need to contact the Home Office’s  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">Employer Checking</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">Servic</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">e</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">(</a>ECS) to establish a statutory excuse. These are when:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You are presented with a document (non-digital CoA or an acknowledgement letter or email) confirming receipt of an application to EUSS on or before 30 June 2021; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are presented with a non-digital CoA confirming receipt of an application to the EUSS on or after 1 July 2021; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have checked a digital CoA, using the online service, confirming receipt of an application to the EUSS on or after 1 July 2021, and been directed to the ECS; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are presented with a valid Application Registration Card stating that the holder is permitted to undertake the work in question. Any work will be restricted to employment in a shortage occupation; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are satisfied that you have not been provided with any acceptable documents because the person has an outstanding application with us which was made before their previous permission expired or has an appeal or administrative review pending and, therefore, cannot provide evidence of their right to work; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You consider that you have not been provided with any acceptable documents, but the person presents other information indicating they are a long-term resident of the UK who arrived in the UK before 1988.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the above circumstances, you will establish a statutory excuse only if you are issued with a Positive Verification Notice (PVN) confirming that the named person is allowed to carry out the type of work in question.</p>

<p>You should not contact the ECS where employment commenced before 29 February 2008 and has been continuous ever since. You will receive a Negative Verification Notice because this employment is out of scope of the civil penalty scheme.</p>

<p>To find out if you need to request a verification check from the ECS and to conduct that check, you should use the online tool  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">‘Employer Checking Service</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">’</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">.</a></p>

<h3>Certificate of Application</h3>

<p>You must make a copy of this document and retain this copy, in the usual way. If you are required to verify the CoA with the ECS, you must also obtain and keep a copy of the Positive Verification Notice (PVN). In so doing, you will have a statutory excuse for six months from the date stated in the PVN. A PVN will not provide a statutory excuse if you know that the employment is not permitted. In such circumstances, you will also be committing a criminal offence.</p>

<h3>Application Registration Card and asylum seekers</h3>

<p>Since July 2017, upgraded Application Registration Cards (ARC) have been issued to new asylum claimants through a gradual rollout. The ARC is the card used by asylum claimants to demonstrate they have made an asylum claim. The new ARC closely resembles the Biometric Residence Permit. It includes extra security features, a biometric facial image and an expiry date. Whilst the earlier version of the ARC is no longer being issued, the cards already in circulation will continue to be acceptable until they expire.</p>

<p>Asylum claimants are not normally allowed to work whilst their claim is being considered. They are instead provided with accommodation and support to meet their essential living needs if they would otherwise be destitute. We may grant permission to work to asylum seekers whose claim has been outstanding for more than 12 months through no fault of their own. Anyone allowed to work under this policy is restricted to working in jobs on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-shortage-occupation-list">shortage occupation list</a> published by the Home Office. Their ARC will state “work permitted shortage OCC”. Any permission to work granted will come to an end if their claim is refused and any appeal rights are exhausted because at that point, they are expected to leave the UK.</p>

<p>You may accept a new biometric style or an old-style ARC, provided you verify the right to work and any work restrictions by obtaining a Positive Verification Notice issued by the ECS. This excuse will expire six months from the date of the PVN, when a further check must be undertaken if the statutory excuse is to be retained.</p>

<p>If you receive a Negative Verification Notice from the ECS, which informs you that the individual does not have the right to work, and you employ this person, you will not have a statutory excuse and may be liable for a civil penalty or be committing a criminal offence.</p>

<p>Anyone who is granted permission to remain in the UK as a refugee, or who is granted humanitarian protection has unrestricted access to the labour market. A refugee may demonstrate their work entitlement through the Home Office online service (if they have a BRP) or Immigration Status Document (an older form of document issued to refugees and certain other categories of migrant prior to the introduction of the BRP).</p>

<h3>Outstanding applications, appeals and administrative reviews</h3>

<p>If you request verification from the ECS, because the employee or potential employee has an outstanding application with us or appeal or administrative review against a Home Office decision, you should wait at least 14 days after the application, appeal or administrative review has been delivered or posted to us or the court, before requesting a verification check. This is because it takes this amount of time for most applications, appeals or administrative reviews to be registered with the Home Office.</p>

<p>In order to make the verification request with the ECS, you must obtain confirmation from your employee or potential employee of when the application, appeal or administrative review was made to the Home Office. This information must be included in the request form.</p>

<p>The ECS aims to provide a response within five working days of receiving a valid request. It is your responsibility to inform the person you intend to employ, or continue employing, that you are carrying out this check on them, to complete the verification request correctly and to make the request at least 14 days after the date of the application, appeal or administrative review was delivered or posted.</p>

<h3>Windrush generation individuals</h3>

<p>The Government has put in place additional safeguards to ensure that those who have lived lawfully in the UK since before 1988 are not denied access to work.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, individuals of the Windrush generation (those who arrived in the UK before 1973) and those non-UK citizens who arrived in the UK between 1973 and 1988, may not be able to provide documentation from the acceptable document lists to demonstrate their entitlement to work in the UK. The Home Office has established the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/windrush-help-team-partner-pack">Windrush Help Team</a>  which is handling applications under the Windrush Scheme for confirmation of indefinite leave to remain, including a biometric residence permit or applications for British citizenship.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">Employer Checking Service</a>  (ECS).</p>

<p>The ECS will notify the Windrush Help Team, who will contact the individual to confirm their circumstances and arrange for their status to be resolved. Working with the Windrush Help Team, the ECS will be able to confirm an individual’s right to work in these circumstances and will do so by issuing you with a PVN.</p>

<p>A PVN issued by the ECS will provide you with a statutory excuse for six months from the date stated in the PVN. The information provided by the ECS will clearly set out whether a repeat check will be required, and if so, when.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/windrush-help-team-partner-pack">The Windrush Help Tea</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/windrush-help-team-partner-pack">m</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/windrush-help-team-partner-pack">c</a>an offer support and guidance about the Windrush Scheme and advise individuals on how to apply. It can also help vulnerable people or those who need additional support. If a prospective or existing employee has been affected, they can contact the Windrush Help Team via the above link or by calling 0800 678 1925.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Who do you conduct checks on?</h2>

<p>You should ask all prospective employees to demonstrate their right to work through a manual document check, using the services of an IDSP, or by using the Home Office online right to work checking service. You cannot mandate how an individual proves their right to work. To ensure that you do not discriminate against anyone, you should provide every opportunity to enable an individual to prove their right to work.</p>

<h3>Discrimination</h3>

<p>You should not discriminate when conducting right to work checks.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<p>· be consistent in how you conduct right to work checks on all prospective employees, including British citizens.</p>

<p>· ensure job selections are made on the basis of suitability for the post.</p>

<p>· ensure that no prospective job applicants are discouraged or excluded, either directly or indirectly, because of known or perceived protected characteristics.</p>

<p>You should not:</p>

<p>· discriminate when conducting right to work checks.</p>

<p>· only check the status of those who appear to you likely to be migrants</p>

<p>· make assumptions about a person’s right to work in the UK or their immigration status on the basis of their colour, nationality, ethnic or national origins, accent, surname or the length of time they have been resident in the UK.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you may be acting in a discriminatory manner and it could be used as evidence against you in proceedings under the Equality Act 2010 or the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997, as amended.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-code-of-practice-on-avoiding-discrimination">Code of practice for employers: Avoiding unlawful discrimination while preventing</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-code-of-practice-on-avoiding-discrimination">illegal working</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-code-of-practice-on-avoiding-discrimination">p</a>rovides practical guidance on how to avoid unlawful discrimination when employing individuals and conducting right to work checks. We strongly recommend that you refer to this code and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">Code of practice on preventing illegal working: Civil penalty</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">scheme for employers</a>  when conducting right to work checks.</p>

<p>Anyone who believes that they have been discriminated against, either directly or indirectly, by an employer, a prospective employer or an employment agency, because of their race or a protected characteristic may bring a complaint before an Employment Tribunal, or an Industrial Tribunal in Northern Ireland. If the claim is upheld, the Tribunal will normally order the employer to pay compensation, for which there is no upper limit.</p>

<p>If you need expert advice and support on discrimination, you can call the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights">Equality Advisory Support Service (EASS)</a> on 0808 800 0082.</p>

<p>In Northern Ireland the advisory service is provided by the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.equalityni.org" rel="external">Equality Commission for Northern Ireland</a>. The telephone helpline number is 028 90 500600.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> When do you conduct follow up checks?</h2>

<p>You need to recheck the right to work of those individuals who have time-limited permission to work in the UK. This should occur when their previous permission comes to an end. The follow-up check is designed to prevent people from overstaying their immigration permission where this is time limited. The Employer Checking Service can confirm the right to work of an individual who has an outstanding application or appeal to the immigration system (see above).</p>

<h3>In-time applications</h3>

<p>A person’s application for further immigration permission to stay in the UK must be made before their existing permission expires for it to be deemed ‘in-time’. If they do this, any existing right to work will continue until that in-time application has been determined. In such circumstances, a PVN from our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">Employer Checking</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">Service</a>  (ECS) would demonstrate your statutory excuse for six months from the date of the Notice. If you receive a Negative Verification Notice in response to your verification request, you will no longer have a statutory excuse and you will be liable for a civil penalty if the person is not permitted to work in the UK. You may also be convicted of the offence of employing an illegal worker.</p>

<p>It is important that a person makes an application to the Home Office before their permission expires, because this has an impact on their right to work.</p>

<h3>Contacting the Home Office</h3>

<p>On the date on which your employees permission expires, to continue to employ them you must be reasonably satisfied they:</p>

<p>· have submitted an in-time application to extend or vary their permission to be in the UK; or</p>

<p>· have made an appeal or an administrative review against a decision on that application which is outstanding; or</p>

<p>· are unable to provide acceptable documentation but presents other information indicating they are a long-term lawful resident of the UK who arrived here before 1988</p>

<p>In such cases, your statutory excuse will continue from the expiry date of your employee’s permission for a further period of up to 28 days to enable you to obtain a positive verification from the ECS. This ‘grace period’ does not apply to checks carried out before employment commences. In such circumstances, you should delay employing the individual until such time you receive a six-month PVN from the ECS.</p>

<p>During either the initial 28 days, or the six-month PVN period your employee provides evidence that their application, appeal or administrative review has been determined with permission to stay granted, you can maintain a statutory excuse for the duration of their immigration permission by conducting a check in the normal way. A letter from a solicitor indicating a successful appeal or administrative review or a copy of a successful court judgment will not provide you with a statutory excuse.</p>

<p>You can reasonably satisfy yourself of a pending application through, for example, a Home Office acknowledgment letter or a Home Office or appeal tribunal reference number, and proof of date of postage. If your employee cannot provide this evidence, this does not necessarily mean that they have not made an application, appeal or applied for an administrative review.</p>

<h3>Appeals and Administrative Reviews</h3>

<p>Administrative reviews have replaced some rights of appeal where the applicant believes our decision to refuse their application is incorrect. For decisions made in the UK, the review application must be made within 14 calendar days from notification of the decision. Any previous permission to work continues during the period that an administrative review can be made and, if made, will continue until the administrative review has been determined (decided or withdrawn). This will normally be within 28 days.</p>

<p>Where an application for an administrative review is brought after the period for making an application has expired, we may decide to accept the administrative review as valid. If so, any permission to work will continue from the date that the administrative review is accepted. This will be confirmed by a PVN from the ECS. The individual will not be permitted to work between the date that their previous permission to work expired and the date we decide that the administrative review is valid.</p>

<p>Further detail on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/administrative-review">administrative reviews</a>  can be found on GOV.UK<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/administrative-review">.</a></p>

<h3>Transfer of undertakings</h3>

<p>Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (TUPE) Regulations 2006 provide that right to work checks carried out by the transferor (the seller) are deemed to have been carried out by the transferee (the buyer). As such, the buyer will obtain the benefit of any statutory excuse established by the seller.</p>

<p>However, if the seller did not conduct the original checks correctly, the buyer would be liable for a penalty if an employee, who commenced work on or after 29 February 2008, is later found to be working illegally. Also, a check by the buyer may be the only way to determine when any follow-up check should be carried out in respect of employees with time-limited permission to work in the UK.</p>

<p>For these reasons, employers who acquire staff in cases of TUPE transfers are advised to undertake a fresh right to work check on those staff they have acquired. Employers are not required to have a statutory excuse in respect of employment which commenced before 29 February 2008, where the individual has been in continuous employment prior to that date. This includes where employment has continued as part of a TUPE transfer.</p>

<p>We recognise that there may be practical problems in undertaking these checks before employment commences for workers acquired as part of a TUPE transfer, and for this reason a grace period has been provided during which you should undertake the check. This period runs for 60 days from the date of the transfer of the business to correctly carry out fresh right to work checks in respect of those TUPE employees acquired. There is no grace period for any subsequent follow-up checks.</p>

<p>This 60-day grace period applies in all situations where there is a “relevant transfer”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, even if the transferring business is subject to “terminal” insolvency proceedings falling within regulation 8(7) of the 2006 TUPE Regulations, such as cases involving compulsory liquidation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Changes in the Employer’s legal constitution</h3>

<p>Where the employer is a corporate body and there has only been a change in the employer’s legal constitution e.g. a change from a private limited company to a public limited company or change from a partnership to a limited company or a limited liability partnership or a TUPE transfer within the same group of companies, the right to work check does not need to be repeated because of this change. This is only the case when the employer is effectively the same entity and is only changing its legal status. Where there is any doubt, we recommend that the employer checks the person’s right to work, rather than risking liability for a civil penalty should an employee be found to be working illegally.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> What are the sanctions against illegal working?</h2>

<p>Illegal working is tackled through a ‘whole government approach’. Co-ordination across agencies in government, including HMRC, to ensure that illegal working is detected more effectively, is conducted through the sharing of intelligence and joint enforcement operations. When illegal working is identified, a range of sanctions are applied.</p>

<p>If you are found to be employing someone illegally and you have not carried out the prescribed checks, you may face sanctions including:</p>

<p>• a civil penalty of up to £20,000 per illegal worker;</p>

<p>• in serious cases, a criminal conviction carrying a prison sentence of up to five years and an unlimited fine;</p>

<p>• closure of the business and a compliance order issued by the court;</p>

<p>• disqualification as a director;</p>

<p>This is a quarterly report showing the total number of civil penalties for illegal working issued to non-compliant employers in each region of the UK. The report shows the number of illegal workers found and the value of the penalty issued.</p>

<h3>Civil penalties</h3>

<p>The amount of any civil penalty issued is determined on a case-by-case basis. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">The ‘Cod</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">e</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">of practice on preventing illegal working</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">’</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-penalties-codes-of-practice-for-employers-2018">e</a>xplains how a penalty is calculated, including mitigating factors which may reduce the penalty amount.</p>

<p>If you are found liable, you will be issued with a Civil Penalty Notice setting out the total penalty amount you are required to pay, and the date by which you must pay it. It will also inform you how you can exercise your right to object, following which you will be able to appeal. The employer must always object against the penalty notice before appealing to the court, except if served with a penalty notice for a higher amount following an objection.</p>

<p>Further information is contained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-fines-employers-guide">‘Employer’s guide to the administration of the civil</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-fines-employers-guide">penalty scheme</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-fines-employers-guide">’</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-fines-employers-guide">w</a>hich sets out in more detail the stages of the civil penalty process, how the penalty is calculated, the range of notices you may receive and the deadlines by which you need to take action at each stage.</p>

<p>Receipt of a civil penalty could also affect your ability to sponsor migrants who come to the UK in the future (including those under the points-based immigration system) or your eligibility to hold a Gangmaster’s licence. Being issued with a civil penalty may also affect your ability to hold a licence in the private hire and taxi sector and the alcohol and late-night refreshment sector.</p>

<p>If an employee is undertaking a role which is different from that for which the certificate of sponsorship was issued and permission to enter or stay was granted, you are employing the worker illegally. Further information on sponsoring migrants may be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sponsorship-information-for-employers-and-educators">Sponsorship: guidance for employers and educators</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sponsorship-information-for-employers-and-educators">.</a></p>

<p>If you are an employer who is subject to immigration control, you should also be aware that if you are liable for a civil penalty, this will be recorded on Home Office systems and may be taken into account when we consider any future immigration application that you make.</p>

<h3>The offence of employing an illegal worker</h3>

<p>You will commit a criminal offence under section 21 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, as amended by section 35 of the Immigration Act 2016, if you know or have reasonable cause to believe that you are employing an illegal worker. You may face up to five years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.</p>

<p>It is illegal to employ someone aged 16 or over who is subject to immigration control and who is not allowed to undertake the work in question (by reason of their immigration status). The civil penalty scheme is the sanction applied in most routine cases involving the employment of illegal workers. If you know that you are employing someone who is not allowed to carry out the work in question, you will not have a statutory excuse, regardless of whether you have conducted right to work checks. However, in more serious cases, prosecution may be considered where it is deemed the appropriate response to the non-compliance encountered.</p>

<h3>The offence of illegal working</h3>

<p>Working illegally is a criminal offence. Illegal workers face having their wages seized. They may also be prosecuted and can be imprisoned for up to six months.</p>

<p>The Immigration Act 2016 made it an offence to work illegally in the UK. A person commits this offence if they are subject to immigration control, and they work when they are disqualified from working by reason of their immigration status. The offence applies when they know, or have reasonable cause to believe, that they are disqualified from working.</p>

<p>‘Disqualified from working by reason of their immigration status’ means that they:</p>

<p>· have not been granted leave to enter or remain in the UK; or</p>

<p>· their leave to enter or remain in the UK</p>

<p>• is invalid,</p>

<p>• has ceased to have effect (whether by reason of curtailment, revocation, cancellation, passage of time, or otherwise), or</p>

<p>• is subject to a condition preventing the person from doing work of that kind.</p>

<p>As well as including those working illegally under a contract of employment, the offence also applies to work undertaken by those who are self-employed. The offence covers both informal and formal working arrangements.</p>

<p>The offence carries a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine in England and Wales and six months’ imprisonment and/or a fine of the statutory maximum in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Wages gained from illegal working may be seized as the proceeds of crime and assets may be confiscated.</p>

<h3>Closure notices and compliance orders</h3>

<p>The 2016 Act (Section 38 and Schedule 6) introduced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/illegal-working-closure-notice-and-compliance-orders">illegal working closure notice and compliance order provisions</a> to provide a power to deal with those employers who have continued to flout the UK’s laws by using illegal labour where previous civil and/or criminal sanctions have not curbed their non-compliant behaviour. Serious or persistently non-compliant employers may face temporary closure of their business by Immigration Officers. The employer is then placed under special conditions to support compliance, as directed by the Court, and may be inspected by immigration officers.</p>

<p>The provisions commenced on 1 December 2016. The notice prohibits access to the premises and paid or voluntary work on the premises, unless it is authorised in writing by an Immigration Officer. The closure notice does not prevent access to the premises by any person who habitually lives there. In addition to the issue of the notice, consideration will also be given to the service of penalties or prosecution for illegal working and other immigration offences.</p>

<p>Whenever an illegal working closure notice has been issued, and which has not been cancelled, an Immigration Officer must make an application by complaint to a Magistrates’ Court for a compliance order. The application is sent to the Court and served on the respondent before the hearing and forms the basis of the application to the court for the compliance order. The aim of a compliance order is to prevent an employer operating at the premises from employing illegal workers. The employer is placed under special conditions to support compliance, as directed by the Court, and may be inspected by immigration officers.</p>

<h3>Preventing illegal working in licensed sectors</h3>

<p>The Immigration Act 2016 amended existing licensing regimes in high-risk sectors of the economy (private hire vehicles and taxi sector and the alcohol and late-night refreshment sector). Licences will not be issued to those who break the UK’s immigration laws and may be revoked where an existing licence holder commits immigration crime or receives a civil penalty for employing illegal workers.</p>

<p>Licensing authorities carry out right to work checks when considering applications for licences in the taxi and private hire vehicle sector and the alcohol and late-night refreshment sector. Applicants need to provide evidence of their right to work in the UK and licences will not be issued to those who do not have the right to do the work in question.</p>

<p>Where the holder of a licence breaches immigration laws or receives a civil penalty, this will be grounds for licensing authorities to review, suspend or revoke a licence. In the case of licences for sale and supply of alcohol and late-night refreshment, the Home Office as a responsible authority under the Licensing Act 2003 receives a copy of these applications and may make representations to the relevant licensing authority when we believe that to grant a licence will be prejudicial to preventing immigration crime and illegal working in licensed premises.</p>

<p>Immigration Enforcement have the same power of entry as licensing enforcement officers to facilitate joint operations and inspections for immigration offences in relation to the licensable activity.</p>

<p>Provisions commenced in April 2017 in England and Wales. Equivalent provisions in regulations will be made for Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Annex B: EEA citizens</h2>

<p>The UK has left the European Union (EU) and the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 ended free movement law in the UK on 31 December 2020. There followed a grace period of six-months during which relevant aspects of free movement law were saved to allow eligible EEA citizens and their family members resident in the UK by 31 December 2020 to apply to the EUSS. This period ended on 30 June 2021.</p>

<h3>Right to work checks for EEA citizens from 1 July 2021</h3>

<p>Since 1 July 2021, EEA citizens and their family members are required to have immigration status in the UK. They can no longer rely on an EEA passport or national identity card, which only confirms their nationality, to prove their right to work. They are required to provide evidence of lawful immigration status in the UK, in the same way as other foreign nationals.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for a retrospective check to be undertaken on EEA citizens who entered into employment up to and including 30 June 2021. You will maintain a continuous statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty if the initial checks were undertaken in line with the guidance that applied at the time you made the check.</p>

<p>If you choose to carry out retrospective checks, you must ensure that you do so in a non-discriminatory manner. The  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-code-of-practice-on-avoiding-discrimination">Code of practice for employers: avoiding unlawful</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-to-work-checks-code-of-practice-on-avoiding-discrimination">discrimination while preventing illegal working</a>  provides practical guidance on how to avoid unlawful discrimination when conducting right to work checks.</p>

<h3>Irish citizens</h3>

<p>Irish citizens continue to have unrestricted access to work in the UK. They can prove their right to work using their Irish passport or Irish passport card (in either case, whether current or expired), or their Irish birth or adoption certificate together with an official document giving the person’s permanent National Insurance number and their name issued by a government agency or a previous employer.</p>

<p>Irish citizens can also apply for a frontier worker permit, this permit can be issued digitally or as a physical permit, so they can prove their right to work using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-work">Home Office online right to</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-work">work service</a>.</p>

<h3>How EEA citizens are required to prove their right to work</h3>

<h3>EEA citizens granted status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)</h3>

<p>The majority of EEA citizens now prove their right to work using the Home Office online services.</p>

<p>If an EEA citizen has been granted ‘Settled Status’ by the Home Office, they will have a continuous right to work.</p>

<p>If an EEA citizen has been granted ‘Pre-Settled Status’ by the Home Office, they will have a time-limited right to work and you must carry out a follow-up check. The Home Office online service will advise when a follow-up check must be carried out.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>A ‘Frontier Worker’ is an EEA citizen who is resident outside the UK but is economically active (employed or self-employed) in the UK. They have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, the EEA European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Separation Agreement and the Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement (‘the agreements’) to enter the UK and work for as long as they remain a frontier worker.</p>

<p>Since 1 July 2021, it is mandatory for frontier workers to obtain a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/frontier-worker-permit">frontier worker permit</a>  as evidence of their right to enter the UK.</p>

<p>Whilst the frontier worker permit requires an individual to reside outside the UK, their work in the UK can be spread over the entire year(s). Therefore, they may make multiple trips to the UK and they are lawfully present in the UK. Frontier workers are issued with a frontier worker permit either digitally or physically. Using the online service, as set out in this guidance, will provide you with a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty.</p>

<h3>Additional information</h3>

<p>Whilst it is mandatory for protected frontier workers to hold a frontier worker permit to enter the UK on this basis from 1 July 2021, there is no mandatory requirement for protected frontier workers who have rights under the Agreements to use a frontier worker permit to evidence their rights in the UK.</p>

<p>Consequently, it is open to any EEA or Swiss citizen who has an enforceable Citizens’ Rights Agreement right as a frontier worker to work in the UK, to demonstrate the existence of that right in a different way than using the online service. To obtain a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty in such cases, you must request a right to work check from the ECS.</p>

<p>You must have obtained copies of the employee’s documents which evidence that they were exercising rights as a Frontier Worker on or before 31 December 2020, as these will form part of your statutory excuse.</p>

<p>Before providing you with a response, the ECS may contact you and ask you to send them a copy of the documents you have checked. The ECS will confirm if the individual has the right to work, and when you need to carry out a follow up check. Where the ECS can issue a Positive Verification Notice in the absence of a Frontier Worker Permit, you will be required to carry out a further ECS check in six months to maintain your statutory excuse.</p>

<p>If you choose to employ the individual as a Frontier Worker, without checking their Frontier Worker Permit via the online service, or securing a PVN from the ECS, you will not establish a statutory excuse against a liability for a civil penalty should the individual be found to be working illegally.</p>

<p>Alternative Evidence:</p>

<p>· evidence of the applicant’s own identity and that they are an EEA citizen – such as a passport or national identity card</p>

<p>· evidence they are primarily resident outside of the UK, such as utility bills or bank statements which include proof of address outside the UK</p>

<p>· evidence they worked in the UK as an employed or self-employed person during</p>

<p>2020, or had retained worker or self-employed status during 2020 (see below)</p>

<p>· evidence they have continued to be employed or self-employed in the UK or have retained worker or self-employed person status</p>

<p>· a signed and dated contract specifying the employee must work in the UK</p>

<p>· letters from employers confirming the need for the employee to travel to the UK for the purpose of work and outlining the frequency of this travel</p>

<p>· tax returns from HMRC showing the person is established as self-employed in the UK</p>

<p>· bank statements or invoices which show payments for work carried out in the UK.</p>

<h4>Retained frontier worker status:</h4>

<p>A protected frontier worker who has (or had) temporarily stopped working can still be treated as a worker under regulation 4 of The Citizens’ Rights (Frontier Workers) (EU Exit) Regulations 2000 if they can provide proof that they:</p>

<p>• are (or were) temporarily unable to work because of illness or an accident</p>

<p>• are (or were) in duly recorded involuntary unemployment</p>

<p>• are (or were) involuntarily unemployed and have embarked on vocational training</p>

<p>• voluntarily stopped working to start vocational training related to their previous work</p>

<p>• are (or were) temporarily unable to work following pregnancy or childbirth</p>

<p>Guidance on what is considered sufficient evidence for retaining frontier worker status can be found in the frontier worker permit case working guidance here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-worker-permit-scheme-caseworker-guidance">Frontier Worker Permit</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-worker-permit-scheme-caseworker-guidance">Scheme Guidance</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-worker-permit-scheme-caseworker-guidance">.</a></p>

<h3>Service Provider from Switzerland</h3>

<p>A ‘Service Provider from Switzerland’ (SPS) is an individual of any nationality who is required by their employer (who must be based in Switzerland) to execute a pre-existing contract to temporarily provide services for a party in the UK. Eligible companies have rights under the Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement to enable employees, or individuals (if self-employed) to travel to the UK to provide services for up to 90 days per year. An SPS must obtain their visa in advance of travel.</p>

<p>The UK company and the Swiss company providing the services must have had a pre-existing contract to deliver services before 31 December 2021. A Service Provider from Switzerland visa is a hard copy document without an online checking function. The visa will be in the form of a vignette and will identify the individual as a ‘Service Provider from Switzerland’, and can be issued in two ways:</p>

<p>• (All nationalities) within a passport</p>

<p>• (Swiss citizens only) on an official form (“Form for Affixing a Visa”) - If the individual is a Swiss citizen, they can choose to apply to the immigration route using their Swiss identity card. In this circumstance, the vignette will be attached to an official Home Office form.</p>

<p>As an employer you are not required to carry out a right to work check on an individual with a Service Provider from Switzerland visa, as they are not in your employment. You may, however, be asked to provide sight or a copy of the contract held with the Swiss company the visa holder is carrying out work or services for.</p>

<p>The Service Provider from Switzerland visa specifies that an individual is only permitted to work in the UK for 90 days per calendar year, the 90 days’ work can be spread over the entire year. The visa allows the individual to make multiple trips to the UK until the visa expires.</p>

<h3>Outstanding UK EU Settlement Scheme applications</h3>

<p>EEA citizens, and their family members, who have made a valid application to the EUSS can continue to live their life in the UK and maintain a right to work until their application is finally determined. This includes pending the outcome of any appeal against a decision to refuse status.</p>

<p>Employers must provide prospective employees with every opportunity to prove their right to work and should not treat those with an outstanding, valid application less favourably.</p>

<h3>Receipt of application submitted to the EU Settlement Scheme</h3>

<p>There are a small number of individuals who made their EUSS application using a paper application. Due to the postage and processing time related to paper application, you may be required to undertake a check before the individual receives their Certificate of</p>

<p>Application. Where an individual has made an application on or before 30 June 2021, they will be provided with a letter or email notification acknowledging receipt of the EUSS application. You must request a right to work check from the Employer Checking Service to verify this document.</p>

<h3>Certificate of Application</h3>

<p>Where an individual has been issued with a Certificate of Application (CoA), you must first check whether this is a ‘digital’ or ‘non-digital’ CoA. A CoA is evidence that an individual has made a valid application to the EUSS and should be used to evidence their right to work until such time their application is finally determined.</p>

<h3>Digital Certificate of Application</h3>

<p>Most individuals with an outstanding valid application made to the EUSS on or before 30 June 2021 have been issued with a digital CoA. In this instance, you should check with the individual and ask them to provide you with a share code. This means you can check their right to work immediately via the online service and do not need to contact the ECS. The online service will provide confirmation of their right to work and advise when a follow-up check is required.</p>

<p>Where the individual has a digital CoA to evidence an application made on or after 1 July 2021, the online service will direct you to verify this via the ECS. You must do this in order to obtain a positive verification notice in these circumstances.</p>

<h3>Non-digital Certificate of Application</h3>

<p>A ‘non-digital’ CoA is an email or letter, sent to the individual, advising them how prospective employers can request information about their right to work from the Employer</p>

<p>Checking Service (ECS). Where a prospective employee provides you with a ‘non-digital’ CoA as evidence of an application made to the EUSS on or after 1 July 2021, you must make a copy of this document and retain this copy, together with a Positive Verification Notice (PVN) from the ECS. In doing so you will have a statutory excuse for six months from the date stated on the PVN.</p>

<p>Should you be provided with a non-digital CoA dated on or before 30 June 2021 you should ask the prospective employee to check if they have also been issued with a digital CoA. If they have, they should provide you with a share code to verify their right to work via the online service instead. If they have not been issued a digital version, you should contact the ECS.</p>

<p>You can request a right to work check from the ECS using the online form ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">request a Home Office right to work check</a>’ on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>EU Settlement Scheme status granted by a Crown Dependency</h3>

<p>The Crown Dependencies (the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and the Isle of Man) each operate their own EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) for those eligible to apply. The UK and the Crown Dependencies recognise status granted under each other’s Scheme, so an individual granted settled or pre-settled status by a Crown Dependency will be considered to have settled or pre-settled status in the UK.</p>

<p>The Isle of Man and Guernsey issue a letter to those granted EUSS status. Jersey issues a letter and operates an immigration status checker service for individuals to obtain confirmation of their status at any point.</p>

<p>When presented with a letter or email confirmation of EUSS leave from a Crown Dependency, you must request a right to work check from the ECS. You must keep a copy of the Crown Dependency letter or email and retain this with the response from the ECS to have a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty.</p>

<h3>Outstanding EU Settlement Scheme applications in a Crown Dependency</h3>

<p>Where an individual has an outstanding application to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) of the Crown Dependencies of the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey or the Isle of Man, they will have a letter or email notification confirming their outstanding application. You must request a right to work check from the ECS</p>

<p>You must make retain a copy of the letter or email notification with the response from the ECS to have a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty.</p>

<h3>EEA citizens with Indefinite Leave to Enter or Remain</h3>

<p>EEA citizens with Indefinite Leave to Enter or Remain (ILE/R) or Settlement are not required to make an application to the EUSS but can do so if they wish.</p>

<p>Since 1 July 2021, EEA citizens with ILE/R are required to prove their right to work in the same way as other foreign nationals who do not have a digital status. You can carry out a manual check of their Home Office documentation such as an endorsement / vignette in a current passport stating, ‘Settlement’, ‘Indefinite Leave to Enter or Remain’ or ‘No Time Limit’. Some may have a current Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) and this can be used to access the online right to work service.</p>

<p>Further information:</p>

<p>If you encounter, EEA citizens who believe that they have ILE/R but do not have a document to confirm this please encourage them to:</p>

<p>· <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/applying-for-settled-status">apply to the EU Settlement Scheme</a> to obtain settled or pre-settled status (individuals may still be eligible to make an application to the EUSS after 30 June 2021)</p>

<p>· <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/windrush-prove-your-right-to-be-in-the-uk">apply to the Windrush Scheme</a> to get proof of their ILE/R status</p>

<p>If they are from Malta or Cyprus, they may also be able to apply for British citizenship through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/windrush-prove-your-right-to-be-in-the-uk">Windrush Scheme</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fpublications%2Fundocumented-commonwealth-citizens-resident-in-the-uk&amp;data=04%7C01%7CFrances.Tomlinson1%40homeoffice.gov.uk%7C33a09a7b4a544f5d2d8808d90f13f739%7Cf24d93ecb2914192a08af182245945c2%7C0%7C0%7C637557400680357723%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=BUa58usG1oz7NN6wFOyH%2BR8mq9Oh9W2DtUgRZYZxmbU%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">.</a></p>

<h3>Points-Based Immigration System</h3>

<p>Since 1 January 2021, EEA citizens who come to the UK to live, work or study need to obtain immigration status under the points-based system in the same way as other foreign nationals. The majority of EEA citizens will be provided with an eVisa however, this will be dependent upon the immigration route and how they made their application. Some EEA citizens will have a Biometric Residence Permit (BRP). Those with a valid BRP must use the online right to work service.</p>

<p>Individuals will provide you with a share code and their date of birth which will enable you to check their Home Office immigration status via the online service, ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">View a job applicant’s right to work’</a> available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>EEA Citizens and non-EEA family members without lawful immigration status</h3>

<p>We recognise that employers wish to have a lawful and stable workforce and maintain compliance with the Right to Work Scheme. You will have a continuous statutory excuse against a civil penalty if you carried out an initial right to work check in the prescribed manner as set out in legislation and guidance that applied at the time you completed the check, such as where an EEA citizen provided their passport or national identity card to you to prove their right to work prior to 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>There may be situations in which you identify an EEA citizen or non-EEA family member in your workforce who has not applied to the EUSS and does not hold any other form of permission to stay in the UK. You may become aware of this if you have chosen to carry out a retrospective check, completed an internal audit or have been made aware that your employee does not have a lawful status in the UK. In these situations, the employee may tell you that they have missed the deadline through no fault of their own and you may wish to explore whether there are ways you can lawfully continue their employment.</p>

<p>If they believe they are eligible for the EUSS, you could signpost them to make an application as the government has agreed temporary protection for applicants to the EUSS. Those who apply to the EUSS from 1 July 2021 will have their right to work protected while their application is determined, this applies to prospective and existing employees.</p>

<p>If an EEA citizen, or non-EEA family member, applies for a job but has not applied to the EUSS and has no alternative immigration status in the UK, then they will not be able to pass a right to work check. After a valid application is made, EUSS applicants and joining family members are able to take up new employment while they await the outcome of their application.</p>

<p>Home Office guidance remains that a Certificate of Application (CoA) confirming a valid application to the EUSS made on or after 1 July 2021, should be verified with the ECS.</p>

<p>The Home Office has grant-funded 72 organisations with a total of £22 million to do outreach and make sure people who are vulnerable or require assistance, are helped to make an application.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the criminal offence of employing an illegal worker is generally reserved for the most serious cases of non-compliance with the Right to Work Scheme. It is not intended for employers who have employed EEA citizens or non-EEA family members in good faith having completed a right to work check in the prescribed manner and are acting in accordance with this guidance to support their employees to make an application to the EUSS.</p>

<p>Where you have identified an existing employee who is an EEA citizen or non-EEA family member and may not have lawful status in the UK, you should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Advise the individual they must make an application to the EUSS within 28 days. They must then provide you with confirmation that they have been issued with a ‘digital’ or ‘non-digital’ Certificate of Application (CoA). Where they have been issued with a CoA, you must request a right to work check from the ECS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not make an application within 28 days, you must take steps to cease their employment in line with right to work legislation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a valid application has been confirmed, the ECS will give you a Positive Verification Notice (PVN). You must retain the PVN and a copy of the individual’s CoA. This will then provide you with a statutory excuse against a civil penalty for six months. This allows sufficient time for the application to be concluded and enables the individual to maintain their employment with you during that time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the individual has been granted status before the PVN expiry date, they can prove their right to work to you using the Home Office right to work online service. If they have not been granted status at the time the PVN expired, you must do a further check with the ECS in order to maintain your statutory excuse against a civil penalty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the follow-up check confirms that the application is outstanding, you will be given a further PVN for six months and would then repeat step 4 until such time as the application has been finally determined. If the follow-up check confirms the application has been finally determined and refused, then you will not be issued with a PVN and you must take steps to cease the individual’s employment.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Immigration Enforcement 28-day notice</h3>

<p>Should Immigration Enforcement encounter EEA citizens, or their family members, who are working without immigration permission, they will be given a written 28-day notice before action is taken. This provides individuals who may have been eligible under the EUSS had they applied by 30 June 2021, with the opportunity to make an application demonstrating any reasonable grounds for missing the deadline.</p>

<h3>Family Members</h3>

<p>Some individuals may be eligible for a permit to come to the UK if they are the family member of an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen, or a ‘person of Northern Ireland’. Non-EEA family members of EEA citizens are required to make an application to the EUSS to continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>There were two different types of family permit: the EUSS family permit and the EEA family permit. The latter, EEA family permits, ceased to be valid after 30 June 2021, even if there was time left on the permit. For more information on the EEA family permit, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/family-permit/eea-family-permit">EEA family permit</a> information on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Those with a EUSS family permit will be issued with a vignette placed in their passport or on a separate card/paper if the individual has not used a passport to apply. Where an individual presents a vignette of this type, the employer must take a copy of the passport as well as the vignette and ensure the photographs represent the same person.</p>

<p>Where the EUSS family permit is on a separate card/paper along with an expired passport or an identity card (current or expired), you must contact the contact the ECS to verify their status and obtain a statutory excuse against a civil penalty:</p>

<p>You must make a copy of their expired passport or identity card, EUSS family permit (vignette in passport or on a separate card/paper) and retain this with the response from the ECS to have a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty.</p>

<p>Finally, where applicable, joining family members (JFM) may apply to the EUSS. Where a JFM makes a valid application to the EUSS, they will receive a <a class="govuk-link" href="#certificate">Certificate of Application (CoA)</a>, issued by the Home Office. They will be able to use their CoA for the purpose of a right to work check, please see section 2 above which gives more details regarding COAs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Annex C: Employment of specific categories of workers</h2>

<h3>Sponsored work routes</h3>

<p>You will usually need a sponsor licence to employ someone to work for you from outside the UK. This includes citizens of the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland who arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>You will not need a sponsor licence to employ certain categories of workers, including:</p>

<p>· Irish citizens</p>

<p>· those with settled or pre-settled status under the EUSS</p>

<p>· those with indefinite leave to remain / settlement in the UK</p>

<p>For an overview of the requirements for a sponsor licence, see ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-visa-sponsorship-employers">UKVI Visa sponsorship for employers on GOV.UK</a>’.</p>

<p>For detailed information on the requirements, see ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sponsorship-information-for-employers-and-educators#workers-and-temporary-workers:-guidance-for-sponsors">Workers and Temporary Workers: guidance for sponsors</a>’ on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Students</h3>

<p>Not all international students are entitled to work while they are in the UK, but some are allowed to take limited employment if the conditions of their permission to study permit this.</p>

<p>A student who has been granted permission to be in the UK and is permitted to work may have an endorsement in their passport, which states that they are permitted to work and the number of hours of work permitted during term time e.g. 10 hours or 20 hours a week. Alternatively, they may have an eVisa or a BRP which will also show this information online, in which case employers can do an check by using the online service, entitled ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">View a job applicant’s right to work detail</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">s</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">’</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>A week is considered in this context to run from Monday to Sunday. If permission to work is not stated in one of these documents, the student is not permitted to work. Students who have the right to work are permitted to work full-time before their course starts, during vacations or during the period they hold permission for after they have competed their course. Students are not permitted to fill a permanent full-time vacancy unless they are applying to switch into the skilled worker route during their study or following the completion of degree-level study in the UK, or they have permission under the Doctorate Extension Scheme. Students are not permitted to work as an entertainer or professional sportsperson.</p>

<p>For students who have limited permission to work during term-times, you must also obtain, copy and retain details of their academic term and vacation times covering the duration of their period of study in the UK for which they will be employed.</p>

<p>· Short-term students on an English language course are not permitted to work or undertake a work placement.</p>

<p>· Visitors studying a course of up to six months in the UK are not permitted to work or to do a work placement.</p>

<p>More information about student work entitlements is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/points-based-system-student-route">Student route caseworker guidance.</a></p>

<h3>Work placements</h3>

<p>Work placements are intended to enable the student to gain specific experience of working in the field for which they are studying. Work placements are distinct from any employment that a student may (if permitted) take while they are following a course of study.</p>

<p>Students, including child students aged 16 or over, are allowed to undertake work placements where they are integral and related to the course and are assessed as part of the course. Where their student sponsor is a Probationary Sponsor, such courses must be at least RQF level 6 or SCQF level 9. Activity as part of a course-related work placement is restricted to no more than one third of the total length of the course undertaken in the UK unless:</p>

<p>· the student is following a course at degree level or above and is sponsored by Higher Education Provider (HEP) with a track record of compliance, or by an overseas HEI to undertake a short-term Study Abroad Programme in the UK, in which case the</p>

<p>work placement is restricted to no more than 50 per cent of the total length of the course; or</p>

<p>· the student is a child student aged 16 or over, in which case the work placement can form no more than 50 per cent of the total length of the course; or</p>

<p>· there is a statutory requirement for the course to include a specific period of work placement which exceeds this limit.</p>

<p>Student sponsors should provide a letter addressed to you as the work placement provider confirming that the work placement forms an integral and assessed part of the course and does not, by itself or in combination with other periods of work placement, breach the above restrictions. The letter must also include the terms and conditions of the work placement, including the work that the student will be expected to do, and how and when they will be assessed. You are strongly advised to obtain and retain such a letter as evidence of the work placement and that the work placement restrictions have not been breached as you may be liable for a civil penalty if your student employee does not comply with their immigration conditions.</p>

<p>While your student employee is undertaking a work placement as required by their course, this period of placement does not count towards the period of term time employment permitted by their immigration conditions.</p>

<p>The Student route replaced Tier 4 on 5 October 2020. Where a student holds Tier 4 leave, they will be considered to hold the same work rights as someone who holds Student immigration permission.</p>

<h3>Impact of a change in circumstances on a student’s right to work</h3>

<h4>The student has made an application to the Home Office to vary their immigration permission</h4>

<p>If the student is in the UK and has made a valid in-time immigration application (one made before their existing immigration permission expired), their existing conditions and work entitlements continue until their application is decided. If the application is approved, their immigration permission will be varied, and they will get new conditions of permission to stay. If the application is refused, their existing conditions continue to apply until their immigration permission expires.</p>

<h4>The student has stopped studying or their sponsor has lost its licence</h4>

<p>If there has been a significant change in the student’s circumstances which means they no longer qualify for their grant of Student immigration permission, the Home Office will curtail their permission. Any permission to work will expire on the new date that the student’s leave will expire following curtailment. Curtailment can be with immediate effect or take effect 60 days from the date the student was notified that their leave was curtailed.</p>

<h3>Voluntary Work</h3>

<p>Individuals, including students, who have been granted immigration permission to be in the UK are permitted to volunteer. Visitors can volunteer for a registered charity for a maximum of 30 days during their visit, but volunteering cannot be the main purpose of their visit. Individuals who have limited permission to work in the UK may not carry out any voluntary work.</p>

<p>The legal distinction between volunteering and voluntary work can be quite complex. However, there are some key questions to consider when assessing whether an activity is voluntary work:</p>

<p>It is likely to be voluntary work if:</p>

<p>· there is an obligation on the individual to perform the work and in return an obligation on the organisation to provide it. The obligation does not have to be in writing.</p>

<p>· the individual is rewarded for that work, either through money or benefits in kind.</p>

<p>An obligation to work or receipt of remuneration is likely to mean that the individual is working under a mutuality of obligation. Where there is mutuality of obligation, it is voluntary work.</p>

<p>However, as the legal distinction is not always clear, we recommend that those involved seek independent legal advice for their specific activity.</p>

<p>An individual who is not permitted to work might commit a criminal offence by engaging in voluntary work when they are subject to contractual obligations. In such circumstances, their employer might also be liable for a civil penalty for employing an illegal worker.</p>

<p>Students, including child students aged 16 and over, can do voluntary work if they are permitted to work, but this work and any other (for example, paid) work must not exceed the total number of hours they are permitted to work during term time. For example, if a student is permitted to work 20 hours a week during term-time and has paid work of 15 hours a week during term time, they cannot do more than 5 hours voluntary work. If they are not permitted to work they cannot do voluntary work.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Annex D: Digital identity verification – Guidance for employers and Identity Service Providers (IDSPs)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction</li>
</ol>

<p>1.1 This guidance follows the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-document-validation-technology-idvt">Home Office announcement of 27 December 2021</a> and updated information available on GOV.UK about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks">digital identity certification for right to work, right to rent and criminal record checks</a>. It sets out how employers can comply with their responsibilities to conduct right to work (RTW) checks, when using Identity Service Providers (IDSPs) to complete the identity verification element of checks involving British and Irish citizens who hold a valid passport (including Irish passport cards).</p>

<p>1.2 ‘Identity Document Validation Technology (IDVT)’ are forms of technology operated for the purpose of verifying the identity of a person, whereby a digital copy of a physical document relating to that person is produced for verification of the document’s validity, and whether that person is the rightful holder of the document.</p>

<p>1.3 ‘Identity Service Provider (IDSP)’ is a provider of identity verification services using IDVT. In the context of this guidance, an IDSP may be certified to provide identity verification to specific levels of confidence, specified by government standards. IDSPs are sometimes referred to as ‘identity providers’.</p>

<p>1.4 ‘IDVT identity check’ means the response generated by an IDSP, using IDVT, when undertaking identity verification with respect to a person.</p>

<p>1.5 The relevant changes to legislation came into force from 6 April 2022.</p>

<p>1.6 IDSPs act on behalf of the employer (with the employer becoming a ‘relying party’ in that transaction).</p>

<p>1.7 This guidance sets out the required steps to verify a person’s identity and eligibility using IDVT, for the purposes of RTW checks in order to obtain a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty.</p>

<p>1.8 Employers and IDSPs must discharge their duties in accordance with this guidance and RTW legislation.</p>

<p>1.9 Changes to the RTW regulations permit the use of IDSPs for identity verification, enabling employers to delegate elements of the checking process to IDSPs. This allows employers and IDSPs to utilise IDVT to carry out remote digital checks when using these services. Where the services of an IDSP are used, employers are encouraged to:</p>

<p>· Use an IDSP that is a certified provider.</p>

<p>· Provide appropriate training and guidance to their staff for example, on what information they must obtain from an IDSP to confirm verification of identity, what the information can be used for, and the additional steps they must take to establish eligibility to work.</p>

<p>1.10 The 2018 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-document-validation-technology/identification-document-validation-technology#why-use-idvts">Identity Document</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-document-validation-technology/identification-document-validation-technology#why-use-idvts">Validatio</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-document-validation-technology/identification-document-validation-technology#why-use-idvts">n</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-document-validation-technology/identification-document-validation-technology#why-use-idvts">Technology guidance</a>  recognises the role of IDSPs in identity verification and should be read in conjunction with this guidance.</p>

<p>1.11 This guidance makes extensive reference to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework#rules-for-identity-service-providers">UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a>. The UKDIATF will make provision for IDSPs to be certified as providers of identity verification services.</p>

<p>1.12 Certification provides a number of benefits. It is capable of providing reassurance the services can be trusted and are secure. It allows a single identity provider to complete a fully remote pre-employment checking process. It can also provide certainty for employers in an evolving technology and digital identity framework.</p>

<p>1.13 The UKDIATF defines:</p>

<p>· the organisational responsibilities of IDSPs that must be met, in order to be certified, and references the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual">Government Good Practice Guide 45</a>  (GPG45) as the standard that is used to define how identities should be verified.</p>

<p>· the ‘levels of confidence’ (LoC) in identity verification and ‘identity profiles’ that can meet the aforementioned levels of confidence.</p>

<p>2. A right to work check using IDVT via the services of an IDSP</p>

<p>2.1 The Home Office prescribes the nature of the checks required and the information that must be retained by employers in order to have a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty. The responsibility for the check remains with the employer, and they must ensure the IDSP they select to complete the identity verification element of the check carries out a prescribed check prior to the commencement of employment.</p>

<p>2.2 Employers will obtain a statutory excuse where they can demonstrate that they have complied with all the statutory requirements to conduct right to work checks. Where they have used an IDSP, the statutory excuse will only be obtained where that IDSP has also complied with the required steps. Should they be found to be employing an individual without their identity and eligibility being checked correctly in accordance with legislation and this guidance, the employer will not have a statutory excuse in the event the individual is found to be working illegally by reason of their immigration status.</p>

<p>3. Documents</p>

<p>3.1 For the purposes of verifying identity for RTW checks through IDVT, only the following specified documents can be accepted:</p>

<p>· valid British passports</p>

<p>· valid Irish passports</p>

<p>· valid Irish passport cards</p>

<p>3.2 For employers to be able to rely upon the IDVT identity check carried out by an IDSP to prove eligibility for the purpose of a RTW check and obtain a statutory excuse, a valid British or Irish passport (including passport cards) must be provided to the IDSP and checked by them using IDVT for the purposes of identity verification.</p>

<p>3.3 If an individual is reliant upon an expired British or Irish passport (including passport cards) to prove their eligibility for the purpose of a RTW check, an IDVT check is not valid. The employer will need to carry out a manual check of the original document in the prescribed manner to obtain a statutory excuse.</p>

<p>4. Required steps to be taken by the IDSP</p>

<p>4.1 The IDSP must take all reasonable steps to check the validity of the document and take all reasonable steps to verify the prospective employee is the rightful holder of the document. The IDSP must also record in a format that cannot subsequently be altered the date on which the check was carried out.</p>

<p>4.2 For each identity verified by the IDSP using IDVT, the following information must be obtained during the check. This must be provided to the employer (relying party) in a clear, legible format which cannot be altered, and must be stored securely by the relying party in electronic or hard copy for audit and investigation purposes:</p>

<p>5. Required steps to be taken by the employer</p>

<p>5.1 Where an IDSP is used, employers retain obligations that they must comply with under the RTW Scheme. The employer needs to complete the following steps before employment commences to ensure a prescribed check has been undertaken, in order to establish a statutory excuse.</p>

<p>· Use an IDSP to check a prospective employee’s valid British or Irish passport (or Irish passport card) using IDVT.</p>

<p>· Obtain an output of the IDVT identity check from the IDSP containing a copy of the IDVT identity check, and the document checked, in a clear, legible format that cannot be altered.</p>

<p>· Carry out their own due diligence to satisfy themselves to a reasonable belief that their chosen IDSP has completed the check correctly in the prescribed manner.</p>

<p>· Satisfy themselves that the photograph and biographic details (for example, date of birth) on the output from the IDVT identity check are consistent with the individual presenting themselves for work (i.e. the information provided by the check relates to the individual and they are not an imposter).</p>

<p>· Where names differ between documents, the employer must establish why this is the case and must not employ that individual unless they are satisfied that the documents relate to them. A statutory excuse will not be obtained where it is reasonably apparent that the prospective employee is not the individual linked to the identity which was verified by the IDSP.</p>

<p>· Employers must retain this information securely for the duration of employment and for a further two years after the employment has ended. The copy must then be securely destroyed.</p>

<p>The following parts of this guidance set out various recommendations in addition to the requirements set out above.</p>

<p>6. Verifying identities IDSPs</p>

<p>6.1 This guidance recommends that, in order for an IDSP to carry out an identity check, the IDSP should undertake identity verification following GPG45. Verifying an individual’s identity following GPG45 requires IDSPs to follow a process known as ‘identity checking’. This process is made up of 5 parts:</p>

<p>· get evidence of the claimed identity</p>

<p>· check the evidence is genuine or valid</p>

<p>· check the claimed identity has existed over time</p>

<p>· check if the claimed identity is at high risk of identity fraud</p>

<p>· check that the identity belongs to the person who’s claiming it</p>

<p>6.2 Each step of the process is scored, and these scores are used to determine what Level of Confidence (LoC) has been achieved.</p>

<p>7. Identity profiles</p>

<p>7.1 There are several ways to combine the scores for each part of the</p>

<p>identity checking process. These combinations are known as identity profiles.</p>

<p>GPG45 has four LoCs. IDSPs can carry out digital identity verification to a range of standards or levels of confidence. The Home Office recommends that employers only accept checks via an IDSP that satisfy a minimum of a Medium Level of Confidence.</p>

<p>7.2 This is the minimum LoC recommended for RTW checks. Employers may choose an IDSP who proofs individuals to a higher LoC (i.e. in employment situations, where there may be a requirement for a Standard, Enhanced, or Enhanced with Barred Lists DBS check) if their business needs require, but this is not needed for the purposes of undertaking eligibility checks for RTW.</p>

<p>7.3 An activity history or identity fraud check is not required to meet some identity profiles. The Home Office recommends, where possible, an identity fraud check is undertaken on the claimed identity for all profiles, including those where GPG45 profile does not require it.</p>

<p>7.4 GPG45 treats all profiles within a level of confidence as being equal. The Home Office recommends that the strongest piece of evidence available is used to prove the identity exists, such as a passport, and the strongest method of matching the individual to this evidence.</p>

<p>8. OPM for identity verification</p>

<p>8.1 The OPM (available at <a class="govuk-link" href="#AppendixA">Appendix A</a> details how IDSPs can complete identity verification to the recommended LoC, in relation to GPG45.</p>

<p>9. Certification and audit of IDSPs</p>

<p>9.1 Whilst it is not mandatory for employers to use a certified IDSP for the purposes of right to work checks, the Home Office recommends employers use a certified IDSP. This will provide assurance that their chosen IDSP has been independently assessed as being capable of providing ID verification services in accordance with this guidance and the standards set out in the trust framework. However, as set out above and regardless of whether or not the IDSP is certified, the responsibility for the check remains with the employer, and they must ensure the IDSP they select to complete the identity verification element of the check carries out a prescribed check prior to the commencement of employment.</p>

<p>9.2 The UKDIATF is currently in a first stage industry prototype (or ‘alpha’) and will not move to the live phase until post-legislation, when parliamentary time allows. In the interim, IDSPs who choose to become certified, will be certified against the most current version of the UKDIATF available (alpha or beta) at the time of the certification process commencing. Once certified, IDSPs will be required to undertake annual surveillance audits and biennial recertification against the version of the UKDIATF which is current at the time.</p>

<p>9.3 All IDSPs who choose to become certified to carry out RTW checks on behalf of employers will be required to become certified to the live version of the UKDIATF after their certification has expired. It is recommended that IDSPs monitor and feedback on the UKDIATF as it develops to ensure they can meet any additional requirements which are not part of the RTW Scheme checks during the UKDIATF alpha and beta phases.</p>

<p>9.4 In addition to this guidance, an Operational Procedures Manual (OPM) is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="#AppendixA">Appendix A</a> for IDSPs. The OPM provides additional guidance around how to verify an individual’s identity, alongside how GPG45 should be used to meet government guidance for digital identity verification.</p>

<p>9.5 IDSPs who choose to become certified will be certified by an independent certification body to assure that they are capable of providing identity verification services in accordance with this guidance and meet the standards set out in the UKDIATF. Further information about the certification bodies available to certify IDSPs can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukas.com/resources/latest-news/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-pilot/" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>9.6 This guidance recommends that, in order for an IDSP to carry out an identity check, the IDSP should undertake identity verification following GPG45. The Home Office has adopted specific profiles of GPG45 as the basis of this guidance for IDSPs carrying out RTW checks. This guidance is consistent with the standards set out in the UKDIATF.</p>

<p>9.7 Therefore, IDSPs that are certified and assessed to meet the terms of the UKDIATF, and whose certification includes those specific profiles, will be able to demonstrate to employers that they are capable of complying with this guidance.</p>

<p>9.8 Certified IDSPs carrying out identity verification for RTW checks must be:</p>

<p>9.8.1 certified they are aware of the purpose of the checks (i.e. to demonstrate they know that the identity checking is to determine eligibility to work in the UK. IDSPs must be aware and acknowledge the sanctions and criminal offences that supplement the RTW Scheme and identity checking in the event of non-compliance.</p>

<p>9.8.2 certified that the requirements in 9.8.1 are also met by ensuring appropriate training of their employees and members of staff involved in the identity checking process, with appropriate records maintained of such training.</p>

<p>9.8.3 certified to demonstrate the information security requirements in section 10.1 – 10.2 are met.</p>

<p>9.8.4 certified to demonstrate the identity assurance requirements in 11.1 – 11.3 are met.</p>

<p>10. Certified against industry standards for information security</p>

<p>10.1 Certified IDSPs must have appropriate information security management systems in place to look after people’s data and keep it secure.</p>

<p>10.2 They must be certified to confirm that they meet an industry standard for information security management. This involves demonstrating that they have adequate processes in place to look after information securely and safely, and how they set up, maintain, and continuously improve an information security management system (ISMS). The ISMS must meet the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html" rel="external">ISO/IEC 27001:2013</a>  or another recognised standard that includes all the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.</p>

<p>11. Certified against government standards for identity assurance</p>

<p>11.1 Certified companies also have to be certified by an independent certification body, to assure that their service meets recommended Home Office standards for identity assurance.</p>

<p>11.2 The service auditors are accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) for carrying out service assessments.</p>

<p>11.3 Certification will confirm the IDSP meets the recommended standards set out in this guidance, for example, that they have reached a medium level of confidence and identify profiles required.</p>

<h3>Appendix A</h3>

<h4>Right to Work Scheme digital identity operational procedures manual (OPM)</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction</li>
</ol>

<p>1.1 This OPM provides additional guidance for identity service providers (IDSPs) to undertake identity verification, on behalf of employers for the purposes of verifying an individual’s identity, as part of a right to work (RTW) check.</p>

<p>1.2 This OPM references the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK digital identity and attributes trust framework</a>  (UKDIATF) and the Government Good Practice Guide 45 (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual">GPG45</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual">)</a>.</p>

<p>1.3 Therefore, the UKDIATF and GPG45 should be followed as normal unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>2. Verifying identities</p>

<p>2.1 This section should be read with reference to the guidance in Annex D above.</p>

<h4>Choosing an identity profile</h4>

<p>2.2 GPG45 treats all profiles within a Level of Confidence (LoC) as being equal. Home Office recommends that the strongest piece of evidence available is used to prove the identity exists (for example, a valid passport), and the strongest method of matching the individual to this evidence.</p>

<h4>Medium level of confidence</h4>

<p>2.3 To achieve a ‘medium’ level of confidence, the following profiles can be used. A single document is acceptable using digital means, as long as it meets the strength, validity, and verification scores detailed below.</p>

<p>2.4 Profiles marked as ‘M1’ only require a single high-strength document. Profiles marked as ‘M2’ require two documents - the second document is only checked for ‘Strength’ and ‘Genuine / Valid’. Profiles marked ‘M3A’ require three documents.</p>

<p>2.5 Although some identity profiles do not require an activity history or identity fraud check to be completed, the Home Office recommends, where possible, an identity fraud check is undertaken on the claimed identity for all profiles, including those where GPG45 profile does not require it.</p>

<p>3. Scoring identity evidence</p>

<p>3.1 GPG45 provides a detailed explanation of how identity evidence is scored. This document details specific guidelines applicable to Home Office RTW check requirements. Home Office guidance may restrict how evidence is scored or may provide additional guidance where it is considered that GPG45 does not provide sufficient clarity to enable IDSPs to operate as Home Office intends.</p>

<p>3.2 Where an IDSP is certified, they will be certified against the current published version of UKDIATF and GPG45 in full and must, therefore, refer to the published versions of both UKDIATF and GPG45.</p>

<p>3.3 IDSPs applying to become certified will be required to undergo a specific audit and certification.</p>

<p>3.4 In so doing, IDSPs must be certified by an independent certification body. The service auditors are accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) for carrying out service assessments. Certification will confirm the IDSP has been independently assessed as being capable of providing ID verification services in accordance with this guidance and the standards set out in the UKDIATF.</p>

<p>3.5 The following information provides additional clarity to enable IDSPs to operate as Home Office intends. Please note, headings correlate to those within GPG45.</p>

<h4>Get evidence of the claimed identity:</h4>

<p>3.6 No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<h4>If the user has changed their name:</h4>

<p>3.7 No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<h4>Scoring evidence of the claimed identity:</h4>

<p>3.8 Score 1</p>

<p>Evidence that only score 1 are not acceptable.</p>

<p>3.9 Score 2</p>

<p>No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<p>3.10 Score 3</p>

<p>No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<p>3.11 Score 4</p>

<p>No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<h4>Check the evidence is genuine or valid:</h4>

<p>3.12 Score 1</p>

<p>Evidence that only score 1 are not acceptable.</p>

<p>3.13 Score 2</p>

<p>Detailed below are some clarifications to the GPG45 requirements and a number of examples.</p>

<p>If the evidence is being checked by a person, they must:</p>

<p>· be trained in how to detect false documents by a specialist trainer; evidence of the trainer’s specialist capability will be required to be presented to the certification auditor</p>

<p>· refresh their training at least every 3 years</p>

<p>All other requirements are as documented in GPG45.</p>

<p>3.14 Score 3</p>

<p>The requirement to confirm any physical security features are genuine and assess UV or IR security features is for physical, in person checks only.</p>

<p>Any evidence protected by cryptographic security features will have a score of 3 if it is ensured that these security features are genuine. Therefore, for a mobile-based automated process, mobile chip checking capability must be used to obtain a minimum score of 3.</p>

<p>All requirements are as documented in GPG45.</p>

<p>3.15 Score 4</p>

<p>All requirements are as documented in GPG45.</p>

<h4>Document validation technology:</h4>

<p>3.16 Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-document-validation-technology/identification-document-validation-technology#why-use-idvts">Identity Document Validation Technology guidance</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-document-validation-technology/identification-document-validation-technology#why-use-idvts">.</a></p>

<h4>Check the claimed identity has existed over time – activity history</h4>

<p>3.17 No amended or supplementary requirements to GPG45.</p>

<h4>Check if the claimed identity is at higher risk of identity fraud</h4>

<p>3.18 The Home Office recommends an identity fraud check is undertaken on the claimed identity for all profiles, including those where GPG45 profile does not require it.</p>

<h4>Check that the identity belongs to the person who’s claiming</h4>

<p>3.19 The Home Office recommends the highest-strength identity document available is used to prove the identity belongs to the individual claiming it.</p>

<p>This means that biometric verification of an individual should be used where documents containing biometric information have been used to prove the identity is real. Sources such as digital authentication of bank accounts as verification of identity are preferred to knowledge-based verification (KBV) as they present a simpler user journey and are less susceptible to user error. All other requirements are as documented in GPG45.</p>

<h3>Appendix B</h3>

<h3>Glossary</h3>

<p>4.1 Certification</p>

<p>Is when an independent auditor checks that organisations follow the rules of the trust framework.</p>

<p>Independent certification builds trust that approved IDSPs will protect an individual’s privacy and keep their data safe and secure.</p>

<p>Certification will be undertaken by an independent certification body to assure their service is capable of providing ID verification services in accordance with this guidance and the standards set out in the UKDIATF.</p>

<p>4.2 Disclosure and Barring Service</p>

<p>The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS delivers disclosure and barring functions on behalf of government. This includes DBS checks for England, Wales, Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man, and barring functions for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. More information about DBS and their work to make recruitment safer can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dbs">DBS</a>  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dbs">website</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dbs">.</a></p>

<p>4.3 Enhanced DBS check/certificate</p>

<p>An Enhanced DBS certificate is a DBS product that shows spent and unspent convictions, cautions plus any information held by local police that is considered relevant to the role being applied for.</p>

<p>4.4 Enhanced with Barred Lists DBS check/certificate</p>

<p>An Enhanced with Barred Lists DBS certificate is a DBS product that shows the same as an Enhanced DBS certificate, alongside whether the applicant is on the Adults’ Barred List, Children’s Barred List, or both.</p>

<p>4.5 Good Practice Guide 45</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual">The Good Practice Guide 45 (GPG45)</a>  is the government standard for identity verification, against which IDSPs will be certified.</p>

<p>4.6 Identity profile</p>

<p>GPG45 has four levels of confidence in terms of proof of identity. These are:</p>

<p>· low confidence</p>

<p>· medium confidence</p>

<p>· high confidence</p>

<p>· very high confidence</p>

<p>This guidance document refers to medium confidence and high confidence only.</p>

<p>There are several ways to combine the scores you get for each part of the identity checking process. These combinations are known as ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual/identity-profiles">identity profiles</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual/identity-profiles">’</a>.</p>

<p>4.7 Identity service providers</p>

<p>An identity service provider (IDSP) is a provider of identity verification services. In the context of this Home Office guidance document, they may be certified to provide identity verification to specific levels of confidence, specified by government standards. IDSPs are sometimes referred to as ‘identity providers’.</p>

<p>4.8 Identity verification</p>

<p>Identity verification (IDV) refers to the process of proving that an identity exists and that the individual making the claim is the owner of the identity.</p>

<p>4.9 Level of confidence</p>

<p>Completion of the identity proofing process will result in a proof that has a ‘level of confidence’ (LoC). The higher the LoC, the stronger the evidence required to support that LoC. The evidence needed to achieve an LoC is defined within GPG45.</p>

<p>4.10 Operational procedures manual</p>

<p>The operational procedures manual (OPM) is a document that provides detailed procedures for IDSPs to meet the Home Office guidance. The OPM aims to aid interpretation of GPG45, to allow IDSPs to develop solutions with certainty and provide a simple reference for auditors to certify against.</p>

<p>4.11 Relying party</p>

<p>The role of relying party is defined in the UKDIATF as an organisation that receives, interprets, and, depending on the use case, stores information received from other trust framework organisations. Relying parties do not need to be certified against the UKDIATF. The employer is the relying party when a right to work (RTW) check is carried out.</p>

<p>4.12 Standard DBS check/certificate</p>

<p>A Standard DBS certificate is a product of DBS that shows spent and unspent convictions, cautions.</p>

<p>4.13 UK digital identity and attributes trust framework</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK digital identity and attributes trust framework</a>  (UKDIATF) is being implemented by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, and will be backed by legislation to enable the legal development of digital ID services. This guidance is being created in line with the UKDIATF.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Annex E: Extension to COVID-19 temporary adjusted right to work checks</h2>

<p>From 6 April 2022, employers will be able to use Identification Document Validation Technology (IDVT) to carry out digital checks on behalf of British and Irish citizens who hold a valid passport (or Irish passport card).</p>

<p>Following the positive feedback, we have received about this development, we have decided to defer the end date for adjusted checks to 30 September 2022. This will ensure employers have sufficient time to develop commercial relationships with identity service providers, make the necessary changes to their pre-employment checking processes and carry out responsible on-boarding of their chosen provider.</p>

<p>Deferring the end date of the adjusted checks to 30 September 2022 ensures the Right to Work Scheme continues to operate in a manner which supports employers to implement long-term, post-pandemic working practices.  It also provides opportunity for employers to put measures in place to enable face to face document checks if they do not wish to adopt digital checks for British and Irish citizens with a valid passport (or Irish passport card).</p>

<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries have advised that their expired passports should be considered as valid for an extended period of time. Where an individual is required to present you with a current passport or travel document endorsed to show that the holder is allowed to stay in the UK for a ‘time-limited period’ and the immigration permission is in a recently expired passport then you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employee-immigration-employment-status">Employer Checking Service</a>, to verify their status and obtain a defence against a civil penalty.</p>

<p>You must make a copy of their expired passport and endorsement and retain this with the response from the ECS to have a statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty.</p>

<p>Information on how to carry out these temporary adjusted checks is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-right-to-work-checks">Coronavirus (COVID</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-right-to-work-checks">-</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-right-to-work-checks">19): right to work checks</a> on GOV.UK. This page will be updated with any changes to the temporary measures.</p>

<p>It remains an offence to knowingly employ a person who is not lawfully in the UK.</p>

<p>You do not need to carry out retrospective checks on employees who had a COVID-19 adjusted check between 30 March 2020 and 30 September 2022 (inclusive). You will maintain a defence against a civil penalty if the check you have undertaken during this period was done in the prescribed manner or as set out in the COVID-19 adjusted checks guidance. However, any individual identified with no lawful immigration status in the UK may be liable to enforcement action.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Annex F: Employment of Ukrainian nationals</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In response to the evolving conflict in Ukraine, the Home Office has introduced visa schemes to support Ukrainian nationals, and their family members, to come to the UK.</p>

<p>Those who are granted a visa under these schemes are able to work, rent a home, and access public services, such as medical treatment and education.</p>

<p>On 14 February 2022, the Government announced changes to make it easier for dependants of British citizens who were resident in Ukraine to apply for a Standard Family Visa, including waiving application fees. Successful applications resulted in the person being issued with a visa in their passport. The visa allows travel to the UK, where they then collect a Biometric Residence Permit (BRP).</p>

<p>If the requirements for a Standard Family Visa were not met, then a visa could be issued stating Leave Outside the Rules (LOTR). This allowed for travel to the UK where a BRP would be available to collect. On 1 March 2022, the scheme was extended to include family members who were not living in the Ukraine as a family unit.</p>

<h3>The Ukraine Schemes</h3>

<p>On 4 March 2022, the Government launched the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa">Ukraine Family Scheme</a>, and the Standard Family Visa concession closed. The Ukraine Family Scheme allows immediate and extended family members of British Nationals and people settled in the UK to come to the country. Applicants must be applying to join or accompany their UK-based family member; must be Ukrainian or the immediate family member of a Ukrainian national who is applying to the Scheme; and must have been residing in Ukraine on or immediately before 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>On 18 March, the Government also launched the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/register-interest-homes-ukraine">Homes for Ukraine Scheme</a>. This scheme enables Ukrainian Nationals (with immediate family members who can be non-Ukrainian nationals), to be sponsored by UK residents, where those residents have suitable accommodation, for at least six months and have at least six months’ leave to be in the UK.</p>

<p>Both schemes are fee free and do not include salary or language requirements for applicants.</p>

<p>Under both schemes, successful applicants are able to stay in the UK for up to three years.</p>

<p>In each scheme individuals are able to work and access benefits in the UK.</p>

<h3>Ukrainians with a valid Ukrainian Passport</h3>

<p>A concession to the Ukraine Schemes was introduced on 15 March 2022, which allows those with a valid Ukraine passport to submit an application to either Scheme without attending an overseas Visa Application Centre (VAC) to submit biometrics. Those who are assessed without submitting their biometrics are issued with a permission to travel letter.</p>

<p>On arrival, Border Force stamp the passport with permission to enter the UK, valid for six months with no restrictions on taking employment or recourse to public funds – Leave Outside the Rules (LOTR). This is a Code 1A or Amended Code 1 endorsement.</p>

<p>Where Border Force have granted LOTR for six months, the individual will need to obtain a Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) which will be endorsed with up to 36-month permission to stay. This can be done at any point during the six-months validity of the stamp.</p>

<p>Those with a stamp or a visa in their valid Ukrainian passport, granting permission to stay under the Ukrainian Schemes, have a time-limited right to work. If an employer manually checks this document as outlined in this guidance and records it correctly, this will give them a time-limited statutory excuse. These endorsements are already included in the acceptable documents for a manual check under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1060294/DRAFT_Employer_s_Guide_to_Right_to_Work_Checks.pdf" rel="external">Annex A of the Employers Guide</a>, List B, Group 1, Number 1.</p>

<p>Employers will need to carry out a follow-up check of those individuals who have time-limited permission to work in the UK. This should occur when their previous permission comes to an end. All Ukrainian nationals arriving under the Schemes should obtain a BRP granting them up to 3 years (36 months) leave. BRP holders will need to use the Home Office online checking service as set out in this guidance to prove their right to work in the UK.</p>

<h3>Example Code 1A and Code 1 stamps, endorsed with an Immigration Officer’s date stamp</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Example Code 1A stamp" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148331/Code_1A_stamp_resized.png"></div></figure>

<p>In a small number of cases, when the Schemes went live, a Code 1A was not available, in place of this a Code 1 was used with the “no recourse to public funds” scored out in ink and possibly initialled by the Officer.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Example Code 1 stamp" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148333/Code_1_stamp_resized.png"></div></figure>

<p>Similarly, a Code1/Code 1A may have been endorsed in Ukrainian passports, if those individuals had entry stamps to Ireland from 25 February 2022 The stamps were manually amended from ‘Leave to enter’ to ‘Leave to remain’ possibly with the Officer’s initials.</p>

<p>There may be situations in which you identify an individual who has an Irish entry stamp in their passport but does not have a Code 1/Code 1A stamp and does not hold any other form of permission to stay in the UK. In these situations, you must point the individual to the Home Office to make an application to stay in the UK.</p>

<p>Any prospective employee who is a Ukrainian national, who has not applied for permission to stay in the UK, will not have a right to work. This means you should not employ them until they have taken action to regularise their status in the UK.</p>

<h3>Example Ukraine Scheme Entry Clearance Vignette / Visa</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Example Ukraine Scheme Entry Clearance Vignette / Visa" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148334/Example_Ukraine_Scheme_Entry_Clearance_Vignette_Visa_resized.png"></div></figure>

<h3>Ukrainian nationals who do not have a valid Ukrainian passport</h3>

<p>If an individual does not have a valid Ukrainian passport, they will be required to provide their biometric information at a VAC and will then be provided with an entry clearance vignette attached to a ‘Form for Affixing the Visa’ (FAV). Shortly after arrival, a BRP is available for collection, and this can be used to access the Home Office online checking service as set out in guidance to prove a right to work. Where necessary, individuals can use their FAV document as proof of their right to work, in conjunction with confirmation from the Home Office Employer Checking Service (ECS) in the form of a Positive Verification Notice (PVN).</p>

<p>Therefore, once an individual with an entry clearance vignette attached to a FAV is in the UK, they are expected to collect their BRP urgently, which can be used for right to work checks as normal, and a statutory excuse obtained for the full period of permission to stay. This means, once they have collected their BRP employers are not required to make a check with the ECS. Where employers contact the ECS and Home Office systems show that the individual has a BRP available, employers will receive a response from the ECS directing them to advise the individual to collect their BRP and prove their right to work using the Home Office online checking service. In this scenario ECS will not issue a PVN to provide a statutory excuse and employers should use the online checking service.</p>
