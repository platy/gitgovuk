<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Background</h2>

<p>For over two decades systems such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and Galileo have been used for commercial and military positioning and navigation. In recent years further satellite constellations have been added and these Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide reliable, accurate worldwide coverage.
However, all these systems are vulnerable to Jamming and Spoofing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jamming is the presence of a competing signal that prevents the decoding of the true signal. This can be both intentional and unintentional</li>
  <li>Spoofing is the malicious transmission of false signals intended to divert users from their intended position</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other navigation and positioning technologies that can be considered to support GNSS navigation such as</p>

<ul>
  <li>Terrain Contour Matching (TERCOM) - use of radar altimeter and a digital terrain elevation database</li>
  <li>Digital Scene Matching (DSMAC) - matches an on board image to an imagery database</li>
  <li>Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) or Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) - rely on accurate measurements of velocity and time to calculate position.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have recently run an Innovation Focus Area looking at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/past-innovation-focus-areas/past-innovation-focus-areas#reducing-reliance-on-global-navigation-satellite-systems-quantum-augmented-position-navigation-and-timing-sensing-capability">Quantum Navigation systems</a> and several proposals have been selected for funding. Quantum technology is not specifically out of scope for this Market Exploration. However, we are specifically looking for technologies that could be developed to a testing and trialling prototype within the next 3 years.</p>

<p>This activity is part of a larger Technology Demonstration Programme</p>

<p>The document <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/market-exploration-alternative-navigation-for-weapon-systems/navigation-in-weapon-systems?preview=6364363" rel="external">Navigation in Weapon Systems</a> document contains further background information, and a generalised concept of operation. If you have any questions please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/market-exploration-alternative-navigation-for-weapon-systems/alternative-navigation-for-weapon-systems-clarifications?preview=6417808" rel="external">clarifications document</a> which will be used to compile answers to any questions received. If you still have a question please e-mail us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accelerator@dstl.gov.uk">accelerator@dstl.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What we want</h2>

<p>Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) and the Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) want to understand the range of technologies used for commercial positioning and navigation systems. The main area of interest is to know the location of the weapon during the mid course phase of deployment, as shown in the figure below, with an accuracy of ± 5 metres. Technology to guide to final target is not in scope for this Market Exploration.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Weapon deployment" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/141294/Background_3.png"></div></figure>

<p>The systems should</p>

<ul>
  <li>have sufficient accuracy to monitor and report on position during the mid course to within ± 5 metres</li>
  <li>currently be at a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance">Technology Readiness Level</a> of 4 or above in either a civilian or military application</li>
  <li>not have sole reliance on GNSS</li>
  <li>have the potential to be further developed to meet military specifications (expected to be level 6 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1050553/ESL2.odt" rel="external">Engineering Severity Level Matrix</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is envisaged that the information obtained in this Market Exploration will be reviewed to identify technology areas that may benefit from further investment and which may be the focus of a DASA competition to be held in the summer of 2022. Details of your submission will not be shared outside of UK Government.</p>

<p>The target of that competition would be to develop the existing technology and proceed to a subsequent Test and Trial phase. It should be appreciated that during the competition stages, successful suppliers will have to work with existing major suppliers of materiel and be comfortable working as part of the supply chain for intended applications within a UK procured weapon system.</p>

<p>We would be particularly interested in innovations from non-traditional defence suppliers and have a dedicated team of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-a-dasa-innovation-partner">DASA Innovation Partners</a> who can discuss your innovations and the defence sector with you.
Your submission will also help us identify your interests in this area, and, where appropriate, we can introduce you to your regional DASA Innovation Partner to discuss any future activity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What we don’t want</h2>

<p>At this stage, we are not interested in systems that calculate and plot trajectories or offer complete guidance systems.</p>

<p>Additionally, we are not interested in submissions from innovators who are not willing to work with existing suppliers of complex weapon systems, literature reviews, paper-based studies, consultancy or non-technical solutions.</p>

<p>This is not a competition, and therefore we are not asking for costed proposals at this stage. This is a market engagement request for information exercise and we do not commit to subsequently launch a formal DASA competition.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>How to submit a Market Exploration Submission to DASA</h2>

<p>Responses to this Market Exploration must be submitted via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/defence-and-security-accelerator-submit-your-research-proposal">DASA submission service</a>, for which you will need to register. We recommend you use a Google Chrome browser to access the DASA submission service.</p>

<p>You will be asked for a title and short summary of your technology, along with questions related to your organisation, your idea and technology maturity. The information you provide will assist in understanding the current technology and identify potential for a future competition.</p>

<p>Submissions must be submitted by Midday on April 7 2022. Unfortunately, we are unable to accept any submissions after this point.</p>

<p>Please provide details of only one product/capability per submission. If you have a number of potential solutions, then please submit multiple forms.</p>

<p>If you have any questions then please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accelerator@dstl.gov.uk">accelerator@dstl.gov.uk</a> with “Alternative Navigation for Weapon Systems” in the subject line.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>How we use your information</h2>

<p>Information you provide to us in a Market Exploration Submission, that is not already available to us from other sources, will be handled in confidence. By submitting a Market Exploration Submission you are giving us permission to keep and use the information for our internal purposes, and to provide the information onwards, in-confidence, within UK Government. The Defence and Security Accelerator will not use or disclose the information for any other purpose, without first requesting permission to do so.</p>
