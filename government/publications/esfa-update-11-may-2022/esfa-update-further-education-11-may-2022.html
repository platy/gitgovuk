<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: apprenticeship training provider accountability framework 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>We have updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-training-provider-accountability-framework-20212022#quality-and-supplementary-indicators">apprenticeship accountability framework technical specification 2021 to 2022</a> to provide further information about the thresholds for off the job training (OTJT), achievement rates and retention rates that form part of the accountability framework.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-training-provider-accountability-framework-20212022">apprenticeship training provider accountability framework</a> came into force in September 2021. The Framework is a new, more timely approach to accountability for apprenticeship training providers, based on a wider range of quality metrics.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-training-provider-accountability-framework-20212022#quality-and-supplementary-indicators">apprenticeship accountability framework technical specification 2021 to 2022</a> outlines the quality indicators that form part of the apprenticeship accountability framework and how we will apply them for this first year. It has been updated to include information about the thresholds for OTJT, achievement rates and retention rates. In response to feedback from training providers, we have also amended the thresholds for withdrawals, learners past planned end date and breaks in learning for providers that fall into the “needs improvement” category.</p>

<p>The thresholds included in the framework are not targets for the apprenticeships programme and should not be used by providers as targets to benchmark their provision against. Instead, these thresholds reflect minimum expectations and will be used to inform any intervention actions we take in response to concerns about the quality of delivery at a provider. As such, the thresholds do not reflect our ambition to ensure that all apprenticeship provision is high quality and meets the needs of employers.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Information: promote adult numeracy courses on National Numeracy Day</h2>

<p>Next Wednesday, 18 May, is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/numeracyday?msclkid=74e6c539c00e11eca2270d9d7e24d68e&amp;es_c=CAF4F91FBEDD0211B84248D8CA72D9C3&amp;es_cl=6E3BA31F8F796CD329630FFE00AD7292&amp;es_id=9d%c2%a3o3" rel="external">National Numeracy Day</a>, run by the charity National Numeracy to encourage both adults and children to feel comfortable with numbers. This is a great opportunity to promote your adult numeracy courses across your networks. National Numeracy has lots of resources to help, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nationalnumeracy.org.uk/numeracyday/champion-sign?es_c=CAF4F91FBEDD0211B84248D8CA72D9C3&amp;es_cl=E0F3A1F8D50635D2C7C257CA621B1764&amp;es_id=9d%c2%a3o3" rel="external">sign up</a> to get your free digital pack of materials and resources.</p>

<p>For background, about half of the working-age population (17m) have the numeracy skills of a primary school child which can hold people back from having the confidence to get on in life and into work. Those who improve their numeracy skills are more likely to be in employment and have higher wages.</p>

<p>Many FE providers are likely to become involved in Improving adult numeracy through the recently launched <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/multiplying-maths-skills-for-adults?es_c=CAF4F91FBEDD0211B84248D8CA72D9C3&amp;es_cl=539FF4D05BF9A6FD5B10BEEB3E83E236&amp;es_id=9d%c2%a3o3">Multiply</a> programme. Backed by £559m across the UK, Multiply will offer adults who do not already have a GCSE grade C/4 or higher in Maths or equivalent, and need to improve their numeracy, free flexible courses that fit around their lives. Upper-tier local authorities recently received a prospectus and funding allocation to specify Multiply courses in their areas, which are expected to start going live in the autumn.</p>

<span class="number">6. </span>Information: sustainability and climate change strategy published</h2>

<p>The Department for Education (DfE) has launched its sustainability and climate change strategy, which aims to empower pupils and educators to fight climate change.</p>

<p>Key action areas include increasing opportunities for young people to learn from and connect with nature, driving climate education and green skills, decarbonising school buildings and making them more climate resilient, and increasing the sustainability of operations and supply chains in education settings.</p>

<p>We will share best practice and advice to help education settings reduce carbon emissions, improve sustainability and resilience, and incorporate a holistic approach to sustainability overall. We will support education settings to put in place climate action plans and will roll out carbon literacy training for at least one person in every locally maintained nursery, state-funded school, and college.</p>

<p>We will support the further and higher education sectors as they deliver programmes teaching the skills of the future and provide support and guidance for green careers.</p>
