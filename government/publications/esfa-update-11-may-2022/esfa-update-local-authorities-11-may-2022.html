<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: sustainability and climate change strategy published</h2>

<p>DfE has launched its sustainability and climate change strategy to empower children, young people and those working in education to fight climate change.</p>

<p>Key action areas include increasing opportunities for young people to learn from and connect with nature, driving climate education and green skills, decarbonising school buildings and making them more climate resilient, and increasing the sustainability of operations and supply chains in education settings.</p>

<p>Measures include the introduction of a nominated sustainability lead in every education setting, and the roll out of carbon literacy training for at least one person in every locally maintained nursery, state-funded school, college, and university. We will also support initiatives to increase active and safe travel to school to improve wellbeing, reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Your feedback: complete this energy survey and help us to understand energy use in schools</h2>

<p>The current energy situation is challenging and many schools whose contract is due to expire over the coming months are trying to get the best value when renewing their contracts.</p>

<p>We are contacting all schools in England to get basic data on their current and future energy tariffs. Your answers will be used to help us to understand how schools will be affected by recent energy price increases so we can consider what additional support we can offer.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bit.ly/DfEEnergysurvey" rel="external">survey is open until 1 June 2022</a> and we would like to encourage as many schools as possible to respond.</p>
