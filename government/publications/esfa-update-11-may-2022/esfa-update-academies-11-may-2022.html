<span class="number">5. </span>Information: School Led Tutoring grant - part of the National Tutoring Programme</h2>

<p>It’s not too late to support pupils with the National Tutoring Programme (NTP). To find out how your school could benefit from tutoring, view our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/how-to-guide" rel="external">How to Guide</a> on the options available.</p>

<p>All pupils who have received tutoring through the School-Led Tutoring (SLT) route in academic year 2021 to 2022, up to and including the census day, must be recorded on the summer school census on Thursday 19 May.</p>

<p>The deadline for approved census submissions is Wednesday 15 June. If a pupil is planning to receive SLT but has not started by the census day, then this should be recorded as not having received tuition. This will not affect any future funding payments.</p>

<p>Find out more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/complete-the-school-census">how to complete the School Census</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: sustainability and climate change strategy published</h2>

<p>DfE has launched its sustainability and climate change strategy, which aims to empower pupils and those working in education to fight climate change.</p>

<p>Key action areas include increasing opportunities for young people to learn from and connect with nature, driving climate education and green skills, decarbonising school buildings and making them more climate resilient, and increasing the sustainability of operations and supply chains in education settings.</p>

<p>The strategy sets out measures to support teaching about climate change, ensuring that all new DfE-tendered CPD material will include content on sustainability, where it is relevant to the subject area. We will develop a Primary Science Model Curriculum that includes an emphasis on nature and ensure that sustainability and climate change is included in science teacher’s CPD, ensuring that all young people receive high-quality teaching on climate change.</p>

<p>We will share best practice and advice to help settings reduce carbon emissions, improve sustainability and resilience, and incorporate holistic approaches to sustainability overall. We will support educations settings to implement climate action plans and will roll out carbon literacy training for at least one person in every locally maintained nursery, state-funded school, and college.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Your feedback: complete this energy survey and help us to understand energy use in schools</h2>

<p>The current energy situation is challenging and many schools whose contract is due to expire over the coming months are trying to get the best value when renewing their contracts.</p>

<p>We are contacting all schools in England to get basic data on their current and future energy tariffs. Your answers will be used to help us to understand how schools will be affected by recent energy price increases so we can consider what additional support we can offer.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bit.ly/DfEEnergysurvey" rel="external">survey is open until 1 June 2022</a> and we would like to encourage as many schools as possible to respond.</p>
