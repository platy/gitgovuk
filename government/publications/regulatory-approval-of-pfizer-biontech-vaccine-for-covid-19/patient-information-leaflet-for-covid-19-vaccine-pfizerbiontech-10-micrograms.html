<h1>Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection, Children 5 to 11 years, COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) tozinameran</h1>

<p>This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects your child may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.</p>

<h3>Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.</li>
  <li>If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</li>
  <li>If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.</li>
</ul>

  <li>What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">1.What </span> Comirnaty is and what it is used for</h2>
<p>Comirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>

<p>Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is given to children from 5 to 11 years of age.</p>

<p>The vaccine causes the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.</p>

<p>As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give your child COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2.What </span> you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty</h2>

<h3>Comirnaty should not be given</h3>
<ul>
  <li>if your child is allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Warnings and precautions</h3>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before your child is given the vaccine if your child:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after having been given Comirnaty in the past.</li>
  <li>is feeling nervous about the vaccination process or has ever fainted following any needle injection.</li>
  <li>has a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, your child can have the vaccination if he/she have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.</li>
  <li>has a bleeding problem, bruises easily or uses a medicine to prevent blood-clots.</li>
  <li>has a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects the immune system.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days.  They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.</p>

<p>As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.</p>

<p>Your child may receive a third dose of Comirnaty. The third dose may still not provide full immunity to COVID-19 in people who are immunocompromised. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>
<p>Comirnaty is not recommended for children aged under 5 years.</p>

<h3>Other medicines and Comirnaty</h3>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is using, has recently used or might use any other medicines or has recently received any other vaccine.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</h3>
<p>If your child is pregnant or breast-feeding, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before your child receives this vaccine.</p>

<h3>Driving and using machines</h3>
<p>Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to use machines or undertake activities such as cycling. Wait until these effects have worn off before resuming activities that require your full attention.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3.How </span> Comirnaty is given</h2>
<p>Comirnaty is given after dilution as an injection of 0.2 mL into a muscle of the upper arm.</p>

<p>Your child will receive 2 injections.</p>

<p>It is recommended to receive the second dose of the same vaccine 3 weeks after the first dose to complete the vaccination course.</p>

<p>If your child is immunocompromised, he or she may receive a third dose of Comirnaty at least 28 days after the second dose.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>
