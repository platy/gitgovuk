<h2>Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified) tozinameran</h2>

<p>This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.</p>

<h2>Package leaflet: Information for the recipient</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you</li>
  <li>Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.</li>
  <li>If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</li>
  <li>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.</li>

  <li>What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty</li>

  <li>Possible side effects</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> What Comirnaty is and what it is used for</h2>
<p>Comirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>

<p>Comirnaty is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older.</p>

<p>The vaccine causes the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.</p>

<p>As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty</h2>

<p>Comirnaty should not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)</p>

<h4>Warnings and precautions</h4>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given Comirnaty in the past.</li>
  <li>you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle
injection.</li>
  <li>you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold.</li>
  <li>you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood-clots.</li>
  <li>you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system</li>
</ul>

<p>Very rare cases of inflammation of the heart (myocarditis or pericarditis) have been reported following vaccination with Comirnaty. These have happened most often in younger men and shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. Most of these cases were mild and people recovered soon after with simple treatment and rest. 
It is important that you urgently seek medical attention if you experience new onset of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart.</p>

<p>As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.</p>

<p>You may receive a third dose of Comirnaty. The third dose may still not provide full immunity to COVID-19 in people who are immunocompromised. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor.</p>

<h4>Children</h4>
<p>Comirnaty is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.</p>

<h4>Other medicines and Comirnaty</h4>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.</p>

<h4>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</h4>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine.</p>

<p>Driving and using machines
Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines.</p>

<p>Comirnaty contains potassium and sodium
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘potassium-free’.</p>

<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium free’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How Comirnaty is given</h2>

<p>Comirnaty is given after dilution as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.</p>

<p>You will receive 2 injections.</p>

<p>It is recommended to receive the second dose of the same vaccine 3 weeks after the first dose to complete the vaccination course.</p>

<p>A booster dose (third dose) of Comirnaty may be given at least 6 months after the second dose in individuals 18 years of age and older.</p>

<p>If you are immunocompromised, you may receive a third dose of Comirnaty at least 28 days after the second dose.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> How to store Comirnaty</h2>
<p>Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children.</p>

<p>The following information about storage, expiry and use and handling is intended for healthcare professionals.</p>

<p>Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and label after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.</p>

<p>Store in freezer at -90 °C to -60 °C. Within the 9 month shelf-life unopened vials may be stored and transported at  25 °C to  15 °C for a single period of up to 2 weeks and can be returned to -90 °C to -60 °C.</p>

<p>Store in the original package in order to protect from light.</p>

<h4>Transfers of frozen vials stored at ultra-low temperature (&lt; -60 °C)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Closed-lid vial trays containing 195 vials removed from ultra-low temperature frozen storage (&lt; -60 °C) may be at temperatures up to 25 °C for up to 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Open-lid vial trays, or vial trays containing less than 195 vials, removed from ultra-low temperature frozen storage (&lt; -60 °C) may be at temperatures up to 25 °C for up to 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>After vial trays are returned to frozen storage following temperature exposure up to 25 °C, they must remain in frozen storage for at least 2 hours before they can be removed again.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Transfers of frozen vials stored at -25 °C to -15 °C</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Closed-lid vial trays containing 195 vials removed from frozen storage ( 25 °C to  15 °C) may be at temperatures up to 25 °C for up to 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Open-lid vial trays, or vial trays containing less than 195 vials, removed from frozen storage ( 25 °C to  15 °C) may be at temperatures up to 25 °C for up to 1 minute.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a vial is removed from the vial tray, it should be thawed for use.</p>

<p>After thawing, the vaccine should be diluted and used immediately. However, in-use stability data have demonstrated that once removed from freezer, the undiluted vaccine can be stored for up to 1 month  at 2 °C to 8 °C. Within the 1 month  shelf-life at 2 °C to 8 °C, up to 12 hours may be used for transportation. Prior to use, the unopened vaccine can be stored for up to 2 hours at temperatures up to 30°C.</p>

<p>After dilution, store and transport the vaccine at 2 °C to 30 °C and use within 6 hours. Discard any unused vaccine.</p>

<p>Once removed from the freezer and diluted, the vials should be marked with the new discard date and time. Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be re-frozen.</p>

<p>Do not use this vaccine if you notice particulates in the dilution or discolouration.</p>

<p>Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.</p>
