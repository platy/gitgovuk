<p>There are no data available on the interchangeability of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 with other COVID-19 vaccines to complete the vaccination series. Individuals who have received one dose of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should receive a second dose of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 to complete the vaccination series.</p>

<p>Individuals may not be maximally protected until at least 7 days after their second dose of the vaccine.</p>

<p><a href="#efficacy" class="govuk-link">For further information on efficacy, see section 5.1</a>.</p>

<h5>Paediatric population</h5>
<p>The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in children under 16 years of age have not yet been established.</p>

<h4>Method of administration</h4>
<p>Administer the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 vaccine intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle after dilution.</p>

<p>After dilution, vials of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 contain 6 doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 6 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.</li>
  <li>If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume.</li>
  <li>Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.</p>

<p>Preparation: The multidose vial is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to dilution</p>

<p>Frozen vials should be transferred to 2 Â°C to 8 Â°C to thaw. Alternatively, frozen vials may also be thawed and kept at temperatures up to 25 Â°C for a maximum of two hours in preparation for dilution for use.</p>

<p>When removed from the freezer, the undiluted vaccine has a maximum shelf life of up to 5 days (120 hours) at 2 Â°C to 8 Â°C, and and additional 2 hours at temperatures up to 25 Â°C in preparation for dilution.</p>

<p>When the thawed vial is at room temperature gently invert 10 times prior to dilution. Do not shake. Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous particles.</p>

<p>The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 1.8 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower needle and aseptic techniques.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Warning: Unpreserved sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is the only diluent that should be used. This diluent is not provided in the vaccine carton.</p>
</div>

<p>Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial by withdrawing 1.8 mL air into the empty diluent syringe.</p>

<p>Gently invert the diluted solution 10 times. Do not shake.</p>

<p>The diluted vaccine should present as an offwhite solution with no particulates visible. Discard the diluted vaccine if particulates or discolouration are present.</p>

<p>The diluted vials should be marked with the dilution date and time and stored between 2 Â°C to 25 Â°C.</p>

<p>Use as soon as practically possible, and within 6 hours after dilution.</p>

<p>After dilution, the vial contains 6 doses of 0.3 mL. Withdraw the required 0.3 mL dose of diluted vaccine using a sterile needle and syringe and administer.</p>

<p>Low dead volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 6 doses from a single vial.</p>

<p>If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial.</p>

<p>Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.</p>

<p>If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume.</p>

<p>Any unused vaccine should be discarded 6 hours after dilution.</p>

<p>After dilution, the vaccine should not be shipped (transported) by motor vehicle away from the site of dilution. Any shipping (transportation) by motor vehicle after dilution of the vial is at the risk of the Health Care Professional.</p>

<h4>Summary of safety profile</h4>
<p>The safety of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in two clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa, and South America. Study BNT162-01 (Study 1) enrolled 60 participants, 18 through 55 years of age. Study C4591001 (Study 2) enrolled approximately 44,000 participants, 12 years of age or older. In Study 2, a total of 21,720 participants 16 years of age or older received at least one dose of COVID19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b and 21,728 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo. Out of these, at the time of the analysis, 19,067 (9531 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 and 9536 placebo) were evaluated for safety 2 months after the second dose of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2.</p>

<p>Demographic characteristics were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race and ethnicity among participants who received COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the participants who received COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2, 51.5% were male and 48.5% were female, 82.1% were White, 9.6% were Black or African American, 26.1% were Hispanic/Latino, 4.3% were Asian and 0.7% were Native American/Alaskan native.</p>

<p>The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older were pain at the injection site (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 50%), myalgia (&gt; 30%), chills (&gt; 30%), arthralgia (&gt; 20%) and pyrexia (&gt; 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. If required, symptomatic treatment with analgesic and/or anti-pyretic medicinal products (e.g. paracetamol-containing products) may be used.</p>

<h4>Adverse reactions from clinical studies</h4>
<p>Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies are listed in this section per MedDRA system organ class, in decreasing order of frequency and seriousness. The frequency is defined as follows: very common (â¥ 1/10), common (â¥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (â¥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (â¥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000), very rare (&lt; 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).</p>

  <li>Uncommon: Malaise</li>
</ul>

<p>Gastrointestinal disorders</p>

<ul>
  <li>Common Nausea</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the safety follow-up period to date, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group.</p>

<h4>Post-authorisation reports of influenza-like illness</h4>
<p>Some recipients have reported chills, shivering (in some cases rigors), and increased body temperature possibly with sweating, headache (including migraine-like headaches), nausea, myalgia and malaise, starting within a day of vaccination. These effects usually last for a day or two.</p>

<p>If a patient reports unusually high and prolonged fever, or other persistent symptoms, alternative causes should be considered and appropriate advice should be provided for diagnostic investigation and medical management as required.</p>

<h4>Reporting of suspected adverse reactions</h4>
<p>If you are concerned about an adverse event, it should be reported on a Yellow card. Reporting forms and information can be found at <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site</a> or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard">Google Play</a>. When reporting please include the vaccine brand and batch/Lot number if available.</p>

<p>Alternatively, adverse events of concern in association with Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT 162b2 can be reported to Pfizer Medical Information on 01304 616161 or via <a href="www.pfizersafetyreporting.com" class="govuk-link">Pfizer Safety Reporting</a>.</p>

<p>Please do not report the same adverse event(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Pfizer and MHRA (in an anonymised form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> Overdose</h3>
<p>Participants who received 58 micrograms of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in clinical trials did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse events.</p>

<p>In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Pharmacodynamic properties</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Pharmacodynamic properties</h3>

<p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03</p>

<h4>Mechanism of action</h4>
<p>The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARSCoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19 disease.</p>

<h4>Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older</h4>
<p>The efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in two clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa and South America. Study 1 enrolled 60 participants, 18 through 55 years of age. Study 2 is a multicentre, placebo-controlled efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the â¥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). There was no requirement for prophylactic use of paracetamol or analgesics. Influenza vaccines could be administered outside a window Â± 14 days of the vaccine doses.</p>

<p>In Study 2, approximately 44,000 participants 12 years of age and older were randomised equally and received 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo with a planned interval of 21 days. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19 disease.</p>

<p>The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included, 36,621 participants 12 years of age and older (18,242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. Demographic characteristics were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race and ethnicity among participants who received COVID-19 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the participants who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, 51.1% were male and 48.9% were female, 82.8% were White, 8.9% were Black or African American, 26.8% were Hispanic/Latino, 4.5% were Asian and 0.6% were Native American/Alaskan native. 57.2% were aged 16-55 years, 42.6% were aged &gt; 55 years and 21.8% were â¥ 65 years.</p>

<h4>Efficacy against COVID-19 disease</h4>
<p>At the time of the analysis of Study 2, information presented is based on participants 16 years and older. Participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID-19 disease for at least 2,214 personyears for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and at least 2,222â¯personyears in the placebo group. There were 8 confirmed COVID-19 cases identified in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 162 cases in the placebo group, respectively. In this analysis, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in  preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 95.0% (95% credible interval of 90.3% to 97.6%) in participants 16â¯years of age and older without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. In participants 65 years of age and older and 75 years of age and older without evidence of prior infections with SARS-CoV-2, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 was 94.7% (two-sided 95% confidence interval of 66.7% to 99.9%) and 100% (two-sided 95% confidence interval of -13.1% to 100.0%) respectively.</p>

<p>In the second primary analysis, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2, compared to placebo was 94.6% (95% credible interval of 89.9% to 97.3%) in participants 16â¯years of age and older with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 disease including those with one or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease (e.g. asthma, BMI â¥â¯30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).</p>

<p>Confirmed cases were determined by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and at least 1 symptom consistent with COVID-19 disease.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Case definition (at least 1 of): fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of breath; chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhoea or vomiting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Preclinical safety data</h3>
<p>Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on a conventional study of repeat dose toxicity.</p>

<h4>Reproductive toxicity</h4>

<p>Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered with the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No data on the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span> Special precautions for disposal and other handling</h3>

<p>When removed from the freezer, the vaccine has a maximum possible shelf life of up to 5 days when stored at 2-8 ÂºC (label to be added once box removed from freezer). A 195 vial pack may take 3 hours to thaw at 2-8oC.</p>

<p>The product can alternatively be defrosted and kept for up to 2 hours at up to 25 ÂºC before being diluted for use. This facilitates immediate thaw and use when removed directly from the freezer to 25 ÂºC. In this instance the product is to be diluted within 2 hours of removing from the freezer.</p>

<p>Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be refrozen.</p>

<p>After dilution the vaccine should be used as soon as is practically possible and within 6 hours of dilution; it can be stored at 2-25 ÂºC during this period. From a microbiological point of view, it would not normally be considered good practice to store diluted product for 6 hours at 25ÂºC before being administered. The product would ideally be used as soon as practically possible after dilution.</p>

<p>The vaccine does not contain a preservative. Discard any unused vaccine</p>

<p>Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.</p>
