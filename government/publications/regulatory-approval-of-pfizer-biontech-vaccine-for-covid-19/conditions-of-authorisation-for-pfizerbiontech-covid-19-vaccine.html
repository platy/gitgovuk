      <li>Submit protocols for the studies stated in the BNT162b2 RMP pharmacovigilance plan</li>
      <li>Provide the interim analysis and final clinical study reports for study BNT162-01 once available, including data on healthy subjects</li>
      <li>Ensure that any participants in study c4591001 that choose to be unblinded and then have a COVID-19 vaccination if they are on placebo arm, should have an end of study visit including immunogenicity assessment (including anti-N antibodies) and also NAAT. This is to ensure that they have a complete status before they become unevaluable for the control arm.</li>
      <li>Provide 6-month safety follow-up data in subjects aged 12-15 years from study C4591001 once available.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>Pfizer/BioNTech has assured the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> that, in light of the UK and Crown Dependency deployment model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The product as supplied in ultra-low temperature conditions (<abbr title="ultra low temperature">ULT</abbr>) has a stability of nine months at a temperature of -70 +/- 10 degrees Centigrade.</li>
  <li>Distribution as part of the deployment can be controlled at either <abbr title="ultra low temperature">ULT</abbr> (-70 +/- 10 degrees Centigrade) within four transitions below -15 degrees Centigrade, or in 2-8 degrees Centigrade within 31 days of leaving <abbr title="ultra low temperature">ULT</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Further packing down of lots to aid deployment can occur at 2-8 degrees Centigrade within the 31 days shelf life of leaving <abbr title="ultra low temperature">ULT</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Within the 1month shelf-life at 2 °C to 8 °C, up to 12 hours may be used for transportation. Prior to use, the unopened vaccine can be stored for up to 2 hours at temperatures up to 30 °C.</li>
  <li>The undiluted product can be held at room temperature below 25 degrees Centigrade for up to two hours prior to dilution.</li>
  <li>The product can be diluted at room temperature less than 25 degrees Centigrade using sterile unpreserved 0.9 percent sodium chloride and in line with the healthcare professional information supplied by the company</li>
  <li>The diluted product can be used within 6 hours of dilution and then must be discarded. Diluted product cannot be transported.</li>
  <li>Any product with a thaw label already specifying 120 hours post <abbr title="ultra low temperature">ULT</abbr> may be extended to 31 days providing acceptable controls are in place to capture the extension activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a condition of the authorisation to supply the product that the above assurances are accurate and that the product can be supplied and held safely in accordance with the above assurances throughout the supply chain.</p>

<h3>Transfers of frozen vials stored at ultra-low temperature (below -60 degrees Centigrade)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Unopened closed-lid vial trays containing 195 vials removed from ultra-low temperature frozen storage (below -60 degrees Centigrade) may be at temperatures up to 25 degrees Centigrade for up to 5 minutes after which they may be returned to below -60 degrees Centigrade</li>
  <li>Open-lid vial trays, or vial trays containing less than 195 vials, removed from ultra-low temperature frozen storage (below -60 degrees Centigrade) may be at temperatures up to 25 degrees Centigrade for up to 3 minutes after which they may be resealed and returned to below -60 degrees Centigrade (with remaining number of vials recorded).</li>
  <li>After vial trays are returned to frozen storage following temperature exposure up to 25 degrees Centigrade, they must remain in frozen storage for at least 2 hours before they can be removed again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once an individual vial has been removed from the vial tray, it should be thawed for use.</p>

<h3>Handling of temperature excursions</h3>
<p>The additional stability information below is not intended to replace or override the recommended storage conditions set out in the Information for Health Care Professionals. Based on additional stability data submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, the following information can be used to inform decision making in the event of a temporary excursion from those recommended storage conditions.</p>

<h3>When considering the implications of temperature excursions whilst stored in the freezer:</h3>

<p>Data have been provided which support temperature excursion of -60 degrees Centigrade to -15 degrees Centigrade for up to 2 weeks. Following a single temperature excursion within these conditions, the vials may be returned one time to the recommended storage condition of -80 degrees Centigrade to -60 degrees Centigrade. Transfers of frozen vials that have been exposed to this excursion should be treated in the same way as vials stored at below -60 degrees Centigrade (see above).</p>

<h3>When considering the implications of temperature excursions once removed from the freezer:</h3>

<p>Vaccine in unopened vials has been found to be stable for up to 24 hours at temperatures from -3 degrees Centigrade to 2 degrees Centigrade. Data also indicates that a total storage time of 4 hours, at temperatures from 8 degrees C to 30 degrees Centigrade, does not adversely affect the stability of the vaccine. The total of 4 hours includes the 2 hours at up to 25 degrees Centigrade allowed in the Information for Health Care Professionals leaflet.</p>

<h2>Supply chain and distribution</h2>

<p>The deployment model developed for the distribution and administration of the product by the NHS in each of the four countries of the United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies should comply with the above conditions in order to ensure the safety, quality and efficacy of the product is not compromised. Where appropriate, the above assurances must be reflected in the conditions imposed on NHS contractors by NHS commissioners.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, the vaccines will be delivered to designated NHS bodies or NHS contractors that have capacity to hold the vaccines at ultra low temperatures, expected to be, but not necessarily, Movianto (in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland) and the Welsh Blood Service).</p>

<p>Thereafter, the NHS arrangements for the onward and (if different) final distribution of the products, and their final deployment, are still being developed, but the bodies responsible under NHS arrangements in each of the four countries for any aspect of the distribution or final deployment of the vaccine must comply, as conditions of this authorisation, with the conditions that are applicable to that aspect of the distribution or final deployment in this authorisation.</p>

<p>The bodies responsible for the transit of the product to the designated NHS bodies or NHS contractors in the UK from the manufacturer must also comply, as conditions of this authorisation, with the conditions of the authorisation that are applicable to them.</p>

<p>In addition:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All wholesalers and manufacturing license holders distributing or holding this product must be authorised to handle Regulation 174 products.</li>
  <li>All activities are to be conducted in accordance with good distribution practice (<abbr title="good distribution practice">GDP</abbr>).</li>
  <li>A manufacturing licence holder can pack down the authorised product without being named on the Company submission.</li>
  <li>Pack down prior to distribution must occur in accordance with good manufacturing practice (<abbr title="good manufacturing practice">GMP</abbr>) and requires <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification that it has occurred in accordance with <abbr title="good manufacturing practice">GMP</abbr> and the specification provided by the contract giver.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers and authorised persons performing the pack down activities must be authorised to handle regulation 174 products and immunological products.</li>
  <li>

Any guidance in respect of the packing down of the product under section 10 or regulation 3 or 3A published by the licensing authority on GOV.UK must be appropriately adhered to.</li>
  <li>Final preparation of the product for administration must take place in a manner and environment, and must be subject to NHS governance arrangements and standard operating procedures that ensure, the safety, quality or efficacy of the product is not compromised.
