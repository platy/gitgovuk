<p>This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1.Name </span> of the medicinal product</h2>

<p>Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified)</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2.Qualitative </span> and quantitative composition</h2>
<p>This is a multidose vial and must be diluted before use.</p>

<p>One vial (1.3 mL) contains 10 doses of 0.2 mL after dilution, see sections 4.2 and 6.6.</p>

<p>One dose (0.2 mL) contains 10 micrograms of tozinameran, a COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (embedded in lipid nanoparticles).</p>

<p>Tozinameran is a single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3.Pharmaceutical </span> form</h2>
<p>Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). The vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9 - 7.9).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4.Clinical </span> particulars</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Therapeutic indications</h3>
<p>Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in children aged 5 to 11 years.</p>

<p>The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Posology and method of administration</h3>

<h4>Posology</h4>

<h4>Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age)</h4>
<p>Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a course of 2 doses (0.2 mL each). It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).</p>

<p>The interchangeability of Comirnaty with COVID-19 vaccines from other manufacturers to complete the vaccination course has not been established. Individuals who have received 1 dose of Comirnaty should receive a second dose of Comirnaty to complete the vaccination course.</p>

<p>Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose should be used only for children 5 to 11 years of age.</p>

<h4>Severely immunocompromised aged 5 years and older</h4>
<p>A third dose may be given at least 28 days after the second dose to individuals who are severely immunocompromised (see section 4.4).</p>

<h4>Paediatric population</h4>
<p>The safety and efficacy of Comirnaty in paediatric children aged less than 5 years have not yet been established.</p>

<h4>Method of administration</h4>

<p>Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6).</p>

<p>After dilution, vials of Comirnaty contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. In order to extract 10 doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine.</li>
  <li>If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume.</li>
  <li>Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.</li>
</ul>

<p>The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</p>

<p>Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally.</p>

<p>The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.</p>

<p>For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.</p>

<p>For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Contraindications</h3>

<p>Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Special warnings and precautions for use</h3>

<h4>Traceability</h4>

<p>In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.</p>

<h4>General recommendations</h4>

<h4>Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis</h4>
<p>Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.</p>

<p>Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. A second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of Comirnaty.</p>

<h4>Myocarditis and pericarditis</h4>
<p>There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Comirnaty. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males (see section 4.8). Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.</p>

<p>Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination.</p>

<p>Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition.</p>

<p>The risk of myocarditis after a third dose of Comirnaty has not yet been characterised.</p>

<h4>Anxiety-related reactions</h4>
<p>Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, tingling sensations and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.</p>

<h4>Concurrent illness</h4>
<p>Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.</p>

<h4>Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders</h4>
<p>As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.</p>

<h4>Immunocompromised individuals</h4>
<p>The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.</p>

<p>The recommendation to consider a third dose in severely immunocompromised individuals is based on limited serological evidence from a case series in the literature from the clinical management of adult patients with iatrogenic immunocompromisation after solid organ transplantation (see section 4.2).</p>

<h4>Duration of protection</h4>
<p>The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.</p>

<h4>Limitations of vaccine effectiveness</h4>
<p>As with any vaccine, vaccination with Comirnaty may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their second dose of vaccine.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</h3>

<p>No interaction studies have been performed.</p>

<p>Concomitant administration of Comirnaty with other vaccines has not been studied.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</h3>

<h4>Pregnancy</h4>
<p>There is limited experience with use of Comirnaty in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Administration of Comirnaty in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.</p>

<h4>Breast-feeding</h4>
<p>It is unknown whether Comirnaty is excreted in human milk.</p>

<h4>Fertility</h4>
<p>Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span> Effects on ability to drive and use machines</h3>

<p>Comirnaty has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> Undesirable effects</h3>

<h4>Summary of safety profile</h4>

<p>The safety of Comirnaty was evaluated in participants 5 years of age and older in 3 clinical studies that included 24,675 participants (comprised of 22,026 participants 16 years of age and older, 1,131 adolescents 12 to 15 years of age, and 3,109 children 5 to 11 years of age) that have received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty.</p>

<p>The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in participants 5 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older.</p>

<p>Additionally, 306 existing Phase 3 participants 18 to 55 years of age received a booster dose (third dose) of Comirnaty approximately 6 months after the second dose. The overall safety profile for the booster dose (third dose) was similar to that seen after 2 doses.</p>

<h4>Children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after 2 doses</h4>
<p>In Study 3, a total of 1,518 children 5 to 11 years of age received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg and a total of 750 children 5 to 11 years of age received placebo. At the time of the analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 with data up to the cut-off date of 6 September 2021, 2,158 (95.1%) (1,444 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 714 placebo) children have been followed for at least 2 months after the second dose of Comirnaty 10 mcg. An analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 adverse event data also included another 2,379 participants [1,591 Comirnaty 10 mcg and 788 placebo], of whom 71.2% had a follow-up period for at least 2 weeks after Dose 2 up to the cut-off date of 8 October 2021. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing.</p>

<p>The most frequent adverse reactions in children 5 to 11 years of age were injection site pain (&gt;80%), fatigue (&gt;50%), headache (&gt;30%), injection site redness and swelling (&gt;20%), myalgia and chills (&gt;10%).</p>

<h4>Participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses</h4>
<p>In Study 2, a total of 22,026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of Comirnaty 30 mcg and a total of 22,021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20,519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of Comirnaty.</p>

<p>At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period up to the participants’ unblinding dates, a total of 25,651 (58.2%) participants (13,031 Comirnaty and 12,620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for ≥ 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15,111 (7,704 Comirnaty and 7,407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10,540 (5,327 Comirnaty and 5,213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older.</p>

<p>The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 50%), myalgia (&gt; 40%), chills (&gt; 30%), arthralgia (&gt; 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (&gt; 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.</p>

<p>The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving Comirnaty, that were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population.</p>

<h3>Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses</h3>
<p>In an analysis of Study 2, based on data up to the cutoff date of 13 March 2021, 2,260 adolescents (1,131 Comirnaty 30 mcg and 1,129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1,308 adolescents (660 Comirnaty and 648 placebo) have been followed for at least 2 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing.</p>

<p>The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (&gt; 90%), fatigue and headache (&gt; 70%), myalgia and chills (&gt; 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (&gt; 20%).</p>

<p>Participants 18 years of age and older – after booster dose (third dose)
A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose (third dose) of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2.</p>

<p>The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (&gt; 80%), fatigue (&gt; 60%), headache (&gt; 40%), myalgia (&gt; 30%), chills and arthralgia (&gt; 20%).</p>

<h4>Description of selected adverse reactions</h4>

<h4>Myocarditis</h4>
<p>The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4).</p>

<p>Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old males per 10,000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.57 [95% CI 0.39 – 0.75] extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males per 10,000 compared to unexposed persons.</p>

<h4>Reporting of suspected adverse reactions</h4>

<p>If you are concerned about an adverse event, it should be reported on a Yellow card. Reporting forms and information can be found at <a href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/</a> or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store. When reporting please include the vaccine brand and batch/Lot number if available.</p>

<p>Alternatively, adverse events of concern in association with Comirnaty can be reported to Pfizer Medical Information on 01304 616161 or via <a href="https://www.pfizersafetyreporting.com/#/en" rel="external" class="govuk-link">www.pfizersafetyreporting.com</a>.
Please do not report the same adverse event(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Pfizer and MHRA (in an anonymized form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> Overdose</h3>

<p>Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of Comirnaty. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions.</p>

<p>In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Pharmacological properties</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Pharmacodynamic properties</h3>

<p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03</p>

<h4>Mechanism of action</h4>

<p>The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.</p>

<h4>Efficacy</h4>

<p>Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind dose-finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥ 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).</p>

<h4>Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older – after 2 doses</h4>
<p>In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44,000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID 19 mRNA Vaccine.</p>

<p>The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36,621 participants 12 years of age and older (18,242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1,616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group).</p>

<p>At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID 19 for in total 2,214 person years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2,222 person years in the placebo group.</p>

<p>There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension).</p>

<p>The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 2.</p>

<h4>Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age – after 2 doses</h4>
<p>In an analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0).</p>

<p>In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170).</p>

<p>The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2 sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5 fold noninferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2 sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was &gt; 0.67.</p>

<h4>Efficacy and immunogenicity in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) – after 2 doses</h4>
<p>Study 3 is a Phase 1/2/3 study comprised of an open-label vaccine dose finding portion (Phase 1) and a multicentre, multinational, randomised, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind efficacy portion (Phase 2/3) that has enrolled participants 5 to 11 years of age. The majority (94.4%) of randomised vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1.</p>

<p>The descriptive vaccine efficacy results in children 5 to 11 years of age without evidence of prior SARS CoV 2 infection are presented in Table 5. No cases of COVID 19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<p>In Study 3, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titres (NT50) 1 month after Dose 2 in a randomly selected subset of participants demonstrated effectiveness by immunobridging of immune responses comparing children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 3 to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 part of Study 2 who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, meeting the prespecified immunobridging criteria for both the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and the seroresponse difference with seroresponse defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from baseline (before Dose 1).</p>

<p>The GMR of the SARS-CoV-2 NT50 1 month after Dose 2 in children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e. 5 to less than 12 years of age) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age was 1.04 (2 sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, 99.2% of children 5 to 11 years of age and 99.2% of participants 16 to 25 years of age had a seroresponse at 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adult) was 0.0% (2 sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 2.2%). This information is presented in Table 6.</p>

<p>Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; GMR = geometric mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean titre; LLOQ = lower limit of quantitation; NAAT = nucleic acid amplification test; NT50 = 50% neutralising titre; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.</p>

<p>Note: Participants who had no serological or virological evidence (up to 1 month post-Dose 2 blood sample collection) of past SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., N-binding antibody [serum] negative at Dose 1 visit and 1 month after Dose 2, SARS-CoV-2 not detected by NAAT [nasal swab] at Dose 1 and Dose 2 visits, and negative NAAT (nasal swab) at any unscheduled visit up to 1 month after Dose 2 blood collection) and had no medical history of COVID-19 were included in the analysis.</p>

<p>Note: Seroresponse is defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise from baseline (before Dose 1). If the baseline measurement is below the LLOQ, a postvaccination assay result ≥4 × LLOQ is considered a seroresponse.</p>

<ul>
  <li>N = Number of participants with valid and determinate assay results before vaccination and at 1 month after Dose 2. These values are also the denominators used in the percentage calculations for seroresponse rates.</li>
  <li>Protocol-specified timing for blood sample collection.</li>
  <li>GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titres and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.</li>
  <li>GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the titres (5 to 11 years of age minus 16 to 25 years of age) and the corresponding CI (based on the Student t distribution).</li>
  <li>Immunobridging based on GMT is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR is ≥0.8.</li>
  <li>SARS-CoV-2 NT50 were determined using the SARS-CoV-2 mNeonGreen Virus Microneutralization Assay. The assay uses a fluorescent reporter virus derived from the USA_WA1/2020 strain and virus neutralisation is read on Vero cell monolayers. The sample NT50 is defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which 50% of the virus is neutralised.</li>
  <li>n = Number of participants with seroresponse based on NT50 1 month after Dose 2.</li>
  <li>Exact 2-sided CI based on the Clopper and Pearson method.</li>
  <li>Difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage (5 to 11 years of age minus16 to 25 years of age).</li>
  <li>2-Sided CI, based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method for the difference in proportions, expressed as a percentage.</li>
  <li>Immunobridging based on seroresponse rate is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the seroresponse difference is greater than  10.0%.</li>

<h4>Paediatric population</h4>

<p>The licensing authority has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Comirnaty in the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).</p>

<p>This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. New information on this medicinal product will be reviewed at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Pharmacodynamic properties</h3>

<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Preclinical safety data</h3>

<p>Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.</p>

<h4>General toxicity</h4>

<p>Rats intramuscularly administered Comirnaty (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible.</p>

<h4>Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity</h4>

<p>Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential.</p>

<h4>Reproductive toxicity</h4>

<p>Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered Comirnaty prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No Comirnaty data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.</p>
