<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> What COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 is and what it is used for</h2>
<p>COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 is a vaccine used for active immunisation to prevent COVID19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>

<p>COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years.</p>

<p>The vaccine triggers the bodyâs natural production of antibodies and stimulates immune cells to protect against COVID-19 disease.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> What you need to know before you receive COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2</h2>
<p>COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 should not be given</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ingredients">listed in section 6</a>.  Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. Contact your doctor or healthcare professional immediately or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have an allergic reaction. It can be life-threatening.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Warnings and precautions</h3>
<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 in the past.</li>
  <li>you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection.</li>
  <li>a severe illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper airway infection, like a cold, are not reasons to delay vaccination.</li>
  <li>a weakened immune system, such as due to HIV infection, or are on a medicine that affects your immune system</li>
  <li>a bleeding problem, bruise easily or use a medicine to inhibit blood clotting</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.</p>

<p>As with any vaccine, COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 may not fully protect all those who receive it. No data are currently available in individuals with a weakened immune system or who are taking chronic treatment that suppresses or prevents immune responses.</p>

<p>If you are immunocompromised and receive an additional dose of <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2, it may still not provide full immunity to COVID-19 and you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>
<p>COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 is not recommended for children under 12 years.</p>

<h3>Other medicines and COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2</h3>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</h3>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine.</p>

<h3>Driving and using machines</h3>
<p>COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4 âPossible side effectsâ may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or operate machinery until you are sure that you are not affected.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 contains sodium and potassium</h3>
<p>This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially âpotassium-freeâ.</p>

<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially âsodiumfreeâ.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 is given</h2>
<p>COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 is given after dilution as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.</p>

<p>You will receive 2 injections, given at least 21 days apart.</p>

<p>If you receive one dose of COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2, you should receive a second dose of the same vaccine at least 21 days later to complete the vaccination series. Protection against COVID-19 disease may not be maximally effective until at least 7 days after the second dose.</p>

<p>A third injection may be given at least 8 weeks after the second injection if advised by your doctor. This may also be if your first two doses were with another COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions on the use of COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Possible side effects</h2>
<p>Like all vaccines, COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> Vaccine BNT162b2 can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.</p>

<p>Most side effects are mild or moderate and go away within a few days of appearing. If side effects such as pain and/or fever are troublesome, they can be treated by medicines for pain and fever such as paracetamol.</p>

</ul>

<p>Some people have reported a sudden feeling of cold with shivering/shaking accompanied by a rise in temperature, possibly with sweating, headache (including migraine-like headaches), nausea, muscle aches and feeling unwell, starting within a day of having the vaccine and usually lasting for a day or two.</p>

<p>If your fever is high and lasts longer than three days, or you have other persistent symptoms, this might not be due to side effects of the vaccine and you should seek appropriate medical advice according to your symptoms.</p>

<h3>Reporting of side effects</h3>
<p>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. 
If you are concerned about a side-effect it can be reported directly via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" rel="external">Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site</a> or search for <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Yellow Card in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?e" rel="external">Google Play</a>. When completing a report please include the vaccine brand and batch/Lot number if available.</p>

<p>Alternatively, side effects of concern in association with Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 <abbr title="messenger RNA">mRNA</abbr> vaccine BNT 162b2 can be reported to Pfizer Medical Information on 01304 616161 or via <a class="govuk-link" href="www.pfizersafetyreporting.com">Pfizer Safety Reporting</a>.</p>

<p>Please do not report the same side effect(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Pfizer and <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> (in an anonymized form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates.</p>

<p>By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this vaccine.</p>
