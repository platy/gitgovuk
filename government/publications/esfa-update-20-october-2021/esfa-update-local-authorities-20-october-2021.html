<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Reminder: Behaviour Hubs Lead school application window open until 31 October</h2>

<p>Funded by the Department for Education (DfE), the Behaviour Hubs programme pairs schools and multi-academy trusts (MATs) with exemplary behaviour practices, called lead schools or MATs, with partner schools or MATs who want and need to improve pupil behaviour.</p>

<p>The programme is looking for ‘good’ and ‘outstanding’ schools that demonstrate excellent behaviour culture with an emphasis on schools that work in challenging contexts. Your support in recommending schools within your local authority is particularly appreciated.</p>

<p>If you would like to recommend a school to become a Lead school in the Behaviour Hubs programme, please contact the team by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:behaviourhubs@educationdevelopmenttrust.com">behaviourhubs@educationdevelopmenttrust.com</a>.</p>

<p>The deadline for the current Lead school and MAT application period is midnight on 31 October 2021.</p>

<p>You can find more information about the role and responsibilities of Lead schools and MATs in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.educationdevelopmenttrust.com/behaviourhubs-LS-brochure" class="govuk-link">Behaviour Hubs brochure</a>.</p>
