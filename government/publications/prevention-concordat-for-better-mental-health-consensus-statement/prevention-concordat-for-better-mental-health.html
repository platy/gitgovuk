<h2>About the concordat</h2>

<p>The Prevention Concordat for Better Mental Health is underpinned by an understanding that taking a prevention-focused approach to improving the public’s mental health has been shown to make a valuable contribution to achieving a fairer and more equitable society. The concordat promotes evidence-based planning and commissioning to increase the impact on reducing health inequalities. The sustainability and cost-effectiveness of this approach is enhanced by the inclusion of action that impacts on the wider determinants of mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>The concordat is intended to provide a focus for cross-sector action to deliver a tangible increase in the adoption of public mental health approaches across:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>Integrated Care Systems (<abbr title="Integrated Care Systems">ICSs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the NHS</li>
  <li>social care</li>
  <li>public, private, and voluntary, community and social enterprise (<abbr title="voluntary, community and social enterprise">VCSE</abbr>) sector organisations</li>
  <li>educational settings</li>
  <li>employers</li>
  <li>emergency services</li>
  <li>justice systems</li>
</ul>

<p>It acknowledges the active role played by people with lived experience of mental health problems, individually and through user-led organisations.</p>

<p>This definition of the concordat has been agreed by the organisations listed at the end of this document. It represents a public mental health informed approach to prevention, as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/five-year-forward-view/" rel="external">NHS Five Year Forward View</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s-consultation-document">Prevention Green Paper: Advancing our health: prevention in the 2020s</a>. It promotes relevant <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> guidance and existing evidence-based interventions and delivery approaches, such as ‘making every contact count’.</p>

<h2>Consensus statement</h2>

<p>The Prevention Concordat consensus statement was updated in 2021 following consultation with stakeholders. It describes the shared commitment of signatories to work together via the Prevention Concordat for Better Mental Health, through local and national action, to prevent mental health problems and promote good mental health.</p>

<p>Prevention Concordat signatories agree the following:</p>

<p>“Strengthening protective factors and reducing risk factors sit at the heart of our commitment to promoting good mental health. COVID-19 has highlighted long-standing social and economic inequalities. There is evidence that protective and risk factors for mental health are unequally distributed across the country, in our communities and for those with existing mental health conditions.</p>

<p>“We are committed to reducing mental health inequalities by taking action to address the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Protective factors – maternal and infant mental health, early years support, family and parenting support, connecting with others and forming good relationships, good education, stable, secure, good quality and affordable housing, good quality work, a healthy standard of living, accessible safe and green outdoor space, arts and cultural activities, community cohesion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Risk factors – poverty, socio-economic inequalities, child neglect and abuse, unemployment, poor quality work, debt, drug and alcohol misuse, homelessness, loneliness, violence, discrimination.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>“This is an opportunity to build back better to create a fairer society, working with our voluntary and community partners, the health and social care sector, emergency services, local and national stakeholders. Signing the Concordat means becoming part of a community of practice committed to taking evidence based preventive and promotional action to support the mental health of the whole population, those at greater risk of poor mental health, and those receiving treatment.</p>

<p>“Keeping people mentally well is as important as providing early help, and many interventions will also result in social and economic benefits, even in the short term.</p>

<p>“As signatories, we will work as a whole system and across organisational boundaries. We commit to supporting place-based population mental health through co-ordination of partnerships at <abbr title="Integrated Care System">ICS</abbr>, local authority and neighbourhood levels. We will do this using needs assessment in partnership with local stakeholders, communities, people with lived experience and carers, all of whom know what matters most. As system leaders, we will also use employment and procurement levers to improve population mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>“We believe that the transformation of mental health services set out in the NHS Long Term Plan will be supported through strong prevention and early intervention, as we know that evidence-based prevention and promotion interventions reduce demand on the mental health system and support recovery. The inter-relationship between good mental and physical health should also inform the delivery of physical health improvement.</p>

<p>“We will encourage local and national stakeholders to invest in promoting mental wellbeing, preventing mental health conditions and preventing suicide. This will reduce demand for services and create savings not just for the NHS and social care, but also for employers, education providers, emergency services and justice systems.</p>

<p>“We will lead by example, taking action based on the best evidence. Where there is promising evidence, we are committed to building on this and to evaluating its efficacy. We will share our good practice and promote learning. We will regularly review and refresh our prevention approach and our action plan, giving an annual account of progress.”</p>

<h2>Reasons to sign the Prevention Concordat</h2>

<p>Signing the consensus statement and committing to a plan to address the prevention and promotion of better mental health is a cost-effective, evidence-based approach to reducing health inequalities and preventing future harm.</p>

<p>The impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) and the social and economic consequences of the pandemic have meant that tackling mental health at a population level has never been more important. COVID-19 was recognised as a public mental health emergency that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30165-1/fulltext" rel="external">exacerbated existing mental health inequalities</a>.</p>

<p>Mental health and substance misuse problems are responsible for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-profile-for-england-2018/chapter-3-trends-in-morbidity-and-risk-factors#mental-health">21.3% of the burden of disease in England</a>. It’s likely that this figure is an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(15)00505-2/fulltext" rel="external">underestimate</a>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30308-4/fulltext#seccestitle140" rel="external">This burden is expected to increase</a> due to the impact of COVID-19. Promotion of better mental health and prevention measures should therefore be included in emergency planning, restoration and recovery.</p>

<p>Signing up to the consensus statement and action plan is an opportunity to join a community of practice working towards creating resilient communities and building the case for a shift to support prevention activity. Ultimately, through both local and national action, our aim is to prevent mental health problems and promote good mental health.</p>

<h2>How to become a signatory</h2>

<p>We’re inviting local authorities, health and wellbeing boards, <abbr title="Integrated Care Systems">ICSs</abbr>, sustainability and transformation partnerships (STP), and other health partnerships to sign up to the Prevention Concordat. <abbr title="voluntary, community and social enterprise">VCSE</abbr> sector organisations should partner with local authorities and <abbr title="Integrated Care Systems">ICSs</abbr> to apply.</p>

<p>To be recognised as a Prevention Concordat signatory, you need to agree to the consensus statement and produce an action plan addressing the 5 domain framework.</p>
