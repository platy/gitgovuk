<h3>Next Generation Wearable Technology</h3>
<p>Unique Identifier IFA031</p>

<p>Closing date: 22 June 2022</p>

<p>Technologies that can be used to collect physiological data (both physical and molecular parameters) from individuals in real-time, continue to develop rapidly. Such developments might be in terms of metrics measured, device functionality and/or form factor (site and style of measurement device). Conceptually, there are obvious drivers for the utility of data from such devices in defence capabilities. However, there remain gaps in the evidence base to support what metrics might be reliably measured by wearable technologies and how data from these platforms might be used to improve decision making in a defence context to protect human health and wellbeing.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> has an aspiration to understand what metrics can be collected from wearable technology platforms that are of credible value to the defence user community (i.e. the metrics are sufficiently robust that they can reliably and confidently inform effective and timely decision making). 
This IFA is therefore seeking propositions that demonstrate novel technology development and/ or data analytics tools that provide information to inform decision making pathways e.g. changes to health and wellbeing that could inform decision making pathways (i.e. as part of a system not a sole diagnostic device) or assist with assessing human performance.<br>
Proposals should aim to demonstrate that data from wearable technologies have the potential to provide robust, reliable and actionable insight in either acute (minutes/hours – e.g. to intervene in acute injury) or chronic (days/months) timeframes.
Of particular interest to this IFA are technologies targeted towards the development of platforms and/or data analytical tools that provide predictive insight, into the effect of physical, psychological and environmental stressors on individuals.</p>

<p>Environmental stressors of interest will include, but are not limited to, thermal (hot or cold), altitude, infection and acute and chronic stress, relative to participant specific baselines.
This could include the development of novel sensor platforms that are capable of accessing novel metrics, development of innovative form factors that improve ergonomics; such as reduced size, weight, comfort and/or development of predictive data tools to better understand how to detect, prevent and treat illnesses caused by a range of occupational and environmental stressors.</p>

<p>This IFA focuses on two key challenges/themes:</p>

<p>1)	Demonstration of new sensor technologies and of the data generated from these sensors against existing validated measures (where applicable). This should include proof of concept that measures are relevant to a particular state or condition of interest.</p>

<p>And/or</p>

<p>2)	Innovative exploitation of signatures generated from current or novel wearable systems to provide prognostic insights into human health and wellbeing. Importantly, this would utilise human participant data (this does not necessarily need to be from a military population) and must provide key insights for preventative interventions.</p>

<p>Within this IFA, <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> expects to fund proposals within Technical Readiness Level 3 – 6  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance">Technical Readiness Level  (<abbr title="technology readiness level">TRL</abbr>)</a> (Rapid Impact Category) up to £200k for a maximum of a 12 month contract (Projects will be funded across multiple Financial Years).</p>

<p>We are seeking proposals that encompass:</p>

<p>1)	Developments in wearable technology platforms. This may include innovative form factors or methods for measurement, which permit the measurement of novel biosignatures from individuals (physical and/or biochemical parameters). This may include, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduction of novel measurements that currently cannot currently be made by wearable technologies. This might include sensors capable of measuring hydration status, a stress marker, cardiac measure or other pertinent metric.</li>
  <li>Improvements in quality, robustness and longevity of measurements that can be made using wearable devices e.g. reliability of data collection, data quality, and resolution and duration of data collection.</li>
  <li>Form factors that enable collection of data in a minimally intrusive format and thus may be more exploitable for defence customers, e.g. alternatives to wrist worn devices to include patches, arm worn or chest worn devices.
Proposals in this theme should include provision of evidence to support that the data generated from these sensors is credible and can be used to inform decision making. This could include demonstrable comparability of any measurement made to an existing validated measure where applicable and/or proof of concept that those measures are relevant to a particular human condition.</li>
</ul>

<p>2)	Exploitation of signatures generated from current or novel wearable systems to provide prognostic insights into human health and wellbeing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proposals in this theme could for example focus on experimentation using wearable sensors in combination with data analysis to measure and monitor individuals to provide insight into the effects of environments or situations on those individuals.</li>
  <li>Of particular interest would be physical, psychological and environmental stressors such as heat or cold, altitude, infection and acute and chronic stress, relative to participant specific baselines.</li>
  <li>Where proposed models or computational tools are described, algorithms and all source code must be provided for future validation and verification purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are not seeking proposals that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not address the need for ethical review (MODREC). Proposals should include GDPR requirements and must include sufficient time to achieve appropriate approvals (currently c. 5 months.) For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modrec-guidance-for-suppliers">here.</a>
</li>
  <li>Are literature reviews or literature summaries.</li>
  <li>Provide proof of concept data collection only. Proposals for novel sensors should aim to demonstrate that the measure is comparable to a credible/validated method to measure the same parameter/metric where appropriate.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate proof of concept of data collection only i.e. data architectures and software solutions are not acceptable unless part of a predictive system including the integration of novel data analytical tools.</li>
  <li>Do not provide prognostic information.</li>
  <li>Utilise existing commercially restricted algorithms.</li>
  <li>Do not provide source code and/or details on the models/algorithms developed sufficient for an independent reviewer to verify.</li>
  <li>Provide solutions which are already commercial products unless applied in a novel way to a defence specific human condition to provide new insight.</li>
  <li>Offer no real long-term prospect of integration into defence and security capabilities</li>
  <li>Offer no real prospect of out-competing existing technological solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Proposals should aim to generate evidence that data from wearable technologies is meaningful in decision-making frameworks for monitoring and maintaining human health and wellbeing and offers demonstrable benefit over current solutions. There is potential for wide exploitation of options developed within this IFA to be exploited across defence, with successful projects being scoped for further use. The exploitation of technology will be leveraged through the <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> Protecting Our People programme.</p>

<h3>Simulating Future Battlespace Complexity</h3>
<p>Unique Identifier IFA024</p>

<p>Current live exercises cannot represent many modern offensive and defensive systems and the anticipated complexity of the battlefield. Using live platforms also places a demand on scarce resources and implies a financial and environmental cost through the use of fuel and other consumables.</p>

<p>We must therefore endeavour to create more effective training environments through the use of simulation and synthetic environments which will enable more frequent training, greater challenge and greater availability. There is a requirement to work with civil partners to pursue technologies and approaches to training within a simulated environment that is compatible with the constraints of our budgets, training facilities and legislation.</p>

<p>We seek novel ideas that can be used by <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Defence to do one, or several, of the below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apply procedures and solutions that provide effective training and evaluation capabilities</li>
  <li>Integration and fusion of data from, and between, distributed training and experimentation systems</li>
  <li>Provide training for operators to perform in complex or high stress environments</li>
  <li>Adoption of Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality into training</li>
  <li>Capture and exploitation of performance information collected during training</li>
</ul>

<p>All proposals should be created with the aim of enabling faster insertion of new capability and must inform and be informed by wargames and simulations investigating emerging threats.</p>

<h3>Defence People – Skills, Knowledge and Experience</h3>
<p>Unique Identifier IFA023</p>

<p>In the current environment it is increasingly important to ensure we have access to people with the skills, knowledge and experience to exploit information and allow us to adopt cutting edge technologies. This will involve a collaborative approach where we work with other parties, be it other government departments, academia, industry or internationally to ensure we have Suitably Qualified and Experienced Personnel (SQEP) across science, technology, engineering and mathematics.</p>

<p>We are seeking proposals which exploit novel contracts and employment models and consider that individuals may need to learn new skills many times in their careers.</p>

<p>We seek novel ideas which could be used by <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Defence to do one, or several, of the below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attract and retain SQEP with niche specialities and technical skills.</li>
  <li>Tracking and managing important skillsets across the workforce</li>
  <li>Provide technologies/services and other opportunities to improve welfare standards, workforce health and wellbeing</li>
  <li>Provide alternative approaches to contracting or seconding specialist staff</li>
  <li>Identify and collaborate with organisations with experience in the above areas</li>
  <li>Suggest novel approaches to improve the sharing and assimilation of knowledge across organisational boundaries, whilst respecting intellectual properties considerations</li>
</ul>

<p>All proposals should consider the use of simulation to personalise training, maximise human potential and create realistic operational environments.</p>

<h3>Operate and Deliver Effects in Contested Domains</h3>
<p>Unique Identifier IFA022</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Armed Forces currently face heavily contested environments across the air, land, sea, and particularly the space and cyber domains, which is of significant threat to the security of our information and could lead to disruption in the use of our space-based capabilities.</p>

<p>Freedom to use our information networks and the electromagnetic spectrum is essential as this is the medium for communication between forces during operations and for our most effective sensors. These mediums can be used by adversaries as a source of information and can also leave us at a tactical disadvantage were they to be disrupted or disabled.</p>

<p>Proposals should consider we need to be robust and resilient and have the ability to disrupt/degrade adversary capabilities. We seek novel ideas which could be used by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Armed Forces to do one, or several, of the below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Communicate and synchronise activities in contested environments</li>
  <li>Monitor contested environments</li>
  <li>Manufacture methods and design concepts to deliver alternate explosive/electromagnetic/chemical effects and protection from these effects</li>
  <li>Manage fleets of remote or autonomous systems and use these systems to undertake tasks normally completed by human operators</li>
</ul>

<h3>Delivering Agile Command and Control</h3>
<p>Unique Identifier IFA021</p>

<p>Mission Command is a style of command historically used by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Armed Forces to plan and orchestrate operations effectively to achieve desired outcomes. Mission Command is essential to achieving the adaptability required to respond quickly to the complexity in the modern environment, allows delegation and operational awareness across all levels of seniority, and enables personnel to carry out missions with the maximum freedom of action.</p>

<p>In order to achieve a more agile Command and Control process we are looking for proposals which promote a shift from more traditional chains of command to more dynamic, lateral networks, with greater delegation of authority and allow exploitation of relevant information at speed.</p>

<p>We seek novel ideas that could be used by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Armed Forces to do one, or several, of the below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technology based data analysis e.g. use of machine learning</li>
  <li>Collaboration between human and technology based decision making processes</li>
  <li>Systems and processes to analyse and visualise real-time data</li>
  <li>Merging in-house and commercially available information services to establish situational awareness</li>
</ul>

<p>All proposals should be created with the aim of transforming military capabilities to be information centric, which will enable future forces and platforms to be designed around an information architecture to enable widespread access to and sharing of information.</p>

<h3>Integrate Information and Physical Activity Across all Domains</h3>
<p>Unique Identifier IFA020</p>

<p>Our Armed Forces have a requirement to be better integrated: with each other, with other government departments and with new and existing international allies and partners. Integration will enable units to work together harmoniously to deliver winning impact across several domains; sea, land, air, space, and cyber.</p>

<p>Communication capabilities underpin all aspects of modern military operations as they allow multiple operators to coordinate in order to maximise their combined effectiveness. Ultimately, all communications are vulnerable to adversary disruption which introduces significant operational risk.</p>

<p>We are seeking proposals which provide field communication capabilities that are resistant to attack, but continue to perform if degraded and are secure. We seek novel ideas that could be used by the Armed Forces to do one, or several, of the below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Manage significant volumes of data from remote or autonomous systems</li>
  <li>Information services that integrate formatted or unformatted data</li>
  <li>Collaborative data sharing internationally with classified information</li>
</ul>

<p>All proposals should be created with the aim of increasing our ability to orchestrate activity, provide protection to military personnel and their equipment and in doing so, deter hostile action by our adversaries.</p>
