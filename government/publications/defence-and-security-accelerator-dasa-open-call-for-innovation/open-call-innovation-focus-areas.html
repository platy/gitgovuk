<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Beyond Line of Sight Communications</h3>
<p>Unique Identifier: IFA036</p>

<p>This Defence and Security Accelerator (<abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr>) IFA, run on behalf of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>) Communication and Networks programme, is seeking Generation-After-Next (GAN)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> proposals, which explore and develop new / novel beyond line of sight (BLOS) communication options.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>)/Front Line Commands (FLCs) relies heavily on the same mature BLOS communication technologies, such as military High Frequency (HF), troposcatter or satellite communications. These technologies have existed within the military for many years, so developing novel and more efficient BLOS communication options is a continuous aim. It is crucial to build a pipeline of future technologies and have a diverse repertoire of communication approaches to overcome any threat and ensure that if one form of bearer is denied, there are alternatives available and communications remain robust.</p>

<p>This IFA is seeking GAN proposals that explore and develop new / novel BLOS communication options. Alternatives to traditional methods of military communications are sought to gain and maintain communication advantage in highly disruptive threat environments. This IFA is looking for suppliers with novel ideas, for Future Beyond Line Of Sight (FBLOS) capability. This IFA should focus on BLOS techniques that are not currently employed, although it will also consider alternative applications of current BLOS technologies.</p>

<p>We are interested in GAN technologies that include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>system development</li>
  <li>approaches to understand the “Channel”</li>
  <li>signal processing for new approaches to BLOS communications</li>
  <li>waveforms</li>
  <li>solution hardware development</li>
</ul>

<p>We are not interested in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solutions which are already commercial products</li>
  <li>Literature reviews</li>
  <li>Offer demonstrations of off-the-shelf products requiring no experimental development (unless applied in a novel way to the challenge)</li>
  <li>Offer no real long-term prospect of integration into defence and security capabilities</li>
  <li>Offer no real prospect of out-competing existing technological solutions</li>
  <li>BLOS methods, which are already utilised by the military or are mature (i.e. HF (High Frequency), SATCOM, Troposcatter).</li>
</ul>

<p>This IFA expects proposals to deliver a proof of concept at around <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance">Technical Readiness Level</a>(<abbr title="technology readiness level">TRL</abbr>) 3/4 by the end of the project. <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> expects to fund proposals around £100K, (although this is not a hard limit) which provides a proof of concept within a maximum contract duration of 2 years.</p>

<p>This IFA is open for submissions within the <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> Open Call. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-competition-document">See Para 9.1</a>. This IFA is expected to continue over multiple cycles, however, we will give sufficient notice for the final cycle.</p>

<p>Exploitation of successful proposals from this competition will feed into other <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> Systems Science and Technology (S&amp;T) programmes, which focus on technological solutions at higher <abbr title="technology readiness level">TRL</abbr> (6&gt;). A research exploitation-working group (REWG) will also engage and aid exploitation. The REWG is composed of stakeholders across StratCom C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), Defence Digital, FLC Digital/C4 capability, Systems S&amp;T programmes, Chief Scientific Advisor (CSA).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Making Science Fiction a Reality: Future Directed Energy Weapons</h3>
<p>Unique Identifier: IFA035</p>

<p><b>Background</b></p>

<p>Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) are systems capable of discrete target selection that emit laser or Radio Frequency (RF) energy as the primary means to cause disruptive, damaging or destructive effects on equipment or facilities.</p>

<p>The vision of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) is to make Directed Energy Weapons a realistic choice for our armed forces, which can contribute a decisive edge and sustain strategic advantage. The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> is currently investing in several high-value demonstrators, including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mbda-systems.com/press-releases/dragonfire-proving-trials-underway" rel="external">DragonFire</a> and several projects integrating both RF and laser-based systems onto military platforms. This is managed by Team Hersa a joint DE&amp;S and <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> project that manages the delivery of demonstrators and prepares defence for the introduction of innovative weapon systems. <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> is supporting the   department’s efforts to understand the next steps necessary to develop and introduce Directed Energy Weapons into service across Land, Sea and Air domains.</p>

<p><b>Scope</b></p>

<p>This Innovation Focus Area is seeking proposals which present ideas to contribute to the first generation of deployed Directed Energy Weapons and help address departmental decisions as described above.

      <li>Operation in adverse environmental conditions</li>
      <li>Propagation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Target detection
    <ul>
      <li>Small non-cooperative targets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Battle Damage indication</li>
  <li>Test and evaluation
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to characterise the effect achieved remotely and on small agile targets in real time.</li>
      <li>Generic diagnostic tools and techniques for characterising the Directed Energy Weapon’s beam.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Successful suppliers will be asked to provide deliverables in the form of reports, presentations and/or demonstrations of innovations which should be detailed as part of the proposal. Collaboration is encouraged to allow for all factors to be considered during the projects, however, it is not mandatory.</p>

<p><b>Clarification</b></p>

<p>We are seeking proposals that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show a creative or innovative approach within the areas described above</li>
  <li>are between <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance">Technology Readiness Levels (<abbr title="technology readiness level">TRL</abbr>) 2 -6</a>
</li>
  <li>have suggested project values of between £50k-£200k, with a maximum of £500k available at this time</li>
  <li>have a maximum project duration of 12 months</li>
</ul>

<p>We are not seeking proposals that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are identical resubmission of previous bids to <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> or <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> without modification</li>
  <li>provide solutions which are already commercial products</li>
  <li>are solely literature reviews</li>
  <li>offer demonstrations of off-the-shelf products requiring no experimental development (unless applied in a novel way to the challenge)</li>
  <li>offer no real long-term prospect of integration into defence and security capabilities</li>
  <li>offer no real prospect of out-competing existing technological solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of the Technical Readiness Level (<abbr title="technology readiness level">TRL</abbr>) all proposals should be submitted under Open Call, Emerging Innovations, then selecting IFA 035. The requirements of this IFA will take precedence over contradicting statements within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-competition-document#emerging-innovations">Emerging Innovations</a>.</p>

<p><b>Exploitation</b></p>

<p>For near term funded projects (&lt;2 years), the exploitation route will emerge through several upcoming capability decisions and within the wider research programme. For longer term projects (2+ years) the aim will to be exploit relevant innovations in Directed Energy Weapon defence procurements, which is likely to be via strategic defence suppliers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Countering IEDs by Novel Technology and Techniques</h3>
<p>Unique Identifier: IFA034</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> IFA is seeking proposals that can rapidly accelerate and enhance electronic capabilities which can counter Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). We are looking for novel methods which either use the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum or provide an understanding of the RF spectrum in order to detect and disrupt the functionality of IEDs.</p>

<p>An important part of countering an IED threat is the detection of devices along with understanding the electromagnetic environment to inform situational awareness, to decide threat from non-threat and to inform the configuration of other countermeasures.</p>

<p>The innovations generated through this call will support a crucial capability for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> military and security users, protecting our service personnel, emergency services and the public using RF techniques to counter IEDs and outpace threat evolution.</p>

<p>An IED is an explosive device fabricated in an improvised manner, but with varying degrees of professionalism. An IED typically comprises of the following component types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a power source</li>
  <li>wires</li>
  <li>electronic circuitry</li>
  <li>an explosive initiator</li>
  <li>an explosives charge</li>
  <li>shrapnel products to increase fragmentation</li>
  <li>a trigger mechanism</li>
  <li>various enclosures</li>
</ul>

<p>The trigger mechanisms used to initiate IEDs are often adapted from commercial products. Examples could include modified Radio Controlled (RC) toys or the use of communication networks. These RF links, and associated components, are considered the primary objective for this call. Other initiation methods could include command wires, timers and victim operated mechanisms, but these are outside the scope of this call unless there is an RF element used in the denial or detection of them.</p>

<p>We are interested in innovative ways to develop and expand the variety of capabilities used for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Defence and Security. The aim of the IFA is to provide a range of successful solutions that can be developed for front line use.
Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) and Electronic Support Measures (ESM) systems need to counter an evolving range of electromagnetic technologies operating across the RF Spectrum, using an ever growing and diverse range of signalling schemes. As possible threat technology types in this area are constantly changing, front line operators need to have a wide variety of options at their disposal to mitigate emerging problems quickly and effectively.</p>

<p>Examples of ECM and ESM use cases include those that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can be carried by a service person on long patrols to deliver an immediate effect against IEDs.</li>
  <li>can be attached to a vehicle in a static and/or moving scenario to deliver an immediate effect against unknown IEDs.</li>
  <li>can be used to provide protection at a fixed location while delivering an immediate effect against an unknown IED.</li>
  <li>can provide targeted protection without being co-located with the protected element.</li>
  <li>are suitable for use in an urban, suburban and/or rural context with the associated variety of environmental conditions and spectrum conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your proposal must meet at least one of the three challenges, but we welcome bids that address more than one.</p>

<p><b>Challenge 1 - To capture and analyse RF signals using novel spectrum survey techniques, which may include, but is not limited to:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>signal analysis techniques and classification algorithms, which identify and distinguish between multiple technology standards and protocols, while being able to operate across a wide spectrum in real time.</li>
  <li>generating methods or data analysis techniques to provide an understanding of the RF environment, which can be used to inform tactical decisions; for instance, the ability to identify abnormal changes in the environment.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenge 2 - Approaches to permanently or temporarily disable commercial communications links and/or the electronics within a Remote Controlled Explosive Device. Examples include techniques that:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>disable communications links to prevent a trigger signal being received. Examples of communication links of interest include those used by push-to-talk radios, wireless doorbells, cellular devices, Wi-Fi and any other readily available communication devices. This may include approaches against the RF signal or the wireless transceivers themselves.</li>
  <li>disable multiple communication types simultaneously across a wide spectrum, preventing devices from switching to alternative RF bearers that they may have access to.</li>
  <li>disable the electronics within a Remote Controlled Explosive Device, preventing its detonation.  Examples include RF techniques to affect the operation of microcontrollers or cause permanent damage.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenge 3 - New or novel hardware and ancillaries (system components), which may include but is not limited to:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>novel antenna concepts to improve performance and lower the RF and visual signature of the service person or vehicle with respect to the ECM system and its ancillaries.</li>
  <li>advancements in hardware design, such as tuneable filters, efficient ultra-wide band amplifier designs.</li>
  <li>optimisations in size, weight, or power, or efficiency optimisations in wideband RF signal generation technologies (in the order of several GHz).</li>
  <li>novel signal and data processing hardware technologies and techniques, that offer advancements in efficiency, parallelism or dynamic configurability.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are seeking proposals that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show an innovative or a creative approach</li>
  <li>clearly demonstrate how the proposed work applies to the challenges outlined</li>
  <li>have been proven or matured for another application or domain, and need adaptation to develop as a viable counter IED solution</li>
  <li>will demonstrate solutions at a minimum of Technology Readiness Levels (<abbr title="technology readiness levels">TRLs</abbr>) 5/6</li>
  <li>are short to medium-term, nominally between 6 to 18 months, with a funding amount between circa £150k and £400k per project</li>
  <li>include a potential delivery roadmap indicating how the technology could be developed over a 2 to 3 year timeframe (beyond the scope of this IFA)</li>
</ul>

<p>We are not seeking proposals that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are an identical resubmission of a previous bid to <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> or <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> without modification</li>
  <li>are off-the-shelf products with no additional innovation/adaptation to the applications mentioned above</li>
  <li>have no long-term prospect of providing a counter IED effect under real world conditions</li>
  <li>simply focus on a discussion of current capability gaps, whether perceived or actual</li>
  <li>offer detailed prediction of effects/benefits that are likely to be seen under a given scenario - this information can be built up over the period of the proposed work</li>
</ul>

<p>Successful proposals may be exploited and developed further through the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>) Future Land Force Protection and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) ECM Capability projects. These projects provide technical support and guidance to personnel in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Strategic Command, the British Army, and Defence Equipment &amp; Support. There is potential for wider exploitation of options developed within this IFA to support future capability requirements across the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and wider government.</p>

<span class="number">1.5 </span>Human Augmentation</h3>
<p>Unique Identifier: IFA033</p>

<p><b>Closing date will be 23 November 2022</b></p>

<p>Human Augmentation (HA) is the use of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) to temporarily or permanently modify human performance. It includes optimisation, enhancement, degradation (reducing the impact of stresses, such as working in extreme climates) and restoration of individuals.  HA encompasses a range of technologies, these include exoskeletons, implantables, genetics, brain interfaces, pharmaceuticals, and bioinformatics<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Recent advances in S&amp;T have led to a considerable variety of technologies (at various levels of technical maturity and readiness) that could be considered to directly or indirectly augment the human. As the battlefield becomes more complex, and more advanced technologies become available, the operational demands and technical challenges on our defence and security personnel will increase.  If HA technologies can be harnessed safely, legally and ethically to develop enhanced levels of operator (and system) performance it is possible they could afford improvements in military and security capability.</p>

<p>This IFA is seeking proposals which present Generation-After-Next (GAN)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> solutions to operational challenges for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Defence and Security where the human performance is the limiting factor for delivering operational effect. This IFA aims to facilitate the generation of new, innovative or radical approaches that will enable appropriate application of Human Augmentation as a solution to an operational challenge or as a means to achieve a competitive advantage in the defence and security environment.</p>

<p>We are interested in GAN technologies that deliver a competitive advantage to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Defence and Security by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Optimising physical and/or psychological performance</li>
  <li>Enhancing physical and/or psychological performance</li>
  <li>Enabling an individual to work for longer at a desired level  (baseline)of performance</li>
  <li>Supporting performance restoration<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of candidate HA technologies include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wearable assistive devices<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> (e.g. exoskeletons and technologies to enhance senses)</li>
  <li>Sensory enhancement technologies</li>
  <li>Nutritional supplements</li>
  <li>Pharmacological interventions</li>
  <li>Manipulation of the microbiomes</li>
  <li>Neurotechnologies</li>
  <li>Novel materials</li>
  <li>Implantable devices</li>
  <li>Synthetic biology</li>
  <li>Cross reality</li>
  <li>Robotics</li>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
</ul>

<p>This IFA is open for submissions within the <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> Open Call. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-competition-document">See Para 9.1</a>. Further cycles may be advertised. This IFA expects proposals to deliver a proof of concept at around <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance">Technical Readiness Level</a> (<abbr title="technology readiness level">TRL</abbr>) 3 by the end of their projects. <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> expects to fund proposals to a value around £70K which provide a proof of concept within a 6 month contract.</p>

<p>We are not seeking proposals that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide existing, commercially available products</li>
  <li>Offer demonstrations of commercial-off-the-shelf products requiring no experimental development (unless applied in a novel way to this IFA)</li>
  <li>Offer no real long-term prospect of integration into defence or security capabilities</li>
  <li>Technologies that are not focussed on GAN</li>
  <li>Provide no improvements or benefits to existing systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the proposal you should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All proposals must consider research ethics, specifically <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modrec-guidance-for-suppliers">JSP536</a>. For more information, please click <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modrec-guidance-for-suppliers">here</a>
