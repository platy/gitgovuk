<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What is the Open Call?</h2>

<p>The Open Call is one of the funding competition mechanisms <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> uses to find proposals that address challenges faced by government stakeholders. It gives bidders the opportunity to present their ideas to defence and security stakeholders at any time, without waiting for a relevant Themed Competition.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What are we looking for?</h2>

<p>The Open Call is looking for innovative ideas to improve the defence and/or security of the UK. Your idea could be a concept, technology or service. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-competition-document#emerging-innovations">Emerging Innovations</a> category is for less mature innovations, and our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-competition-document#rapid-innovations">Rapid Impact</a> category is for innovations that are more developed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Defence requirements</h3>
<p>Suppliers may submit proposals to address any defence challenge or a specific <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-innovation-focus-areas">Innovation Focus Area</a> and can submit under either <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-competition-document#emerging-innovations">Emerging Innovations</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-competition-document#rapid-innovations">Defence Rapid Impact</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Security requirements</h3>
<p>Suppliers may submit proposals under the <a class="govuk-link" href="#security-rapid-innovations">Security Rapid Impact category</a> to address any security challenge.</p>

<p>It is expected that some proposals will be relevant to both defence and security</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Emerging Innovations</h2>

<p>The Open Call competition category âEmerging Innovationsâ is currently not available for submission. Further information will be provided as soon as this category becomes available again. Please note, you will be able to submit into the Rapid Impact and all <abbr title="Innovation Focus Area">IFA</abbr> categories <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-how-to-submit-a-proposal">here</a>. If you have any queries or questions please email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accelerator@dstl.gov.uk">accelerator@dstl.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Emerging innovations are viewed as those which will deliver a proof of concept at around <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance">Technology Readiness Level (<abbr title="technology readiness level">TRL</abbr>)</a> 3 or 4. Proof of concept might include component and/or sub-system validation in laboratory-style environment. Successful projects may be candidates for follow-on funding in the Rapid Impact category, although other funding opportunities may be available.</p>

<p>The majority of successful projects start at <abbr title="technology readiness level">TRL</abbr> 2 or 3, which means the basic concept has been formulated and the underpinning technological principles observed at the outset. No funding limit is specified, however we would typically expect to fund bids between Â£50K - Â£100K that last between 3 and 10 months.
For examples of work we have funded <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accelerator-funded-contracts/accelerator-funded-contracts-1-april-2018-to-31-march-2019">click here.</a></p>

<p>Emerging Innovations proposals are contracted under the Innovation Standard Contract. Please review the <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance">terms and conditions</a> before submitting your proposal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Defence Rapid Impact</h2>

<p>Rapid Impact Innovations are viewed as those which will deliver a technology model or prototype demonstration at around <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance">Technology Readiness Level (<abbr title="technology readiness level">TRL</abbr>)</a> 6 or 7.  This demonstration should be at a limited scale, in the hands of end users, and in the context or environment in which it is expected that the solution would be used. To be successful it will also have to provide evidence of how other&nbsp;<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>/Security&nbsp;business and capability requirements, such as the Defence Lines of Development (<abbr title="Defence Lines of Development">DLOD</abbr>), could be satisfied should the project to be taken forward after the pilot.</p>

<p>Your project should have a realistic prospect of achieving an impact within a 3 year time frame from the completion of the project. Proposals will therefore only be funded if there is a strong customer requirement and capability need for the idea. Proposals could be pre-sifted from the competition prior to full assessment if user need is not explained.</p>

<p>No funding limit is specified, however we would typically expect to fund bids between Â£100K - Â£350K.&nbsp;Proposals that demonstrate value for money will be viewed favourably.  Please see examples of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accelerator-funded-contracts/accelerator-funded-contracts-1-april-2018-to-31-march-2019">previous funded work here.</a></p>

<p>Rapid Impact proposals are contracted under the Innovation Standard Contract. Please review the <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance">terms and conditions</a> before submitting your proposal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Security Rapid Impact</h2>

<p>Security Rapid Impact Innovations are viewed as those which will undergo a period of research and development in order to deliver a technology model or prototype demonstration at around <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance#what-dasa-funds">Technology Readiness Level (<abbr title="technology readiness level">TRL</abbr>)</a> 6 or 7, at the end of the contract. This demonstration should be at a limited scale and in the context or environment in which it is expected that the solution would be used. The research and development project should include all of the activities that are required to provide this limited demonstration, including appropriate testing and validation throughout the project.</p>

<p>Your project can also include a further priced option for a Testing and Trialling phase, taking place after the demonstration. This aims to allow you to gather further data from an operational environment and refine the innovation, trialling its suitability to meet end userâs needs.</p>

<p>The Testing and Trialling phase should be outlined within the full proposal under the âTesting and Triallingâ section and should include approximate timings, deliverables and maximum total costs. Please include any travel and subsistence as well as costs from third party sites such as airports, other national infrastructure or publicly accessible location operators. Note, costings for Testing and Trialling should not be inserted into the âFinanceâ and âDelivery Scheduleâ sections of the proposal. If you do not wish to include a Testing and Trialling phase, please add âN/Aâ to the âTesting and Triallingâ section on your submission.</p>

<p>An Option Condition between Demonstration and the Testing and Trialling phase will be included in any resultant Contracts awarded and the Authority will be under no obligation to exercise this option. We may cease any further participation if demonstrations (following the development phase) do not meet expectations.</p>

<p>Your project should have a realistic prospect of achieving an impact within a 3 year time frame from the completion of the project. Proposals will therefore only be funded if there is a strong security and/ or defence user requirement and capability need for the idea. Proposals could be pre-sifted from the competition prior to full assessment if security user need is not explained.
We are currently seeking ideas related to one or more of the following government departments;</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/home-office-areas-of-research-interest/home-office-areas-of-research-interest">Home Office</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dft-areas-of-research-interest">Department for Transport (in relation to security departments)</a></li>
  <li>other Government Security Departments</li>
</ul>

<p>No funding limit is specified, however we would typically expect to fund bids between Â£100K - Â£350K. Your project, to include any Testing and Trialling options, must complete by March 2024.</p>

<p>It is expected that some proposals will be relevant to both defence and security.</p>

<p>Security Rapid Impact proposals are contracted under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance#our-standard-contracts">Innovation Standard Contract</a>. Please review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance"><abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> terms and conditions</a> before submitting your proposal.</p>

<p>For this Security Rapid Impact Competition a submitted Innovation Outline is required prior to full proposal submission.

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Innovation Focus Areas</h2>

<p>Whilst <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> are interested in funding all sorts of projects, we also have some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-innovation-focus-areas">Innovation Focus Areas</a>(IFAs) which are enduring challenges faced by our defence and security customers. They are often broad in scope and will always be open for a minimum of two open call cycles.  If you are interested in any of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-innovation-focus-areas">Innovation Focus Areas</a>, please check the relevant <abbr title="Innovation Focus Area">IFA</abbr> unique identifier number when creating your submission.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>What should be included in your proposal?</h2>

<p>When submitting a proposal, you must complete all sections of the online form, including an appropriate level of technical information to allow assessment of the bid and a completed finances section. It is also helpful to include a list of other current or recent government funding you may have received in this area if appropriate, making it clear how this proposal differs from this work.</p>

<p>A project plan with clear milestones and deliverables must be provided. Deliverables must be well defined and designed to provide evidence of progress against the project plan and the end-point for this phase; they must include a final report. You should also plan for attendance at a kick-off meeting at the start of the project and a close down meeting at the end of project.  Your proposal must demonstrate how you will complete all activities/services and provide all deliverables within the timescales. Proposals with any deliverables (including final report) outside the competition timeline will be rejected as non-compliant.</p>

<p>A resourcing plan must also be provided that identifies, where possible, the nationalities of those proposed research workers that you intend to work on the project. In the event of proposals being recommended for funding, <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> reserves the right to undertake due diligence checks including the clearance of proposed research workers. Please note that this process will take as long as necessary and could take up to 6 weeks in some cases for non-UK nationals.</p>

<p>You must identify any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-ethical-legal-and-regulatory-guidance">ethical / legal / regulatory factors</a> within your proposal and how the associated risks will be managed, including break points in the project if approvals are not received. MODREC approvals can take up to 5 months therefore you should plan your work programme accordingly. If you are unsure if your proposal will need to apply for MODREC approval, then please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-a-dasa-innovation-partner">Contact <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr></a> for guidance.</p>

<p>Requirements for access to Government Furnished Assets (<abbr title="government-furnished assets">GFA</abbr>), for example, information, equipment, materials and facilities, should be included in your proposal. <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> cannot guarantee that <abbr title="government-furnished assets">GFA</abbr> will be available so please propose a substitute if available.</p>

<p>Failure to provide any of the above listed will automatically render your proposal non-compliant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Public facing information</h3>

<p>When submitting your proposal, you will be required to include a proposal title and a short abstract. The title and abstract you provide will be used by <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr>, and other government departments, to describe the project and its intended outcomes and benefits. It will be used for inclusion at <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> events and included in documentation such as brochures.

<span class="number">8.1 </span>Cyber risk assessment</h3>

<p>On receipt of a âFundâ decision, successful suppliers must submit a Supplier Assurance Questionnaire (SAQ). The SAQ allows suppliers to demonstrate compliance with the specified risk level and the corresponding profile in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-for-defence-suppliers-def-stan-05-138">Def Stan 05-138</a>, the levels of controls required will depend on this risk level.</p>

<p>Successful Suppliers will be emailed a Risk Assessment Reference (RAR) number and corresponding risk level, and must use this to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=7WB3vlNZS0iuldChbfoJ5Tv4OR9pb0BHial1Ag-WKXVUOFk3Sk9SS0JDQ0FRWjhYNDhTVldHUDJaNy4u" rel="external">complete a SAQ here</a>. The completed SAQ form and resulting email response from Defence Cyber Protection Partnership (DCPP) must be downloaded and returned to <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr>. Further guidance can be found at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dcpp-cyber-security-model-industry-buyer-and-supplier-guide">DCPP: Cyber Security Model industry buyer and supplier guide</a>.</p>

<p>If the SAQ reveals deficiencies then a Cyber Implementation Plan (CIP) is needed and requires approval before a contract can be awarded.</p>
