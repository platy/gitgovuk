<h4>Q: Can consortia submit proposals or should they be from individual companies?</h4>

<p>A: We welcome proposals from consortia, but there must be an identified Lead Applicant that will submit the proposal. Any participating entities should be identified as sub-contractors. We encourage all parties to provide a reasonable breakdown of their tasks, deliverables and costs, including sub-contracts, in order to enable DASA Assessors to determine which entity is working on which part of the project, and the value for money.</p>

<h4>Q: Could you explain the process once you have submitted, and how do you prioritise proposals to be funded? What feedback do you give to the customer /bidder?</h4>

<p>A: Once you have submitted your proposal, it will pass through an initial sift. At this stage, your proposal may be rejected if it does not meet the competition terms of reference (such as non-compliance with DASA terms and conditions). After the initial sifting process, experts from across UK government will be assigned to assess your proposal. During the assessment phase all proposals are assessed against the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>desirable: strategic fit, end user support/pull</li>
  <li>feasible: technical credibility, innovation, risk, expertise of team/capability</li>
  <li>viable: costs and value for money, project delivery/plan</li>
</ul>

<p>After assessment, a moderator will compile an overview of all assessments, pulling together comments to provide a collective outcome in the form of a ‘Fund’ or ‘No Fund’ recommendation against the proposal. Governement stakeholders/moderators are invited to challenge the ‘Fund’ or ‘No Fund recommendation made against each proposal. Challengers should present their argument both in written form for circulation and at the decision conference. At the decision conference, key stakeholders come together to discuss the recommendations and a decision is made against each proposal.</p>

<p>Suppliers who receive a ‘Fund’ decision will be contacted by DASA commercial to answer any clarification questions and finalise the contracts. Moderators provide feedback for ‘No Fund’ proposals which is subsequently reviewed by DASA and released by the commercial team.</p>

<p>Full details covering the asssessment process can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-how-your-proposal-is-assessed">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Q: Can an application be lead by an academic institution or must it be industry?</h4>

<p>A: Any entity can be a lead applicant.</p>

<h4>Q: Do I have to speak to an Innovation Partner?</h4>

<p>A: Applicants must engage with an Innovation Partner by submitting an Innovation Outline in advance of submitting a full proposal. The Innovation Outline is a one-page summary of your proposed innovation that enables us to determine the desirability of your proposed innovation, and to engage appropriate assessors to ensure that your proposal is assessed by appropriate technical and operational experts. Innovation Partners will relay feedback on your Innovation Outline in order to enable you to take an informed decision on whether or not to submit a full proposal.</p>

<h4>Q: When is the deadline for next round?</h4>

<p>A: The DASA Open Call runs throughout the year, with five cycles. Cycle closting dates can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/defence-and-security-accelerator-dasa-open-call-for-innovation/open-call-competition-document#competition-closing-dates">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Q: If I’ve got an idea that’s been developed for another sector, might that be eligible for this funding?</h4>

<p>A: We welcome proposals that seek to adapt existing capability from other sectors for use in the security domain.</p>

<h4>Q: In the application, can we upload data such as videos or images to help provide evidence of the potential technology?</h4>

<p>A: We welcome the submission of images and documents as annexes to your proposal. Videos cannot be submitted.</p>

<h4>Q: Are there maximum lengths in words for each of the 5 sections?</h4>

<p>A: There is no word limit for the three sections of the proposal covering desirability, feasibility and viability. Assessors are expected to be able to read and assess your proposal in 60-90 minutes, so the length of the proposal should correspond to this target timeframe. The project plan is typically uploaded as a separate attachment, and the costs section of the proposal consists of completing a table.</p>

<h4>Q: Registering for a DASA account requires a DUNS number - is there a workaround for applicants looking to incorporate their entity a bit later?</h4>

<p>A: We require a DUNS number for registration in order to manage multiple instances of the same entity. We suggest that suppliers who are not yet ready to incorporate contact DASA through the enquiry form and speak to an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://accelerator-community.force.com/s/enquiry-form" rel="external">Innovation Partner</a>.</p>

<h4>Q: How many proposals can I put in, is there a limit?</h4>

<p>A: There is no limit on the number of proposals that you can submit. If your proposal is unsuccessful, and you resubmit the same proposal in another cycle, then we would expect you to identify how you have taken feedback into consideration in order to improve your proposal.</p>

<h4>Q: In terms of IP and disclosure. If we have something that is very new how do we help the reviewer understand it is real?</h4>

<p>A: Security Rapid Impact Innovations is targeted at capabilities that are expected to reach TRL 6/7 by the end of the contract. As such, we would not expect to receive applications at the lowest end of the TRL scale unless there is a clear and credible plan to move rapidly through the TRL scale. We welcome the submission of diagrams or images in order to help explain the nature of your innovation. We also use the Innovation Outline process to find appropriate assessors across government with relevant technical expertise to ensure that we have the right people assessing your proposal.</p>

<h4>Q: Do we have to involve an industrial partner in the bid?</h4>

<p>A: An industrial partner is not mandated. We welcome applications from sole traders, SMEs, large organisations and academia. As part of your proposal, we encourage you to elaborate on the planned exploitation route for your innovation in order to take it to market. This may involve partnership with other entities to further develop, manufacture and support your innovation.</p>

<h4>Q: What is the process for Government Furnished Asset request? Can we have this in the viability and as a back up?</h4>

<p>A: Proposals should identify any need for Government Furnished Assets (GFA), including Government Furnished Information (GFI). Should GFA not be granted, the proposal should identify suitable alternatives</p>

<h4>Q: If we don’t have a suitable partner from industry, can DASA help with this?</h4>

<p>A: DASA supports funded suppliers in developing partnerships through a number of activities, including business-to-business brokering and showcases at exhibitions. If you are applying for funding and you do not have an industrial partner, you may wish to speak to an Innovation Partner to understand how best to demonstrate the credibility of the exploitation route of your innovation.</p>

<h4>Q: How do we best understand specific needs in security at this point?</h4>

<p>A: The DASA Open Call intentionally avoids highlighting specific security needs in order to encourage the widest possible range of submissions - including those that the Government may not have already identified. Guidance on departmental research priorities can be found on departmental websites. For example, ‘Areas of Research Relevant to the Home Office’ can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/home-office-areas-of-research-interest/home-office-areas-of-research-interest">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Q: Is there any requirement to use resources in the UK?  Or can we use engineers that are outside the UK for a project?</h4>

<p>A: We welcome applications from entities outside the UK, both in terms of the country in which they are incorporated and the location of their employees.</p>

<p>A resourcing plan must be provided that identifies, where possible, the nationalities of those proposed research workers that you intend to work on the project. In the event of proposals being recommended for funding, DASA reserves the right to undertake due diligence checks including the clearance of proposed research workers. Please note that this process will take as long as necessary and could take up to 6 weeks in some cases for non-UK nationals.</p>

<h4>Q: How do I evidence work at a higher classification/with classified partners?</h4>

<p>A: Information submitted through the DASA portal should be at OFFICIAL only. If you would like to submit information at a higher classification in order to support your application then please contact your Innovation Partner for guidance.</p>

<h4>Q: Are submissions made under an NDA? If we disclose an invention that is currently trade secret &amp; pre-patent can we ensure we do not compromise the patent process?</h4>

<p>A: DASA recognises the value of your intellectual property (IP). We use a number of safeguards to protect the information you provide to us in your proposals, whilst allowing proper scrutiny of your submissions by our expert assessors, facilitating effective collaboration, and achieving appropriate transparency of how public money is being spent.</p>

<p>Further guidance on how we use the information that you submit to us can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance#your-proposal">here</a>.</p>
