<p>Applications will be reviewed by a recruitment panel, which will include civil servants, <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> signers and an impartial external advisor. We may then invite you to interview. Recommendations will be made to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who will make the decision on appointments.</p>
