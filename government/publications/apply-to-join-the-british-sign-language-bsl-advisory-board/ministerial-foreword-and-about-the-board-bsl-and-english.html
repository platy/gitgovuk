<h2>Ministerial foreword</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGz4x3yVwxk" rel="external">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGz4x3yVwxk</a></p>

<p>The passing of the British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>) Act (2022) has given <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> the legal recognition it deserves and for which Deaf people have campaigned for many years.</p>

<p>The work now begins to implement the Act, to guide government departments on understanding their duties, to support departments in their use of <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> across public communications and to publicly report on our progress. Integral to this is ensuring the needs of <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> signers are at the heart of what we do.</p>

<p>We are establishing the <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> Advisory Board so that <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> signers can advise on the implementation of the Act and in doing so bring together their lived experience from across England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p>I was delighted to support the British Sign Language Bill through Parliament and I extend my thanks to Rosie Cooper <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr> and all who have campaigned so hard to get us here. I look forward to continuing to work with <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> signers in ensuring the Act is fully implemented and that we better understand and offer solutions to barriers to inclusion for all who have <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> as their language.</p>

<h2>Overview of the Board</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69DqcvQoywc" rel="external">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69DqcvQoywc</a></p>

<p>A British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>) Advisory Board is being established to help advise the government on the implementation of the British Sign Language Act 2022. This Act legally recognises <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> as a language of England, Wales and Scotland. It requires government departments to report on how they are ensuring accessibility of their communications through the use of <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>.</p>

<p>This is a new and unique opportunity, which will involve <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> signers in helping government services to be more accessible to Deaf people. Members of the <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> Advisory Board will also guide on wider issues affecting <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>, such as the availability and supply of interpreters.</p>

<p>Members will use their expertise and experience to help ensure the voices of Deaf people are recognised and valued in a way that informs policy and strategy across government. It is an excellent opportunity for people to gain knowledge and experience of cross-government policy, along with an understanding of the delivery of those policies in front-line services.</p>

<p>We are recruiting for board members and an independent co-chairperson.</p>

<p>We welcome applications from people with experience of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>signing <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> as their first language, as a Deaf person</li>
  <li>signing <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> as their second language as a parent of Deaf child(ren) or as a child of Deaf adult (<abbr title="Children of deaf adults">CODA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>working as a qualified and registered interpreter or translator</li>
  <li>working for an organisation which represents, supports or advocates for <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> signers</li>
  <li>working with Deaf children and young people as a Teacher using <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>
</li>
  <li>using tactile or hands-on <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> as a first or primary language</li>
</ul>

<p>The closing date for applications is 5pm on Friday 2 September 2022.</p>

<h2>Terms of reference</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRtEaWEUkF4" rel="external">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRtEaWEUkF4</a></p>

<p>The <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> Advisory Board is a new expert committee which will advise the government on the implementation of the <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> Act and other matters important to <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> signers. The Board will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>advise on the production of guidance for government departments on the use of <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> in public communications and policy delivery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>examine the remit and reach of the British Sign Language Report and make suggestions for the Secretary of State for the Department of Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) to consider when detailing the progress of government departments in their use of <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> in their communications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>advise on how to increase the numbers of qualified and registered <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> interpreters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be a platform to represent the views of the Deaf community to benefit the government’s understanding of the needs of <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> signers and how to progress implementation of the Act – this may involve setting up working groups or hosting a focus group</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is not a decision making body. It will not advise on matters devolved to the Scottish and Welsh governments.</p>

<h3>Membership of the board</h3>

<p>The first term of the Board will be from 2022 to 2025. The Board will be chaired jointly by an independent chairperson and a senior civil servant.</p>

<p>The Board will be composed of mainly Deaf&nbsp;<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>&nbsp;signers from across the regions of England, with one member from Wales, one member from Scotland and one person who is a tactile signer.</p>

<p>Members will be appointed for 3 years, reviewed annually by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and will be expected to attend all meetings.</p>

<p>Where possible, the Board will encompass regional variations in <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> and a range of lived experiences. This will include experiences of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>parents of Deaf children</li>
  <li><abbr title="Children of deaf adults">CODA</abbr></li>
  <li>being qualified and registered interpreter&nbsp;or translator</li>
  <li>being a tactile signer</li>
  <li>representing organisations instrumental in the <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> Act Now! campaign</li>
</ul>

<p>All external appointments will be made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions following an open recruitment process. A reserve list of suitably qualified applicants may be established and maintained in order to fill any vacancies which may arise over the term of the board.</p>

<h3>Operation of the board</h3>

<p>The Board will meet 4 times a year and will be a mix of in-person and online meetings. The length of meetings may vary depending on the agenda, but will usually be between 2 to 3 hours, on a weekday.</p>

<p>The board will publish information on its activities online in both <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> and English and will operate as a dual language Board, with all meetings being held in both languages.</p>

<p>The secretariat of the <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> Advisory Board is the Cabinet Office Disability Unit. The sponsoring department is <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>
