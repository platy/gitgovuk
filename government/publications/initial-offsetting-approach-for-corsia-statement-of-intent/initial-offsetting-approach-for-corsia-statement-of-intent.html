<h2>Context and approach</h2>

<p>This statement of intent sets out the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government’s initial approach to implementation of the offsetting requirements of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (<abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>) in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<p>The corresponding draft legislation is published alongside this document. As draft legislation, it will be subject to further legal review, particularly following any feedback on this statement of intent.</p>

<p>This legislation is not expected to have a material impact on aeroplane operators, but the government welcomes any comments and queries from stakeholders who may have questions or concerns. These comments should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:corsiaconsultation@dft.gov.uk">corsiaconsultation@dft.gov.uk</a> by 21 July 2022.</p>

<h3><abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr></h3>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> recognises the importance of international action to tackle emissions from international aviation and has been instrumental in agreeing and developing a global offsetting scheme, <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>, aimed at meeting the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (<abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr>’s) medium-term climate change goal of carbon neutral growth from 2020 (<abbr title="carbon neutral growth from 2020">CNG2020</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> requires qualifying aeroplane operators to offset their growth in international aviation carbon dioxide (<abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>) emissions covered by the scheme above 2019 levels.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> The growth in emissions will be offset by purchasing and cancelling emissions units. One unit is equivalent to one tonne of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> equivalent emissions avoided or removed from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Under the scheme, aeroplane operators are required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monitor and report emissions on all international flights (subject to exemption thresholds)</li>
  <li>offset the growth above the baseline in emissions from flights between participating states by purchasing and cancelling eligible emission units generated by projects that reduce emissions in other sectors (for example, renewable energy)</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> is divided into 3 phases. States may volunteer for the pilot phase (2021 to 2023) and first phase (2024 to 2026), meaning that all qualifying aeroplane operators operating on routes between participating states will be subject to offsetting requirements. The second phase (2027 to 2035) will include all <abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr> states, subject to exemptions.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> confirmed its participation in <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> from the start of the pilot phase, along with 87 other states.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> From 2022, a total of 107 states have volunteered to participate in the scheme, representing nearly 80% of international aviation activity.</p>

<p>As a contracting state of&nbsp;<abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr>, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is obliged to adopt the relevant&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://elibrary.icao.int/home/product-details/229739#page=1" rel="external">Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs)</a>&nbsp;relating to&nbsp;<abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>&nbsp;into domestic law.</p>

<p>Following a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/implementing-the-carbon-offsetting-and-reduction-scheme-for-international-aviation">consultation on implementing <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a> in 2021, the monitoring, reporting and verification (<abbr title="monitoring, reporting and verification">MRV</abbr>) requirements of <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> (chapters 1 and 2 of the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> SARPs) were implemented into <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/534/contents/made" rel="external">Air Navigation (<abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>) Order 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Aeroplane operators have been monitoring and reporting their international emissions since 2019 to set the baseline emissions level for the scheme and, from 2021, to determine any offsetting obligations. Guidance to help <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/corsia-how-to-comply"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-administered aeroplane operators comply with their obligations under the scheme</a> has also been published.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> offsetting requirements</h3>

<p>Further secondary legislation is required to implement <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>’s offsetting requirements (chapters 3 and 4 of the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> SARPs). This forms the second stage of <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> implementation in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Qualifying aeroplane operators operating flights between states participating in <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> are subject to offsetting requirements. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/state-pairs.aspx" rel="external">list of these states</a> can be found on <abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr>’s website.</p>

<p>Aeroplane operators’ <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> offsetting obligations are calculated on an annual basis. From 2021 to 2029, this calculation is based on the international aviation sector’s global growth in emissions above the baseline each year, or the ‘sectoral growth factor’. The sectoral growth factor will be confirmed by <abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr> by October of the following year. From 2030 onwards, this calculation will also take into account each individual aeroplane operator’s growth in emissions.</p>

<p>Aeroplane operators will comply with their offsetting obligations by purchasing and cancelling <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> eligible emission units generated by projects that reduce emissions in other sectors (for example, renewable energy), with one unit representing one tonne of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> equivalent emissions avoided or removed from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr> Council has approved a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/CORSIA-Emissions-Units.aspx" rel="external">list of emissions units</a> that can be used for compliance with <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>. The Council’s decision is informed by a recommendation from a Technical Advisory Body and guided by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/CORSIA-Emissions-Units.aspx" rel="external"><abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> Emissions Units Eligibility Criteria</a>.</p>

<p>Compliance with <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> offsetting obligations takes place within 3-year compliance cycles. For example, aeroplane operators will be required to cancel enough eligible emissions units to cover their total offsetting obligations for the 2021 to 2023 compliance period by January 2025 and submit a verified emissions unit cancellation report to their regulator by the end of April 2025. This then repeats on a 3-year cycle.</p>

<h3>Interaction between <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Emissions Trading Scheme (<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>We recognise that the implementation of <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>’s offsetting requirements will need to work in conjunction with the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/participating-in-the-uk-ets"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Emissions Trading Scheme (<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>&nbsp;ETS)</a>,&nbsp;as legislated for by the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2020/9780348209761/contents" rel="external">Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020</a>&nbsp;(‘the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>&nbsp;ETS&nbsp;Order’).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> was established on 1 January 2021 and, for aviation, it currently covers flights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>between the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and Gibraltar</li>
  <li>departing the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Flights from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> are, therefore, in scope of both <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> and the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority is also consulting on expanding the current scope of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> to cover <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to Switzerland flights. Should this be implemented, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to Switzerland flights will, similarly, be in scope of both <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developing-the-uk-emissions-trading-scheme-uk-ets">Developing the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Emissions Trading Scheme (<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>)</a> for further detail.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/implementing-the-carbon-offsetting-and-reduction-scheme-for-international-aviation">2021 <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> consultation</a>, therefore, also included 6 high-level options for how <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> could interact with the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> on flights in scope of both schemes. Without policy action, <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions above the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> baseline on flights from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> would incur obligations from both the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> and <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>. We are carefully considering responses to the consultation.</p>

<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) significantly reduced the aviation sector’s activity and its emissions and, as such, it is unlikely that aeroplane operators will accrue <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> offsetting obligations in the pilot phase as their emissions are likely to remain below the 2019 baseline. While the speed of the sector’s recovery remains uncertain, recent estimates confirm that international aviation activity in 2023 is likely to remain below 2019 levels<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> and hence there is unlikely to be any real overlap in obligations with the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> in this period.</p>

<p>In light of the impact of COVID-19 on emissions and expected <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> offsetting requirements, the government is carefully considering its approach to implementing <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> alongside the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority recently published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developing-the-uk-emissions-trading-scheme-uk-ets">consultation on future development of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr></a>, including proposals to align the cap with a net zero consistent trajectory. We believe it is right that responses to this consultation and plans for the future direction of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> are appropriately considered when determining how <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> should interact with the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>We are seeking to have all legislation for <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> and any consequential amendments that may be required to the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> in force by the start of 2024. We will consult again on the details of our interaction approach in due course, ahead of introducing further legislation. A summary of initial stakeholder views on interaction between <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> and the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>, in response to our first consultation, will be published as part of that consultation.</p>

<p>While recent estimates do not predict that aeroplane operators will accrue <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> offsetting obligations during the pilot phase, the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> SARPs require states to calculate and inform aeroplane operators of their <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> offsetting obligations in respect of 2021 emissions by 30 November 2022.</p>

<p>We are proposing to provide a legal obligation for this in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law through a short amending Order (‘the 2022 Order’) to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/534/contents/made" rel="external">Air Navigation (<abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>) Order 2021</a> in line with our commitment to implement the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> SARPs and while further consideration is given to interaction between <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> and the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Section 2 outlines the provisions in the 2022 Order, a draft of which is published alongside this document. The 2022 Order will implement <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>’s offsetting requirements in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law in respect of 2021 emissions only. Further secondary legislation will be required to implement <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>’s offsetting requirements for the full duration of the scheme and to clarify any interaction between <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> and the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Planned legislation</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>This section outlines the provisions covered in the amending 2022 Order to the existing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/534/contents/made" rel="external">Air Navigation (<abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>) Order 2021</a> (‘the 2021 Order’), a draft of which is available alongside this document. The 2022 Order will implement elements of Chapter 3 within Part II of Annex 16, Volume IV of the Chicago Convention (the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> SARPs).</p>

<p>The draft 2022 Order implements <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>’s offsetting requirements in respect of 2021 emissions only, thereby providing a legal obligation for regulators to notify <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-administered aeroplane operators of their 2021 offsetting requirements by 30 November 2022, as required by the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> SARPs.</p>

<p>As outlined previously, aeroplane operators are not expected to accrue any <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> offsetting obligations in respect of 2021 emissions, given that the impact of COVID-19 means international aviation emissions were below the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> baseline.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Therefore, the 2022 <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> Order is not expected to have a material impact. It aims to provide legal certainty of the 2021 <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> offsetting requirements for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-administered airlines. As noted, further legislation will be required to implement <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>’s offsetting requirements for the full duration of the scheme.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> offsetting requirements</h3>

<p>The 2022 Order implements the offsetting requirements for the 2021 scheme year in article 21, which inserts new articles 41A and 41B into the 2021 Order.</p>

<p>Provisions for the applicability of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> offsetting requirements for the 2021 scheme year are contained in article 41A and follow the provisions outlined in paragraph 3.1 of the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> SARP that are relevant to the 2021 scheme year.</p>

<p>The offsetting requirements only apply to an aeroplane operator<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> with international flights between states as defined in the <abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr> document entitled <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/state-pairs.aspx" rel="external"><abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> States for Chapter 3 State Pairs</a>. For the 2021 scheme year, this will be the list of states participating in <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Provisions for the calculation of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> offsetting requirements for the 2021 scheme year are contained in article 41B and follow the provisions outlined in paragraph 3.2 of the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> SARP that are relevant to the 2021 scheme year. This article covers the calculation used by Regulators<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> to determine an aeroplane operator’s <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> offsetting requirements for the 2021 scheme year.</p>

<h3>Additional amendments to the 2021 Order</h3>

<p>It should be noted when considering the 2022 Order that the SI also contains small amendments to the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> <abbr title="monitoring, reporting and verification">MRV</abbr> provisions contained in the existing 2021 Order. These amendments are outlined here for clarity and are separate to the introduction of <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>’s offsetting requirements for the 2021 scheme year. They do not have a material effect on the impact of the draft Order.</p>

<p>A number of small non-reportable errors identified in the 2021 Order, with regard to terminology use and consistency of language, are corrected as part of the 2022 Order.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>An addition to existing provisions in the 2021 Order covering aeroplane operators’ Emissions Monitoring Plans is contained in article 26(6). This mirrors a provision in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1265/contents/made" rel="external">Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020 (<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Order)</a> and intends to reduce administrative burden for regulators and aeroplane operators.</p>

<p>Provisions for calculating emissions reductions from the use of <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> eligible fuels were consulted on and implemented in article 32 of the 2021 Order. The 2022 Order moves these provisions to article 41C, to align with their placement in Chapter 3.3 of the <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> SARPs.</p>

<h2>What will happen next</h2>

<p>It’s proposed that the draft 2022 Order, including any amendments that may be considered necessary as a result of stakeholder comments or internal review, will be made and enter force by November 2022.</p>

<p>Further secondary legislation will be required to implement <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr>’s offsetting requirements and related enforcement provisions for the full duration of the scheme and clarify any interaction between <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> and the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>. We plan to consult again in due course, aiming to have all legislation for <abbr title="carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation">CORSIA</abbr> and any consequential amendments that may be required to the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> in force by the start of 2024.</p>
