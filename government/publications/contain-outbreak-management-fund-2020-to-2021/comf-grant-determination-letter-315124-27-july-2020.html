<h2>Annex B: grant conditions</h2>

<p>1. In 2-tier areas, this grant is conditional on upper-tier authorities working closely with their lower-tier partners and ensuring those partners are given opportunities to deliver the outcomes this grant is meant to support where delivery by those partners would be the most efficient and cost-effective means of delivery. In those cases, it is essential that upper-tier authorities provide sufficient resources to lower-tier authorities within the former’s allocated funding (see Annex A) so that the latter can carry out any responsibilities that they are asked to undertake.</p>

<p>2. The Chief Executive and Chief Internal Auditor of each of the recipient authorities are required to sign and return to the Contain Outbreak Management Fund Team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Covid-19LAfundingrequests@dhsc.gov.uk">Covid-19LAfundingrequests@dhsc.gov.uk</a> the declaration below, by 30 June 2022.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">To the best of our knowledge and belief, and having carried out appropriate investigations and checks, in our opinion, in all significant respects, the conditions attached to the ‘Local authority Test and Trace Contain Outbreak Management Fund surge funding grant determination 2020 to 2021: No 31/5124’ have been complied with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3. If an authority fails to comply with any of the conditions and requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2, the Minister of State may either:</p>

<p>a) reduce, suspend or withhold grant</p>

<p>b) by notification in writing to the authority, require the repayment of the whole or any part of the grant</p>

<p>4. Any sum notified by the Minister of State under paragraph 3(b) shall immediately become repayable to the Minister.</p>
