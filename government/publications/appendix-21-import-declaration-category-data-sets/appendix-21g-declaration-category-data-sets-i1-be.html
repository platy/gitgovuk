<p>The following table identifies the requirements for completion of the appropriate data elements on an I1 B&amp;E simplified declaration (on an occasional basis).</p>

<p>Where a Commodity Code requires completion of data elements that are not part of this data set, then the import simplified declaration on an occasional basis cannot be used.</p>

<p>In addition, claims to Quota or Authorisation by Customs Declaration cannot be made using the I1 B&amp;E data set. In these circumstances an alternative declaration category data set must be used.</p>
