<p>Closing date for full proposals: 7th July 2022 at 16.00</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.1 </span>1. Scope of Call</h3>

<p>The UK has made a major investment in ESA’s Exploration Programme and the UK Space Agency wishes to secure the benefits from this investment. Exploration covers the regions where humans do, or may, in the near future, live and work, namely Low Earth Orbit, the Moon and Mars.  Therefore, the UK Space Agency is making funding available to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fund science research that utilises data from Mars exploration missions (Including ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter, NASA’s Insight lander, Perseverance and other Mars exploration missions), or underpins future Mars exploration missions. This can include supporting science operations of current rover missions.</li>
  <li>Support scientists selected for groups and/or science teams, campaign science groups and other definition work related to Exploration missions (including Mars Sample Return, Artemis and Lunar Gateway and other Moon and Mars exploration missions).  This would be for travel and subsistence, and the scientists time to participate in meetings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lunar science and the exploitation of data from Lunar missions is within the remit of STFC and is not within the scope of this call.</p>

<p>Exploitation of data collected on the International Space Station and other ESA SciSpace facilities where the experiment is focussed on work that is within the remit of UKRI is not within the scope of this call.</p>

<p>There will be a separate Exploration technology call for instrument feasibility studies and TRL raising activities and should not be applied for here.</p>

<p>Prospective applicants may discuss with the Agency prior to submission if they are uncertain about whether their proposal fits this call.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.2 </span>2. Aims and Objectives</h3>

<p>This scheme is open to academics and individual scientists from the UK or overseas, working at UK Research Organisations, for proposals to fund:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fellowships - to develop promising early career researchers or allow existing academics to discipline-hop.</li>
  <li>Post Doctorate Research Assistants</li>
  <li>Studentships</li>
  <li>Support for&nbsp;academics, including involvement in international working groups</li>
</ul>

<p>Although extensions to current fellowships will be considered, preference will be given to new fellowships.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.3 </span>3. Award Duration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For PDRAs and studentships, awards will normally be for no more than three years;</li>
  <li>Fellowships will be offered for no more than 36 months in total but could be held part-time for up to six years.</li>
  <li>Support for academics must be justified and of reasonable length in relation to the mission.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.4 </span>4. Award value</h3>

<p>Awards will be made in line with standard STFC criteria for PDRAs, fellowships and studentships.</p>

<p>This is funding from the UK Space Agency, though it is administered through STFC&nbsp;on behalf of the UK Space Agency. Awards will be made in line with standard STFC criteria, in accordance with their financial rules (including the&nbsp;standard FEC&nbsp;application and for the length of the grant&nbsp;– please make sure you and your institution are fully aware of these before application - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukri.org/apply-for-funding/before-you-apply/your-responsibilities-if-you-get-funding/meeting-ukri-terms-and-conditions-for-funding/#contents-list" rel="external">https://www.ukri.org/apply-for-funding/before-you-apply/your-responsibilities-if-you-get-funding/meeting-ukri-terms-and-conditions-for-funding/#contents-list</a>.</p>

<p>Reasonable costs will be permitted, but it should be noted that all costs must be justified and that the appropriateness and justification of sums requested will form part of the assessment criteria.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.5 </span>5. Grant payment</h3>

<p>Payments will be made to the research organisation quarterly and the first payment will be made once the formal offer letter has been accepted by the research organisation.</p>

<p>The final payment will be made after the submission of the final reconciliation report at the end of the grant.&nbsp; These processes are administered by STFC, please note that UKSA remains the funder.</p>

  <li>In using the UK Space Agency’s name and logo, the Grant Recipient shall comply with all reasonable branding guidelines issued by the UK Space Agency from time to time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.8 </span>8. Monitoring and Evaluation and Reporting</h3>

<p>All grants awarded will require the awardee to report on impacts and outcomes annually through the ResearchFish process<a class="govuk-link" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> as per UKRI grant terms and conditions, both during the grant period and for 5 years afterwards.</p>

<p>In addition, during the grant period, quarterly written reports will be required to be provided to the UK Space Agency detailing the activity carried out within the scope of the grant. Regular progress meetings will also be held between the grant holder and the UK Space Agency to monitor and evaluate progress for the length of the grant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.9 </span>9. Proposal Assessment</h3>

<p>In assessing your proposal, the UK Space Agency will seek comment from at least two additional referees, to which you will be able to respond. This will be a formal peer review process where relevant academic leaders will be asked to comment on your proposal. You will be given opportunity to respond to reviewer comments before the formal Review Panel takes place.</p>

<p>Please note: It may take up to 6 months for the UK Space Agency to complete the evaluation process. A final assessment and ranking of proposals will be made by a Review Panel which will draw experience across a broad range of science disciplines and representatives of UK Space Agency.</p>

<p>In considering the proposal, the panel will use the following criteria:</p>
