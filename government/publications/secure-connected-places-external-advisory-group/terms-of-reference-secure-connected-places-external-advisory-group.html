<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Terms of reference</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Purpose</h3>

<p>The Secure Connected Places External Advisory Group (“the Group”) brings together experts and experienced practitioners to inform recommendations given to ministers on policy relating to the Government’s programme on connected places.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Scope</h3>

<p>The responsibilities of the Group are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advise and inform the development of the DCMS-led programme on secure connected places;</li>
  <li>provide insight on policy and delivery challenges facing the programme as it progresses;</li>
  <li>help to steer policy focus towards strategic issues relating to the security of connected places;</li>
  <li>assist in the coordination of engagement and outreach with stakeholders, including those outside of the UK; and</li>
  <li>help with the identification of examples of good practice, both in the UK and abroad</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Role of the chairperson</h3>

<p>The Group will be chaired independently by Prof. Greg Clark (Chair, Connected Places Catapult). The Chair will be provided with a briefing from DCMS officials, providing further information on the proposed discussions, in order to assist with their responsibilities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Membership</h3>

<p>Membership of the Group shall be on the invitation, and with the agreement of both DCMS and the Chairperson. Members of the Group, who should consider themselves independent from Government, will be selected for participation due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their relevant expertise and/or experience;</li>
  <li>their ability to represent the interests of key stakeholder groups; and</li>
  <li>their ability to provide insights into relevant technical or social issues</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a member is unable to attend, they may, with the agreement of the Chair and DCMS, delegate attendance within their organisation. The secretariat of the Group will be available to meet with members following meetings of the Group to facilitate the opportunity for comment should this be appropriate.</p>

<p>Members of the Group will not be remunerated for their participation in the Group. Should there be a need to convene an in-person meeting when circumstances permit, travel expenses will be paid.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Secretariat</h3>

<p>The DCMS Secure Connected Places team will provide the secretariat to the Group, and shall support the work of the Group in its work. Its responsibilities will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>circulating the agenda and papers to members in advance of the meeting;</li>
  <li>recording the minutes of the Group, and circulating these to the members for approval by correspondence or for consideration at the next meeting of the Group; and</li>
  <li>acting as the primary point of contact between the members and DCMS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>Meetings</h3>

<p>The Group will convene virtually every twelve weeks. There may also be additional sub-group meetings within this cycle where appropriate, and where this assists in achieving the objectives of the Group. Any attendance at sub-group meetings will be on a voluntary-basis depending on the interests and expertise of members.</p>

<p>DCMS and other government officials may attend the meetings of the Group to provide updates on their work, to present papers to inform the Group’s advice, or to observe.</p>

<p>Members are welcome to suggest potential topics for discussion during and in between meetings. Topics should ideally be communicated to the Secretariat prior to them being tabled for being a potential topic at a meeting. The discussion of these topics will be agreed by the secretariat, the Chairperson, and the government’s Secure Connected Places Steering Board.</p>

<p>Agenda items will be supported by concise papers. These papers will be approved for distribution by the Secretariat and the Chairpersons, and circulated at least one week in advance of the meeting.</p>

<p>Minutes will be drafted by DCMS and circulated to all members within one week of the meeting. Members will be given the opportunity to approve the minutes by correspondence and at the next meeting of the Group. Meetings of the Group will take place under Chatham House rules, and so attendees should not expect their contributions to be ascribed to them in the formal record.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span>Permissions</h3>

<p>Members will be asked to consent to the publication of the minutes and membership list of the Group. The Government will not publish these on a routine basis and will only do so on the request of a third party.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span>Review points</h3>

<p>The Terms of Reference, membership and operation of the Group will be reviewed at regular intervals to ensure they remain appropriate.</p>

<p>The Chairperson, in conjunction with the government Steering Board, will have ultimate approval of these terms of reference and of membership of the Group.</p>
