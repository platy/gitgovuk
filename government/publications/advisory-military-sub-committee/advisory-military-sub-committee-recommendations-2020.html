<p>The independent Advisory Military Sub-Committee (AMSC) offers advice to the Committee on the Grant of Honours Decorations and Medals (the HD Committee) on historic military medals claims, including cases which may not have been previously considered or where new evidence has emerged. The HD Committee is the principal body with responsibility for making recommendations on honours, awards, and medals.</p>

<p>The AMSC have made recommendations on the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Request for granting a Bomber Command Star for aircrew who served with Bomber Command during the Second World War to replace the Bomber Command Clasp that was introduced in 2013.</li>
  <li>Request for granting of a Clasp to the 1939-45 Star for personnel who served as part of the British Expeditionary Force during the period 2 September 1939 to 31 May 1940.</li>
</ul>

<p>The AMSC has an independent Chair, and independent Membership. It has considered both cases carefully, including submissions from relevant interested external parties. The AMSC’s recommendation to the HD Committee for the cases listed above was not to award a Star or a Clasp. The HD Committee has accepted this advice.</p>

<p>In the case of Bomber Command, the AMSC considered the decision taken in 2012 by the Military Medals Review to recommend the introduction of a Bomber Command Clasp (for wear on the 1939-45 Star), rather than a bespoke Bomber Command Star. The AMSC concluded the recommendation in 2012  was sound and that there were no grounds to recommend the decision be overturned and a Bomber Command Star be introduced.</p>

<p>In considering the case of the British Expeditionary Force, the AMSC noted the historic position taken not to award clasps for service in each specific battle and/or campaign during WW2, and that consequently only a very limited number of clasps had been awarded. The AMSC also noted that service with the British Expeditionary Force resulted in the 1939-45 Star being awarded without the customary six-months service rule applying, in particular in France or Belgium between 10 May and 19 June 1940. Having considered these factors, the AMSC concluded that there was no basis to recommend a British Expeditionary Force Clasp be introduced.</p>

<p>The outcome of the AMSCs consideration of these cases in no way diminishes the importance of the contribution of those who served as part of Bomber Command and the British Expeditionary Force during the Second World War.</p>

<p>The process for introducing a new medal and/or clasp is extremely rigorous, and the bar is set high. This therefore means that requests for new military medals and/or clasps are rarely approved.</p>

<p>The AMSC recognises the commitment of campaign groups, and individuals, to ensuring these cases are considered through a formal process and for the evidence provided to the Sub-Committee. More information regarding the role of the AMSC and the process of evaluation can be found in the Sub-Committee’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/830839/Advisory-Military-Sub-Committee-Terms-of-Reference-2019-1-1.pdf" rel="external">Terms of Reference</a>.</p>
