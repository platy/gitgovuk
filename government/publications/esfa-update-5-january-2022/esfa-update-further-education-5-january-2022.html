<span class="number">1. </span>Information: latest on COVID-19 for FE providers</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Resources for FE providers to support encouragement of COVID-19 testing and reporting by FE students</h3>

<p>As all settings are aware, we have asked that FE students and staff take one self-test at home either the evening or morning before they return in January, then continue to test twice weekly at home.</p>

<p>It is important, when testing at home, that test results are reported online to NHS Test &amp; Trace whether positive, negative or void. Reporting results helps the NHS monitor the spread of the virus, combat the virus and save lives.</p>

<p>We have provided a <a rel="external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EALYRVfsXA3iUNSGZ-7glh14UrOQicoC/view" class="govuk-link">toolkit</a> to support you in getting out this messaging, encouraging students to test regularly. The toolkit provides strategies, best practice case studies and online resources to help increase participation levels. This includes sending GOV. UK automatic text reminders to test and report results, working with student groups to encourage testing and incentivising testing through reward schemes.</p>

<p>Colleges may also find it useful to refer to the <a href="https://coronavirusresources.phe.gov.uk/Community-Testing/resources/slef-reporting-toolkit/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">self-reporting toolkit</a>, which is available in a number of <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirusresources.phe.gov.uk/Community-Testing/resources/slef-reporting-toolkit-translations/">translated versions</a>, to help explain to students the importance of reporting all rapid Covid-19 test results as soon as they have them.</p>

<p>Updated guidance and further resources to support you with asymptomatic testing is also available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jYv0MjFyIIbzgPn_1S10OuRgfrj_b5_P" rel="external">secondary schools and colleges document sharing platform</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Colleges are now able to apply for a DFE-funded air cleaning unit</h3>

<p>Following the announcement last weekend, the department is making 7,000 air cleaning units available for poorly ventilated teaching spaces in state-funded education settings, including FE colleges. Applications will be assessed against strict criteria, prioritising spaces with the poorest ventilation to receive units based on criteria such as CO2 levels and occupation density.</p>

<p>SEND settings that were not successful or did not apply in the first round are also eligible to apply in this round. This is in addition to the 1,000 DfE-funded air cleaning units that we announced on 18 November for SEND and Alternative Provision settings.</p>

<p>Settings can now apply for funded units via the online forms below, with applications open until 9am on 17 January:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>SEND settings: <a rel="external" href="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=yXfS-grGoU2187O4s0qC-cTrsVQ_sDZGqR3GQgCYBoFUMFFFUU1CWFhIV0NOQzlMQ04yTEJCSVhDVy4u&amp;web=1&amp;wdLOR=cB2E33B62-D530-4D35-91D9-81A391685242" class="govuk-link">application form for DfE-funded air cleaning units</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Settings with successful applications will be contacted individually to arrange delivery, with deliveries expected from February 2022. For settings which are not eligible for funded units, the <a href="https://s107t01-webapp-v2-01.azurewebsites.net/list/air-cleaning" rel="external" class="govuk-link">online marketplace provides</a> a route to purchasing air cleaning units directly from suppliers at a suitable specification and competitive price.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span>Information: financial assurance, monitoring post-16 funding for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>The post-16 monitoring dashboard is available, following the close of the R04 ILR data submission. View the dashboard online using <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/">View your education data</a>. Thanks to feedback from providers, we’ve made changes to the dashboard so it displays information in a more streamlined and user-friendly format.</p>

<p>We are still moving historic data over to our new model following the close of R14 for the 2021 to 2022 funding year, and this will be available in the dashboard in January. We’ve published a known issues log in the dashboard itself, rather than as a separate document, making it easier to identify any issues or changes being made to data in-year.</p>

<p>Over the coming months we will post hints and tips for getting the most out of the dashboard and will use a wider range of media to support providers, training organisations and employers.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Information: flexi-job apprenticeship pilot scheme</h2>

<p>As announced by the Prime Minister in his 2020 Skills Speech, we are launching a pilot scheme for flexi-job apprenticeships (previously known as portable apprenticeships) beginning in April 2022. Flexi-job apprenticeship put apprentices in the driving seat apprentices and enable them to complete their apprenticeship across multiple short employment contracts.</p>

<p>We are pleased to invite providers to submit an Expression of Interest to engage in the pilot to test an exciting new model of apprenticeship delivery and support ongoing developments in the apprenticeship programme.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://education.app.jaggaer.com/web/login.html" class="govuk-link">Expression of Interest and further details about flexi-job apprenticeships can be found on Jaggear</a>, the DfE’s eSourcing platform.</p>

<p>IFATE has updated the <a href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/developing-new-apprenticeships/revisions-status-report/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Revisions Status Report</a>.

<p>This regular dissemination of information aims to prewarn the sector that new versions are upcoming so it can prepare accordingly and allow IFATE to consult the sector on the appropriate notice period for each version change. It forms part of wider enhancements to the introduction of new versions of apprenticeship standards to the market.</p>
