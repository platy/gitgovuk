      <div class="govspeak">
<p>In 2020, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>), the Environment Agency and Ofwat led a review of the water industry national environment programme (<abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>) ahead of the next price review (<abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr>). They wanted to ensure the next round of <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> actions achieves greater environmental benefits for every pound invested by water companies by using a more outcomes-based approach.</p>

<p>A dedicated <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> taskforce undertook the review and co-developed a series of proposed solutions for redesigning the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005173/Review_of_the_water_industry_national_environment_programme__consultation_document.odt" rel="external">review of the water industry national environment programme consultation document</a> (Environment Agency, <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, Ofwat (July 2021)) asked for comments on the proposed solutions. The consultation document also set out a longer-term roadmap for developing the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> including actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the next price review in 2024</li>
  <li>to consider in future price reviews (2029 and beyond)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> roadmap has been updated to reflect the consultation responses.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> taskforce will continue to work with water companies to achieve the following actions.</p>

<h2>Action 1: Introduce a tiered approach for including schemes in the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</h2>

<p>We will start to use the 3-tiered approach to develop the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> for <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr>. We will use it fully in future price review periods. For <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr>, a list of tier 1 outcomes will be linked to improving river water quality, biodiversity net gain and surface water management.</p>

<p>Water companies can choose how their obligations in these areas are reflected in the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>; either as tier 2 goals, or tier 3 outputs. Every tier 2 goal or tier 3 output will be linked to a tier 1 outcome.</p>

<h3>Actions for <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr> <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The actions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> methodology will set out the tiered approach government and regulators expect to be used by <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> will clearly link all proposed tier 3 outputs and tier 2 goals to tier 1 outcomes</li>
  <li>regulators will set delivery requirements at an outcome level rather than at an output level, as appropriate</li>
  <li>the guidance for options development and for options assessment will specify how water companies should produce a high quality, evidence based <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> programme of best value options â allowing water companies to meet their regulatory obligations and customersâ needs, whilst restoring and increasing natural assets to realise environmental net gains</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action for future <abbr title="water industry national environment programmes">WINEPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Government and regulators will review the policy and change the regulatory framework to further enable a more outcomes-based approach.</p>

<h2>Action 2: Better incorporate long-term planning in the development of the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Actions for <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr> <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The actions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure the environmental actions that water companies propose consider the long term</li>
  <li>companies should plan to a 25-year time horizon to enable options with a longer lead-in time to be included in future programmes of work</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 years of clear actions that align with the next price review period (financial years 2025 to 2030)</li>
  <li>there will be a set of âindicativeâ actions for the following 5 years (financial years 2030 to 2035)</li>
  <li>any actions that are working towards the environmental outcomes identified within longer-term plans (up to 25 years) where there is sufficient evidence to support them</li>
</ul>

<h3>Actions for future <abbr title="water industry national environment programmes">WINEPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Government and regulators will review how to best achieve the objectives of the existing strategic planning frameworks such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>river basin management plans</li>
  <li>drainage and wastewater management plans</li>
  <li>water resources management plans</li>
  <li>flood risk management plans</li>
</ul>

<p>Government and regulators will consider how future <abbr title="water industry national environment programmes">WINEPs</abbr> can incorporate long term planning.</p>

<h2>Action 3: Clearly establish dependencies between the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> and other statutory planning frameworks</h2>

<h3>Actions for <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr> <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Government and regulators will use the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> methodology to show how the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> can achieve outcomes from other statutory planning frameworks.</p>

<p>Water companies will work at a catchment level. They will draw together the long-term goals from other statutory planning frameworks to understand catchment objectives for the next 25 years. This will inform their <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> proposals and business plans.</p>

<p>Water companies will include actions from other planning frameworks in the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> where appropriate to make sure they align with <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr>âs long term strategies and adaptive planning approach.</p>

<h3>Action for future <abbr title="water industry national environment programmes">WINEPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Water companies will make sure <abbr title="water industry national environment programmes">WINEPs</abbr> are aligned to actions in other planning frameworks.</p>

<h2>Action 4: Increase the use of catchment and nature-based solutions</h2>

<h3>Actions for <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr> <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Water companies, the Environment Agency and, where appropriate, Natural England will define the problems to be addressed through the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> with water companies at an appropriate scale, to achieve the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> requirements.</p>

<p>Water companies should consider catchment and nature-based solutions wherever they are feasible and appropriate. They should use them where they present the best value option for the environment.</p>

<p>Regulators will consider new approaches to support greater innovation and use of catchment and nature-based solutions where they are the right solution.</p>

<p>Regulators will consider changing how they regulate catchment and nature-based solutions. They will be in line with relevant position statements or framework documents and supported by the price review framework.</p>

<h3>Actions for future <abbr title="water industry national environment programmes">WINEPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The actions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a natural capital approach will become further integrated into water company decision making</li>
  <li>government will consider changing legislation to encourage using catchment and nature-based solutions â they will aim to move away from less desirable traditional solutions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Action 5: Take account of wider environmental outcomes when deciding on solutions in the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Actions for <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr> <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The actions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water companies will develop options to contribute to the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> wider environmental outcomes</li>
  <li>water companies will use natural capital metrics (as specified in the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> options development guidance) to understand changes to asset quantity and condition, and impacts on the ecosystem services they provide, when developing options and proposing solutions</li>
  <li>regulators will assess evidence identified to support achieving wider environmental outcomes</li>
  <li>regulators will consider evidence of customer support and costs. This will include evidence on how customers are protected if co-funding does not materialise where included in the proposals</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action for future <abbr title="water industry national environment programmes">WINEPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Government and regulators will evaluate whether changes made to the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> methodology have supported wider environmental outcomes. They will adapt the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> methodology or legislative framework accordingly.</p>

<h2>Action 6: Increase water company involvement in the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> development process</h2>

<h3>Actions for <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr> <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The actions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water companies will be expected to follow the options development guidance and driver guidance, including co-design, when developing options for the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>water companies should work with others and, where appropriate, lead on the development of <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> options to address the impact of their activities</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> methodology makes it clear how all parties can use the existing framework to enable a more adaptable approach to the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action for future <abbr title="water industry national environment programmes">WINEPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Water companies should take greater ownership in developing the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Action 7: Increase involvement of other organisations and external funding in the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> development process</h2>

<h3>Actions for <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr> <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The actions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider how to involve catchment partnerships and others in developing the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>target at least 20% co-funding of non-statutory actions and seek further co-funding beyond this level at their discretion</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action for future <abbr title="water industry national environment programmes">WINEPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Government and regulators to further embed co-design, co-delivery, and co-funding in the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> framework.</p>
