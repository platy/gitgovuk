<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The requirements and procedures for clinical trials in the UK are set out in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/1031/contents/made" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004</a>. These regulations require all interventional clinical trials to be ethically approved and authorised by the MHRA. They also include requirements for the application and assessment of each trial, the supply of investigational medicinal products (<abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr>), the conduct of clinical trials in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-clinical-practice-for-clinical-trials">good clinical practice</a> and safety reporting.</p>

<p>Detailed guidance on the manufacture and import of <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> are described in <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/eudralex/vol-4_en">Eudralex Volume 4</a> and <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/eudralex/vol-10_en">Eudralex Volume 10</a>, including guidance for the issuance of the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-10/2013-12_qp_template_imp.pdf">Qualified Person Declaration</a> for the importation of <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> manufactured in third countries outside the EEA.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Import of <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> from an approved country</h2>

<p>If you are the Sponsor of a UK clinical trial using <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> imported into Great Britain from countries on an ‘approved country for import’ list (initially, all EU and EEA countries) you will require a UK Manufacturing and Import Authorisation (<abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP)) holder to put in place an assurance system to check these <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> have been certified by a Qualified Person (<abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr>) in a listed country, before release to the trial.</p>

<p>This assurance system must be overseen by a <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr>, however the <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> would not require recertification. The routine tasks relating to verification of <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certification in a listed country may be delegated by the <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> named on the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) to appropriate personnel operating within their <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) quality system.  The <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> named on the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) that is responsible for this verification process may be resident in the UK or a listed country. Any manufacturing activity or importation from a non-listed country must be certified by a <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> who is resident in the UK.</p>

<p>A Sponsor may perform verification of <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certification in a listed country themselves if they are the holder of a UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP). Alternatively, they may outsource this verification to a third party who holds a UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP).</p>

<p>There is a one-year transition period from 1 January 2021 to implement this guidance.</p>

<p><abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> coming to Great Britain from Northern Ireland do not require this additional oversight.</p>

<p><abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> coming directly to Great Britain from third countries that are not on the approved country for import list will continue to require import and <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certification in the UK by the <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) holder as per the existing requirements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Oversight process</h2>

<p>There are two routes for <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> to be received into Great Britain from a listed country for use in UK clinical trials following <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certification by the listed country <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) holder:</p>

<ul>
  <li>direct to the Great Britain clinical trial site</li>
  <li>via a Great Britain storage and distribution ‘hub’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both require the oversight of a UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) holder and <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr>, with systems in place to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> are not made available for use in Great Britain clinical trial sites until appropriate <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certification in a listed country has been verified by the <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> named on the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> are only shipped to appropriate Great Britain trial sites detailed within the UK trial application</li>
  <li>up-to-date information and documentation relating to the clinical trial and associated Product Specification File are made available by the Sponsor to the <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> named on the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP)</li>
  <li>the clinical trial is authorised by the MHRA before IMP is made available to the Investigator</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Written agreements</h3>

<p>There should be written agreements which describe the assigned responsibilities and provision of relevant information between the organisations. These include agreements between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sponsor and the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) holder responsible for the oversight of import from the listed country</li>
  <li>sponsor and the listed country <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) holder</li>
  <li>UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) holder and Great Britain storage and distribution hub (if applicable)</li>
  <li>sponsor and Great Britain storage and distribution hub (if applicable)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Documentation available to the <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> named on the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> named on the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP)should have the following documentation available as part of the oversight process for import of IMP to Great Britain from listed countries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the manufacturing and distribution supply chain.</li>
  <li>the UK Clinical Trial Application form, plus amendments. This should be used to confirm the site responsible for final certification of the finished IMP.</li>
  <li>the UK Clinical Trial Application and any amendment approval records (including any post approval commitment requirements).</li>
  <li>evidence that the certifying site in the listed country is appropriately licensed and holds a current GMP certificate for the IMP dosage form(s) and associated activities (e.g. manufacture, packaging, testing and / or import from a third country).</li>
  <li>details of the approved Great Britain trial sites from the ethics application, plus any updates or amendments.</li>
  <li>details of each shipment of IMP to Great Britain including the addressees’ information. This should be verified against the ethics approvals.</li>
  <li>details of any excursions from the stated storage conditions during shipment, along with any decisions taken by the Sponsor and certifying <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr>, and the rationale for those decisions.</li>
  <li>details of the responsibilities described in the written agreement between the Sponsor and the listed country <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) holder.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exclusive or exhaustive list because information requirements may vary depending on the responsibilities of each organisation in the supply chain.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Acceptable evidence of <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certification</h3>

<p>Written evidence should be available to demonstrate that each batch of IMP imported from a listed country has been <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certified for use in the specified UK trial. This should be verified prior to the first shipment of IMP from each batch to the Great Britain trial site(s).</p>

<p>Not all options listed below may be suitable for different supply chain relationships, however just one of these pieces of evidence is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Regulations. Other evidence may be acceptable provided it confirms that <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certification has taken place for the batch in question.</p>

<p>Batch certification by a Qualified Person may be confirmed using evidence such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Batch certificate confirming <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certification in accordance with Article 13.3 of Directive 2001/20/EC</li>
  <li>Statement of certification (ad-hoc, confirming certification in accordance with Article 13.3 of Directive 2001/20/EC)</li>
  <li>Access to the certifying <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) holder’s internal systems (e.g. global Enterprise Resource Planning system) that confirms batch certification</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Supply of IMP to a Great Britain clinical trial site</h2>

<p>Until the <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> named on the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP)confirms that the batch of IMP has been appropriately certified by the listed country <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr>, the IMP should not be made available for use by the Great Britain trial sites. This is in addition to the two-step release procedure described in EU GMP Annex 13. Regulatory release of the IMP may be given for some countries at different times therefore the Sponsor should ensure the regulatory release is in place for the UK prior to IMP being made available for use in the trial.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Using a Great Britain storage and distribution ‘hub’</h2>

<p>You may use a distribution facility to store <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> imported from a listed country before supply to Great Britain clinical trial sites. <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> may be imported to the distribution hub from a listed country before confirming that <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certification has taken place in the listed country if they are segregated electronically or physically until certification has been confirmed by the <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> named on the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP). Great Britain storage and distribution facilities should be named on the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP) of the company responsible for oversight of the import.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Reference and retention samples</h2>

<p>Additional reference and retention samples are not specifically required to be stored within Great Britain, but the storage location should be visible to the <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> named on the UK <abbr title="Manufacturing and Import Authorisation">MIA</abbr>(IMP)and defined in the written agreement with the Sponsor. Provision for timely access to the samples by the UK competent authority should be made within the relevant written agreements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Importing non-investigational medicinal products for use in a clinical trial</h2>

<p>If you import authorised or unauthorised products for use in a UK clinical trial in Great Britain that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non-investigational medicinal products</li>
  <li>unmodified comparators to be labelled in Great Britain prior to <abbr title="qualified person">QP</abbr> certification and release to the clinical trial,</li>
</ul>

<p>importation from a listed country should use a wholesale dealer’s licence (<abbr title="wholesale dealer's license">WDA</abbr>(H)). A Responsible Person for import (<abbr title="Responsible person (import)">RPi</abbr>) may be required. Guidance is available on importation of medicines from an approved country for import and the requirements for <abbr title="Responsible person (import)">RPi</abbr>.</p>

<p>Importation from a country that is not a listed country will require a manufacturers licence.</p>

<p>Obtaining non-investigational medicinal products from Northern Ireland will require a <abbr title="wholesale dealer's license">WDA</abbr>(H), unless you are the Sponsor of the clinical trial.</p>
