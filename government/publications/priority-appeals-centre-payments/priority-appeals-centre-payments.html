<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In January 2021, it was announced that it was no longer fair for GCSE, AS, A level and some vocational and technical qualification (<abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr>) exams to proceed as planned. Instead, students who were due to sit exams have received teacher assessed grades this summer. Every student had the right to appeal their grade if they believed an error had been made in determining their grade. If a student wished to appeal, centres should first have undertaken an initial process review. If following that a student still wished to appeal, they were required to ask their exam centre to submit a formal appeal to the exam board on their behalf.</p>

<p>Exceptionally, for this year only, we are providing additional funding to centres for teachers to process priority appeals, including conducting the centre review and submitting the formal appeal to an awarding organisation where relevant. Centres will be eligible for £75 for each priority appeal they process. The funding is available to state funded centres and those entering private candidates.</p>

<p>Priority appeals are where students have missed out on their ‘firm’ higher education choice and wish to appeal an A level or other Level 3 result. Centres are eligible to claim £75 for each priority appeal processed in summer 2021 as described above.</p>

<p>This document provides guidance about the claims service so schools, colleges and other registered exam centres can claim this payment.</p>

<p>If you have further queries about this payment that are not answered in this guidance, contact us via the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen">ESFA helpdesk</a>.</p>

<h2>Assessments in scope and eligibility</h2>

<p>This support is available to state-funded exam centres or any centre on behalf of a private candidate. Centres must enter students in at least one of the following qualifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A levels and other level 3 qualifications awarded in summer 2021 where a student’s ‘firm’ higher education choice is dependent on the outcome</li>
  <li>Level 3 <abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr> awarded via a teacher assessed grade in summer 2021 where a student’s ‘firm’ higher education choice is dependent on the outcome</li>
</ul>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>state-funded schools and academies</li>
  <li>further education, sixth form and tertiary colleges</li>
  <li>independent training providers who deliver publicly funded <abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>state-funded adult and community learning providers</li>
  <li>non-state-funded centres where the cost was incurred for a private candidate who the centre entered in summer 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>In the rest of this guidance, the term ‘schools and colleges’ is used to refer to all types of exam centre as detailed above.</p>

<h2>When to use the service</h2>

<p>Priority appeals are where students have missed out on their ‘firm’ higher education choice and wish to appeal an A level or other Level 3 result. Centres were asked to undertake a centre review before a formal appeal could be submitted to the awarding organisation. This payment reflects the work undertaken to complete these priority centre reviews and submit a formal appeal to the awarding organisation where relevant.</p>

<p>The deadline for centres to submit priority appeals to awarding organisations was the 23 August. Claims should be submitted after all associated event costs have been incurred.</p>

<p>We are expecting schools and colleges to pass on the £75 payment to the teachers involved in processing any priority centre review and/or appeal. Centres are still eligible to claim for priority appeals even if no subject teachers were involved in processing the appeal. The £75 payment is made available per priority review and/or appeal.</p>

<h2>Service availability</h2>

<p>The claims service will open later in the autumn term for schools and colleges to make claims for the priority appeals payment, alongside further guidance on how to make a claim.</p>

<h2>Making a claim</h2>

<p>Where you do not currently receive payments from ESFA, in order to receive payments against any claim you will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/provide-information-about-your-banking-and-payments-to-dfe" class="govuk-link">provide information about your banking and payments to DfE</a>. You will also need to enter your 8-digit UK provider registration number (<abbr title="UK provider registration number">UKPRN</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you do not know the <abbr title="UK provider registration number">UKPRN</abbr> for your school or college, you can find it on <a href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Get information about schools</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not have a <abbr title="UK provider registration number">UKPRN</abbr> you can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/ukrlp/ukrlp_registration.page_pls_regProviderStep1">register as a UK learning provider</a> (note that this should be prioritised to prevent delays to payment).</p>

<p>If your school or college isn’t already set up with a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/">DfE sign-in</a> or <abbr title="UK provider registration number">UKPRN</abbr>, you should set this up in advance of making a claim so that payment is not delayed.</p>

<p>Centres should keep a record of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their <abbr title="UK provider registration number">UKPRN</abbr> and centre number</li>
  <li>the candidate number, subject (specification) code and UCAS PID for each priority appeal processed</li>
</ul>

<p>These may be required when making a claim. Centres should also keep a record of the number of priority appeals that meet the criteria set out above that they have processed.</p>

<p>The claims process will open in the autumn term.</p>

<p>We will review claims and may refuse payment or require repayment for any claims that do not meet the criteria set out in this guidance. You should therefore ensure that you keep records of this expenditure and the related evidence for at least one year.</p>
