<p>To be eligible applicants must be studying for a degree which contains a minimum of 30% in social research methods in your overall degree content, your degree must include quantitative research methods (i.e. research design, data collection (i.e. questionnaire design, sampling, weighting), and data analysis (e.g. statistical analysis, interpretation)) as well as three out of the following five areas:</p>

Nationality requirements are explained in more detail on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-rules">Civil Service nationality rules webpage</a>.</p>

<p>More information on the eligibility criteria, can be found at the top of this page in the attached Application Guidance Notes, Updated 2023-24 Job Descriptions from individual government departments will be provided in due course.</p>

<h3>How to Apply</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Government Social Research Service">GSR</abbr> 2023-24 Sandwich Student Placements scheme is due to open for for applications the week commencing Monday 3rd October 2022. A link to the vacancy application form on the Civil Service Jobs website will be included here once the scheme is open.</p>

<p>2023-24 Candidates who are successful at the sift stage will be randomly allocated to any of the participating departments.</p>

<p>Candidates who are unsuccessful at the sift stage will not be given any feedback or comments. If you do not hear from us within 2 months of the closing date, please assume your application has been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Please note that some departments require candidates to have a UK footprint for 3 years in order to get security clearance.</p>

<h3>Interviews</h3>
<p>Candidates who are successful at the sift stage will be invited for interview at one of the participating Departments. Interviews will take place in November and December 2022 and will be conducted virtually.</p>

<h3>Re-join <abbr title="Government Social Research Service">GSR</abbr> after your placement</h3>
<p>As part of the scheme, we have included an enhancement to the already successful sandwich placement scheme by making an offer of a permanent contract (subject security clearance) to those students to take up upon graduation (in their placement department where possible or another government department) and who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are on track for a minimum 2:1 degree containing at least 30% in social research methods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are assessed to have successfully completed their placement by their line managers</p>

  </li>

</ul>

<p>This means that the placement scheme is now a gateway to a career as a government social researcher.</p>

<p>Please note: Some departments may not be able to offer a permanent contract if successful at <abbr title="Social Research Assessment Centre">SRAC</abbr> and you will be informed of this, should this be the case.</p>
