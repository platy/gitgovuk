<p>If you’ve been sexually assaulted it’s important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help. This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make decisions about whether and how to seek medical advice and attention; report to local police; and engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</p>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">rape and sexual assault: returning to the UK</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the emergency number on 112</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact the British Embassy or Consulates in Turkey. You can find their number on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/turkey">link</a>. Embassy staff will be empathetic, and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence</li>
  <li>you may want to consider speaking to a lawyer or you may need the services of an interpreter.  You can find <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/turkey-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyers for British nationals in Turkey</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/turkey-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">translators/interpreters for British nationals in Turkey</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in Turkey</h2>

<ul>
  <li>if you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you are in an area where there is a British embassy or consulate they will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7</li>
  <li>if you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the nearest British embassy or consulate on 0090 312 455 33 44 and they can offer you consular support</li>
  <li>if you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts</li>
  <li>tell the police if you think you have been drugged</li>
  <li>insist you get a police report, this document will be in Turkish</li>
  <li>you do not have to surrender your passport whilst an investigation is carried out. Police may take a copy of the passport to record your identification information</li>
  <li>there are no risks when reporting rape or sexual assault to local police. Extramarital sex, homosexuality and drinking are not considered as crimes in Turkey</li>
  <li>you can request an officer of a particular gender although there is no guarantee one will be available.  Police officers work with the help of interpreters when taking statements. You may have to wait for the interpreter depending on the time and the location of the police station</li>
  <li>at this stage, you may wish to hire a private lawyer or alternatively, you have a right to ask for a State-appointed lawyer to help you through the initial stages</li>
  <li>it is important to note that the investigations are led by the Public Prosecutors of Courts and not by the police.&nbsp; Public Prosecutors&nbsp;have a duty to investigate the alleged situation and make sure that the rights of all parties are preserved in accordance with the existing law</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Minors</h2>

<p>There are CIM (Investigation Centre for Minors) facilities in some cities which have specialised officers dealing with minors who are victims of crime. The medical examinations are carried out here and statements taken with the support of psychologists.</p>

<p>The Prosecutor witnesses the statements being taken, in a very discreet environment which avoids children having to give evidence in court. Psychologists, lawyers and translators are always provided. If there are no CIM facilities in an area a minor should still be provided with a translator, psychologist and lawyer when dealing with the police and hospitals.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Turkey</h2>

<p>The British embassy or consulate will be able to help you. This includes helping you make arrangements to contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.</p>

<p>We can provide you with lists of English-speaking lawyers, translators and medical facilities.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can also report the incident to them and ask them for assistance. Where possible, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. If you wish, and depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you.</p>

<p>You may go to any hospital to receive medical treatment. Please note that local doctors are obliged by law to report the incident to the police even if you choose not to report the incident.</p>

<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime. If you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>The support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence.</p>

<p>If you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>, or the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in London.</p>

<p>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police.</p>

<p>The UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action. UK police do not have jurisdiction to investigate an attack that has taken place abroad and cannot direct an alleged crime be investigated. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">rape and sexual assault: returning to the UK</a> after a rape or sexual assault abroad for more information.</p>

<p>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Reporting the crime in Turkey: next steps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>if you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained</li>
  <li>the police will ask you to make a statement about the incident including a description of the attacker(s)</li>
  <li>insist you get a police report, this document will be in Turkish</li>
  <li>once statements have been taken, the Public Prosecutor will decide whether the police should take you to a hospital for a forensic examination. Hospitals are easily accessible all around Turkey</li>
  <li>police may keep any clothes or electronic equipment which may be evidence of your attack to present to a forensic examiner. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages</li>
  <li>tell the police if you think you have been drugged</li>
  <li>be aware that Turkish police do not normally inform UK police of the crime</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>The medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<p>The investigation related examination should be undertaken at a State Hospital. If further forensic examinations are required, you may be taken to a specialist facility.</p>

<p>If a crime has been committed hospitals are obliged to report the results of any examination to the police.</p>

<p>At the examination:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a gynaecologist will carry out a full examination. There may be an internal examination to obtain evidence of a sexual act and a full external examination to obtain evidence of force and/or violence. The initial examination will be undertaken by a medical professional and swabs, DNA tests and STD tests may be necessary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>doctors are required to undertake examinations with a nurse present.  You may be able to request a particular gender, but this is not guaranteed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you will then be seen by a GP for an external examination to report any bruising and external injuries</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, they may be able to accompany you to the hospital. If possible, depending on the location and timing, a Consular Officer will accompany you too and offer support throughout the process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Treatment</h2>

<p>HIV PEP is subject to availability and medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception, also known as the morning after pill, is available from the pharmacies and can be bought without the need of a prescription or medical referral at your own cost. It needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. There are pharmacies in most districts in&nbsp;Turkey. The Turkish equivalent of pharmacy is “Eczane” which&nbsp;can be identified by the capital letter E in red on the pharmacy signs.</p>

<p>The investigation related initial treatment is paid by the court.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you should keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Police investigations in Turkey: what to expect</h2>

<p>The police may take you to the scene of the crime, or where you think the attacker may be located, to try to identify and arrest the person.  If a suspect is brought to the police station, you may be asked to make an identification.</p>

<p>If the attacker(s) is/are located they will go through a similar process at the same time but separately. They can be detained by the police 24 to 48 hours for this initial investigation before they are referred to the court.  The suspect will be taken to court and the Public Prosecutor will decide how to proceed after a preliminary investigation.</p>

<p>The Public Prosecutor may request to speak to you in person for you to repeat your statement. However, this is not always necessary.</p>

<p>The perpetrator can be detained and sent to prison, released conditionally or released if there is insufficient evidence to prosecute.</p>

<p>Once the case has been filed the victim will not need to remain in Turkey.  A state-appointed lawyer will still offer a service free of charge at this stage and will have access to the case file.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>State prosecution is automatic for a rape case and will not be dropped by the state.  The Embassy does not have access to your court file due to Data Protection rules.</p>

<p>You will not be updated automatically by the Turkish Authorities about your case. You will need to either request information in person or enlist the help of a lawyer who will be able to keep you updated and explain your rights and the legal procedures. You will need to appoint and pay for the lawyer.</p>

<p>If you change your mind about pressing charges or you are not sure if you want to continue, you can retract your statement.  As rape is an automatic state prosecution and will not be dropped, your revised statement will be considered during the hearings.</p>

<p>The defendant can press counter charges claiming false accusations. If they wait until after and are proven not guilty, it could make their case stronger.</p>

<p>If anyone intentionally makes false accusations to the police or withholds the truth, they can be prosecuted.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Trial procedures</h2>

<p>If you press charges and there is enough evidence, your case will be taken to trial. The Public Prosecutor makes this decision and your lawyer will be able to follow the process. The trials will be conducted in Turkish, but interpreters are assigned for foreign nationals who do not speak Turkish.</p>

<p>If there is a trial the Court may require your testimony which can be given either in person or from the UK. It is your choice to attend the court or not for the hearings, however attending the hearing can be quicker than alternative options. The court does not pay for travel and accommodation costs.</p>

<p>Rape and sexual assault trials can sometimes take several years from start to finish depending on circumstances.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Hiring a lawyer</h2>

<p>The Turkish authorities do not automatically update victims of crime about their case. You will need to either request information in person, this can prove difficult unless you are able to speak Turkish, or enlist the services of a lawyer. A lawyer should keep you updated and explain your rights and the legal procedures.</p>

<p>State-appointed lawyers are only available at the preliminary investigation stage at the police station and court before the prosecution starts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Communication</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the victim has a right to ask for a state translator at the police and court</li>
  <li>you can give your local address if you are a resident in the country, and your UK/home address if you are not, for contact if and when needed. You cannot use the lawyer’s address</li>
  <li>you will not be updated by anyone unless you visit the court in person or appoint a Lawyer</li>
  <li>you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/turkey-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">find a list of private interpreters based in Turkey</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Legal aid</h2>

<p>The Turkish Court does not have the system and jurisdiction right abroad to evaluate the financial situation of the victim. In practice legal aid is not possible.  Payment terms are negotiated between the victim and the lawyer. There may be some firms that provide a pro bono service in certain circumstances and locations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Compensation</h2>

<p>You can have a separate compensation litigation at a Civil Court for any injuries or losses after perpetrator/s have been convicted in a Criminal Court. Any such claim will have to wait until the finalization of the criminal case for any entitlement.</p>

<p>There is no state-funded compensation scheme in Turkey to cover physical or psychological injuries suffered as a result of a violent crime.</p>
