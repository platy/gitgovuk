<p>Janssen-Cilag Ltd</p>

<h2>Lay summary - COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen suspension for injection (COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]))</h2>

<p>This is a summary of the Public Assessment Report (<abbr title="Public Assessment Report">PAR</abbr>) for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen suspension for injection. It explains how this product was assessed and its authorisation recommended, as well as its conditions of use. It is not intended to provide practical advice on how to use this product.</p>

<p>This product was approved with a national Conditional Marketing Authorisation (<abbr title="conditional Marketing Authorisation">CMA</abbr>) which is used for medicinal products that fulfil an unmet medical need.</p>

<p>This product will be referred to as COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in this lay summary for ease of reading.</p>

<p>For practical information about using COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, patients should read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-janssen/patient-information-leaflet-for-covid-19-vaccine-janssen">Patient Information Leaflet (<abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr>)</a> or contact their doctor or pharmacist.</p>

<h3>What is COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen and what is it used for?</h3>
<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is a vaccine indicated for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older.</p>

<p>This product has been authorised by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> in Great Britain (consisting of England, Scotland and Wales). This procedure follows a European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) decision on 11 March 2021 (EMEA/H/C/005737), in accordance with the advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (<abbr title="Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr>). This is known as the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> Decision Reliance Procedure.</p>

<h3>How does COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen work?</h3>
<p>COVID 19 Vaccine Janssen causes the body’s natural defences (immune system) to produce antibodies and specialized white blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19. None of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID-19.</p>

<h3>How is COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen used?</h3>
<p>The pharmaceutical form of this medicine is a suspension for injection and the route of administration is intramuscular injection. COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is for intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</p>

<p>You will receive 1 injection of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen of 0.5 mL.</p>

<p>For further information on how COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is used, refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-janssen" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> and Summary of Product Characteristics (<abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SmPC</abbr>)</a> available on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) website.</p>

<p>This vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription.</p>

<p>The patient should ask the administering healthcare practitioner if they have any questions concerning the vaccine.</p>

<h3>What are the possible side effects of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen?</h3>

<p>For the full list of all side effects reported with this medicine, see Section 4 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-jansse" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> or the <abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SmPC</abbr></a> available on the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> website.</p>

<p>If a patient gets any side effects, they should talk to their doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in the product information or the <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> that comes with the medicine. Patients can also report suspected side effects themselves, or a report can be made on behalf of someone else they care for, directly via the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Yellow Card scheme</a> or search for ‘<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Yellow Card’ online. By reporting side effects, patients can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.</p>

<p>The most common side effects with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are headache, nausea, muscle aches, pain where the injection is given and feeling very tired.</p>

<h3>Why was COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen approved?</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> decided that the benefits are greater than the risks and recommended that this medicine can be approved for use.</p>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen has been authorised with a Conditional Marketing Authorisation (<abbr title="conditional Marketing Authorisation">CMA</abbr>). CMAs are intended for medicinal products that fulfil an unmet medical need, such as for serious and life-threatening diseases where no satisfactory treatment methods are available or where the product offers a major therapeutic advantage. CMAs may be granted where comprehensive clinical data is not yet complete, but it is judged that such data will become available soon. Adequate evidence of safety and efficacy to enable the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> to conclude that the benefits are greater than the risks is required. Any new information on COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen will be reviewed every year and this report will be updated as necessary.</p>

<h3>What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen?</h3>
<p>A Risk Management Plan (<abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr>) has been developed to ensure that COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is used as safely as possible. Based on this plan, safety information has been included in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-janssen" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SmPC</abbr> and the <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr></a>, including the appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients.</p>

<p>Known side effects are continuously monitored. Furthermore, new safety signals reported by patients and healthcare professionals will be monitored and reviewed continuously.</p>

<h3>Other information about COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen</h3>
<p>A marketing authorisation was granted in Great Britain (consisting of England, Scotland and Wales) on 28 May 2021.</p>

<p>The full <abbr title="Public Assessment Report">PAR</abbr> for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen follows this summary.</p>

<p>This summary was last updated in June 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Based on the review of the data on quality, safety and efficacy, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) considered that the application for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen suspension for injection (PLGB 00242/0742) could be approved.</p>

<p>The product is approved for the following indications:
Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older.
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.</p>

<p>The name of the active substance is COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]).</p>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) glycoprotein in a stabilised conformation. Following administration, the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is transiently expressed, stimulating both neutralising and other functional S-specific antibodies, as well as cellular immune responses directed against the S antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.</p>
