<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> What COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is and what it is used for</h2>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is given to adults aged 18 years and older.</p>

<p>The vaccine causes the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID-19.</p>

<p>None of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> What you need to know before you are given COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen</h2>

<p>Do not have the vaccine if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in <a href="#ingredients" class="govuk-link">section 6</a> ).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Warnings and precautions</h3>

<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have ever had a severe allergic reaction after injection of any other vaccine,</li>
  <li>you have ever fainted following any needle injection,</li>
  <li>you have ever had a condition known as heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT or HIT type 2),</li>
  <li>you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold,</li>
  <li>you have a problem with bleeding or bruising, or if you are taking an anticoagulant medicine (to prevent blood clots),</li>
  <li>your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or cancer medicines).</li>
</ul>

<p>As with any vaccine, vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen may not fully protect all those who receive it. It is not known how long you will be protected.</p>

<h3>Blood disorders</h3>

<p>A combination of blood clots and low levels of ‘platelets’ (cells that help blood to clot) in the blood has been observed extremely rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This includes severe cases with blood clots, including in unusual locations, such as the brain, liver, bowel and spleen in some cases in combination with bleeding. These cases occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination and occurred mostly in women below 60 years of age. Fatal outcome has been reported.</p>

<p>Seek immediate medical attention, if you experience severe or persistent headaches, seizures (fits) mental status changes or blurred vision, unexplained skin bruising beyond the site of vaccination which appear a few days after vaccination, pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination, develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain. Inform your healthcare provider that you have recently received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.</p>

<h3>Children and adolescents</h3>
<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is not recommended for children aged below 18 years. Currently there is not enough information available on the use of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age.</p>

<h3>Other medicines and COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen</h3>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or vaccines.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</h3>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine.</p>

<h3>Driving and using machines</h3>
<p>Some of the side effects of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen listed in <a href="#side-effects" class="govuk-link">section 4</a> (Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen contains sodium</h3>
<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of 0.5 mL, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen contains ethanol</h3>
<p>This medicine contains 2 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each dose of 0.5 mL. The amount of ethanol in this medicine is equivalent to less than 1 mL beer or wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is given</h2>

<p>Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will inject the vaccine into the muscle - usually in the upper arm.</p>

<h3>How much vaccine will you receive</h3>
<p>A single-dose (0.5 mL) of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is injected.</p>

<p>After the injection your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you for around 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Possible side effects</h2>

<p>Like all vaccines, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most of the side effects occur in the 1 or 2 days of getting the vaccination.</p>

<p>Get medical attention immediately if within 3 weeks of vaccination you get any of the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>experience severe or persistent headaches, blurred vision, mental status changes or seizures (fits);</li>
  <li>develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain or persistent abdominal pain;</li>
  <li>notice unusual skin bruising or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Get urgent medical attention if you get symptoms of a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions may include a combination of any of the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>feeling faint or light-headed</li>
  <li>changes in your heartbeat</li>
  <li>shortness of breath</li>
  <li>wheezing</li>
