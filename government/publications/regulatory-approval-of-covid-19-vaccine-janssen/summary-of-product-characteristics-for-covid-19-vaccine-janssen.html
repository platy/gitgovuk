<p>Colourless to slightly yellow, clear to very opalescent suspension (pH 6-6.4).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Clinical particulars</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Therapeutic indications</h3>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older.</p>

<p>The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Posology and method of administration</h3>

<h4>Posology</h4>

<h5>Individuals 18 years of age and older</h5>
<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is administered as a single-dose of 0.5 mL by intramuscular injection only.</p>

<h5>Paediatric population</h5>
<p>The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in children and adolescents (less than 18 years of age) have not yet been established. No data are available.</p>

<h5>Elderly</h5>
<p>No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥65 years of age. See also sections 4.8 and 5.1.</p>

<h4>Method of administration</h4>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is for intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</p>

<p>The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.</p>

<p>For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.</p>

<p>For instructions on handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Contraindications</h3>
<p>Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in <a href="#excipients" class="govuk-link">section 6.1</a>.</p>

<p>Individuals who have previously experienced episodes of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) (see also section 4.4).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Special warnings and precautions for use</h3>

<h4>Traceability</h4>
<p>In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.</p>

<h4>Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis</h4>
<p>Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination.</p>

<h4>Anxiety-related reactions</h4>
<p>Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.</p>

<h4>Concurrent illness</h4>
<p>Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. However, the presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.</p>

<h4>Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome</h4>
<p>A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This includes severe cases of venous thrombosis at unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis as well as arterial thrombosis concomitant with thrombocytopenia. Fatal outcome has been reported. These cases occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination, and mostly in women under 60 years of age.</p>

<p>Individuals with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT or HIT type 2) should only receive the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.</p>

<p>Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with neurological symptoms including severe or persistent headaches, seizures, mental status changes or blurred vision after vaccination, or who experiences skin bruising (petechia) beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention.</p>

<p>Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia requires specialised clinical management. Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g., haematologists, specialists in coagulation) to diagnose and treat this condition.</p>

<p>Individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia within 3 weeks after vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen should be actively investigated for signs of thrombosis. Similarly, individuals who present with thrombosis within 3 weeks of vaccination should be evaluated for thrombocytopenia.</p>

<h5>Risk of bleeding with intramuscular administration</h5>
<p>As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.</p>

<h4>Capillary leak syndrome</h4>

<p>Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) have been reported in the first days after vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, in some cases with a fatal outcome. A history of CLS has been reported. CLS is a rare disorder characterised by acute episodes of oedema mainly affecting the limbs, hypotension, haemoconcentration and hypoalbuminaemia. Patients with an acute episode of CLS following vaccination require prompt recognition and treatment. Intensive supportive therapy is usually warranted. Individuals with a known history of CLS should not be vaccinated with this vaccine. See also section 4.3.</p>

<h4>Guillain-Barré syndrome</h4>

<p>Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been reported very rarely following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. Healthcare professionals should be alert of GBS signs and symptoms to ensure correct diagnosis, in order to initiate adequate supportive care and treatment and to rule out other causes.</p>

<h4>Immunocompromised individuals</h4>
<p>The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy.
The efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals.</p>

<h4>Duration of protection</h4>
<p>The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.</p>

<h4>Limitations of vaccine effectiveness</h4>
<p>Protection starts around 14 days after vaccination. As with all vaccines, vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen may not protect all vaccine recipients (see section 5.1).</p>

<h4>Excipients</h4>

<h5>Sodium</h5>
<p>This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium free’.</p>

<h5>Ethanol</h5>
<p>This medicinal product contains 2 mg of alcohol (ethanol) per 0.5 mL dose. The small amount of alcohol in this medicinal product will not have any noticeable effects.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</h3>

<p>No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen with other vaccines has not been studied.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</h3>

<h4>Pregnancy</h4>
<p>There is limited experience with the use of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in pregnant women. Animal studies with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</p>

<p>Administration of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks to the mother and foetus.</p>

<h4>Breast-feeding</h4>
<p>It is unknown whether COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is excreted in human milk.</p>

<h4>Fertility</h4>
<p>Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span> Effects on ability to drive and use machines</h3>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the adverse reactions mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> Undesirable effects</h3>

<h4>Summary of safety profile</h4>

<p>The safety of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen was evaluated in an ongoing phase 3 study (COV3001). A total of 21,895 adults aged 18 years and older received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. The median age of individuals was 52 years (range 18-100 years). The safety analysis was performed once the median follow-up duration of 2 months after vaccination was reached. Longer safety follow-up of &gt;2 months is available for 11,948 adults who received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.</p>

<p>In study COV3001, the most common local adverse reactions reported was injection site pain (48.6%). The most common systemic adverse reactions were headache (38.9%), fatigue (38.2%), myalgia (33.2%) and nausea (14.2%). Pyrexia (defined as body temperature ≥ 38.0°C) was observed in 9% of participants. Most adverse reactions occurred within 1–2 days following vaccination and were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (1–2 days).</p>

<p>Reactogenicity was generally milder and reported less frequently in older adults (763 adults ≥ 65 years old).</p>

<p>The safety profile was generally consistent across participants with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline; a total of 2,151 adults seropositive at baseline received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (9.8%).</p>

<h4>Tabulated list of adverse reactions</h4>

<p>Adverse drug reactions observed during study COV3001 are organised by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC). Frequency categories are defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very common (≥ 1/10);</li>
  <li>Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10);</li>
  <li>Uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100);</li>
  <li>Rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000);</li>
  <li>Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).</li>
</ul>

<p>Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.</p>

<p>(a) Hypersensitivity refers to allergic reactions of the skin and subcutaneous tissue.</p>

<p>(b) Cases received from an ongoing open-label study in South Africa.</p>

<p>(c) Severe and very rare cases of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia have been reported post-marketing. These included venous thrombosis such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, as well as arterial thrombosis (see section 4.4)</p>

<h3>Reporting of suspected adverse reactions</h3>

<p>Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. If you are concerned about an adverse event, it should be reported on a Yellow Card. Reporting forms and information can be found at <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">Coronavirus Yellow Card</a> or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store and include the vaccine brand and batch/Lot number if available. Alternatively, adverse events of concern in association with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen can be reported to Janssen on +442076602872 / 0080056540088. Or visit <a rel="external" href="https://covid19vaccinejanssen.com" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen</a></p>

<p>Please do not report the same adverse event(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Janssen and MHRA (in an anonymised form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates.</p>

<p>No case of overdose has been reported. In phase 1/2 studies where a higher dose (up to 2-fold) was administered COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen remained well-tolerated, however vaccinated individuals reported an increase in reactogenicity (increased vaccination site pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, nausea and pyrexia).</p>

<p>In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.</p>

<span class="number">5.1 </span> Pharmacodynamic properties</h3>

<p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03</p>

<h4>Mechanism of action</h4>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector that encodes a SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) glycoprotein in a stabilised conformation. Following administration, the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is transiently expressed, stimulating both neutralising and other functional S-specific antibodies, as well as cellular immune responses directed against the S antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.</p>

<h4>Clinical efficacy</h4>

<p>An ongoing, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study (COV3001) is being conducted in the United States, South Africa and Latin American countries to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a single-dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. The study excluded individuals with abnormal function of the immune system resulting from a clinical condition, individuals who are under immunosuppressive therapies within 6 months, as well as pregnant women. Participants with stable HIV infection under treatment were not excluded. Licensed vaccines, excluding live vaccines, could be administered more than 14 days before or more than 14 days after the vaccination in the study. Licensed live attenuated vaccines could be administered more than 28 days before or more than 28 days after the vaccination in the study.</p>

<p>A total of 44,325 individuals were randomised in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive an intramuscular injection of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen or placebo. A total of 21,895 adults received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen and 21,888 adults received placebo. Participants were followed for a median of 58 days (range: 1-124 days) after vaccination.</p>

<p>The primary efficacy analysis population of 39,321 individuals included 38,059 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals at baseline and 1,262 individuals with an unknown serostatus.</p>

<p>Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among individuals who received the COVID 19 Vaccine Janssen and those who received placebo. In the primary efficacy analysis population, among the individuals who received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, the median age was 52.0 years (range: 18 to 100 years); 79.7% (N=15 646) of individuals were 18 to 64 years old [with 20.3% (N=3 984) aged 65 or older and 3.8% (N=755) aged 75 or older]; 44.3% of individuals were female; 46.8% were from Northern America (United States), 40.6% were from Latin America and 12.6% were from Southern Africa (South Africa). A total of 7,830 (39.9%) individuals had at least one pre-existing comorbidity associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 at baseline (comorbidities included: obesity defined as BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (27.5%), hypertension (10.3%), type 2 diabetes (7.2%), stable/well-controlled HIV infection (2.5%), serious heart conditions (2.4%) and asthma (1.3%)). Other comorbidities were present in ≤1% of the individuals.</p>

<p>COVID-19 cases were confirmed by a central laboratory based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA result using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test. Vaccine efficacy overall and by key age groups are presented in Table 2.</p>

<p>Of the 14 vs. 60 severe cases with onset at least 14 days after vaccination in the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen group vs. placebo group, 2 vs. 6 were hospitalised. Three individuals died (all in the placebo group). The majority of the remaining severe cases fulfilled only the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (≤93% on room air).</p>

<p>Prior to unblinding, supplementary analyses, considered post-hoc, of positive cases using PCR-based tests regardless of confirmation by the central laboratory generally support the results of the primary analysis.</p>

<p>Beyond 14 days after vaccination, 2 vs. 8 cases of molecularly confirmed COVID-19 were hospitalised, respectively in the COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen vs. placebo group. One case in the placebo group required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation. The finding was supported by post-hoc analysis of all COVID-19 related hospitalisations implementing a broader search based on all available information from any source (2 vs. 29 cases in the extended data set).</p>

<p>Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates for male and female participants, as well as for participants with and without medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.</p>

<p>Exploratory subgroup analyses of vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 for Brazil, South Africa, and the United States were conducted (see Table 4). For the subgroup analyses, all COVID-19 cases accrued up to the primary efficacy analysis data cut-off date, including cases confirmed by the central laboratory and cases with documented positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a local laboratory which are still awaiting confirmation by the central laboratory, were included.</p>

<p>Samples from 71.7% of central laboratory confirmed primary analysis cases had been sequenced [United States (73.5%), South Africa (66.9%) and Brazil (69.3%)]. Of the sequenced samples there is an imbalance in the completeness of the dataset between COVID 19 Vaccine Janssen and placebo. In the United States, 96.4% of strains were identified as the Wuhan-H1 variant D614G; in South Africa, 94.5% of strains were identified as the 20H/501Y.V2 variant (B.1.351 lineage); in Brazil, 69.4% of strains were identified to be a variant of the P.2 lineage and 30.6% of strains were identified as the Wuhan-H1 variant D614G.</p>

<h4>Elderly population</h4>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen was assessed in individuals 18 years of age and older. The efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen was consistent between elderly (≥65 years) and younger individuals (18 64 years).</p>

<h4>Paediatric population</h4>

<p>The licensing authority has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).</p>

<h4>Conditional approval</h4>

<p>This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. New information on this medicinal product will be reviewed at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Pharmacokinetic properties</h3>

<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Preclinical safety data</h3>

<p>Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance, and reproductive and developmental toxicity.</p>

<h4>Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity</h4>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen has not been evaluated for its genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The components of the vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic or carcinogenic potential.</p>

<h4>Reproductive toxicity and fertility</h4>

<p>Female reproductive toxicity and fertility were assessed in a combined embryo-foetal and pre- and post-natal development study in the rabbit. In this study a first vaccination of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen was administered intramuscularly to female rabbits 7 days prior to mating, at a dose equivalent to 2-fold above the recommended human dose, followed by two vaccinations at the same dose during the gestation period (i.e., at gestational days 6 and 20). There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. The parental females as well as their foetuses and offspring exhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific antibody titers, indicating that maternal antibodies were transferred to the foetuses during gestation. No COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen data are available on vaccine excretion in milk.</p>

<p>In addition, a conventional (repeat-dose) toxicity study in rabbits with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen did not reveal any effects on male sex organs that would impair male fertility.</p>
