<p>This publication has been withdrawn and replaced with updated guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils standard</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>These are indicative standards and payment rates while work continues to refine our assessments and receive feedback from farmers and stakeholders. We will publish final versions of this standard by November 2021, ahead of launching the scheme in 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>How the standard works</h2>

<p>A standard is a set of land management actions.</p>

<p>There are 3 levels to the standard. Each level has a set of actions you must complete to get paid.</p>

<p>The levels build on one another - each one includes the actions from the previous levels.</p>

<p>If you’re already doing some of these actions on your land, they’ll count towards payment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Overview and payment rates</h2>

<p>The levels and indicative payments for the arable and horticultural soils standard are set out in the table.</p>

<p>These payment rates are annual.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What land is eligible</h2>

<p>You can use this standard for all cultivated land, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arable</li>
  <li>field vegetables</li>
  <li>horticultural</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Ineligible land</h3>

<p>Do not use this standard for areas of peat soils greater than 20% soil organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs)</h3>

<p>If your application includes SSSI land, you will need consent from Natural England.</p>

<p>For more information read the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest">sites of special scientific interest: managing your land</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Aims of the standard</h2>

<p>The aims of the standards are not mandatory but they describe a visual representation of what the outcome should look like if you follow all the mandatory actions. Further detail on monitoring and how the aims will be used will be shared before the scheme launches in 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Actions</h2>

<p>Actions are mandatory. All actions must be delivered at the selected ambition level.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>All levels</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Carry out a soil assessment</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>A soil assessment will be completed at the start of the agreement to identify parcels at risk of surface runoff, soil erosion, compaction, waterlogging or regularly flooding, to inform land management actions. The assessment will include soil texture, drainage, slope and connectivity to a waterbody or sensitive habitat.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Carry out a soil assessment to identify the priority areas on your farm for delivering water quality improvements, carbon storage, flood mitigation or biodiversity.</p>

<p>In the first year, across all land, assess:</p>

<ul>
  <li>soil texture</li>
  <li>drainage</li>
  <li>slope</li>
  <li>connectivity to a waterbody or sensitive habitat</li>
</ul>

<p>Record and keep observations, and review the assessment every 2 years.</p>

<p>Every year, on at least 20% of the land:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess soil structure</li>
  <li>assess biological indicators, for example earthworm count</li>
  <li>analyse soil organic matter</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Improve soil structure by alleviating compaction</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>Throughout the agreement analysis of soil structure, biological indicators and soil organic matter will be completed across the whole farm. The results of which will inform actions to maintain or improve soil structure, including avoiding farm traffic machinery on wet soils, and where compaction has been identified, improving soil structure by either sub-soiling, cultivations, organic matter additions or resting the field.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Take measures to alleviate soil compaction identified in the soil assessment and soil management plan (soil management plan completed at advanced level only).</p>

<p>Measures include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sub-soiling</li>
  <li>cultivations</li>
  <li>additions of organic matter</li>
  <li>natural soil recovery through resting the field</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not use sub-soiling or increase the depth of cultivation where there are known to be buried archaeological features.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Establish green cover</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>Ensure there is dense crop cover across the whole field from early to late winter to protect the soil surface and provide root growth that maintains soil structure, supports soil biology and minimises nutrient leaching, soil erosion and run-off. The area and date will vary for each ambition level.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Establish green cover to provide dense over-winter ground cover across the whole field before the onset of winter rainfall.  Retain the cover crop until late winter.</p>

<p>Ways you can achieve green cover include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sowing an autumn-sown crop to achieve dense ground cover across the whole field over winter</li>
  <li>establishing a quick-growing cover crop that will provide dense ground cover across the whole field over winter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Area and date will vary according to ambition level applied for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>establish by mid-October on at least 5% of arable land (introductory level) - this should be targeted at land at the highest risk of erosion or surface runoff identified in the soil assessment</li>
  <li>establish by the end of September on at least 10% of arable land (intermediate level) - this should be targeted at land at risk of erosion or surface runoff and light sandy soil identified in the soil assessment</li>
  <li>establish by the end of September on at least 15% of arable land (advanced level) - this should be targeted at land at risk of erosion and surface runoff, light sandy or on shallow soils identified in the soil assessment</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Increase soil organic matter</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>To boost soil organic matter levels and improve soil structure and biology by either the application of organic matter, incorporation of straw, growing green manures, cover crops or the introduction of grass or herbal leys into the arable rotation (grass or herbal leys intermediate and advanced only).</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Organic matter can be from organic manures, certified compost, incorporation of straw or by growing green manures and cover crops</p>

<ul>
  <li>do this on 10% of arable land every year (introductory level)</li>
  <li>on 15% every year (intermediate level). In addition to the actions above, this level can also include the introduction of grass or herbal leys into the arable rotation</li>
  <li>on 20% every year (advanced level). In addition to the actions above, this level can also include the introduction of grass or herbal leys into the arable rotation</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Intermediate level</h2>

<p>In addition to the first 4 actions at all levels, you must do the following intermediate level action.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Use shallow, minimum, no-tillage or direct drilling</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>To improve soil organic matter and biological activity by using shallow, minimum or no till to establish crops.
To reduce disturbance of the soil and maintain soil organic matter and support soil biological activity, direct drilling or over-sowing/broadcasting techniques will be used on temporary grassland that is reseeded.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>This should be done on at least a quarter of arable land - this includes temporary grassland.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Advanced level</h2>

<p>For the advanced level you must do all of the actions listed above, plus the following action</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Create a soil management plan</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>Target and prioritise soil management interventions to improve soil structure, soil organic matter and overall soil health and reduce erosion and run-off by developing a detailed soil management plan.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Produce this in the first year of your agreement to identify and action priorities to improve soil structure, soil carbon storage and soil biology and avoid and alleviate soil compaction. 
This should build on the soil assessments and include soil respiration or microorganism assessments
You must review the plan every 2 years.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Relationship to existing regulations</h2>

<p>All farmers should be compliant with regulations. An expectation of regulatory compliance underpins the standards in the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme.</p>
