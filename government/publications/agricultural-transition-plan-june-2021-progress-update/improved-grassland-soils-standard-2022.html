<p>This publication has been withdrawn and replaced with updated guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>These are indicative Standards and payment rates while work continues to refine our assessments and receive feedback from farmers and stakeholders. We will publish final versions of this Standard by November 2021, ahead of launching the scheme in 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>How the standard works</h2>

<p>A standard is a set of land management actions.</p>

<p>There are 3 levels to the standard. Each level has a set of actions you must complete to get paid.
The levels build on one another - each one includes the actions from the previous levels.
If you’re already doing some of these actions on your land, they’ll count towards payment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How much you’ll be paid</h2>

<p>The levels and indicative payments for the improved grassland soils standard are set out in the table.
These payment rates are annual.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What land is eligible</h2>

<p>All grassland that meets the definition of improved grassland is eligible for this standard.
To qualify as improved grassland, the sward composition should include at least 2 of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more than 30% cover of rye-grasses and white clover</li>
  <li>up to 8 species per m2, including grasses</li>
  <li>less than 10% cover of wildflowers and sedges, excluding white clover, creeping buttercup, docks, thistles and ragwort</li>
</ul>

<p>Management of the land is likely to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular re-seeding, or has been reseeded within the last 15 years</li>
  <li>regular fertilising with typically at least 100 kg per ha of nitrogen as compound fertiliser or animal manures and slurries</li>
  <li>boom spraying herbicide to treat weeds</li>
  <li>active, well-maintained field drains</li>
  <li>taking any conserved forage as silage, usually more than once a year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grassland defined as improved grassland encompasses a wide range of farm and land types, including organic systems.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Ineligible land</h2>

<p>The following land is ineligible for this standard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sites of special scientific interest (SSSI)</li>
  <li>areas of peat soils greater than 20% soil organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Aims of the standard</h2>

<p>The aims of the standards are not mandatory but they describe a visual representation of what the outcome should look like if you follow all the mandatory actions. Further detail on monitoring and how the Aims will be used will be shared before the scheme launches in 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Actions</h2>

<p>Actions are mandatory. All actions must be delivered at the selected ambition level.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>All levels</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Carry out a soil assessment</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>A soil assessment will be completed at the start of the agreement to identify parcels at risk of surface runoff, soil erosion, compaction, waterlogging or regularly flooding, to inform land management actions. The assessment will include soil texture, drainage, slope and connectivity to a waterbody or sensitive habitat.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Carry out a soil assessment to identify the priority areas on your farm for delivering water quality improvements, carbon storage, flood mitigation or biodiversity.
In the first year, across all land, assess:</p>

<ul>
  <li>soil texture</li>
  <li>drainage</li>
  <li>slope</li>
  <li>connectivity to a waterbody or sensitive habitat</li>
</ul>

<p>Record and keep observations, and review the assessment every 2 years.</p>

<p>Every year, on at least 20% of the land:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess soil structure</li>
  <li>assess biological indicators, for example earthworm count</li>
  <li>analyse soil organic matter</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Improve soil structure by alleviating compaction</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>Throughout the agreement analysis of soil structure, biological indicators and soil organic matter will be completed across the whole farm. The results of which will inform actions to maintain or improve soil structure, including avoiding farm traffic machinery on wet soils, and where compaction has been identified, improving soil structure by either sub-soiling, cultivations, organic matter additions or resting the field.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Take measures to alleviate soil compaction identified in the soil assessment and Soil Management Plan (advanced level only).</p>

<p>Measures include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grassland aeration</li>
  <li>sub-soiling</li>
  <li>additions of organic matter</li>
  <li>natural soil recovery through resting the field</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not use sub-soiling or increase the depth of cultivation where there are known to be buried archaeological features.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Add or retain a mix of legumes, herbs and grasses</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>There will be a sward with a mixture of legumes, herbs and wildflowers, as described in the guidance, to provide varied root structures to improve and maintain soil structure, soil carbon, soil biology and soil fertility. This area will vary for each ambition level.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Increase or maintain the diversity of improved grass swards by adding or retaining a mixture of legumes, herbs and grasses with varied root structures.</p>

<ul>
  <li>do this on at least 5% improved grassland (introductory level)</li>
  <li>on at least 10% (intermediate level)</li>
  <li>on at least 15% (advanced level)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not do this on parcels with historic or archaeological features.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Maintain permanent grassland on land at risk of erosion or surface run-off</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>To maintain soil carbon, support biological activity and reduce erosion, maintain permanent grassland on land at risk of erosion or surface runoff identified in the soil assessment.  The area will vary according to ambition level.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Maintain as permanent grassland and only re-seed by direct drilling or over-sowing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>do this on at least 5% of improved permanent grassland (introductory level). This should be targeted at land at the highest risk of erosion or surface runoff identified in the soil assessment</li>
  <li>on at least 10% of improved permanent grassland (intermediate level). This should be targeted at land at risk of erosion or surface runoff identified in the soil assessment</li>
  <li>on at least 15% of improved permanent grassland (advanced level). This should be targeted at land at risk of erosion and surface runoff identified in the soil assessment</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>Manage stocking density on grassland at risk of erosion or surface run-off</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>To minimise poaching, soil compaction, bare ground and run-off, livestock will be removed or stocking densities will be reduced when the soils are wet on land at risk of erosion or surface run-off. The area will vary according to ambition level.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Reduce stocking density or remove livestock when soils are wet.</p>

<ul>
  <li>do this on at least 5% improved grassland (introductory level). This should be targeted at land at the highest risk of erosion or surface runoff identified in the soil assessment</li>
  <li>on at least 10% (intermediate level). This should be targeted at land at risk of erosion or surface runoff identified in the soil assessment</li>
  <li>on at least 15% (advanced level). This should be targeted at land at risk of erosion or surface runoff identified in the soil assessment</li>
</ul>

<p>Advanced level</p>

<p>For the advanced level you must do all of the actions listed above, plus the following action</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span>Create a soil management plan</h3>

<p>Aim</p>

<p>A full detailed soil management plan that takes account of soil biology, soil chemistry, soil organic matter and soil structure, in addition to the soil risk assessment, will be carried out for the whole farm. The soil management plan will be updated every two years and used to target and prioritise soil management interventions to improve soil structure, soil organic matter and overall soil health and reduce erosion and run-off.</p>

<p>Action</p>

<p>Produce this in the first year of your agreement to identify and action priorities to improve soil structure, soil carbon storage and soil biology and avoid and alleviate soil compaction.</p>

<p>This should build on the soil assessments and include soil respiration or microorganism assessments</p>

<p>You must review the plan every 2 years.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Relationship to existing regulations</h2>

<p>All farmers should be compliant with regulations. An expectation of regulatory compliance underpins the standards in the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme.</p>
