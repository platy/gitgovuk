<h2>Background to the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme</h2>

<p>On the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>), an <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> national vaccination programme was introduced in 2008 to protect secondary school Year 8 girls (aged 12 to 13 years old) against cervical cancer. At that time, a catch-up programme also took place to vaccinate girls aged 13 to 18 years old.</p>

<p>The recommendation for a 3 dose schedule of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine in the vaccination programme for adolescent girls was reviewed by <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> in May 2014. Following this, a 2-dose schedule was recommended for girls under fifteen years of age as antibody response to 2 doses was found to be as good as a 3 dose course.</p>

<p>In the latest evidence from evaluation of the programme, published in the Lancet in 2021, the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine was shown to dramatically reduce cervical cancer rates by almost 90% in women in their 20s who were offered the vaccine at age 12 to 13 years in England, when compared to an unvaccinated population. Earlier evidence had shown that the number of young women with pre-cancerous cervical disease is falling (Scotland data), and that the number of infections of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types 16 and 18, the main cancer-causing types, has reduced by 86% in 16 to 21 year old women in England. In 2018, 10 years after vaccination was introduced, no HPV16 and/or 18 infections were detected in 16 to 18 year olds, indicating the programme has succeeded in delivering both direct and indirect protection. In 2020, the rate of genital warts diagnoses among 15 to 17 year old girls was 95% lower compared to 2016 and a decline of 89% was seen in the same aged heterosexual boys over the same period, suggesting substantial herd protection. Current indications are that this protection will last for many years.</p>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20120907100504/http:/transparency.dh.gov.uk/2012/07/25/jcvi-meeting-june-2012/" rel="external">June 2012, the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr></a> asked the Health Protection Agency (now UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) but previously Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>)), to undertake modelling studies to assess the impact and cost effectiveness of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination of men who have sex with men (<abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>), as this group were expected to receive very little indirect protection or benefit from the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme offered to adolescent females.</p>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-statement-on-hpv-vaccination-of-men-who-have-sex-with-men">2015, <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr></a> advised that all <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> up to and including 45 years who attend sexual health and/or <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> treatment services should be offered the vaccine.</p>

<p>In 2016, a successful <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>-led pilot was set up which offered vaccine to <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> through existing appointments at selected local sexual health services in England. In April 2018, the vaccination programme was extended to include <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> up to and including 45 years attending all specialist Sexual Health Services (<abbr title="Sexual Health Services">SHSs</abbr>) and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> clinics.</p>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-statement-extending-the-hpv-vaccination-programme-conclusions">2017, <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr></a> considered evidence for extending the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme to boys. At that time, extending the programme to boys was not considered cost effective and <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> was unable to recommend extension.</p>

<p>Following stakeholder responses to this interim advice, additional analyses were conducted which adjusted for the long natural history of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> associated disease. This analysis found extension of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination to boys to be cost effective and it is anticipated that ongoing reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer, other cancers in both men and women and genital warts will substantially reduce the burden of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-related diseases.</p>

<p>In September 2019, the existing <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme was extended to boys from 12 years of age and this is expected to provide clear health benefits including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>direct protection for vaccinated boys against <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection and associated disease such as anogenital warts, anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers</li>
  <li>protection against <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> for <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> by offering them vaccination before their sexual debut</li>
  <li>indirect protection for non-vaccinated males and females</li>
</ul>

<p>At its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://app.box.com/s/iddfb4ppwkmtjusir2tc/file/229171742011" rel="external">meeting in June 2016</a> the Chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) noted that the 9-valent vaccine was the preferred vaccine for the girls’ programme because of the additional health benefits that it provided in protecting against the 5 additional cancer causing <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types.</p>

<p>In 2022 the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hpv-immunisation-programme-introduction-of-gardasil-9-letter/annex-b-hpv-vaccine-coverage-data-collection">Gardasil 9 vaccine will be introduced into the programme</a> and supplied for those eligible for the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine (adolescents aged 12 to 13 years and those who remain eligible until they turn 25 years of age, and <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> up to and including 45 years of age). As the programme transitions to Gardasil 9, some individuals may receive a mixed schedule during the switch. Gardasil and Gardasil 9 vaccines should be considered interchangeable and vaccination should not be delayed due to preference for either vaccine.</p>

<p>At its meeting in June 2021, the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advised a move from a 3-dose schedule to a 2-dose schedule for those starting the programme when they are aged 15 years and above and for those eligible through the <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> programme. The <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> also advised that the 3-dose schedule should continue to be offered to people known to be <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>-positive, including those on antiretroviral therapy, or known to be immunocompromised at the time of immunisation.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>individuals who would have been eligible to receive 3 doses of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine (eligible <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> and those aged from 15 to 25 years of age who are completely unvaccinated and remain eligible under the adolescent programme), will only require 2 doses, given at least 6 months apart, to be considered fully vaccinated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a 3-dose schedule should still be offered to eligible individuals who are living with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>, including those on antiretroviral therapy, or are known to be immunocompromised at the time of vaccination</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>individuals who start the NHS vaccination programme prior to 1 April 2022 should continue on the planned 3-dose schedule. Those who commence prior to 1 April 2022 whose schedule is interrupted/delayed so that an interval of 6 months or more was observed between their first and second doses should be considered fully vaccinated and do not require a third dose</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance provides information for healthcare practitioners about <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> programme eligibility, scheduling and vaccine administration.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine is recommended for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all adolescents (boys and girls) in school Year 8 (usually aged 12 and 13)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> up to and including 45 years of age attending specialist <abbr title="Sexual Health Services">SHSs</abbr> and/or <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> clinics regardless of risk, sexual behaviour or disease status</li>
</ul>

<p>Girls remain eligible to receive the vaccine up to their 25th birthday, and boys in the eligible cohort (born after 1 September 2006) remain eligible to receive the vaccine until their 25th birthday. Older boys (born before 1 September 2006) have not been offered the vaccine as they are already benefitting greatly from the indirect protection provided by the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme to date.</p>

<p><abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> older than 45 years are not eligible for <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination under the national NHS England procured service.</p>

<p>Although the universal adolescent <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> programme will be delivered as a school-based programme, eligible individuals who are home-schooled, or schooled outside of mainstream schooling should also be offered the vaccine.</p>

<h3>Individuals with a similar risk profile to <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> considers that there may be considerable benefit in offering the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine to other individuals who have a similar risk profile to that seen in the sexual health and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> clinic attending <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> population, including some <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> over 45 years of age, sex-workers, women and men who are <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> positive. Clinicians are able to offer vaccinations outside of the national programme using individual clinical judgement, and <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination could therefore be considered for such individuals on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>In these instances, vaccine should be purchased directly from the manufacturer and costs reclaimed. Vaccine stock centrally procured for the schools-based or the <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> programme should not be used for this purpose.</p>

<h3>Transgender individuals</h3>

<p>The eligibility of transgender women (women who were assigned male at birth) should be a case-by-case clinical decision based on a risk assessment that includes the woman’s sexual behaviour and the sexual behaviour of their partners. Transgender women are eligible if their risk of acquiring <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> is equivalent to the risk of <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> eligible for the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>Transgender men (men who were assigned female at birth) are eligible for vaccination if they have sex with other men, attend specialist <abbr title="Sexual Health Services">SHSs</abbr> or <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> clinics and are aged 45 and under. If they have previously completed a course of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination as part of the girls’ school Year 8 <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine programme, no further doses need be given.</p>

<h3>Vaccination of individuals not eligible to receive <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine as part of an NHS-approved vaccination programme</h3>

<p>For these individuals, if following a clinical assessment <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine is clinically indicated, the vaccine can be prescribed but must be sought separately from the national immunisation stock.</p>

<p>Vaccine supplied to practices free of charge via ImmForm cannot be used for this purpose. GP surgeries should order <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine directly from the manufacturer and then reclaim the cost of the vaccine.</p>

<p>Some parents may opt to make alternative arrangements to have their child immunised with the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine if their child does not meet the eligibility criteria for the routine programme. Parents should be informed that if the vaccine is not clinically indicated and a private arrangement is made for vaccination, the provider may charge for the service as this arrangement is outside of the national programme.</p>

<h3>Individuals moving from abroad</h3>

<p>Males and females moving to the UK from overseas who have not been offered protection against <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> in their country of origin and who meet the eligibility criteria for <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine should be offered vaccine if they are under 25 years of age. This would include females born after 1 September 1991, males born after 1 September 2006 and <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> attending specialist <abbr title="Sexual Health Services">SHSs</abbr> up to 45 years of age.</p>

<h2>Recommended vaccine</h2>

<p>During 2022, the vaccine supplied for the adolescent <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> and <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-<abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> programmes will change from Gardasil to Gardasil 9. The timing is dependent on depletion of <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s stocks of Gardasil.</p>

<p>Once <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> start to supply Gardasil 9, for a period of time, both vaccines may be locally available in different areas as teams exhaust their local Gardasil stocks at a different pace. Both vaccines can be used interchangeably and there should be no delay due to preference for either vaccine.</p>

<h3>Gardasil</h3>

<p>Gardasil is licensed for use from 9 years of age and it is the vaccine that has been used in the NHS since 2012. Gardasil provides protection against 4 <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types: 16 and 18, 2 high risk <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types that can lead to cancer; and 6 and 11, the 2 <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types that cause approximately 90% of all anogenital warts in males and females.</p>

<h3>Gardasil 9</h3>

<p>Gardasil 9 is licensed for use from 9 years of age and provides protection against 9 <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types: 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58. This vaccine will become available for use during 2022.</p>

<p>The vaccine is made from the proteins that make up the outer coat of the virus types. These proteins assemble into small spheres that are called virus-like particles (<abbr title="virus-like particles">VLPs</abbr>). <abbr title="virus-like particles">VLPs</abbr> are not infectious and cannot cause <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-associated cancers or genital warts as they do not contain the virus’s DNA. However, <abbr title="virus-like particles">VLPs</abbr> are very immunogenic, which means that they induce high levels of antibody production by the body. Following vaccination with <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine, the immune system should mount a response against the <abbr title="virus-like particles">VLPs</abbr>. Upon subsequent exposure to the live virus, the immune system reacts quickly to prevent infection.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/schedules" rel="external"><abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> vaccine-preventable diseases monitoring system</a> 2020 global summary lists over 120 countries using <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine around the world. Over <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/18/ten-years-on-since-the-start-of-the-hpv-vaccine-programme-what-impact-is-it-having/" rel="external">10.5 million doses</a> were given in the first 10 years of the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine programme in the UK and more than 100 million people have been vaccinated worldwide.</p>

<p>Gardasil 9 offers protection against 5 additional types of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> (31, 33, 45, 52, 58) which, although less common than types 16 and 18, are also considered high-risk. Gardasil 9 is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/gardasil-9" rel="external">expected to prevent</a> the majority of cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers and premalignant lesions, as well as genital warts associated with <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine excipients</h3>

<p>Vaccine excipients can be found in the vaccine’s summary of product characteristics (<abbr title="summary of product characteristics">SPC</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/261/smpc" rel="external">Gardasil</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/7330/smpc" rel="external">Gardasil 9</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Neither Gardasil nor Gardasil 9 contain thiomersal or porcine gelatine.</p>

<h2>Vaccine efficacy</h2>

<p>Gardasil has been shown to be highly effective in preventing <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection for the serotypes contained in the vaccine.</p>

<p>In clinical trials in young women with no previous history of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection, the vaccine was shown to be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/vaccines.html" rel="external">99% effective</a> at preventing pre-cancerous lesions associated with <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types 16 and 18. Gardasil is also 99% effective at preventing genital warts associated with vaccine types in young women.</p>

<p>Although <a class="govuk-link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090348#abstract0" rel="external">Miltz and others</a> concluded that there was no evidence that <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccines are effective in preventing vaccine-type <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-associated pre-cancer in women with evidence of prior <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> exposure, it has been suggested that they may be an effective post-treatment adjuvant form of therapy by boosting immunity, reducing recurrences or preventing re-infection in people with a history of previously treated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22291111/" rel="external">high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia</a> (HGAIN).</p>

<p>Prior infection with an <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> type does not diminish the efficacy of the vaccine against other <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types included in the vaccine. To get the best protection, it is important that the full course of vaccination is received.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21288094/" rel="external">clinical trial</a> of Gardasil in men indicated that it can prevent anal cell changes caused by persistent <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection, and genital warts. <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccines have not been shown to have an impact on an existing infection or any of the outcomes of an existing <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> infection, such as anogenital warts, but may boost immunity and prevent re-infection or reduce recurrences in people with established disease.</p>

<p>In a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02178-4/fulltext" rel="external">study</a>, published in the Lancet in 2021, the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine was shown to dramatically reduce cervical cancer rates by almost 90% in women in their 20s who were offered the vaccine at age 12 to 13 years in England, when compared to an unvaccinated population.</p>

<h2>Vaccine dosage and schedule</h2>

<p>Gardasil and Gardasil 9 should be administered as a 0.5ml dose and from 1 April 2022 should be offered with the following schedules:</p>

<h3>Immunocompetent eligible individuals of all ages (children, adolescents and adults)</h3>

<p><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine should be administered as a 2-dose schedule at 0 and 6 to 24 months.</p>

<p>Any interval between doses of between 6 and 24 months is clinically acceptable.</p>

<h3>Immunocompromised individuals</h3>

<p>There is no data for 2-dose schedules for immunocompromised individuals. For this reason, a 3-dose schedule with doses at 0, 1 and 4 to 6 months should be offered to individuals who are known to be immunocompromised at the time of immunisation. Re-immunisation may be considered after treatment is finished and/or recovery has occurred depending on treatment received.</p>

<p>Specialist advice may be required, see Green Book <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immunisation-of-individuals-with-underlying-medical-conditions-the-green-book-chapter-7">chapter 7</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/human-papillomavirus-hpv-the-green-book-chapter-18a">chapter 18a</a>.</p>

<h3>Individuals living with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Eligible individuals who are <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> positive should be given <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bhiva.org/vaccination-guidelines" rel="external"><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine</a> regardless of CD4 count, antiretroviral therapy use or viral load. Evidence suggests individuals living with <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> are at increased risk of acquiring <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> and persistent infection. They are also more likely to have frequent carriage of multiple <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types and have an increased risk of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-related rapidly progressive malignancies.</p>

<p><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccines are known to be safe and immunogenic when given to individuals who are <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> positive with no adverse impact on CD4 cell counts or viral load observed.</p>

<p>There are no data to support giving fewer than 3 doses to individuals who are <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> positive. For this reason a 3-dose schedule at 0,1 and 4 to 6 months should continue to be offered to individuals in the eligible cohort who are known to be <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> positive. The immune response to this vaccination and its effectiveness may be less than that observed in people who are <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> negative.</p>

<h3>Duration of protection</h3>

<p>Current studies suggest that protection is maintained for at least 10 years although it is expected to last longer and may be lifelong. Long term follow up studies are underway to evaluate this and will determine the need for any boosters.</p>

<p>There is currently no recommendation for any booster dose of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine following a primary course.</p>

<h3>Vaccine safety</h3>

<p>The safety of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine has been established through rigorous testing in clinical trials followed by extensive global use with millions of doses administered to date. As with any medicinal product, some people may experience a side effect (see adverse reactions section below), but these are generally mild, of short duration and outweighed by the benefits of the vaccine.</p>

<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<abbr title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">CDC</abbr>) have posted clear advice on their website supporting the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv-vaccine.html" rel="external">safety of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine</a>.</p>

<h3>Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (<abbr title="postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome">POTS</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome">POTS</abbr> is 4 times more common in females and has peak onset in adolescence. Given the number of girls vaccinated, a large number of diagnoses of <abbr title="postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome">POTS</abbr> around the age <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine is given would be expected, regardless of any association with the vaccine.</p>

<p>In previous years, concerns regarding the safety of the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine have been raised in the UK and other European countries, with some parents and pressure groups linking the vaccine to <abbr title="postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome">POTS</abbr>. In June 2015, the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> carried out a routine review of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine safety and concluded that it had no concerns about the safety of the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine. The European Medicines Agency (<abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr>) has also conducted an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/review-concludes-evidence-does-not-support-hpv-vaccines-cause-crps-pots" rel="external">independent review</a> and, in line with findings from the UK’s MHRA, concluded that available evidence does not support that <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccines cause complex regional pain syndrome (<abbr title="complex regional pain syndrome">CPRS</abbr>) or <abbr title="postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome">POTS</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine was temporarily suspended by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204520306082?via%3Dihub" rel="external">Japanese government</a> in 2013 but as no causal link was found between the vaccine and the illnesses reported in Japan the suspension was lifted in 2020. No other health authorities have taken similar action, and the World Health Organization continues to endorse the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>Various worldwide independent health bodies and authorities have also reviewed the safety of the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine and all have concluded that the evidence does not support a link between <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine and the development of a range of chronic illnesses.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine ordering</h2>

<p>There are separate order lines for the adolescent and <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> programmes on ImmForm. The correct one must be used to order vaccine volumes for each programme, even where an ImmForm account holder is ordering for both.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine storage</h2>

<p><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine should be stored in a vaccine refrigerator between +2°C and +8°C. The vaccines should be stored in the original packaging to protect them from light and should not be frozen. Further information on vaccine storage is available in the vaccine <abbr title="summary of product characteristics">SPC</abbr>, the patient group direction (<abbr title="patient group direction">PGD</abbr>) and from the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Effectiveness cannot be guaranteed for vaccines unless they have been stored at the correct temperature. Those responsible for the ordering, storage and use of vaccines should be familiar with the recommendations in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/storage-distribution-and-disposal-of-vaccines-the-green-book-chapter-3">Green Book chapter 3</a>. Vaccines should not be over-ordered or stockpiled.</p>

<h2>Consent</h2>

<h3>Obtaining consent</h3>

<p>Where doses of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine are being given in school, it may be more practical to obtain written consent for both doses of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine from parents once rather than separately for each dose. As the 2 <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> doses may be given across 2 different academic years (Year 8 and Year 9) in areas delivering a school-based programme, if written consent is sought from parents, this need only be done once for the full course.</p>

<h3>Written consent</h3>

<p>In the routine school-based immunisation programmes, an information leaflet and consent form are usually sent to the parent to complete and return as they are not present at the time of vaccination. Email or electronic forms of consent are increasingly being used.</p>

<p>Consideration should be given for appropriate routes to reach parents or families who may not easily access information digitally. Providers should make sure parents have sight of the NHS information leaflets.</p>

<p>Consent forms should not act as a barrier to immunisation and they should be as simple to complete as possible. Any information being collected about the young person, such as their health and immunisation status, or medications being taken, should be relevant to the immunisation being offered.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> provides <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccination-consent-form">template consent forms</a> that are available to download.</p>

<h3>Verbal consent</h3>

<p>On the day of the immunisation session, school nurses and school immunisation teams should attempt to make contact with the parent or guardian of young people who are keen to be immunised but who have not returned a written consent form. This enables consent to be obtained over the phone which maximises uptake and reduces the need for additional catch-up sessions. This strategy also has the added benefit of including people who are unable to complete written consent forms due to language or literacy issues therefore addressing inequalities.</p>

<h3>Self-consent</h3>

<p>As is clearly outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consent-the-green-book-chapter-2">Green Book consent chapter</a>, some young people can self-consent. If a parent cannot be reached on the phone at the time of the immunisation session, self-consent should be used, where appropriate, to ensure the child is protected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>young people aged 16 and 17 are presumed, in law, to be able to consent to their own medical treatment</li>
  <li>younger children who understand fully what is involved in the proposed procedure (referred to as ‘Gillick competent’) can also give consent, although ideally their parents will be involved. Although there is no lower age for Gillick competency, as this will vary from child to child, some immunisation teams choose to reserve this option for senior school children</li>
  <li>if a person aged 16 or 17 or a Gillick-competent child consents to treatment, a parent cannot override that consent</li>
  <li>if the health professional taking consent felt a child was not Gillick-competent then the consent of someone with parental responsibility would be sought</li>
  <li>if a person aged 16 or 17 or a Gillick-competent child refuses treatment that refusal should be accepted. It is unlikely that a person with parental responsibility could overrule such a refusal.</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of local areas are already successfully using self-consent for young people aged 16 or 17 and Gillick-competent children in their schools-based programmes. Some teams advise parents in the information provided, that the young person will be offered the opportunity to self-consent if the completed consent form is not returned. Self-consent can also increase inclusion where parents have language or literacy issues and could also reduce the need for additional immunisation sessions at the school.</p>

<h2>Vaccine administration</h2>

<h4>Administering <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine</h4>

<p><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine should be administered according to the manufacturer’s instructions and healthcare professionals are encouraged to read the individual vaccine summary of product characteristics (<abbr title="summary of product characteristics">SPC</abbr>) to ensure accurate delivery of the product. Prior to use, the pre-filled syringe should be shaken well to obtain a white, cloudy suspension.</p>

<p>The vaccine should be administered by a single intramuscular injection (<abbr title="intramuscular injection">IM</abbr>) into the deltoid area of the upper arm. Healthcare professionals should choose an appropriate needle length to ensure an intramuscular (<abbr title="intramuscular injection">IM</abbr>) administration. Longer length needles are recommended for morbidly obese individuals to ensure the vaccine is injected into muscle.</p>

<p>A small air bubble may be visible in the prefilled syringe. This is not harmful and should not be removed prior to administration. This small bolus of air injected following administration of medication clears the needle and prevents a localised reaction from the vaccination. To try to expel it risks accidently expelling some of the vaccine and therefore not giving the patient the full dose.</p>

<p>Accurate records should be kept to ensure there is clear evidence of which <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine has been administered and Gardasil or Gardasil 9 should be specified.</p>

<h3>Vaccination for individuals with bleeding disorders</h3>

<p>Individuals with bleeding disorders may be vaccinated intramuscularly if, in the opinion of a doctor familiar with the individual’s bleeding risk, vaccines or similar small volume intramuscular injections can be administered with reasonable safety by this route. If the individual receives medication or treatment to reduce bleeding, for example treatment for haemophilia, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such medication or treatment is administered. Individuals on stable anticoagulation therapy, including individuals on warfarin who are up to date with their scheduled INR testing and whose latest INR was below the upper threshold of their therapeutic range, can receive intramuscular vaccination. A fine needle (equal to 23 gauge or finer calibre such as 25 gauge) should be used for the vaccination, followed by firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes.</p>

<p>If in any doubt, consult with the clinician responsible for prescribing or monitoring the individual’s anticoagulant therapy.</p>

<p>The individual or carer should be informed about the risk of haematoma from the injection.</p>

<h3>Administering the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine at the same time as other vaccines</h3>

<p>Gardasil and Gardasil 9 are inactivated vaccines and will not be affected by, nor interfere with other inactivated or live vaccines given at the same time, or at any interval from each other.</p>

<p>If more than 1 vaccine is given at the same time, the vaccines should be given at separate sites, preferably in a different limb. If given in the same limb, they should be given at least 2.5cm apart. The site at which each vaccine was given should be noted in the individual’s records.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> Hepatitis B vaccination status</h3>

<p>Clinics or clinicians should take the opportunity to check (and correctly code) patients’ hepatitis B virus (<abbr title="hepatitis B virus">HBV</abbr>) vaccination status. Hepatitis B vaccination uptake amongst <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> attending specialist <abbr title="Sexual Health Services">SHSs</abbr> is below national targets, both for first dose uptake and for completion of 3 doses of vaccine. Recording of both <abbr title="hepatitis B virus">HBV</abbr> immunity and hepatitis B vaccine delivery by clinician coding is also suboptimal. The UK’s risk-based vaccination policy for hepatitis B includes <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> and maintaining high vaccine coverage in <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> is important to avoid outbreaks of <abbr title="hepatitis B virus">HBV</abbr> infection.</p>

<p>Further information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hepatitis-b-the-green-book-chapter-18">Green Book Hepatitis B chapter 18</a>and in the British Association for Sexual Health and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> (<abbr title="British Association for Sexual Health and HIV">BASHH</abbr>)’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bashhguidelines.org/current-guidelines/viral-hepatitis/" rel="external">National Guidelines for the Management for Viral Hepatitides 2017 interim update</a>.</p>

<h2>Cautions and contraindications for receiving Gardasil or Gardasil 9</h2>

<p>There are very few individuals who cannot receive <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccines. Where there is doubt, instead of withholding immunisation, appropriate advice should be sought from a consultant with immunisation expertise, a member of the screening and immunisation team or from the local health protection team.</p>

<p>Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be postponed until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing any signs or symptoms to any possible adverse effects of the vaccine.</p>

<p>Gardasil and Gardasil 9 should not be administered to those who have had:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirmed anaphylaxis to a previous dose of the vaccine OR</li>
  <li>confirmed anaphylaxis to any constituent or excipient of the vaccine</li>
</ul>

<p>For the composition and full list of vaccine excipients refer to the specific Summary of Product Characteristics (<abbr title="summary of product characteristics">SPC</abbr>):</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/7330/smpc" rel="external">Gardasil 9</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Yeast allergy</h3>

<p>Even though Gardasil and Gardasil 9 are grown in yeast cells, the final vaccine product does not contain yeast as an excipient or ingredient, and at most would only contain very small trace amounts of yeast protein (&lt;0.007 micrograms).</p>

<p>Yeast allergy is not a contraindication to the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<h3>Adverse reactions following Gardasil vaccination</h3>

<p>In clinical vaccine trials the most common adverse reactions observed were injection-site reactions (77.1% of vaccinees within 5 days following any <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination visit). These include mild to moderate short-lasting pain, redness and swelling at the injection site. Other reactions commonly reported are headache, fever, nausea and dizziness. These adverse reactions are usually mild or moderate in intensity.</p>

<h3>Adverse reactions following Gardasil 9 vaccination</h3>

<p>In clinical vaccine trials the most common adverse reactions observed were injection-site reactions (84.8% of vaccinees within 5 days following any vaccination visit). These include mild to moderate short-lasting pain, redness and swelling at the injection site. Other reactions commonly reported are headache, fever, nausea and dizziness. These adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity.</p>

<p>For a detailed list of adverse reactions associated with Gardasil or Gardasil 9 refer to the manufacturer’s summary of product characteristics (<abbr title="summary of product characteristics">SPC</abbr>) or the patient information leaflet (<abbr title="patient information leaflet">PIL</abbr>):</p>

<p>Any suspected adverse reactions following administration should be reported to the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard" rel="external">Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency</a> (MHRA) using the yellow card reporting scheme.</p>

<h2>PGDs and patient information</h2>

<h3>Patient group directions (PGDs) and off-label use</h3>

<p>Gardasil and Gardasil 9 are prescription only medicines and should only be administered using 1 of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prescription written manually or electronically by a registered medical practitioner or other authorised prescriber</li>
  <li>Patient Specific Direction (<abbr title="patient specific direction">PSD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Patient Group Direction (<abbr title="patient group direction">PGD</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> have developed a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immunisation-patient-group-direction-pgd">national <abbr title="patient group direction">PGD</abbr> template</a> which should be reviewed and authorised locally before use. Off-label use of licensed products can be permitted under a <abbr title="patient group direction">PGD</abbr> if that use is included within the <abbr title="patient group direction">PGD</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Incomplete or interrupted schedules</h2>

<p>Any eligible individual that started but did not complete the routine adolescent <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme before reaching the age of 25 years should complete the vaccination course at the minimum interval.</p>

<p><abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> individuals that started but did not complete the schedule before the age of 46 years should complete the vaccination course at the minimum interval.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to restart the course for either group, even if there has been a longer than recommended interval between doses.</p>

<h3>Eligible individuals with a history of receiving an incomplete course of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine</h3>

<p>Where an individual in the eligible cohort (females born after 1 September 1991 and males born after 1 September 2006) presents with an incomplete vaccination history, every effort should be made to clarify what doses they have had and when they were administered.</p>

<p>If the course is interrupted, it should be resumed but not repeated.</p>

<p>Individuals who started the 3-dose schedule before 1 April 2022 should continue on the planned 3-dose schedule.</p>

<p>Eligible individuals who commenced a 3-dose schedule but received the first 2 doses of vaccine at least 6 months apart do not require a third dose and should be considered to have completed the full course.</p>

<p>Immunocompromised individuals or those individuals known to be <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> positive should continue to receive the 3-dose schedule.</p>

<h3>Vaccines administered at less than the recommended interval in error</h3>

<p>Where vaccines have been given at less than the recommended interval, the dose given early should be discounted and should be repeated once the recommended time period has elapsed and at least 4 weeks from the dose given early in error. Individuals should be advised this may lead to an increased risk of local reaction.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, immunisations for all individuals should follow the recommended 0, 6 to 24 months schedule, but there is some clinical data that the interval between the 2 doses can be reduced to 5 months for Cervarix.</p>

<p>For Gardasil the minimum interval between the 2 doses should be 6 months.</p>

<p>For Gardasil 9 the minimum interval between the 2 doses can be 5 months.</p>

<p>Two doses given less than 6 months apart for Gardasil or less than 5 months apart for Gardasil 9 should not be considered adequate to provide long term protection and a third dose should be given according to the recommended interval as above.  If different vaccines (a mixed schedule) have been administered with the 0, 6 to 24 month schedule, the minimum interval between the 2 doses should be 6 months.</p>

<p>As the <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> <abbr title="patient group direction">PGD</abbr> recommends a minimum interval of 6 months between doses, vaccination sessions that are less than 6 months apart should not routinely be scheduled.</p>

<h3>Administration of an incomplete dose</h3>

<p>In the event that Gardasil or Gardasil 9 vaccine is administered at less than the recommended 0.5 ml dose, the vaccination will need to be repeated because the dose that the individual received may not be sufficient to evoke a full immune response. Where possible, the dose should be repeated on the same day or as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

<h2>Gardasil or Gardasil 9 scheduling</h2>

<h3>Individual or parent requests the same vaccine for the second dose</h3>

<p>Gardasil and Gardasil 9 should be considered as interchangeable and there should be no delay due to preference for either vaccine. Individuals may receive 2 doses of Gardasil, 2 doses of Gardasil 9 or a mixed schedule.</p>

<h3>Individual or parent is concerned about the reason Gardasil is being replaced with Gardasil 9</h3>

<p>Gardasil has an excellent safety record established after use of more than 7 million doses in the routine immunisation programme in the UK since 2012, with millions more doses used in other countries. No serious new safety issues have been found with Gardasil since it was introduced in the UK and it has been shown to provide good protection against cervical and other <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-related cancers.</p>

<h3>Individual or parent requests Gardasil 9 even though they have completed a course of Gardasil vaccine</h3>

<p>The primary purpose of the national immunisation programme is to protect against <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>-related cancers. Gardasil has been shown to give good protection against <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> related cancers caused by <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types 16 and 18. It would not be appropriate therefore as part of the NHS programme to offer Gardasil 9 to those who have had a full course of Gardasil.</p>

<h2>Cervical screening</h2>
<p>Cervical screening is offered to all women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 64 years in the UK. This is to detect infection with “high risk” types of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>. If these types of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> are found, the sample is then checked for precancerous changes in the cervix so that early treatment reduces the chances of cancer developing.</p>

<p><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine does not protect against all <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> types so cervical screening remains important and should be carried out according to the national screening programme policy.</p>

<h2>COVER data</h2>

<h3>Vaccine coverage data for the adolescent <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> programme</h3>

<p>The routine <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine coverage collection for the adolescent programme will not be impacted by the switch to Gardasil 9.</p>

<p>Dose 1 and dose 2 coverage of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine will continue to be evaluated for both males and females in school Year 8 (ages 12 to 13 years old) and Year 9 (ages 13 to 14 years old) as part of the routine universal programme.</p>

<p><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> coverage is based on aggregated school level data. The data is entered manually on a secure web platform called ImmForm. For more information, please see: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hpv-immunisation-programme-introduction-of-gardasil-9-letter/annex-b-hpv-vaccine-coverage-data-collection">Annex B: <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine coverage data</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/vaccine-uptake#hpv-vaccine-uptake">annual <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> coverage reports</a>.</p>

<h3>Vaccine coverage data collection for the <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme</h3>

<p>Accurate recording of all vaccine doses given and reasons for not offering or giving the vaccine to eligible <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> (via the codes available in surveillance and reporting systems) is essential.</p>
