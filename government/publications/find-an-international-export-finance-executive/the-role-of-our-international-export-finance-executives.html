<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>How IEFEs can help</h2>

<p>International export finance executives (IEFEs) are global representatives of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-export-finance">UK Export Finance</a> (UKEF), based outside the UK. They work within the department’s Origination, Client Coverage, Marketing and Communications (OCCMC) division.</p>

<p>Forming a key part of OCCMC’s international business development activities, IEFEs are the first point of contact for various counterparties in-country. They are on hand to discuss financing options available from UKEF to support the exports of UK goods and/or services.</p>

<h4>Who can benefit from IEFE assistance?</h4>

<p>IEFEs can consider appropriate bankable projects across all sectors within their regions. Special attention will be given to clean growth sector opportunities for UK businesses, ensuring UKEF support for the global transition to a low carbon economy.</p>

<p>Our IEFEs are qualified practitioners of structured and export finance, and have significant experience in their markets.</p>

<p>Potential counterparties who may benefit from IEFE assistance include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK suppliers and exporters travelling in-country and looking to explore financing options available to support their export contracts</li>
  <li>overseas buyers and project sponsors looking for UKEF support to finance their projects and/or contracts</li>
  <li>contractors (UK and non-UK based) looking to obtain financing for project sponsors provided there is a viable project or contract</li>
  <li>professional advisors and consultants who are looking to obtain financing options in their advisory services to the project sponsors</li>
  <li>banks’ counterparties looking to use UKEF to support their lending to overseas buyers or project sponsors</li>
  <li>government and/or government-related entities exploring financing options to support their national development projects</li>
</ul>
