<p>Common Platform is a digital case management system. It allows all parties involved in a case secure access to case information in one place, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the judiciary</li>
  <li>solicitors and barristers</li>
  <li>Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)</li>
  <li>court staff</li>
</ul>

<p>Each platform user only sees the material appropriate to them, and has immediate access to the most up-to-date information.</p>

<p>This reduces the need for manual document handling and improves how criminal cases are accessed, managed and processed.</p>

<p>We’re currently implementing Common Platform in all criminal courts across England and Wales.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Important statistics</h2>

<p>As of 18 July 2022, Common Platform has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>managed over 250,000 cases</li>
  <li>gone live in over 120 criminal courts (56% of all criminal courts)</li>
  <li>onboarded legal professionals from over 1,000 firms</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Main outcomes</h2>

<p>The purpose of Common Platform is to link HMCTS more effectively with criminal justice partners through one central, online system. This is to give the parties in a case quicker access to the most up-to-date information, and to free up court staff for work that they can add most value.</p>

<p>We’ve achieved several major outcomes towards these goals, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the system is live in 56% of criminal courts and is used to hear cases in both the Crown and magistrates’ courts</li>
  <li>recording the adjudication in the courtroom on a new single IT software platform which is used in the Crown and magistrates’ courts, replacing unintegrated IT systems that did not talk to each other</li>
  <li>case information is available online to defence practitioners, the police, Crown Prosecution Service, National Probation Service, youth offending teams and the witness service</li>
  <li>when court users have administrative queries in the magistrates’ court, our Courts and Tribunals Service Centre (CTSC) resolves these to make sure consistent, easy access to customer support is available</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How Common Platform helps courts run more smoothly</h2>

<p>From a clerk in the Crown Court who feels like they’re “constantly spinning plates” to a legal adviser handling up to 30 cases each day, using several different software systems makes things challenging for staff in a courtroom.</p>

<p>Switching to Common Platform, all the information will be in one place. This makes it easier for legal advisers and court clerks to access case details for entirety of the case and keep a court log. Similarly, staff can record results and generate notices, orders and warrants to share with the appropriate agencies automatically in the courtroom as soon as a case is concluded.</p>

<p>Common Platform also means that the parties in a case, including defence, can ‘self-serve’ case materials as soon as they’re uploaded to the system, removing the need to request and wait for them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Looking ahead</h2>

<p>By the end of the 2022 to 2023 business year, we expect Common Platform to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be used in all Crown and magistrates’ courts in England and Wales</li>
  <li>include more automated and digitised processes</li>
  <li>make use of more enhanced case progression features, so it’s easier for staff to keep cases moving through the courts</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Feedback</h2>

<p>Carl Nadim, defence solicitor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I have used Common Platform from the outset which has really assisted in the efficiency of dealing with cases. Being able to login to a Cloud-based system to retrieve evidence and communicate with the other parties frees up so much more time, to prepare and attend court ready to progress, especially when I’m Court Duty. Common Platform really is the next step in finally achieving a system between all parties which will help remove the communication barriers which are all too present in today’s court system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jon Sugden, legal adviser at HMCTS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">My first impression of Common Platform was it was more modern than previous systems, especially in its design and feel. Dealing with a case on a single system, rather than at least 3 different systems as we did previously, is more practical and efficient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark Whitely, Wales transformation implementer at HMCTS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I like that producing orders is far simpler, now they are created directly from the result. There’ is no need to produce orders manually and email them or complete a lengthy electronic monitoring form.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Who we’re working with</h2>

<p>To make sure Common Platform works for all users, we’re working together with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPS</li>
  <li>judiciary</li>
  <li>magistracy</li>
  <li>Legal Aid Agency</li>
  <li>defence professionals (including the Bar Council, Criminal Bar Association, Law Society)</li>
  <li>police forces</li>
  <li>witness care units</li>
  <li>youth offending teams</li>
  <li>NHS Liaison and Diversion</li>
  <li>HM Prisons and Probation Service</li>
  <li>Big Word (interpreting service provider)</li>
  <li>justice contractors</li>
  <li>Electronic monitoring service</li>
  <li>media</li>
  <li>consultation with departmental trade unions</li>
</ul>
