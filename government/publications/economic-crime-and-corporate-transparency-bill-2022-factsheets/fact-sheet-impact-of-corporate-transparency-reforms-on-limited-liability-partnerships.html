<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Do Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) fall within scope of the corporate transparency reforms?</h2>

<p>Any entity which registers at Companies House will fall within scope of the reforms. This includes LLPs.</p>

<p>The reforms do include substantial changes to the legislation on limited partnerships (LPs). Although LPs are similarly titled to LLPs, they are entirely distinct forms of business association. The Government is not making substantial amendments to the legislation that underpins LLPs with the Bill. However, secondary legislation will be passed in due course which adapts company law, as amended by the Bill, to the law governing LLPs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> How will the corporate transparency reforms affect LLPs?</h2>

<p>All of the members of LLPs will be required to verify their identities. It will be an offence to fail to do so. They will also be required to verify the identity of their people with significant control. Where a partner is a corporate entity, all of the directors (or equivalents) will also be required to verify their identity.</p>

<p>The changes introduced through this Bill all apply to information that LLPs submit to the register. For example, the Registrar will be given new powers to query the information that is held about an entity on the Register. The Registrar will also be able to proactively exchange information with other bodies, for the purpose of exercising the Registrar’s functions or for purposes connected with the functions of a public authority that the Registrar exchanges information with.</p>

<p>Many LLPs provide formation and filing services. If an LLP provides these services for an LP, the LLP must confirm that it is supervised for anti-money laundering purposes in the UK, and register as an Authorised Corporate Services Provider (ACSP). When they seek to form an entity or to file on their behalf, they will then be required to confirm that the identities of all directors (and their equivalents in different forms of entity) associated with that entity have been verified, to a standard that is at least the equivalent of those conducted by Companies House. Formation and filing services that LLPs provide in respect of other entities can either be submitted as an ACSP, or by an individual who may work for the LLP and has had their identity verified.</p>

<p>LLPs that are the general partners of LPs, and which are also corporate entities, will be required to name a managing officer who is an individual, for the purpose of communicating with the general partner.</p>

<p>Corporate director reforms <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-crime-and-corporate-transparency-bill-2022-factsheets">see section 6 of ‘Identity Verification and Authorised Corporate Service Providers’ factsheet</a>, which will be regulated for after Royal Assent of this Bill, will apply to LLPs acting as corporate directors. An LLP will only be able to act as a corporate director if all its members have had their identity verified.</p>
