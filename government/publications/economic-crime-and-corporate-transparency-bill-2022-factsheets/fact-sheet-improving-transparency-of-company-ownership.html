<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> What is the government doing and why?</h2>

<p>Through the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill (“the Bill”), and through regulations, the government will improve the transparency of company ownership.</p>

<p>A core purpose of the companies register is to provide details of company ownership. However, users of the companies register, for instance those who use the companies register to confirm basic information about a company or to carry out due diligence work, have reported that there are some problems with the way company ownership data is recorded.</p>

<p>The government is introducing measures in the Bill to improve transparency requirements to increase the usefulness of the information held on the shareholders, subscribers and guarantors (referred to collectively as shareholders) of UK companies. These measures will mean that users of the companies register will have more certainty on who they are doing business with, build confidence in the integrity of the companies register, and prevent bad actors from exploiting the register.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> How is the government going to do it?</h2>

<p>The government will introduce measures that will improve the usefulness of information held on the shareholders of UK companies by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introducing a requirement for companies to record the full names of shareholders in their registers</li>
  <li>introducing a requirement for certain companies to provide a one-off full shareholder list: this will enable Companies House to display shareholder information in a more user-friendly way</li>
  <li>taking a power to make regulations to collect more information about shareholders</li>
</ul>

<p>The government will also do the following through regulations made under the Companies Act 2006:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collect and display more information from companies claiming an exemption from the requirement to provide details of their People with Significant Control (PSCs), including the reason for the exemption</li>
  <li>collect and display the conditions satisfied to which allow a Relevant Legal Entity (RLE) to be recorded as a PSC</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How will the measures affect the submission of shareholder names?</h2>

<p>Currently the Companies Act 2006 requires companies to provide names of their shareholders, but “names” is not defined.  The Bill will introduce a requirement for companies to record the full names of all company shareholders in their registers, for instance ‘Jane Smith’ as opposed to ‘J Smith’. The government will also introduce a one-off requirement for private companies, and traded companies where shareholders hold at least 5% of the issued shares of any class of the company, to provide a full list of shareholder names.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> What additional information will companies claiming a PSC exemption have to provide?</h2>

<p>The following changes will be introduced by regulations. Companies claiming an exemption from providing PSC information will be required to state why they satisfy the conditions for an exemption and if listed they must say which market they are listed on and where information on their shareholders can be found.</p>

<p>Exempt companies must provide the information via the next confirmation statement due after coming into force.</p>

<p>This information will be publicly available on the register.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> What additional information will companies owned and controlled by a “Relevant Legal Entity” (RLE) have to provide?</h2>

<p>The following changes will be introduced by regulations. Companies notifying that a RLE is their PSC will be required to state the conditions satisfied to be recorded as a PSC, and if the RLE is a listed company they must say which market they are listed on. This will give assurance that the RLE meets the conditions as claimed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> What is the effect of non-compliance with any of these measures?</h2>

<p>Those that do not comply may face criminal or civil sanctions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> When will these measures come into effect?</h2>

<p>These measures will require consequential changes and new secondary regulations and guidance, as well as system development, following Royal Assent of the Bill.</p>

<p>From the date the relevant measures in the Bill come into force:</p>

<ul>
  <li>companies must provide a full list of shareholder names via the next confirmation statement which falls due</li>
  <li>companies incorporating will have to provide full names for subscribers or guarantors</li>
</ul>

<p>From the date the relevant measures in regulations come into force:</p>

<ul>
  <li>existing companies with a RLE must provide the information via the next confirmation statement due</li>
  <li>existing companies claiming an exemption must provide the information via the next confirmation statement due</li>
  <li>companies incorporating and stating their PSC is a RLE must provide the information as part of the incorporation application</li>
  <li>companies notifying Companies House that a RLE is a PSC must provide the information as part of the notice</li>
</ul>

<p>The information as set out above for shareholders, companies claiming an exemption and those with a RLE will be publicly available on the register.</p>
