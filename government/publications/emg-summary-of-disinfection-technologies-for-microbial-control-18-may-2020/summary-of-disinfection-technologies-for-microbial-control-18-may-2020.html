<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This paper summarises evidence for ultraviolet (<abbr title="Ultra violet">UV</abbr>) disinfection, visible light, local air filtration and fumigation technologies to be applied to control <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> transmission. Supporting evidence is presented in a companion paper ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emg-application-of-uv-disinfection-visible-light-local-air-filtration-and-fumigation-technologies-to-microbial-control-19-may-2020">Application of <abbr title="Ultra violet">UV</abbr> disinfection, visible light, local air filtration and fumigation technologies to microbial control</a>’.</p>

<h2>Key findings</h2>

<p>Key findings are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There is good evidence that germicidal <abbr title="Ultra violet">UV</abbr> (<abbr title="germicidal UV">GUV</abbr>) that uses <abbr title="UVC refers to ultraviolet light with shorter wavelengths used to disinfect air water and nonporous surfaces">UV-C</abbr> light and fumigation approaches (particularly Hydrogen Peroxide Vapour (<abbr title="Hydrogen Peroxide Vapour">HPV</abbr>)) are likely to be viable decontamination approaches against <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> for unoccupied rooms. Both are widely available as commercial systems and are already used in many hospitals for terminal disinfection. <abbr title="UVC refers to ultraviolet light with shorter wavelengths used to disinfect air water and nonporous surfaces">UV-C</abbr> is more challenging to apply well in a complex space with surfaces in shadow but ‘shadowing’ effects can also affect fumigation efficacy, with areas facing away from delivery equipment or positions on the underside of room surfaces the most challenging to reach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both <abbr title="UVC refers to ultraviolet light with shorter wavelengths used to disinfect air water and nonporous surfaces">UV-C</abbr> and fumigation decontamination require a sufficient duration of exposure to be effective. As such they are more likely to be effective as part of a terminal cleaning process rather than daily disinfection. This is particularly the case for fumigation which requires 30 to 90 minute cycle time, plus time for aeration to remove of any excess fumigants. <abbr title="Ultra violet">UV</abbr> carousel devices are typically deployed for between 20 and 45 minutes, depending on the room to be treated, but may also require moving and repeat treatment to overcome shadowing effects. Removal of fumigant by aeration is a particular concern for fumigation approaches that should be considered particularly in environments with a high level of soft furnishings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is good evidence that upper room <abbr title="germicidal UV">GUV</abbr> has good potential to be used effectively to reduce microbial load in the air in occupied rooms, although there is limited evidence for application against respiratory viruses in a real-world setting. The technology is only suitable in rooms with a high enough ceiling and is most effective in poorly ventilated spaces. It should not be seen as an alternative to ventilation but is likely to be beneficial where ventilation can’t be improved. An upper room <abbr title="germicidal UV">GUV</abbr> system needs to be sized correctly for the size of the room and the microorganism, and needs to consider the interaction with the ventilation flow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local air cleaning devices, including filter devices and <abbr title="UVC refers to ultraviolet light with shorter wavelengths used to disinfect air water and nonporous surfaces">UV-C</abbr> devices – which may be found in combination – are unlikely to have significant benefit unless the airflow rate through the device is sufficient. There may be some poorly ventilated spaces where these may be useful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far-<abbr title="Ultra violet">UV</abbr> technology is promising as a control but is far too early in development to be applied in real-world settings without significant further research. There is some evidence that visible light or blue or violet (<abbr title="High Intensity Narrow Spectrum light">HINS</abbr>) light may be effective in reducing bacterial contamination in buildings, but there is very weak evidence for the effect on viruses. Enhancing natural light in buildings (for example opening blinds) is a no cost precautionary measure where good light ingress already exists, but it is unlikely to have more than a marginal benefit. The benefits of <abbr title="High Intensity Narrow Spectrum light">HINS</abbr> light are worthy of further research as this has been developed to a level that it has been applied in hospitals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both <abbr title="UVC refers to ultraviolet light with shorter wavelengths used to disinfect air water and nonporous surfaces">UV-C</abbr> and fumigation decontamination approaches have significant safety considerations and should only be carried out by trained staff with appropriate risk assessments and controls in place. Upper room <abbr title="germicidal UV">GUV</abbr> has significant safety considerations which must be taken into consideration in the design, installation and
operation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not considered the cost-effectiveness of any of these approaches, This would need to be considered alongside enhancing conventional strategies such as improving ventilation and increasing standard cleaning approaches to determine whether there is additional benefit to be gained from applying disinfection technology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The approaches detailed in this paper should never be regarded as a substitute for good cleaning or good ventilation. They are technologies that could be used to supplement conventional methods but not to replace them. Importantly, chemical fumigation and <abbr title="Ultra violet">UV</abbr> based room treatments should be regarded as disinfection processes, not as sterilisation, regardless of supplier claims.</p>
  </li>
