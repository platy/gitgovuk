<p>Did you know?</p>

<p>In England, on average 26,500 fires are started on grass, heathland and moorland every year. This is an average of 73 fires every day!</p>

<p>50,000 fires occur in refuse and rubbish containers (including wheelie bins and skips) each year.</p>

<p>Fire safety doesn’t stop when you leave your home. This leaflet will help to keep you safe while enjoying the outdoors.</p>
</div>

<h2>Countryside safety</h2>

<p>Avoid open fires in the countryside. Only have them in safe, designated areas.</p>

<p>Put out cigarettes and other smoking materials properly before you leave your vehicle and when out enjoying the countryside.</p>

<p>Don’t leave bottles or glass in woodlands. Sunlight shining through glass can start a fire. Take them home or put them in a waste or recycling bin.</p>

<p>If you see a fire in the countryside, report it immediately.</p>

<p>Don’t attempt to tackle fires that can’t be put out with a bucket of water – leave the area as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Never throw cigarette ends out of car windows – they could start a fire and ruin surrounding countryside.</p>

<p>The Countryside Code contains further advice.</p>

<p>For more information <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england">visit Natural England</a>.</p>

<h2>Barbecue safety</h2>

<p>Keep a bucket of water, sand or a garden hose nearby for emergencies.</p>

<p>Follow the safety instructions provided with your gas, charcoal, or disposable barbecue.</p>

<p>Never use a barbecue indoors, in a tent, under an awning or in a caravan.</p>

<p>Use enough charcoal to cover the base of the barbecue, but not more (normally around 5cms or 2 inches).</p>

<p>Keep children, pets and garden games away from the cooking area.</p>

<p>After cooking, make sure the barbecue is cool before moving it.</p>

<p>Empty ashes onto bare garden soil, not into dustbins or wheelie bins. If they’re hot, they can melt the plastic and cause a fire.</p>

<p>Make sure your barbecue is well away from sheds, fences, trees, shrubs or garden waste.</p>

<p>In the countryside or public park areas, only use disposable barbecues where there are specially designated areas and carefully follow the safety guidance.</p>

<p>Enjoy yourself, but don’t drink too much alcohol if you are in charge of the barbecue.</p>

<p>Never use petrol or paraffin to start or revive your barbecue; use only recognised lighters or starter fuels on cold coals.</p>

<h3>Gas barbecues</h3>

<p>Never store gas cylinders under the stairs – if there is a fire they might explode and block your escape route.</p>

<p>Store gas cylinders outside, away from direct sunlight and frost.</p>

<p>Take care when turning bottled gas barbecues on and off.</p>

<p>Make sure the tap is turned off before changing the gas cylinder.</p>

<p>After cooking, turn the gas supply off first and then the barbecue control. This will stop any gas from leaking.</p>

<p>If you suspect a leak, turn off the gas cylinder and try brushing soapy water around all joints, watching for bubbles.</p>

<p>Make sure all joints are tightened, safe and secure.</p>

<p>Change gas cylinders outdoors or in a well ventilated area.</p>

<h2>Camping and caravanning safety</h2>

<p>Ensure caravans and tents are at least six metres apart and away from parked cars, to reduce the risk of fire spreading.</p>

<p>Keep a torch handy for emergencies – never use lighted candles.</p>

<p>Make sure you know the campsite’s fire safety arrangements and check where the nearest telephone is.</p>

<h3>Using gas cylinders</h3>

<p>Don’t use petrol or paraffin to light a solid fuel stove.</p>

<p>Keep flammable liquids (such as petrol and gas cylinders) outside and away from children.</p>

<p>Only change gas cylinders when they’re completely empty and store them away from caravans and vehicles.</p>

<p>Make sure the gas pipe connection is secure. If you suspect a leak, turn off the main cylinder valve.</p>

<p>Never smoke whilst changing your gas.</p>

<h3>What to do if there is a fire</h3>

<p>Keep calm and get everyone out as quickly as you can.</p>

<p>Call the fire and rescue service and give the exact location. Give a map reference if possible, or
give a landmark such as a farm or pub.</p>

<h3>Staying in a tent</h3>

<p>Never use candles in or near a tent – torches are safer.</p>

<p>Keep cooking appliances away from the tent walls as they could easily set alight.</p>

<p>Consider having a carbon monoxide alarm.</p>

<p>Never cook inside a tent.</p>

<p>Don’t cook near flammable materials or long grass, they can set alight easily.</p>

<p>Make sure you know how to escape by cutting your way out of the tent if there is a fire.</p>

<p>Make sure everyone knows how to put out clothing that’s on fire – stop, drop and roll.</p>

<p>Don’t smoke inside tents.</p>

<h3>Staying in a caravan</h3>

<p>Fit and test a smoke alarm in your caravan.</p>

<p>Consider fitting a carbon monoxide alarm.</p>

<p>Take special care when cooking – don’t leave pans unattended.</p>

<p>Turn off all appliances before you go out or to bed.</p>

<p>Don’t smoke inside the caravan. Smoke outdoors and put cigarettes right out – this is safer than smoking in the caravan.</p>

<p>Make sure ashtrays are made of a material that can’t burn – and never smoke in bed.</p>

<p>Don’t dry clothes over the stove.</p>

<p>Remove any litter and rubbish near the caravan to reduce the risk of fire spreading.</p>

<p>Make sure the caravan is ventilated, and never block air vents, to avoid a build up of poisonous gases.</p>

<p>Consider keeping a fire extinguisher by the entrance, but always read the instructions before using it.</p>
