<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This document sets out the rules of a scheme (the “Scheme Rules”) to be known as the Film and Television Production Restart Scheme (the “Scheme”).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Definitions and Interpretation</h2>

<p>These Scheme Rules are to be interpreted in accordance with paragraph 2 of Annex 1 (Definitions and interpretation) and capitalised terms used in these Scheme Rules have the meaning given to them in paragraph 1 of Annex 1 (Definitions and interpretation).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Description of the Scheme</h2>

<p>3.1 In response to the national lockdown measures introduced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, film and television production within the UK ceased to a significant extent, with many production businesses suffering significant losses as a result of delaying or abandoning existing and planned productions. Following the subsequent easing of these lockdown measures, many producers were unable to restart or, for new productions, commence production due to the lack of availability of insurance coverage for COVID-19 related risks, which prevented them from accessing funding from their finance provider(s).</p>

<p>3.2 The objective of the Scheme is therefore to support the film and television industry to restart production in the UK, by making direct compensation available to eligible film and television producers that incur losses during the course of producing eligible productions as a result of certain COVID-19 related risks, in respect of which they would otherwise be unable to self-insure or access insurance or indemnity in the commercial market on commercially viable terms. The Scheme will be available to new eligible productions (which have been unable to meaningfully commence production).</p>

<p>3.3 The Scheme is to be established by the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (“DCMS”) and DCMS will meet all payment commitments under the Scheme under section 8 of the Industrial Development Act 1982.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Scheme commencement</h2>

<p>The Scheme shall commence and open for the registration of Eligible Participants on 16 October 2020 (the “Launch Date”).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> State aid</h2>

<p>To the extent that DCMS has provided unlawful State aid (under the laws of the European Union or any other applicable law) to any Eligible Participant under or in connection with the Scheme, DCMS may (as required by applicable law) by notice in writing require that Eligible Participant to repay to DCMS such aid, together with interest calculated thereon in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Compensation available</h2>

<p>6.1 All compensation available under the Scheme is provided at the sole and absolute discretion of DCMS, whose decision in these matters shall be final and binding. These Scheme Rules shall not, under any circumstances, be construed as implying that any contract of insurance exists between any person and DCMS or that any compensation available under the Scheme is not discretionary.</p>

<p>6.2 Subject to Rules 16 (Excess), 17 (Production Limit) and 18 (Scheme Limit), DCMS may, in relation to each Request, determine whether or not to provide any compensation to an Eligible Participant under the Scheme and, in doing so, may have regard to the information provided under Rule 24 (Provision of information) and to such other factors as DCMS considers to be relevant to this determination.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Eligible Participant</h2>

<p>7.1 The Scheme will be available to any producer (or co-producer) of an Eligible Production that is either:</p>

<p>(A) an incorporated entity that is resident solely in the UK or an EEA State for tax purposes (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, a permanent establishment of such an entity that is located in a Non-EEA State and whose profits, or any part thereof, are subject to tax in that Non-EEA State); or</p>

<p>(B) a partnership, provided that all of the profits of the business carried on by the partnership are subject to tax in the UK or one or more EEA States,
(each, an “Eligible Participant”).</p>

<p>7.2 In order to make a Request under the Scheme, an Eligible Participant must have successfully completed the registration process described in Rule 19 (Registration) by the Registration Cut-Off Date in respect of the Eligible Production to which the Request relates. In the case of an Eligible Production that is produced by an Eligible Participant and one or more other persons (each, a “Co-producer”), only one application for registration to the Scheme may be made in respect of such Eligible Production by a single Eligible Participant and such Eligible Participant will be required to register the interests of all of the other Co-producers of that Eligible Production who are also Eligible Participants and wish to utilise the Scheme in respect of the Eligible Production.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Eligible Productions</h2>

<p>8.1	An Eligible Participant may apply to register and make a Request under the Scheme in respect of any Pre-Existing Production or New Production that:</p>

<p>(A)	is produced solely by that Eligible Participant or by that Eligible Participant and one or more Co-producers (whether or not such Co-producers are Eligible Participants);</p>

<p>(B)	will incur at least fifty per cent. (50%) of the Production Budget on UK Expenditure;</p>

<p>(C)	meets the Cultural Test in accordance with Rule 8.2 below;</p>

<p>(D)	meets the Commercial Viability Criteria; and</p>

<p>(E)	is not an Excluded Production,</p>

<p>(an “Eligible Production”).</p>

<p>8.2	Compliance with the Cultural Test will:</p>

<p>(A)	in circumstances where the Eligible Participant has made a successful application in respect of the Eligible Production for UK Corporation Tax High-end Television, Animation, Children’s Television or Film Tax Relief, be evidenced through the submission by the Eligible Participant as part of the registration process of a copy of the interim certificate issued by the BFI, certifying the Eligible Production as “British” for the purposes of the applicable cultural test for such tax relief; and</p>

<p>(B)	in all other circumstances, be self-assessed by the Eligible Participant in accordance with Annex 2 and the Eligible Participant will be required as part of the registration process to submit a declaration signed by a duly authorised representative of the Eligible Participant which confirms that the Eligible Production meets the Cultural Test. This declaration may be subject to verification by DCMS and shall constitute a representation made by the Eligible Participant, on which DCMS will place reliance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Commercial Viability Criteria</h2>
<p>9.1	Each Eligible Production must meet the following requirements (the “Commercial Viability Criteria”):</p>

<p>(A)	the Eligible Participant is not able to obtain insurance cover for COVID-19 Risks under any insurance policy entered into in respect of the production (if applicable) and, in any event, the Eligible Participant has sought to secure insurance cover for COVID-19 Risks in respect of the production either: (i) through one regulated insurance broker; or (ii) directly, through at least two regulated insurers, and in either case its request(s) for such insurance cover have been rejected or the only insurance cover that was offered was not on commercially viable terms;</p>

<p>(B)	the Eligible Participant is unable to obtain cover for COVID-19 Risks on commercially viable terms pursuant to a Group Insurance Policy, Self-Insurance Structure or any alternative compensation or insurance scheme or fund established in any territory outside of the UK for purposes similar to those of the Scheme;</p>

<p>(C)	the Eligible Participant has obtained insurance cover in respect of the production from a regulated insurer on arms’ length commercial terms for all risks that would customarily be insured against for such a production other than COVID-19 Risks or the terms of such insurance cover have been agreed with such an insurer in principle such that the Eligible Participant will be in a position to (and shall) put such cover in place immediately after confirming its registration for the Scheme;</p>

<p>(D)	the Eligible Participant has in place a Production Contract in respect of the production; and</p>

<p>(E)	either:</p>

<p>(i)	solely due to the Eligible Participant’s inability to obtain cover for COVID-19 Risks (as described in Rules 9.1(A) and 9.1(B)), the Eligible Participant has been unable to secure approval from the commissioning broadcaster to release any part of the agreed licence fee or the agreement of any other provider of finance to release, on customary terms, financing pertaining to its agreed share of the Production Budget and has, therefore, been unable to commence or restart Principal Photography (as applicable); or</p>

<p>(ii)	the Eligible Participant has been able to restart or commence Principal Photography (as applicable) after the Effective Date by securing approval from the commissioning broadcaster to release any part of the agreed licence fee or the agreement of any other provider of finance to release, on customary terms, financing pertaining to its agreed share of the Production Budget, in either case in reliance on anticipated eligibility for the Scheme.</p>

<p>9.2	A duly authorised representative of the Eligible Participant will be required to submit, on behalf of the Eligible Participant, a declaration confirming that the requirements of the Commercial Viability Criteria are met in respect of the relevant production as part of the registration process for the Scheme pursuant to Rule 19 (Registration). Such declaration shall constitute a representation made by the Eligible Participant, on which DCMS will place reliance.</p>

<p>9.3	The Commercial Viability Criteria will be self-assessed by the Eligible Participant in respect of any production with a Production Budget of less than £30 million and evidenced through the declaration signed by the duly authorised representative of the Eligible Participant. This self-assessment may be reviewed and subject to verification by DCMS to confirm that the Commercial Viability Criteria have been met, using information requested from and provided by the Eligible Participant (including, but not limited to, the Production Budget, information on any finance provider(s) and the description of the production).</p>

<p>9.4	With respect to any production with a Production Budget of £30 million or more, the assessment of the Commercial Viability Criteria will be carried out by DCMS and the Eligible Participant will be required to submit to DCMS additional documentary evidence demonstrating that each of the relevant requirements has been met, including, but not limited to:</p>

<p>(A)	relevant correspondence with the provider(s) of any existing insurance policy in respect of the production (if applicable) and with the regulated insurance broker or the two regulated insurers (as applicable) from whom cover for COVID-19 Risks was sought by the Eligible Participant in accordance with Rule 9.1(A));</p>

<p>(B)	documentary evidence demonstrating that the production is not, for the purposes of Rule 9.1(B), included in the scope of any Group Insurance Policy or Self-Insurance Structure and is not eligible to participate in any alternative compensation or insurance scheme or fund established in any territory outside of the UK for purposes similar to those of the Scheme;</p>

<p>(C)	formal notifications from the commissioning broadcaster and/or finance provider(s) (as applicable) evidencing that:</p>

<p>(i)	the production was not able to commence or restart (as applicable) as a result of the Eligible Participant’s inability to obtain cover for COVID-19 Risks (as described in Rules 9.1(A) and 9.1(B)); or</p>

<p>(ii)	the production was able to commence or restart (as applicable) after the Effective Date on the basis of anticipated eligibility for the Scheme; and</p>

<p>(D)	any other documentation requested by DCMS that might reasonably evidence that the Eligible Production meets the Commercial Viability Criteria (or any individual limb of such criteria).</p>

<p>9.5	With respect to any production with a Production Budget of £30 million or more and unless otherwise agreed with DCMS, it shall be assumed that the Commercial Viability Criteria are not met if such production continued to be filmed during the period beginning on 24 March 2020 and ending on the Effective Date.</p>

<p>9.6	Where a production is produced by two or more Co-producers, references to the “Production Budget” in Rules 9.3 to 9.5 above shall mean the value of the aggregate of the Financial Interests of each Co-producer who is an Eligible Participant and wishes to utilise the Scheme in respect of the production, as initially declared at the time of registration for the Scheme in accordance with Rule 19.9.</p>

<h2>Annex 4</h2>

<p><b>Specific Age Extension</b></p>

<p>A1. If an Eligible Participant wishes to be able to request compensation under the Scheme for Cast Losses in respect of an Eligible Production in circumstances where the relevant individual to whom such Cast Losses relate was over seventy (70) years of age at the time the relevant Cast Losses were incurred, the Eligible Participant must obtain express authorisation from DCMS in relation to the relevant individual (a “Specific Age Extension”) in accordance with this Annex 4.</p>

<p>A2. Each Specific Age Extension will only be valid in respect of a single named individual.</p>

<p>A3. Two (2) Specific Age Extensions will be granted by DCMS in respect of each Eligible Production, subject to the conditions at paragraph 4 below. Further Specific Age Extensions in respect of each Eligible Production beyond two (2) will be subject to the conditions at paragraph 4 below, will be reviewed by DCMS on a case-by-case basis and will be subject to an additional fee (“Further Additional Fee”).</p>

<p>A4. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Annex, the grant of a Specific Age Extension by DCMS shall be conditional on the Eligible Participant:</p>

<p>(A) submitting an application for such Specific Age Extension in such form as may be specified by DCMS from time to time;</p>

<p>(B) providing such additional documentation as DCMS may require; and</p>

<p>(C) paying to DCMS an amount in pounds sterling equal to 0.25 per cent. (0.25%) of:</p>

<p>(i) the Production Budget of the relevant Eligible Production; or</p>

<p>(ii) where the Eligible Production is or will be produced by two or more Co-producers, the aggregate value of the Financial Interests of each Co-producer who is an Eligible Participant and who wishes to utilise the Scheme,</p>

<p>(the “Additional Fee”).</p>

<p>(D) For each additional over-70 beyond two (2), paying to DCMS an amount in pounds sterling as equal to 0.275 per cent. (0.275%) of:</p>

<p>(i) the Production Budget of relevant Eligible Production: or</p>

<p>(ii) where the Eligible Production is or will be produced by two or more Co-producers, the aggregate value of the Financial Interests of each Co-producer who is an Eligible Participant and who wishes to utilise the Scheme,
(the “Further Additional Fee”).</p>

<p>A5. If an Eligible Participant makes a Request which relates (in whole or in part) to Cast Losses involving an individual in respect of whom a Specific Age Extension has been obtained, compensation shall only be provided where:</p>

<p>(A) the value of all Eligible Losses of the Eligible Participant in respect of which the Request is made in aggregate exceeds the value of the applicable Retention; and</p>

<p>(B) the value of all Cast Losses which relate to an individual in respect of whom a Specific Age Extension has been obtained and in respect of which the Request is made in aggregate exceeds the value of the Additional Retention,</p>

<p>and then only in the sum that all such Eligible Losses exceed the value of an amount equal to the aggregate of the applicable Retention and the Additional Retention.</p>

<p>A6. No compensation in respect of Cast Losses that relate to an individual in respect of whom a Specific Age Extension has been granted will be provided by DCMS to an Eligible Participant under the Scheme where such Cast Losses were incurred prior to the Eligible Participant having submitted an application for the relevant Specific Age Extension in accordance with paragraph 4(A) above, unless:</p>

<p>(A) such Cast Losses were incurred prior to 20 December 2020; and</p>

<p>(B) the Eligible Participant submitted to DCMS, in accordance with Rule 19.4, an application to register the relevant Eligible Production for the Scheme prior to 20 December 2020.</p>
