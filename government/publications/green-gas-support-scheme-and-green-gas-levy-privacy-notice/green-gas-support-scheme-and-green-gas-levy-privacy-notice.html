<p>This notice sets out how we will use your personal data for monitoring, evaluation, and research to support ‘public tasks’ related to the Green Gas Support Scheme (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>) and Green Gas Levy (<abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr>). It also sets out your rights.</p>

<p>It is made under Articles 13 and 14 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>).</p>

<h2>The data</h2>

<p>We will process the following data.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr></h3>

  <li>contact details of an authorised signatory including name, email address and telephone number</li>
  <li>name and address of the anaerobic digestion plant, and of the associated company</li>
  <li>administrative details, including <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> number, dates of submission and commission, and application status</li>
  <li>plant details, including capacity, capital cost, and expected biomethane generation</li>
  <li>payment details, including tariffs and the amount of biomethane supported under the scheme (this does not include details of the account into which you receive <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> tariff payments)</li>
</ul>

<h3><abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr></h3>

<ul>
  <li>contact details of an authorised signatory including name, email address and telephone number</li>
  <li>name and address of the supplier</li>
  <li>administrative details, including <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr> number and dates of payments</li>
  <li>supplier details, including number of meter points</li>
  <li>payment details, including total amount paid under the scheme (this does not include details of the account from which you make <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr> payments)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purposes for which we are processing your personal data are listed below.</p>

<p>1. <strong>Evaluation of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr></strong>. Your personal data will be processed for activities including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sampling – the activity of using your personal data to contact you, to invite you to consent to participate in research activities, including but not limited to surveys and interviews</li>
  <li>data analysis – the activity of carrying out statistical activities on your personal data, either in isolation or combined with other datasets</li>
  <li>tailoring - the activity of including your personal data on research apparatus to make it more specific to you, such as the inclusion of your name on the introductory message of a survey</li>
</ul>

<p>2. For <strong>monitoring of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr></strong>, your data will be processed for activities including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monitoring of payments made to participants (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>) or by participants (<abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the publication of official statistics</li>
</ul>

<p>3. For <strong>analysis, research and future policy development</strong>, your data will be processed for activities including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>research for the development of policies on clean heat and any related activities</li>
  <li>data analysis – the activity of carrying out statistical activities on your personal data, either in isolation or combined with other datasets</li>
  <li>conduct research and analysis to support related policies</li>
  <li>linking – your data may be linked to other datasets in which your data is stored for evaluation, monitoring, and analytical purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal basis of processing</h2>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is public task (Article 6(1)(e) UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>). Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, such as the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown, or a government department; the exercise of a function conferred on a person by an enactment; the exercise of a function of either House of Parliament; or the administration of justice.</p>

<p>In this instance, one of the tasks which <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> needs to complete is an evaluation of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr>. A proper evaluation of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr> is required to assess the value-for-money of public spending, the extent to which they have met their aims and whether it has resulted in the expected impacts. The Public Value Framework published by Her Majesty’s Treasury makes clear the necessity of evaluation to public policy (this is particularly clear on page 47).</p>

<p>In addition, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> needs to monitor the scheme and how it is functioning, from an operational, financial and a policy development perspective. This is done by producing Official Statistics, financial forecasts, and other analysis. The statistics provide transparent information on the scheme, e.g., the number of applicants. The financial forecasts enable control of spend of the scheme as well as payments to applicants. Financial auditing is also done by the National Audit Office. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> also carries out research to inform the development of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>, <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr>, and other policies.</p>

<h2>Recipients</h2>

<p>For evaluation purposes, your personal data will be shared by us with any contractor or sub-contractor with whom <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> deem necessary for undertaking evaluation activities as part of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr> evaluation. These contractors and sub-contractors will not have the right to share your data more widely without <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ permission. They will not use your data for purposes other than carrying out the evaluation of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr>.
For the purposes listed above, personal data may be shared by us with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Welsh Government</li>
  <li>the Scottish Government</li>
  <li>the Office for National Statistics</li>
  <li>other government departments and agencies as required for monitoring and research purposes, for example DEFRA (Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs)</li>
  <li>the National Audit Office</li>
  <li>any contractor or sub-contractor we deem necessary for undertaking research activities</li>
</ul>

<p>In accordance with <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Principle (C): Data Minimisation, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will limit the sharing of your personal data to what is necessary and relevant. We will limit the data sharing to those who require it to undertake their contractual obligations in completing work as part of the evaluation or monitoring of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Green Gas Levy">GGL</abbr>. We only share personal data when that is essential for the research activity. Where personal data is not essential for the monitoring, evaluation, or research we may instead share extracts of data.</p>

<p>As your personal data will be stored on our IT (information technology) infrastructure it will also be shared with our processors: Microsoft and Amazon Web Services.</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>

<p>Data will be retained to monitor payments until all payments on the schemes have been made, in November 2041.</p>

<h2>Where personal data has not been obtained from the data subject</h2>

<p>Your personal data is obtained by us from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). Ofgem are legally compelled to supply data to <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> under the Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021 when <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> requests it.</p>
