<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The UK government published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-education-strategy-global-potential-global-growth">International Education Strategy(<abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr>): global potential, global growth</a> in March 2019. Led by Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) and Department for International Trade (DIT), it sets a cohesive, cross-government approach supporting global activities of our education sector.</p>

<p>It also sets out 2 ambitions to achieve by 2030:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase education exports to £35 billion per year</li>
  <li>increase the numbers of international higher education (<abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>) students studying in the UK to 600,000 per year</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-education-strategy-2021-update"><abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> 2021 update: Supporting recovery, driving growth</a>, published in February 2021, re-committed the UK government to achieving the 2 ambitions. It made a commitment to work closely with the devolved administrations and the UK education sector to move from recovery to sustainable growth. This update also reported progress against the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr>.</p>

<p>A total of 15 actions from the 2019 strategy were closed and an additional 14 new actions were added. These aimed to support the renewal of export growth following disruption caused by the pandemic.</p>

<p>These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>setting out the priority countries and regions for the International Education Champion: India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Nigeria</li>
  <li>working with the UK higher education (<abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>) sector to enhance the international student experience from application to employment</li>
  <li>developing a new international teaching qualification, ‘International Qualified Teacher Status’ (<abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>increasing export opportunities for UK chartered professional bodies and UK special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) providers</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the 2021 update was published, the effects of the pandemic have continued to be felt across the world with disruption to international mobility. This affected the ability of our International Education Champion, Professor Sir Steve Smith, to travel to and work with priority countries on the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> ambitions.</p>

<p>The UK government continues to focus on supporting education export recovery and growth, to ensure that the UK remains open to international students.</p>

<p>This 2022 update summarises the steps UK government has taken, and outlines progress against the ambitions and each outstanding action (<a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-A">Annex A</a>) since February 2021. It includes updates on new initiatives to support export growth and increase the number of <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> students studying in the UK.</p>

<h2>Progress against the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> ambitions</h2>

<p>The latest available data shows positive progress against the 2 ambitions.</p>

<p>The 600,000 international students ambition was met for the first time in 2020 to 2021 with 605,130 international students studying in the UK.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 2019, on the £35 billion education exports ambition the total UK revenue from education-related exports and transnational education activity was estimated to be £25.2 billion. This is an increase of 8.1% since 2018 in current prices<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. From 2020 onwards, to meet the £35 billion ambition by 2030, an average annual increase in export revenue of around 3% per year is needed.</p>

<p>This progress is welcome. However, the UK government recognises the need to avoid complacency. The medium-term effect of the pandemic on both international student recruitment and education exports is not yet apparent.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there has not been uniform growth across the education sector during the pandemic, with some sub sectors disproportionately affected.</p>

<p>Global competition continues to increase as markets reopen during pandemic recovery, and countries place increased efforts on expanding education exports and student recruitment.</p>

<p>As a result, we must take steps to maintain the UK’s competitive advantage across the entire sector. We must ensure that the UK remains a partner and destination of choice for business and students all over the world.</p>

<p>Therefore, promoting and sustaining the growth of education exports and international student numbers remains a priority for UK government. So does ensuring that our education exports come from a diversified base.</p>

<p>We continue to work across government and closely with the devolved administrations and education sector to support education export growth and pandemic recovery. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/education-sector-advisory-group">Education Sector Advisory Group (<abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr>)</a>, co-chaired by the Minister for Skills and the Minister for Exports has membership from government and the education sector. <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> continues to meet regularly to discuss opportunities and challenges to export growth as well as implementation of the strategy.</p>

<p>The UK government remains proactive and adaptable in anticipating the challenges and opportunities ahead using data to inform our approach. We will review progress regularly against the strategy’s ambitions and actions, and especially when the next data sets become available in early 2023.</p>

<h2>Significant achievements in 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>The implementation of the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> remains an important focus for the UK government. We have made good progress on the actions in the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> and a summary is set out below. Details against each action are under <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-A">Annex A</a>.</p>

<h3>International Education Champion</h3>

<p>Sir Steve Smith has continued extensive engagement with the UK government, the devolved administrations, and the UK education sector. This has created greater cross-departmental working and strengthened a coordinated, UK-wide approach to promoting education exports overseas.</p>

<p>Working with the education sector and UK government, he ran government-to-government engagement with India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Nigeria. This helped to develop relations and identify export opportunities.</p>

<p>His successful missions to Saudi Arabia in July and October 2021 developed partnerships between UK and Saudi Universities, schools, and special educational needs service providers.</p>

<p>Sir Steve Smith then travelled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to support the education-focused week on the UK pavilion at Dubai Expo.</p>

<p>The priorities for 2022 are greater international engagement, including in-person missions with <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members to priority countries. So far in 2022, he has travelled to Saudi Arabia, India and Nigeria with a particular focus on establishing <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> partnerships.</p>

<h3>Graduate route</h3>

<p>The new graduate route was launched on 1 July 2021. It allows international students awarded their degrees to stay and work or look for work in the UK. This is at any skill level and for a period of 2 years, rising to 3 years if they successfully complete a PhD.</p>

<p>The new student route improves on the previous Tier 4 route, creating a more streamlined experience for international students. There are continued increases in international student numbers, including from South Asia, despite the impacts of the pandemic. This indicates that the introduction of the graduate route may have had a positive impact on international student recruitment.</p>

<h3>Education exports data</h3>

<p>DIT and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> ran an initial mapping of data availability across the sector and requirements to improve coverage. Both departments commissioned the London School of Economics (<abbr title="London School of Economics">LSE</abbr>) to conduct a research project. This is defining the scope of education exports and develop a methodology for improving data sources and collection.</p>

<p>Both departments, alongside the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>), will work closely with <abbr title="London School of Economics">LSE</abbr> to ensure the review informs government and sector priorities. We are looking at the possibility of comparing education exports to other sectors’ exports and the forthcoming <abbr title="London School of Economics">LSE</abbr> report will provide recommendations.</p>

<p>The UK government will work closely with the sector to take forward the findings and inform processes which better measure and classify education export data.</p>

<h3>International Qualified Teacher Status (<abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> launched a public consultation in February 2021 to test policy proposals for <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr>, a new international teaching qualification.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> responded to the consultation in August 2021 and announced that <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> would be launched with a year-long pilot.</p>

<p>The pilot will allow <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to test and learn to ensure that the framework is appropriate.</p>

<p>On 15 November 2021, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> published guidance for <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>criteria</li>
  <li>core content framework,</li>
  <li>teachers’ standards</li>
  <li>policy paper</li>
  <li>approvals process for providers</li>
</ul>

<p>The approvals process to select 6 accredited English <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> pilot providers closed in December 2021. The successful pilot providers were announced in February 2022.</p>

<p>The 6 <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> pilot providers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the University of Sunderland</li>
  <li>the University of Warwick</li>
  <li>Sheffield Hallam University</li>
  <li>the University of Birmingham Dubai</li>
  <li>Canterbury Christ Church University</li>
  <li>the University of Derby</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> pilot will run for one academic year starting in September 2022, with up to 180 trainees taking part.</p>

<p>As the UK’s International Education Champion, Sir Steve has been promoting <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> in his priority markets.</p>

<h3>Turing Scheme</h3>

<p>Under the Turing Scheme, providers successfully applied for funding to cover over 41,000 individual mobilities to over 150 destinations across the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<p>Almost half of these were for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The first mobilities started in September 2021. However, travel restrictions, as a result of coronavirus (COVID-19), are likely to have affected the number that will take place throughout the year.</p>

<p>We want as many students as possible to benefit from opportunities funded by the Turing Scheme, provided it is safe to do so. The Turing Scheme has given additional advice and flexibility in support.</p>

<p>Funding was confirmed for the next 3 years at the Spending Review 2021, including £110 million for the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<h3>Free trade agreements (FTAs)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and DIT worked with the sector to understand their export priorities for countries where we are negotiating FTAs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and DIT ran information sessions for a range of stakeholders to feed back on the FTA public consultations. These sessions encouraged sector organisations to give their views on the FTA process.</p>

<h3>Sustainability and climate change</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/education-secretary-puts-climate-change-at-the-heart-of-education--2">draft Sustainability and Climate Change Strategy</a> at COP26.</p>

<p>This sets out <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s vision for the UK education sector to be world leading by 2030 and to inspire action on the international stage. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has worked with stakeholders since November 2021. This is to develop and define how we will work with international partners to strengthen the role of education in tackling climate change.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainability-and-climate-change-strategy">final version of the strategy</a> was launched in April 2022. It sets out the UK’s international ambitions and plans. This includes an International Green Skills Conference to exhibit the best of UK green skills and opportunities at further and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> levels.</p>

<p>Sustainable education initiatives will play an important role in supporting the provision of UK education exports and the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> in the future.</p>

<h3>Improving the student journey</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://myriad.ucas.com/" rel="external">Myriad by UCAS</a>, the new dedicated platform for international postgraduate students, launched in February 2022 to provide tailored information, including scholarships and funding information and an English language test preparation and booking feature, to enhance and streamline the international student journey. For international undergraduate students, the new UCAS Hub went live at the start of the academic cycle. UCAS are running a number of events through the 2021/2022 application cycle for international students and stakeholders to promote the new systems and services.</p>

<p>UCAS published a comprehensive report in January 2022, ‘Where next? The experience of international students connecting to UK higher education’, which shares new insight on students’ perceptions of the UK and the impact of COVID on applications. It found that almost nine out of ten (88%) international students see the UK as a positive, or very positive, place to study. Further research into the mindset of those international students who apply to more than one destination country is due for release by UCAS in May 2022.</p>

<p>Universities UK International (UUKi) will run a forum of alternative finance providers, education sector and student representatives. This will raise awareness of the financial options available to international students and how products could be improved to meet demand.</p>

<p>The Office for Students (OfS) and the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) have reviewed existing practice on the international student experience.</p>

<p>On 16 March, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/publications/working-in-partnership-to-improve-international-student-integration-and-experience/" rel="external">OfS launched a call for evidence</a> which closed on 16 May. This is to find what works in ensuring international students can integrate and receive a fulfilling academic experience in the UK. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), UKCISA, UUKi and significant education employer groups will hold roundtables to discuss and support international student employability opportunities.</p>

<h3>Support for Ukraine</h3>

<p>The Department for Education has made over £4 million of additional funding available to universities to distribute to students from Ukraine. This will support students who are currently studying at English <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> providers and who need financial hardship assistance.</p>

<p>We are extending access to <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> student support, home fee status, tuition fee caps, advanced learner loans and FE19+ funding. This be focused on those who are granted leave under one of the three schemes for Ukrainians introduced recently by the Home Office.</p>

<h3>Warm Welcome Scholarship Scheme</h3>

<p>The UK government announced ‘Operation Warm Welcome’ on 1 September 2021 to support those who have been relocated to the UK via Operation Pitting. This will enable access the vital health, education, and support into employment to fully integrate into society.</p>

<p>The scheme will support those affected and who are eligible to access undergraduate and postgraduate university scholarships in the UK. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> is working in partnership with the British Council as the UK-wide delivery partner for the scheme. The scheme aims to meet the needs of different groups with links to Afghanistan in the UK. It will help them to rebuild their lives, find work, pursue education, and integrate with their local communities through scholarships providing access to <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Support is being extended to persons granted leave under the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) and the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS).</p>

<p>From 1 August 2022, these persons will qualify for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>student support and home fee status (in relation to new <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> education courses)</li>
  <li>advanced learner loans for further education (FE) courses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annex A: progress against the actions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2019 International </span> Education Strategy actions</h3>

<h4>Action 3 (2019): visa offer</h4>

<p>The UK government keeps the visa system under review to ensure it remains fit for purpose and that the UK’s visa system is world-class. Government will strengthen the UK’s visa offer for international <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> students by increasing the post-study leave period and making it easier for students to move into skilled work after graduation.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>

<p>The UK government has continued to operate COVID-19 concessions to support the education sector and international students where necessary. The graduate route went live on 1 July 2021. It provides eligible international students with an opportunity to work or look for work at any skill level. This is for post-study and for a period of 2 years, and 3 years for PhD graduates.</p>

<p>The student and child student routes, which were launched in October 2020 as simplified study routes, work as intended. They make the application process more straightforward and streamlined compared to the previous Tier 4 routes.</p>

<h4>Action 4 (2019): visa customer journey</h4>

<p>The UK government will keep the visa application process for international students under review, with the aim of improving the customer journey both for students and their sponsoring institutions. This will include reviewing processes for conducting interviews to ensure that these are appropriately focused and to minimise any inconvenience for applicants.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>

<p>In August 2021, the UK government published ‘The UK’s Points-Based Immigration System: Sponsorship Roadmap’. This roadmap sets out a significant package of reforms to the sponsorship system. This includes necessary changes to make a streamlined, simplified and modern student sponsorship system meeting the needs of the Home Office and its service users.</p>

<p>In December 2021, the UK government streamlined the customer visa journey even further through the rollout of eVisas that give digital status to main applicants and their adult dependants who are granted permission to stay in the UK on the Student route.</p>

<h4>Action 9 (2019): education exports data</h4>

<p>The UK government will provide a clearer picture of exports activity by improving the accuracy and coverage of education exports data.</p>

<p>The Department for Education, in partnership with the Department for International Trade, the sector and other key bodies such as the Office for National Statistics, will work in between each annual data publication to strengthen the methodology, identify a better range of sources, and look for ways to deliver more accurate, up-to-date reporting.</p>

<p>Throughout, government will continue to look for ways to develop our picture of the global education market and regional trends, where the data allows, to better inform government and sector priorities.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
DIT and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> ran initial mapping of data availability across the sector and requirements to improve coverage. The London School of Economics (<abbr title="London School of Economics">LSE</abbr>) was commissioned to conduct a research project. This was to define the scope of education exports and develop a methodology for improving data sources and collection. Both departments, alongside the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>, will work closely with <abbr title="London School of Economics">LSE</abbr> to ensure the review informs UK government and sector priorities.</p>

<p>Both DIT and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have developed relationships with the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>, devolved administrations and the education sector to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regularly review and discuss the utility of UK wide-education exports data</li>
  <li>improve the collection of accurate and coherent data</li>
  <li>identify and resolve data gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>In December 2021, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> published the UK revenue from education-related exports and transnational education activity 2019 publication. This publication had no major methodological changes. We are investigating how improvements identified in the workstreams above can support the development of the publication.</p>

<h4>Action 13 (2019): quality and safety of schools</h4>

<p>The Department for Education, working with the Department for International Trade, will coordinate efforts across government and key sector bodies to promote the quality and safety of our schools, both in the UK and overseas, by advocating the British Schools Overseas Inspection Scheme. We will encourage independent schools to have a better understanding of guardian arrangements, learning from those schools that do this well and the important role of accreditation bodies.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and DIT met with British Schools Overseas (BSO) inspectorates and associations on 2 December 2021. This was to support associations with the promotion of the BSO brand and identify solutions following COVID-19 delays with inspection and accreditation extensions.</p>

<p>The consultation on the national minimum standards for boarding and residential special schools closed on 23 February 2021. We are considering the analysis of the responses, including how to improve the requirements for guardian arrangements.</p>

<h4>Action 15 (2019): English Language Training (ELT) sector engagement</h4>

<p>The Department for International Trade will inform the UK ELT sector of global opportunities linked to other industries. We will ensure that ELT providers have the opportunity to take part in a broader range of Department for International Trade-led activity where ELT could play a more prominent role. From 2019, we will hold webinars and workshops in the UK to share sector best practice and identify large-scale international projects run by other UK exporters that require skills and training, which can be supported by language training.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
DIT manages an international events calendar. This makes it simpler for businesses to search for events in different sectors to engage and promote English for specific purposes (ESP) products and services. We have planned more promotion of this through ELT networks in quarter 1 2022.</p>

<p>A tenders and bids workshop was delivered to English UK members in February 2022.</p>

<p>Individual sessions have also been delivered to specific organisations on request.</p>

<p>Further cross-sector DIT, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> education and ELT teach-in sessions are planned for Q2.</p>

<h4>Action 16 (2019): promotion of ELT sector</h4>

<p>The Department for International Trade will utilise our exports pipeline database and exploit opportunities overseas to promote the English Language and the UK ELT sector, as valuable contributors to individual and national prosperity. From 2019, the Department for International Trade will host joint webinars with the British Council to raise awareness of the ELT offer for the benefit of the UK education sector.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
DIT and the British Council are using their networks to promote and support the #Englishwithconfidence campaign from English UK. This is through the GREAT brand and through social media promotion.</p>

<p>DIT and the British Council worked closely together in Taiwan in 2020 and 2021 on workshops and webinars. This raised awareness of the UK ELT offer and the range, innovations, and expertise of UK ELT organisations.</p>

<p>In 2021, DIT and British Council hosted joint webinars in Indonesia and Brazil similarly supporting and raising awareness of the UK ELT offer.</p>

<p>DIT have supported and promoted opportunities identified by the British Council, including digital innovation funding in Vietnam and Indonesia, to UK ELT networks. This ensures that the range of proposals and solutions offered reflects the variety in the UK ELT sector itself.</p>

<p>British Council funded 2 editions of the PRELIM project. This was in partnership with International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL) and English UK. This involved 60 grants of £10,000 to establish partnerships between English UK members and national English teacher associations around the world. This was largely but not exclusively in  Official Development Assistance (ODA) countries.</p>

<h4>Action 19 (2019): value of transnational education (TNE)</h4>

<p>The Department for Education and Department for International Trade will work with the <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> sector and the British Council to identify more accurately the overall value of TNE to the UK economy.</p>

<p>We will seek to provide insight into potential markets for both new and existing providers, and to improve the overall evidence base around best practice and impact.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
DIT and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s research project commissioned to the London School of Economics (see action 9) will include a review of TNE trade data. This research will evaluate and define the scope of TNE, assess current data collection methodologies, and offer improvements for the data collection and estimations. The findings from the research project will include a valuation of UK TNE using the recommended definition and methodology concluded from the research.</p>

<h4>Action 20 (2019): barriers to TNE growth</h4>

<p>The Department for International Trade will support the sector to grow TNE by engaging in dialogue with countries with recognised export potential. We will work to resolve regulatory barriers through international agreements and the work of the International Education Champion. We will work to ensure these agreements include the recognition of UK degrees, including online and blended learning programmes.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and DIT, supported the International Education Champion, continues to explore opportunities for the mutual recognition of qualifications and reducing market access barriers. Professor Sir Steve Smith will take part in <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> trade missions, vice-chancellor delegations and other high-profile events organised in 2022 across several priority markets. This includes a plan in the 2030 Roadmap for India-UK future relations to expand cooperation between our universities. It includes agreeing mutual recognition of academic qualifications.</p>

<p>The British Council has a key performance indicator (KPI) to increase the acceptance of UK qualifications globally. This involves work at system level to influence regulatory change, including in <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> priority countries. A progress report on this activity will be available in May 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2021 International </span> Education Strategy actions</h3>

<h4>Action 1 (2021): International Education Champion</h4>

<p>The International Education Champion’s immediate priority countries are: India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Nigeria. These priorities reflect where there is significant potential for growth and where the Champion could both open up opportunities and address barriers to that potential. Other important regional markets for the International Education Champion will include Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan, Europe, China and Hong Kong.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
Progress Professor Sir Steve Smith continues to work extensively across the UK government, the education sector and the devolved administrations. This is to help to identify and fulfil export opportunities in his immediate priority countries. He has also begun a comprehensive programme of engagement with other governments in his priority countries.</p>

<p>With the support of the British Council and the education sector, Sir Steve has developed relationships with India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. This has developed a better understanding of educational needs and boosted the promotion of UK education exports overseas.</p>

<p>Sir Steve became the Prime Minister’s Special Representative to Saudi Arabia on Education in October 2020. He then visited Saudi Arabia in July 2021 and October 2021 to meet with government and education sector representatives. The purpose was to develop partnerships with UK universities, schools and SEND service providers. In December 2021, he also attended Education Week at Dubai Expo, where he met with delegates from priority and other important markets.</p>

<p>In 2022, Sir Steve Smith will focus on international engagement and travel, subject to COVID-19 protocols. This includes leading in-person trade missions to the priority countries and developing ties with the other important regional partners. So far he has travelled to India, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria to promote further education (FE) partnerships.</p>

<h4>Action 2 (2021): free trade agreements</h4>

<p>The Department for International Trade and the Department for Education will promote education in future FTAs and ensure the sector’s views are represented.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
DIT and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have been working with the sector to understand export priorities for countries where we are negotiating FTAs. We ran information sessions for a range of stakeholders to feedback during the FTA public consultations, which has encouraged sector organisations to give their views during the FTA process.</p>

<h4>Action 3 (2021): streamlined application process for international students</h4>

<p>The Department for Education will work with the sector and the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service to ensure there is clearer, more accessible information for international students wishing to study in the UK. This will include information and advice tailored to students’ needs, including links to the immigration system.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://myriad.ucas.com/" rel="external">Myriad by UCAS</a>, launched in February 2022, provides a dedicated platform for international postgraduate students seeking admission to UK higher education. The new service brings together key considerations of the journey to UK higher education through a one-stop platform. It enables applicants to search for universities and college courses, find accommodation, be matched to scholarship and funding opportunities, look for part time jobs, as well as prepare for and book their English language tests. There is also a cohort of universities and colleges using Myriad’s advanced application services, further improving the applicant experience. The platform currently provides information for over 90% of eligible <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> institutions and details of more than 2,500 scholarships.</p>

<p>UCAS has recently updated <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> officials about progress made in developing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ucas.com/what-are-my-options/create-your-ucas-hub-today" rel="external">UCAS Hub</a> - the undergraduate student journey - including increased personalisation and information tailoring for international applicants.</p>

<h4>Action 4 (2021): financial options for international students</h4>

<p>Universities UK International will convene alternative finance providers, sector and student representatives together, in order to raise awareness of the financial options available to international students and how products could be improved to meet demand.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
UUKi are working with member institutions and doing desk research into alternative finance provision. They aim to hold a roundtable of stakeholders later this year.</p>

<h4>Action 5 (2021): academic experience of international students</h4>

<p>The Office for Students (OfS) together with the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA), will launch a new project that will aim to find ‘what works’ in ensuring international students can integrate and receive a fulfilling academic experience in the UK. It will explore the positive impact international students have on home students, and what longer term lessons can be learnt from their response to the coronavirus pandemic on provider-level delivery and student engagement.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
UKCISA and OfS have completed an evidence review and summary report to establish the themes for a call to evidence to go out to providers.</p>

<p>The OfS launched their call for evidence ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/publications/working-in-partnership-to-improve-international-student-integration-and-experience/" rel="external">Working in partnership to improve international student integration and experience</a>’ on 16 March 2022. This closed on 16 May 2022. It sought to identify effective practice in supporting international students’ integration into UK <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The findings from this work are important, as they will make sure the UK remains an attractive destination for international students where they have an enjoyable and valuable experience.</p>

<h4>Action 6 (2021): employability of international students</h4>

<p>The UK Council for International Student Affairs will collaborate with the Confederation of British Industry, Universities UK International, and key education and employer groups to support international student employability. This group will build understanding of the UK’s skills needs, international labour markets, and barriers to international graduate employability and share examples of best practice across the sector.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
UKCISA ran 2 roundtables in 2021 with sector bodies and stakeholders on student employability and the graduate route.</p>

<p>The new graduate route launched on 1 July 2021. It allows international students awarded their degrees to stay and work or look for work in the UK. This is at any skill level and for a period of 2 years, rising to 3 years if they successfully complete a PhD.</p>

<p>This supports the UKCISA in their work to support graduate employability.</p>

<h4>Action 7 (2021): system-to-system engagement</h4>

<p>The Department for International Trade will lead system-to-system engagement to develop trading partners with whom the UK education sector can engage over the long term. We will work with development banks and donor organisations to develop the sector’s contact with these organisations, to ensure it is engaged in opportunities for business.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
DIT has worked closely with development banks, including the Asian Development Bank, and donor organisations (and helped to promote ODA funded opportunities to UK providers).</p>

<h4>Action 8 (2021): International Qualified Teacher Status (IQTS)</h4>

<p>The Department for Education will work with teacher training providers to establish a new international teaching qualification, ‘International Qualified Teacher Status’, that will provide an opportunity for teachers around the world to train to world-respected domestic standards. As well as providing more opportunities for teacher training providers, this will support the spread of high-quality teaching, and provide further opportunities for the UK to build lasting and positive relationships around the world.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> launched a public consultation in February 2021 to test policy proposals for a new international teaching qualification called <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> responded to the consultation in August 2021 and announced the launch of <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr>, informing the sector that we will be taking a pilot approach. This will allow us to test and learn during the first year and make sure that the framework created is appropriate.</p>

<p>On November 15 2021, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> published further guidance for <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> including Criteria, Core Content Framework, Teachers’ Standards, policy paper and the approvals process for providers.</p>

<p>The approvals process to select 6 <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> pilot providers closed in December 2021 and chosen pilot providers were announced in February 2022.</p>

<p>The 6 <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> pilot providers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the University of Sunderland</li>
  <li>the University of Warwick</li>
  <li>Sheffield Hallam University</li>
  <li>the University of Birmingham Dubai</li>
  <li>Canterbury Christ Church University</li>
  <li>the University of Derby</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> pilot will run for one academic year starting in September 2022, with up to 180 trainees taking part.</p>

<p>As International Education Champion, Sir Steve has been promoting <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> in his priority markets.</p>

<h4>Action 9 (2021): market barriers</h4>

<p>The Department for Education, the Department for International Trade and the International Education Champion will work with the British Council and the sector to address market barriers to the growth of UK education exports. This will help facilitate the expansion of TNE, including online and blended learning models.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and DIT continue to track market barriers which affect education exports. The International Education Champion focuses on barriers in priority markets, working with overseas representatives on solutions to issues such as the recognition of qualifications.</p>

<p>The British Council launched its Going Global Partnerships programme in 2021. The programme supports universities, colleges, and sector organisations to start projects developing new teaching and research partnerships. The programme also helps to reduce barriers and create an environment for UK tertiary education providers to provide UK education and qualifications internationally.</p>

<p><strong>Case Study: UK - Hong Kong mutual recognition of architecture education</strong></p>

<p>In October 2021, the DIT Hong Kong Education Team agreed to explore developing a Memorandum of Understanding for the mutual recognition of architecture education. This followed the Hong Kong Institute of Architect’s (HKIA) decision not to recognise the UK’s architectural education qualifications after September 2022. Since July 2022, DIT Hong Kong has established dialogue with HKIA and the Hong Kong / UK Architect Registration Board (HKARB / UKARB).</p>

<p>With support from the former Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, DIT Hong Kong were able to demonstrate the importance of preserving mutual recognition. A successful memorandum of understanding (MoU) would create a multi-million-pound opportunity for the UK from tuition fees, accommodation and cost of living.</p>

<h4>Action 10 (2021): alumni activity</h4>

<p>Following a recommendation in the 2019 Tailored Review of the British Council to take a more structured approach to its alumni activity, the British Council is exploring options for attracting and supporting a global UK alumni network.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
Progress on the development of a centralised alumni platform continues. A digital platform to enable sign-on and facilitate networking was commissioned and is expected to be ready in quarter 3, 2022. Promotional assets under the banner ‘Alumni UK’ were produced.</p>

<p>Soft-launch activities have begun, with online activities to encourage early registrations. Over 6,000 alumni have registered their interest to date.</p>

<p>Further activities in priority countries and wider promotions are being planned for 2022 to 2023, aligning with Study UK alumni activity where relevant. The annual Study UK Alumni Awards will run again. Last year they attracted over 1,500 applicants, with ceremonies in 23 countries.</p>

<h4>Action 11 (2021): UK Export Finance offer to the education sector</h4>

<p>UK Export Finance (UKEF) will tailor its marketing and communications activity for the whole of the education sector, to boost awareness and understanding of the sector’s access to UKEF products. The Department for International Trade will also work to promote and ensure an understanding of the UKEF offer across the education sector.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
UKEF are tailoring marketing and comms activities for the whole of the education sector.</p>

<p>DIT will work to promote and ensure an understanding of the UKEF offer across the education sector.</p>

<p>DIT has worked closely with UKEF to promote the UKEF offer, including the General Export Facility, to the education sector. This has included UKEF speaking directly to the <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> and webinars for the education sector/skills sector.</p>

<h4>Action 12 (2021): opportunities for UK chartered professional bodies</h4>

<p>The Department for International Trade will scope opportunities for partnership and export for UK chartered professional bodies. DIT will connect overseas demand for chartered status to UK organisations. We will ensure we effectively communicate these opportunities to the sector, and we will run trade missions specifically for chartered professional bodies.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
DIT continues to engage with chartered and professional bodies. This is to identify and execute international trade opportunities across key markets and how they can support foreign direct investment.</p>

<p>DIT met with the chartered professional bodies in September and December 2021. They discussed opportunities to increase promotion overseas. In March 2022, DIT led a professional bodies hybrid trade mission to India, which provided important market access insights, support and networking opportunities.</p>

<p>DIT is working in with the UAE National Qualifications Council to seek recognition of chartered status. DIT will continue to work with chartered professional bodies in 2022 to identify future trade mission, promotion and networking opportunities.</p>

<p>DIT is working with the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) to include chartered bodies in the UK Skills Partnership (UKSP). UKSP and CMI [chartered bodies lead] have met to discuss this.</p>

<h4>Action 13 (2021): exporting UK SEND services</h4>

<p>The Department for International Trade will identify high value export opportunities for UK SEND providers. DIT will work with the National Association for Special Educational Needs (NASEN), the UK SEND sector and other government departments to develop an effective and collaborative approach to this work.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review early 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
A working group was established with representatives from DIT, NASEN, British Council and BESA. The group meets every 2 months.</p>

<p>We created a database of UK SEND companies wishing to export services and products.</p>

<p>A survey was set up on SEND requirements and opportunities in priority countries. It identified significant opportunities for partnerships in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>We are working on developing marketing materials and a market approach.</p>

<h4>Action 14 (2021): developing investment opportunities in the UK education sector</h4>

<p>The Department for International Trade will develop its investment offer and identify opportunities for the education sector, beyond EdTech.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong>: ongoing - review mid 2023</p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong>
The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.great.gov.uk/international/content/investment/sectors/edtech/" rel="external">UK EdTech Proposition is now promoted on the newly launched Investment Atlas on the great.gov.uk website</a>.
