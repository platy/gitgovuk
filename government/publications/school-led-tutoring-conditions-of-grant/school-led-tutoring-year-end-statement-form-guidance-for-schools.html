<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As part of the Department for Education’s (DfE’s) education recovery plan, the Secretary of State for Education has provided financial assistance to eligible local authorities for their maintained schools and academy trusts. This was in accordance with section 14 of the Education Act 2002 and took the form of the school-led tutoring grant for the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<p>This grant gave schools and academy trusts the flexibility to determine how best to provide tutoring intervention to support catch-up for lost education due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<h3>About the year-end statement</h3>
<p>The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) has released the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital-forms.education.gov.uk/mQGSRslJ90/start" rel="external">school-led tutoring year-end statement form</a>, and all schools, academies and independent special schools that have received funding will be expected to complete and return the statement detailing how much tuition has been delivered.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This is a mandatory return.</p>
</div>

<p>Where the funding has not been used fully (or at all) by schools and academies, ESFA will treat this as an overpayment. ESFA will offset this against future payments.</p>

<p>Where the local authority has passed funding on to an independent special school and the school has not utilised it fully or at all, ESFA will recover this from the independent special school and not the local authority.</p>

<p>The funding will be recovered via an invoice from ESFA to the independent special school. We will use the information provided in the year-end statement to calculate this.</p>

<p>Refer to the ‘Calculating overpayments’ section in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1069886/Updated_School-Led_Tutoring_Guidance_.pdf" rel="external">school-led tutoring guidance</a> for further information, including detailed examples which set out how overpayment will be calculated in different scenarios.</p>

<h2>When to&nbsp;complete your submission</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The deadline to complete this form is 6:00pm on Friday, 16 September 2022.</p>
</div>

<h2>Accessing the&nbsp;form</h2>
<p>This form is for schools, academies and independent special schools only.</p>

<p>Access the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital-forms.education.gov.uk/mQGSRslJ90/start" rel="external">school-led tutoring: year-end statement form</a> to submit your year-end statement to ESFA.</p>

<h3>Before you start</h3>
<p>Make sure you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the instructions on this page and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1085417/Year_end_statement_guidance_for_schools_and_academies.pdf" rel="external">year-end statement guidance for schools, academies and independent special schools</a>
</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE Sign-in account</a>
</li>
  <li>pupil hours and funding spent information</li>
</ul>

<h3> Accessing the form</h3>

<h4>Sign in to your&nbsp;DfE Sign-in&nbsp;account:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Access the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital-forms.education.gov.uk/mQGSRslJ90/start" rel="external">school-led tutoring: year-end statement form</a>.</li>
  <li>Sign&nbsp;in to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a> using your account information (username and password).</li>
  <li>Choose the organisation for which you are completing the form.</li>
  <li>The next page will display the details we hold about the organisation you selected when you logged in. This will show the name, address, and unique reference number (URN) or&nbsp;UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN)&nbsp;of the organisation, as well as the name and email address of the person who signed in&nbsp;via&nbsp;DfE Sign-in.</li>
  <li>If these details are correct,&nbsp;select&nbsp;‘continue’&nbsp;to move to the next page.</li>
  <li>If you believe they are incorrect or you are experiencing issues accessing the form, contact us via the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb" rel="external">ESFA help centre</a> and&nbsp;we will&nbsp;investigate.</li>
  <li>Complete the form as instructed in the following sections.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your account must be connected to the organisation&nbsp;you are&nbsp;making the statement for.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You do not need to add any services in DfE Sign-in. It is used for authentication only, and the form will not appear in your list of services.</p>
</div>

<p>If your DfE Sign-in account is associated with more than one organisation, you must select the individual setting from the list presented on the ‘Select your organisation’ page, which will then provide you with access to the digital form.</p>

<p>If the individual organisation is not displayed, you would need to find out who within your organisation has approver permissions for DfE Sign-in and they can add or remove a user.</p>

<p>If you cannot find who has approver access, your chief executive officer (CEO)/chief financial officer (CFO) or business manager can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact-us" rel="external">contact us</a> to raise an incident.</p>

<h4>If you&nbsp;do not have a DfE Sign-in account</h4>
<p>You will need to create one:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Access&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a>.</li>
  <li>Select the&nbsp;‘create&nbsp;account’&nbsp;button.</li>
  <li>Enter your name and email address (it is recommended to use your work email address or one that is clearly associated with your organisation).</li>
  <li>We will send you an email to verify your email address. Copy the code from this email and paste it into the box on the verification page.</li>
  <li>Create a memorable password of 8 characters, which must include 2 upper case characters, 2 lower case characters and 2 numbers.</li>
  <li>Sign in using your new credentials, select ‘organisations’ and then ‘request an organisation’, enter the URN or name of your establishment.&nbsp;The request will be sent to the DfE Sign-in approver for the establishment, to approve your request.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might have noticed the term ‘approver’ when creating your account. An approver is someone at your organisation responsible for controlling who has access to DfE Sign-in and the services within the system. It is usually a senior person, such as an administrator or a manager.</p>

<p>Once your request to access an organisation has been approved, you can follow the steps outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sign-in-to-your-DfE-sign-in-account">sign in to your DfE Sign-in account</a> to&nbsp;complete the form.</p>

<p>For security reasons, you will need the approval of one of your organisation’s approvers before you can access the form.</p>
