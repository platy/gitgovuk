<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As part of the Department for Education’s (DfE)’s education recovery plan, the Secretary of State for Education has provided financial assistance to eligible local authorities, for their maintained schools, and academy trusts. This was in accordance with section 14 of the Education Act 2002, in the form of the school-led tutoring grant for the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<p>This grant gave schools and academy trusts the flexibility to determine how best to provide tutoring intervention, to support catch-up for lost education due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>These instructions&nbsp;provide guidance so local authorities can use this service to report where they have passed school-led tutoring grant funding on to independent special schools.</p>

<h3>About the fund</h3>
<p>This grant funding is only for expenditure on school-led tutoring, and cannot be combined with other premiums.</p>

<p>It should entail staff costs of delivering tuition only and cannot be used to cover costs such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>diagnostic tools</li>
  <li>room hire</li>
  <li>equipment</li>
  <li>laptops</li>
  <li>transport</li>
  <li>stationery</li>
  <li>record keeping</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more about how to use the grant in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-grant">school-led tutoring guidance</a>.</p>

<p>This funding cannot be used for the non-subsidised element of the National Tutoring Programme (NTP) including costs related to support provided by NTP tuition partners and academic mentors.</p>

<h2>When to&nbsp;complete your submission</h2>
<p>The deadline to complete this form is 5:00pm on Friday, 9 September 2022.</p>

<h2>Accessing the&nbsp;form</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This form is for local authorities only.</p>
</div>

<p>Access the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital-forms.education.gov.uk/6Ge4UmrLon/report-your-transfer" rel="external">school-led tutoring: report transfer of grant funding form</a> to confirm transfer of grant funding to independent special schools.</p>

<h3>Before you start</h3>
<p>Make sure you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read this guidance document</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk" rel="external">a DfE Sign-in account</a></li>
  <li>the names of each independent special school, including their unique identifier (UID) that you have passed school-led tutoring funding to, and the funding amounts transferred</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing the form</h3>

<h4>Sign in to your&nbsp;DfE Sign-in&nbsp;account:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Access the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital-forms.education.gov.uk/6Ge4UmrLon/report-your-transfer" rel="external">School-led tutoring: report transfer of grant funding form</a>.</li>
  <li>Sign&nbsp;in to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a> using your account information (username and password).</li>
  <li>Choose the organisation for which you are completing the form.</li>
  <li>The next page will display the details we hold about the organisation you selected when you signed in. This will show the name, address, and unique reference number (URN) or&nbsp;UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN)&nbsp;of the organisation, as well as the name and email address of the person who signed in&nbsp;via&nbsp;DfE Sign-in.</li>
  <li>If these details are correct,&nbsp;select&nbsp;‘continue’&nbsp;to move to the next page.</li>
  <li>If you believe the details are incorrect, or you are experiencing issues accessing the form, contact us via the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb" rel="external">ESFA help centre</a> and&nbsp;we will investigate.</li>
  <li>Complete the form as instructed in the following sections.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your account must be connected to the organisation&nbsp;you are&nbsp;claiming funding for.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You do not need to add any services in DfE Sign-in. It is used for authentication only, and the form will not appear in your list of services.</p>
</div>

<p>If your DfE Sign-in account is associated with more than one organisation, you must select the individual setting from the list presented on the ‘Select your organisation’ page, which will then allow access to the form.</p>

<p>If the individual organisation is not displayed, you would need to find out who within your organisation has approver permissions for DfE Sign-in and they can add or remove a user.</p>

<p>If you cannot find who has approver access, your chief executive officer (CEO)/chief financial officer (CFO) or business manager can raise an incident via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact-us" rel="external">DfE Sign-in Service Desk</a>.</p>

<h4>If you&nbsp;do not have a DfE Sign-in account</h4>
<p>You will need to create one:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Access&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a>.</li>
  <li>Select the&nbsp;‘create&nbsp;account’&nbsp;button.</li>
  <li>Enter your name and email address (it is recommended that you use your work email address, or one that is clearly associated with your organisation).</li>
  <li>We will send you an email to verify your email address. Copy the code from this email and paste it into the box on the verification page.</li>
  <li>Create a memorable password of 8 characters, which must include 2 upper case characters, 2 lower case characters and 2 numbers.</li>
  <li>Sign in using your new credentials, select ‘organisations’ and then ‘request an organisation’, enter the URN or name of your establishment.&nbsp;The request will be sent to the DfE Sign-in approver for the establishment, to approve your request.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might have noticed the term ‘approver’ when creating your account. An approver is someone at your organisation responsible for controlling who has access to DfE Sign-in and the services within the system. It’s usually a senior person, such as an administrator or a manager.</p>

<p>Once your request to access an organisation has been approved, you can follow the steps outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sign-in-to-your-DfE-Sign-in-account">sign into your DfE Sign-in account</a> to&nbsp;complete the form.</p>

<p>For security reasons, you will need the approval of one of your organisation’s approvers before you can access the form.</p>
