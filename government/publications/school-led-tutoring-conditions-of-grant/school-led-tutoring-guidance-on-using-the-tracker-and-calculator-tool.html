<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>School-led tutoring has been introduced as part of the National Tutoring programme this academic year, 2021 to 2022, and will continue into academic years 2022 to 2023 and 2023 to 2024. More information about how to use the grant is available on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-grant">school-led tutoring grant pages</a>.</p>

<p>Eligible schools will receive a grant via their regular scheduled ESFA payments. This can be used to source tutoring provision for disadvantaged and vulnerable pupils who have missed the most education due to coronavirus (COVID-19) disruption. You can find information about school level allocations on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant">School-led tutoring: conditions of grant and allocations page</a>.</p>

<p>The school-led tutoring grant is restricted to expenditure on school-led tutoring only and must be spent in 2021 to 2022 academic year. We will recover any overpayments at the end of the academic year.</p>

<p>So that we can accurately recover any unspent funding and understand how schools are supporting their pupils, there are two key, compulsory data collections that schools must complete during the academic year:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the school census – this must be completed once a term, further information about completing this can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/complete-the-school-census">Complete the school census</a>
</li>
  <li>a school-led tutoring year-end statement by the end of July 2022. Further information about this data collection and how the voluntary tracker and calculator tool can support it is below</li>
</ol>

<h3>About this tool</h3>
<p>This tracker and calculator tool has been designed to help schools track information during the academic year, so they have the relevant information to hand when they need to complete and return their school-led tutoring year-end statement to EFSA. This must be returned by the end of July 2022.</p>

<p>We would like to make clear the difference between the tracker tool and the year-end statement.</p>

<h3>Tracker and calculator tool</h3>
<p>The tracker and calculator tool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is a voluntary tracker and calculator tool that can be used by schools if they choose to</li>
  <li>is being provided to help schools to keep track of information throughout the academic year, so they have the information needed to complete the year-end statement</li>
  <li>can be downloaded and used offline by schools. If schools already have their own methods of collating information about school-led tutoring, there is no need to use, or switch to, this tracker</li>
  <li>does not need to be returned to DfE at any point. It is for the school’s own internal use, if it is helpful to them</li>
</ul>

<h3>School-led tutoring year-end statement</h3>
<p>The school-led tutoring year-end statement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is a compulsory data collection that all schools must complete (even if they choose not to use the school-led tutoring grant)</li>
  <li>will be made available as an online form; schools will need to complete and return their data to ESFA at the end of the academic year 2021 to 2022. The online form is not available yet; it will become live around June 2022 and we will inform all schools when it is live</li>
  <li>will be used to calculate any underspend and recover funding from schools if necessary.</li>
  <li>final questions will be available in summer 2022. However, in order to help prepare schools, we have provided some information below about the data that will be requested</li>
</ul>

<h3>Function of this tracker tool</h3>
<p>The tracker tool will capture information for all mainstream schools and pupils who attend either a special school, alternative provision, or a special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) unit.</p>

<p>The offline tracker and calculator tool will provide schools with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the breakdown of the school-led tutoring grant amount showing the DfE contribution, and the contribution expected from schools for 1) mainstream pupils and 2) pupils who attend a special school, alternative provision, or a SEND unit, who receive a higher rate of funding</li>
  <li>a monthly tracker where the number of pupils, funded hours and total spend can be recorded</li>
  <li>a cumulative totals table, which will calculate the cumulative figures for the number of pupils, funded hours and spend. These figures can be used to complete the online school-led tutoring year-end statement in summer 2022</li>
  <li>a reconciliation calculation, which will provide an indication of any underspend that will be recovered by ESFA at the end of this academic year</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use the tool</h2>
<p>The offline tracker and calculator tool has been designed for schools to download, for use on a monthly basis, to keep track of their school-led tutoring funded hours, the total pupil numbers in receipt of school-led tuition and expenditure.</p>

<p>The blue shaded boxes on the tracker tool sheet (cells B5 to B7 and B13 to F23) are for schools and academy trusts to insert this information.</p>

<h3>Section 1</h3>
<p>This section contains a link back to this guidance for the calculator tool help.</p>

<h3>Section 2: allocation information</h3>
<p>Schools can populate this section with information taken from their published school-led tutoring allocation. This will enable a projection of any potential underspend, which will be recovered by DfE at the end of the academic year, in section 6.</p>

<p>School-level allocations for 2021 to 22 can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1022225/School_led_tutoring_allocations_.xlsx" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Section 3: school contribution</h3>
<p>This section sets outs the total academic year allocation alongside calculations to show both the DfE contribution (75%) and the expected school contribution (25%) to the school-led tutoring hours.</p>

<p>The funding is allocated to schools based on the number of pupils eligible for pupil premium funding. The total expected cost of tutoring is calculated at unit cost of up to £18 per pupil, per hour, for mainstream pupils and unit cost of up to £47 per pupil, per hour, for pupils attending either a special school, alternative provision, or a SEND unit. If schools spend above this unit cost, they will need to contribute more.</p>

<p>(Please note, pupils with SEND who attend a mainstream school are only eligible for the standard rate of funding.)</p>

<h3>Section 4: keeping track of data for the academic year</h3>
<p>The table can be populated monthly to maintain a record of key school-led tutoring data. This will help schools complete the online year-end statement, which must be submitted to ESFA by the end of July 2022.</p>

<p>There is only one column to record the cumulative total of all pupils in receipt of school-led tuition. However, it is important to note that pupils should only be counted once across the year, even if they receive more than one 15-hour package of tuition. This will help DfE to understand how many pupils have benefited.</p>

<p>Tutoring hours includes hours of funded tuition and this figure can include already funded hours which were planned but not delivered for reasons outside of a school’s control, for example due to pupil illness.</p>

<h3>Section 5: summary totals</h3>
<p>The table is calculated to show a cumulative summary of the data input into section 4. The summary totals can be used to populate the online school-led tutoring year-end statement form which will become available in summer 2022.</p>

<h3>Section 6: projected end of year reconciliation</h3>
<p>The table shows what the end of year reconciliation will look like. This will indicate any potential underspend of funding, which will be recovered by DfE at the end of the academic year. This is solely based on the input of number of pupils, number of hours funded and total spend entered into the calculator tool, and is for information only.</p>

<p>The reconciliation exercise will be carried out at the end of the academic year when schools have completed and returned their year-end statement. Schools have until the end of July 2022 to complete their year-end statement; any funding that needs to be recovered as a result of reconciliation or non-completion of the form will take place following that.</p>

<p>ESFA will retain the amount shown from general annual grant (GAG) and dedicated schools grant (DSG) payments in September or October 2022.</p>

<p>The full allocated amount will be recovered where no tutoring hours have been provided.</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>
<p>We recommend that schools maintain records throughout the year to help keep track of the key data they are required to submit via the year-end statement.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In summer 2022, ESFA will release the school-led tutoring year-end statement form – all schools in receipt of the school-led tutoring grant will be required to complete and return it. This is a mandatory return.</p>
</div>

<p>While the final form is not currently available, to help schools prepare, we will ask for data covering the areas set out below:</p>

<p>1) What is the total amount your school has spent on school-led tutoring in the academic year 2021 to 2022?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mainstream pupils</li>
  <li>Pupils in special schools, alternative provision, or a SEND unit</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This figure should represent the full cost of tuition, including DfE’s subsidy element and your school’s contribution. 
A small number of schools will receive a higher rate for pupils who attend either a special school, alternative provision, or a SEND unit. Given this, we require schools to submit separate figures for both mainstream pupils and these pupils attending the institutions described above for the total cost and the number of funded hours. This will enable ESFA to calculate the average hourly cost at the two different rates.</p>
</div>

<p>2) Please state the total number of pupils in your school who have received tuition through the school-led tutoring grant in academic year 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>3) Please state the total number of hours of funded tuition in your school through the school-led tutoring grant funding in academic year 2021 to 2022.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mainstream pupils</li>
  <li>Pupils in special schools, alternative provision, or a SEND unit</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A small number of schools will receive a higher rate for pupils who attend either a special school, alternative provision, or a SEND unit. Given this, we require schools to submit separate figures for both mainstream pupils and these pupils attending the institutions described above for the total cost and the number of funded hours. This will enable the ESFA to calculate the average hourly cost at the 2 different rates.</p>
</div>

<p>4) Confirmation that the information outlined above is correct and you have met the conditions of the grant (tick-box).</p>
