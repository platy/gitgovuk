<span class="number">3. </span> Why and how we use your data</h2>

<p>We will use the information you provide in a manner that complies with all relevant data protection law, primarily the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection and privacy laws.  It is our responsibility to keep your information accurate and up to date and not keep it for longer than is necessary, and in accordance with our current data retention policy.</p>

<p>We collect your data so that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Traffic commissioners can make decisions on applications for and to vary operator’s licences.</li>
  <li>Traffic commissioners can regulate goods and passenger vehicle operators in accordance with the statutory provisions. - Should you be called to Public Inquiry, data from previous applications may be included and the information made available to other operators also called to the Public Inquiry.</li>
  <li>Traffic commissioners can make decisions on applications for, to vary and to cancel local bus services.</li>
  <li>The Traffic Commissioner for Scotland can make decisions with regards to appeals against decisions by Scottish local authorities on taxi fares</li>
