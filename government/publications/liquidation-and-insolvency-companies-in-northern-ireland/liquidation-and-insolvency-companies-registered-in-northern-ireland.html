<p>This guidance provides a basic overview of insolvency proceedings and more detailed information about the documents you must send to Companies House under:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>It summarises some of the rules that apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>company voluntary arrangements</li>
  <li>moratoria</li>
  <li>administrations</li>
  <li>receivers</li>
  <li>voluntary liquidations</li>
  <li>compulsory liquidations</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the complexity of the requirements, this guide will not be able tell you everything you need to know about insolvent companies.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You should seek independent professional advice if you suspect your company is, or is about to become, insolvent. You should also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/the-insolvency-service">contact the Insolvency Service</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>We can help with queries about what documents you must send to Companies House, such as what notice to file when an administrator has been appointed.</p>

<p>The relevant legislation can be found in:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>&nbsp;Insolvency proceedings</h2>

<p>Insolvency proceedings are formal measures taken to deal with company debt. There are many different types of company insolvency proceedings. We cover all of them in this guidance.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that not all companies involved in insolvency proceedings are insolvent.</p>

<p>The parts of this guide covering compulsory winding-up and receivers (including administrative receivers) apply to registered and unregistered companies (including overseas companies).</p>

<p>The parts of this guide covering voluntary winding-up and administration orders do not apply to unregistered companies, which cannot be wound up by these methods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Companies can be dissolved without going through insolvency proceedings</h3>

<p>If we have reason to believe that a company is not carrying on business or is not in operation, its name may be struck off the Companies House register and dissolved without going through liquidation.</p>

<p>A private company that’s not trading may apply to be struck off the Companies House register. This procedure is not an alternative to formal insolvency proceedings.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>See our guidance for more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/company-strike-off-dissolution-and-restoration">strike off, dissolution and restoration</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>&nbsp;Supervising insolvency procedures</h3>

<p>All liquidators, administrators, administrative receivers and supervisors taking office must be authorised insolvency practitioners.</p>

<p>Receiver managers, receivers and nominees appointed to manage a company voluntary arrangement moratorium do not have to be authorised.</p>

<p>Insolvency practitioners may be authorised by the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chartered Association of Certified Accountants</li>
  <li>Insolvency Practitioners’ Association</li>
  <li>Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales</li>
  <li>Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland</li>
  <li>Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>&nbsp;Directors of an insolvent company</h3>

<p>The liquidator, administrative receiver, administrator or official receiver has a duty to send a report to the Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland) on the conduct of all directors who were in office in the last 3 years of the company’s trading.</p>

<p>The Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland) must decide whether it’s in the public interest to seek a disqualification order against a director.</p>

<p>Examples of the most commonly reported conduct are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continuing the company’s trading when the company was insolvent</li>
  <li>failing to keep proper accounting records</li>
  <li>failing to prepare and file accounts or make returns to Companies House</li>
  <li>failing to send in returns or pay to the Crown any tax that is due</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>&nbsp;Company voluntary arrangements (<abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr>) including <abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr> moratoria</h2>

<p>A <abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr> is when a company makes an agreement with its creditors. This arrangement must be approved by the court, in which the company has formally agreed terms with its creditors for the settlement of its debts.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Proposing a <abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>A <abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr> may be proposed by the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>administrator, where the company is in administration</li>
  <li>liquidator, if the company is being wound up</li>
  <li>directors, in other circumstances</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>&nbsp;Considering the proposal</h3>

<p>Where the nominee is not the administrator or liquidator, they must deliver notice of consent to the proposer as soon as possible after receiving the proposal.</p>

<p>Within 28 days of receipt the nominee must submit a report to the court.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>&nbsp;Approving a proposal for a <abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The nominee must invite members of the company to consider a proposal by summoning a meeting and inviting creditors to consider the proposal by a decision procedure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>&nbsp;Once the <abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr> is approved</h3>

<p>If the members and creditors approve the arrangement, then the nominee or their replacement becomes the supervisor of the arrangement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>&nbsp;What we need</h3>

<p>The supervisor must send us a copy of the chair’s report of the meeting attached to Form 1.01.</p>

<p>The supervisor must send reports on the progress and prospects for the full implementation of the voluntary arrangement to all interested parties including Companies House, every 12 months starting from the date the <abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr> was approved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>&nbsp;Termination or full implementation</h3>

<p>When the arrangement is completed or terminated, the supervisor must send us a copy of the notice to creditors and the supervisor’s report within 28 days after final completion or termination of the voluntary arrangement.</p>

<p>If the arrangement is suspended or revoked, you must tell us by filing the appropriate form.</p>

<p>These forms are not available from Companies House. You can get them from the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk" rel="external">legislation</a> or from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tso.co.uk" rel="external">The Stationery Office</a> (TSO).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>&nbsp;<abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr> moratorium</h3>

<p>A moratorium provides breathing space to allow directors of a company time to put the <abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr> proposals to creditors. It prevents the company’s creditors from proceeding against the company during this time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span>&nbsp;Obtaining a moratorium</h3>

<p>The directors must apply to the court for a moratorium. The moratorium will normally last for a period of 28 days and will be managed by a nominee, who may (or may not) be a registered insolvency practitioner.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span>&nbsp;What we need</h3>

<p>The nominee must deliver notice of the moratorium to us. You must notify us if the moratorium ends, or is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>extended</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>further extended</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>renewed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being continued</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of a moratorium a company may (or may not) proceed to a <abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Administration</h2>

<p>Administration provides breathing space to allow a rescue package or more advantageous realisation of assets to be put in place.</p>

<p>An administrator is appointed to manage a company’s affairs, business and property for the benefit of the creditors.</p>

<p>The person appointed must be an insolvency practitioner and have the status of an officer of the court (whether they’re appointed by the court, or not).</p>

<p>The objective of administration is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rescue a company as a going concern</li>
  <li>achieve a better price for the company’s assets or otherwise realise their value more favourably for the creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration)</li>
  <li>in certain circumstances, realise the value of property in order to make a distribution to one or more preferential creditors</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>&nbsp;Companies entering administration</h3>

<p>A company enters administration when the appointment of an administrator takes effect. An administrator may be appointed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an administration order made by the court</li>
  <li>the holder of a floating charge</li>
  <li>the company or its directors</li>
  <li>the liquidator of a company</li>
  <li>the supervisor of a <abbr title="company voluntary arrangements">CVA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a designated office of a magistrate’s court</li>
</ul>

<p>The administrator must perform their functions as quickly and efficiently as reasonably practicable in the best interests of the creditors as a whole.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>&nbsp;Notification when a company is in administration</h3>

<p>As soon as reasonably practicable, an administrator must send a notice of their appointment to the company and each of its creditors and publish notice of their appointment.</p>

<p>The administrator must also send a notice of their appointment to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Companies House</li>
  <li>the Belfast Gazette</li>
  <li>a newspaper in the area where the company has its principal place of business</li>
</ul>

<p>While a company is in administration, every business document issued by or on behalf of the company or the administrator must state the name of the administrator and that they’re managing the affairs, business and property of the company.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>&nbsp;The process of administration</h3>

<p>Soon after their appointment, the administrator will request a statement of the company’s affairs from the relevant people - such as an officer or employee of the company.</p>

<p>As soon as reasonably practicable and before the end of 8 weeks after the company enters administration, the administrator must make a statement setting out proposals for achieving the purpose of the administration or explaining why they cannot be achieved.</p>

<p>The proposals may include a voluntary arrangement or a compromise or arrangement with creditors or members.</p>

<p>The statement setting out the proposals must be sent to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Companies House on form 2.17B</li>
  <li>every creditor of the company with an invitation to an initial creditors’ meeting, if one is to be held</li>
  <li>every member of the company, unless the administrator publishes a notice to the effect that they will provide a copy free of charge to any member of the company who applies in writing for a copy</li>
</ul>

<p>Creditors will be asked to approve (with or without modifications) the statement of proposals. Following the initial meeting the administrator may form a creditors committee. The administrator must notify creditors of any revisions to the proposals.</p>

<p>You must report any decisions taken by creditors to us.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>&nbsp;When administration ends</h3>

<p>There are several ways administration can end.</p>

<p>Administration can end automatically one year from the date the administration took effect. You must notify us. But the administration may be extended with the consent of creditors or the court. You must file any extension with Companies House on form 2.31B.</p>

<p>An administrator who thinks that the purpose of administration has been sufficiently achieved must file a notice with the court and Companies House.</p>

<p>An administrator appointed under a court order may apply to the High Court to end administration if they think:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the purpose of the administration cannot be achieved</li>
  <li>the company should not have entered administration</li>
  <li>a creditors’ meeting requires the application</li>
</ul>

<p>The court will discharge the administration order and the administrator must notify us on form 2.33B.</p>

<p>An administrator appointed by the holders of a floating charge, or by the company or its directors, may end administration when the purpose of administration has been sufficiently achieved. The administrator must file notice with the court and with us on form 2.32B.</p>

<p>The administration may end on the application of a creditor to the High Court alleging an improper motive on the part of the person who appointed the administrator, or applied to the High court for an administration order. The administrator must send a copy of the order with form 2.33B to us within 14 days of the order being made.</p>

<p>The administration may end when the company moves into creditors’ voluntary winding up. This can happen where the administrator thinks that each secured creditor is likely to be paid and a distribution will be made to unsecured creditors, if there are any. The administrator must notify us on form 2.34B and send copies to the High Court and each creditor. The company will then be wound up - as if a resolution for voluntary winding up had been passed on the day the notice is registered with Companies House.</p>

<p>Administration may end and move into dissolution. This can happen if the administrator thinks that a company has no property with which to make a distribution to its creditors. The administrator must send notice to us and the company will be dissolved 3 months after we register the form, unless an order is made to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>extend or suspend the period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stop the dissolution</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must notify us of any order.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>&nbsp;Administration can be converted to creditors voluntary liquidation (<abbr title="creditors' voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The administration can be converted to <abbr title="creditors' voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr> where the administrator of a company thinks the total amount each secured creditor of the company is likely to receive has been paid or set aside to them and that a distribution will be made to unsecured creditors of the company (if there are any).</p>

<p>The administrator must send form 2.34B Notice of move from administration to creditors voluntary liquidation. Once we register the form, you must also file form VL1 Notice of appointment of liquidator. The appointment of the liquidator must not be before the date the company went into liquidation (the date of registration of form 2.34B).</p>

<p>A company converts to <abbr title="creditors' voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr> from the date of registration of form 2.34B. It’s helpful to tell us on a covering letter that you’re filing the form VL1 for a case where the company has moved from administration to <abbr title="creditors' voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>&nbsp;Administration forms</h3>

<p>You must file these forms with us for administration cases.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Receivers</h2>

<p>There are different kinds of receiver and their powers vary according to the terms of their appointment.</p>

<p>An administrative receiver is a receiver or manager of the whole, or substantially the whole, of a company’s property who is appointed by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures of the company secured by a floating charge. They have the power to sell, or otherwise realise, the assets covered by the floating charge and apply the proceeds of the debt owed to the charge holder.</p>

<p>Receivers who are not administrative receivers may be appointed in other circumstances. For example, under powers contained in an instrument or document creating a charge over a company’s property, a receiver or manager may be appointed until the debt is recovered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>&nbsp;Notice of the receiver’s appointment</h3>

<p>The person who appoints the administrative receiver, receiver or manager, or has them appointed under the powers contained in an instrument, is responsible for informing us within 7 days of the appointment. A form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appoint-an-administrative-receiver-receiver-or-manager-rm01">RM01</a> is required for each separate charge registered at Companies House over which the Receiver is appointed, whether the appointment is over part of the property or all the company’s assets.</p>

<p>An administrative receiver must also publish notice of their appointment in the Belfast Gazette and in an appropriate newspaper.</p>

<p>When the administrative receiver, receiver or manager ceases to act they must notify us with a form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cease-to-act-as-administrative-receiver-receiver-or-manager-rm02">RM02</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must file separate forms RM01 and RM02 for each separate charge registered at Companies House over which a receiver is appointed or ceases to act, whether the appointment is over part of the property or all the company’s assets.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>&nbsp;What the receiver sends to us</h3>

<p>Within 3 months of appointment, an administrative receiver must make a report to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Companies House</li>
  <li>the company’s creditors</li>
  <li>the holders of a floating charge</li>
  <li>any trustees for secured creditors of the company</li>
</ul>

<p>The report must explain the circumstances of the appointment and the action the administrative receiver is taking. 
The report must also include a summary of any ‘statement of affairs’ prepared for the receiver by the officers or employees of the company.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Statement of affairs</h4>

<p>This is a summary of the company’s assets, liabilities and creditors. The administrative receiver decides whether it’s needed and who should prepare it.</p>

<h4>Receipts and payments</h4>
<p>All receivers must send an account of receipts and payments for the first 12 months of receivership to us, and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for administrative receivers, at 12-monthly intervals thereafter</li>
  <li>for receivers and managers, 12 months after the date of appointment and every subsequent 6 months</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Voluntary liquidation</h2>

<p>There are 2 kinds of voluntary liquidation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>members’ voluntary liquidation (<abbr title="members' voluntary liquidation">MVL</abbr>) - which means the directors have made a statutory declaration of solvency</li>
  <li>creditors’ voluntary liquidation (<abbr title="creditors' voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr>) - which means that the directors have not made such a declaration</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>&nbsp;When a company can go into <abbr title="members' voluntary liquidation">MVL</abbr>
</h3>

<p>This can take place when the directors of a company believe that the company is solvent.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>A majority of the company’s directors must make a statutory declaration of solvency in the 5 weeks before a resolution to wind up the company is passed.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>&nbsp;The statutory declaration</h3>

<p>The statutory declaration states that the directors have made a full inquiry into the company’s affairs. It also states that after the inquiry, they believe that the company will be able to pay its debts, in full, within 12 months from the start of the winding-up.</p>

<p>The declaration includes a statement of the company’s assets and liabilities - as at the latest practicable date before making the declaration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>&nbsp;The start of liquidation</h3>

<p>The liquidation starts when the members, in a general meeting, pass a special resolution to wind up the company voluntarily.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>&nbsp;Giving notice of voluntary liquidation</h3>

<p>Notice of the special resolution for voluntary winding-up of the company must be published in the Belfast Gazette within 14 days of the general meeting.</p>

<p>The company must also send a copy of the declaration of solvency (form 4.71) and the special resolution to us within 15 days of the general meeting.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>&nbsp;When a <abbr title="creditors' voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr> is appropriate</h3>

<p>A company may go into <abbr title="creditors' voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr> when it cannot pay its debts.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>What the company must do</h3>

<p>The company passes a special resolution to say that it cannot continue in business because of its liabilities and that it’s advisable to wind up.</p>

<p>The resolution must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advertised in the Belfast Gazette within 14 days</li>
  <li>sent to Companies House within 15 days</li>
</ul>

<p>A meeting of creditors must be held in the next 14 days after passing the resolution. Notice of the meeting must be sent to the creditors at least 7 days before the meeting. The directors must prepare a statement of affairs for consideration at the meeting and appoint one of them to attend and preside over the meeting.</p>

<p>When the liquidator is appointed, the directors must provide them with a statement of affairs and co-operate with the liquidator.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>&nbsp;Advertising the meeting</h3>

<p>The meeting must be advertised in the Belfast Gazette and in 2 newspapers in the area where the company has its principal place of business.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>&nbsp;The main duties of a liquidator</h3>

<p>The liquidator is appointed to wind up the company’s affairs. The liquidator does this by calling in all the company’s assets and distributing them to its creditors.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span>&nbsp;Notification of a liquidator’s appointment</h3>

<p>Within 14 days of being appointed, a liquidator must publish a notice of appointment in the Belfast Gazette and notify Companies House.</p>

<p>If the liquidation is voluntary, the liquidator must also give notice in a newspaper in the area where the company has its principal place of business.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.10 </span>&nbsp;What the liquidator must send to us</h3>

<p>The liquidator must send a statement of affairs and form 4.21 to us within 7 days of the creditors’ meeting.</p>

<p>The liquidator must also send a statement of receipts and payments (form 4.69) at 12 monthly intervals until the liquidation is concluded.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.11 </span>&nbsp;Converting a <abbr title="members' voluntary liquidation">MVL</abbr> into a <abbr title="creditors' voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If the liquidator decides that the company will not be able to pay its debts, in full, in the period stated in the directors’ statutory declaration of solvency, they must call a meeting of the creditors. The meeting must be held within 28 days. The liquidation becomes a <abbr title="creditors' voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr> from the date of the meeting.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.12 </span>&nbsp;The requirements for giving notice in such a case</h3>

<p>The liquidator must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>post a notice of the meeting to each creditor at least 7 days before the date of the meeting</li>

  <li>prepare a statement of affairs for consideration at the meeting - a copy of the statement must be sent to Companies House within 7 days of the meeting</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.13 </span>&nbsp;What happens when the company’s affairs are fully wound up</h3>

<p>Within one week of the meeting having taken place, the liquidator must send the account and a return of the final meeting to us.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Compulsory liquidation</h2>

<p>Compulsory liquidation of a company is when the company is ordered by a court to be wound up.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>&nbsp;Courts that can order a compulsory liquidation</h3>

<p>The High Court may order the winding-up of a company. For example, this may be on the petition of a creditor or creditors on the grounds that the company cannot pay its debts.</p>

<p>A company is regarded as unable to pay its debts if, for example, a creditor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is owed more than £750</li>
  <li>presents a written demand in the prescribed form (known as a statutory demand) to the company</li>
  <li>the company fails to pay, secure or agree a settlement of the debt to the creditor’s reasonable satisfaction</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other situations where a company is deemed unable to pay its debts. You can find more information in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1989/2405/contents" rel="external">The Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989</a></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/1991/364/contents/made" rel="external">The Insolvency Rules (Northern Ireland) 1991</a>^</li>
</ul>

<p>The court may also order the company to be wound up on the petition of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the company itself</li>
  <li>the company’s directors or one or more members</li>
  <li>Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland)</li>
  <li>the official receiver</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>&nbsp;Information on the public record</h3>

<p>Unless the court directs other arrangements, you must advertise the petition in the Belfast Gazette.</p>

<p>If the petition is successful, the official receiver must deliver a copy of the winding-up order to us and it will be placed on the company’s public record.</p>

<p>The petition is not presented to us and does not appear on the public record.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>&nbsp;When the official receiver becomes liquidator</h3>

<p>The official receiver becomes liquidator on the making of a winding-up order against a company, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>&nbsp;The duties of the official receiver</h3>

<p>When a winding up order is made, the official receiver becomes liquidator unless and until an insolvency practitioner is appointed in their place. The exception to this is where the court has appointed a former administrator or supervisor under a voluntary arrangement, as liquidator the time of the winding up.</p>

<p>The official receiver retains their duty to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>investigate the company’s affairs and the causes of its failure.</li>
  <li>report to creditors</li>
  <li>report on the company officers’ conduct</li>
</ul>

<p>They also decide whether to call meetings of the creditors and contributories. Contributories are people liable to contribute to the assets of the company if it’s wound up, for the purpose of appointing a liquidator in their place. The liquidator must notify us of their appointment on form 4.32.</p>

<p>If they decide not to call meetings, they must notify the creditors, contributories and the court of this decision.</p>

<p>If the position of liquidator becomes vacant at any time, the official receiver becomes the liquidator for the duration of the vacancy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>&nbsp;When the winding-up is complete</h3>

<p>When we receive notice from the liquidator of the final meeting of creditors (form 4.44) or notice from the official receiver that winding-up is complete, we’ll register it and publish its receipt in the Belfast Gazette.</p>

<p>Unless the Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland)&nbsp;directs otherwise, the company is dissolved 3 months after the notice is registered with us.</p>

<p>If the official receiver, acting as liquidator, is satisfied that the company’s realisable assets (assets which could be sold or disposed of to raise money) will not cover the expenses of winding-up and that no further investigation of the company’s affairs is necessary, they may apply for early dissolution of the company. The company is dissolved 3 months after the application is registered with us.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>&nbsp;Forms for compulsory liquidation</h3>

<p>Where a liquidator has been appointed in place of an official receiver, you must file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4.32 - Notice of appointment of liquidator in winding up by the court</li>
  <li>4.44 - Notice of final meeting of creditors</li>
</ul>

<p>These forms are not available from Companies House. You can get them from the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk" rel="external">legislation</a> or from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tso.co.uk" rel="external">The Stationery Office</a> (TSO).</p>
