              <p class="app-c-published-dates__change-note">Added the Secretary of State's determination that, having regard to the efficient administration of Universal Credit, the conversion day for traditional SDP payments is: (a) 8 October 2020 in relation to any award of Universal Credit where the amount of a transitional SDP payment has been determined on or before that day; and (b) in any other case, the day on which the amount of that payment is determined.</p>

              <p class="app-c-published-dates__change-note">Added: The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions considers it necessary, to safeguard the efficient administration of Universal Credit, to extend the temporary de minimis period in accordance with regulation 5(2) of the Universal Credit (surpluses and self-employed losses)(Digital Service) amendment regulations 2015(a).

The 'temporary de minimus period' is the period during which 'the relevant threshold' for the purposes of calculating surplus earnings under regulation 54a of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013(b) is £2,500 rather than £300.

Therefore, in exercise of the power conferred by paragraph (2) of regulation 5 of the Universal Credit (surpluses and self-employed losses)(Digital Service) amendment regulations 2015, the Secretary of State determines that the temporary de minimis period is extended and will end on 31 March 2020.</p>

              <p class="app-c-published-dates__change-note">Added the following information under heading 'Universal Credit, Jobseeker’s Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance': The Universal Credit (Transitional Provision) Regulations 2014 - bring together a number of changes to various pieces of legislation where improvements or simplifications have been identified, including measures announced in the Autumn 2017 Budget and other changes as a result of changes being made elsewhere in government.  

The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions considers it necessary, in order to protect the efficient administration of Universal Credit, to extend the interim period for the purpose of Regulations 39 and 40 of the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2014(a).  

The 'interim period' is the period during which no claim may be made for Universal Credit by a person who is responsible for more than 2 children or qualifying young persons unless the claim meets the criteria in Regulation 39(1)(a) or (b) of the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2014.  

In exercise of the power conferred by paragraph (2) of Regulation 39 of the Universal Credit (Transitional provisions) Regulations 2014, the Secretary of State determines that:  

1. The interim period is extended and will end on 31 January 2019.</p>
