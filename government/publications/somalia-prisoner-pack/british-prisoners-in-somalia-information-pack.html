Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage, or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information. The information contained in this guide is general and factual. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/somalia-list-of-lawyers">contact local lawyers</a> for independent legal advice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Key points</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you, but they cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer. Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad</a>.</p>

<p>This detention information pack is designed to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Somalia and who can help. A printed copy is provided to those in prison or in custody. We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h4>1. Contacting us</h4>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British High Commission (and must do so if you want them to).</li>
  <li>even if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself, and should do so, particularly if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</li>
  <li>friends or family can also contact the local British Consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British Consulate even if you don’t want anyone to know that you have been arrested. This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British Government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h4>2. Who we are</h4>

<p>Consular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London, and in British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates overseas.</p>

<p>There is no consular presence at the British Embassy in Mogadishu. Consular assistance is provided remotely by the British high commission in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>

<p>You can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office on 020 7008 5000.</p>

<h4>3. What we can do</h4>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help. Once notified of your arrest or detention, consular staff will aim to contact you as soon as possible so that we can assess how we can help you.</p>

<p>We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions: our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>In Somalia, notification by the authorities to the embassy does not normally takes place. You should ask the authorities to contact the British Embassy if you would like our assistance.</p>

<p>Once we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible. In Somalia, this can take time as consular staff may need to make a formal request to the Somali government to arrange a time to speak to you.</p>

<p>We can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a list of local English-speaking <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/somalia-list-of-lawyers">lawyers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/somalia-translators-and-interpreters">interpreters</a>
</li>
  <li>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system (including if legal aid is available)</li>
  <li>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services</li>
  <li>keep in regular contact with you by telephone. The frequency of contact will depend on local conditions and your personal circumstances</li>
  <li>tell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including medication</li>
  <li>put you, or your family, in touch with a prisoners’ welfare charity called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>in some circumstances we may be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer-money">help to transfer money to you</a> from your friends or family</li>
  <li>generally, we cannot arrange for delivery directly to you</li>
</ul>

<p>What we can’t do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get you out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>help you get special treatment</li>
  <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>pay for any costs as a result of being arrested</li>
  <li>forward you packages sent by friends or family</li>
  <li>prevent authorities from deporting you after release</li>
</ul>

<h3>First steps</h3>

<h4>1. Can you / will you tell my family?</h4>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and can provide them with information about how to contact you in prison or detention. With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your well-being.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider the impact that not doing so might have. For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h4>2. Will the UK Police be informed?</h4>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>

<p>There may be other circumstances in which information about you may need to be shared by ourselves or authorities in Somalia.</p>

<h4>3. Do I need a lawyer? / How can I find a lawyer?</h4>

<p>Although we cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime, we can offer basic information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. We can give you a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/somalia-translators-and-interpreters">list of local interpreters</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/somalia-list-of-lawyers">list of local English-speaking lawyers</a>.</p>

<p>See also the section <a class="govuk-link" href="#legal-assistance">“What kind of legal assistance is available?”</a> You will want to consider the benefits of local legal representation and to discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. In no circumstances can we pay your legal or interpretation costs.</p>

<h4>4. Can you get me out?</h4>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for you because you are British. However if you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards we will consider whether to approach local authorities.</p>

<p>This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for fair trial or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h4>5. Who else can help me?</h4>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://%20www.prisonersabroad.org.uk">Prisoners Abroad</a>, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Detention conditions in Somalia</h2>

<h3>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<h4>1. Can my family and friends visit me? How can I arrange a visit?</h4>

<p>Family members and relatives are permitted to visit inmates. All visits must be arranged with prison authorities in advance.</p>

<p>We can provide guidance of visiting prisons upon request. You should advise any potential UK visitors to contact us via the FCDO in London, giving as much notice as possible.</p>

<p>Prisons have different rules regarding visits. There is no specific provision as to the number of prison visits allowed; however, when your family notify us of their intention to visit you in prison, we will provide them with details of the number of visits allowed in your specific case and try to request extra days. There is no guarantee that this will be granted.</p>

<h4>2. What can visitors expect?</h4>

<p>Visits takes place in dedicated rooms and there is no separation from prisoner and visitors. Visits take place in the presence of the guards.</p>

<h4>3. What can visitors bring?</h4>

<p>Prison rules in Somalia vary, therefore, families should contact the FCDO in advance of their visit so we can enquire from the prison authorities what will be accepted.</p>

<h4>4. Visits: Consular staff</h4>

<p>Consular assistance for British Nationals in Somalia is provided remotely by the British High Commission in Nairobi. Contact with the prisoner will therefore be by telephone.</p>

<p>We will contact you as soon as possible after being notified of your arrest or detention to assess your situation. We will aim to contact you once before sentencing and quarterly after sentencing unless you are vulnerable.</p>

<p>During our telephone conversations you will have the opportunity to discuss any health issues, security concerns, your treatment in prison and any other general issues that you wish to raise with our consular officials. Telephone calls with consular officials usually take place in the presence of prison guards.</p>

<p>You can write to us at any time on matters of concern by completing our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Somalia&amp;post=British%20Embassy%20Mogadishu" rel="external">contact form</a> for consular enquiries, but if it is urgent it may be quicker to ask prison authorities to contact us on your behalf through the following telephone numbers: +254 (0) 202 844 000 or +254 (0)202 873 000</p>

<h4>5. Emergency trips outside of prison</h4>

<p>Prisoners are not allowed to go outside of prisons no matter the urgency of the situation.</p>

<h3>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h3>

<h4>1. Arrival at the police station &amp; basic rights</h4>

<p>You have the right to be informed of the reason for your arrest in a language that you understand.</p>

<p>When you are arrested you will be taken to a police station and should be brought before a competent court within 48 hours. In practice, this does not always happen.</p>

<p>When arrested or detained you have the right to choose, and to consult with, a legal</p>

<p>Practitioner. If you cannot afford one, the State must appoint a legal practitioner for you. You should contact consular staff if this does not happen.</p>

<p>At the police station you can express your concerns in relation to your health, welfare and hygiene. There is no any special clothing for detainees. The detainees at a police station are held in shared rooms, and they should be allowed outdoors to perform daily prayers, for visits, and when going to be interviewed or when the authorities allow it.</p>

<p>You should be given the opportunity to contact the British Embassy. If this is not offered then you need to make a request. It is your right.</p>

<h4>2. Appearance at court</h4>

<p>In a court appearance, your case should be presented to the judge, along with the investigation report. Then, the judge will examine such a report and decide whether to release you, to order further investigation or transfer you to the Central Prison.</p>

<p>The courts should appoint a lawyer for any individual who lacks legal representation at the beginning of trial, though the law does not mention any specific time.</p>

<p>The judge may give you the opportunity to raise any issues related to your detention (e.g. torture, mistreatment, due process failings). But, this is at the discretion of the judge, as there is no specific provision in this regard.</p>

<p>Bail can be considered in this first hearing. However, this at the discretion of the judge. More information about the Somalia judicial system can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#chapter-three">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<h4>3. Initial arrival at the prison</h4>

<p>Prisoners are searched upon arrival. Any belongings will be kept in storage by the prison authorities and returned to you on release.</p>

<p>The British Embassy cannot store your personal belongings on your behalf. Your passport will usually be retained by the local authorities until the end of your sentence.</p>

<h3>Prison: conditions and daily life</h3>

<p>According to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://unpos.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/old_dnn/Assessment%20of%20the%20Prison%20System%20in%20Mogadishu_South_9_2012.pdf" rel="external">assessment of the prison system in Mogadishu/ South Central Somalia</a> by UNPOS, UNICEF and UNODC released in September 2012, prisoners’ living conditions in Somalia fall short of meeting minimum international and national standards. Most prisons lack basic infrastructure.</p>

<h4>1. Accommodation</h4>

<p>There is no proper separation of prisoners. Adults on remand and those that are sentenced to imprisonment and children are kept in the same area.</p>

<p>Overcrowding is a common problem with insufficient access to clean water and no electricity.</p>

<h4>2. Food and diet</h4>

<p>Food is distributed to prisoners three times a day. This consists of bread, rice, beans and maize. The food provided by the prison authorities is not sufficient in either quantity or nutritional value.</p>

<h4>3. Hygiene</h4>

<p>Bathing facilities are limited and there is insufficient clean water. The 2012 UN report states that prisons in Somalia do not meet the minimum standards required.</p>

<h4>4. Work and study</h4>

<p>Work and study are not common within Somali prisons.</p>

<h4>5. Contact and languages</h4>

<p>Most officials speak Somali language. In principle, administrative instructions and standing orders allow for prisoners to write or receive letters from outside. However, this is not always implemented in practice. The use of mobile phones is strictly forbidden for detainees and prisoners.</p>

<p>There may be the possibility to obtain local language materials through the post from Prisoners Abroad (including language textbooks and dictionaries).</p>

<h4>6. Exercise</h4>

<p>Prisoners exercising is not a normal thing in the prison.</p>

<h4>7. Climate</h4>

<p>Somalia has a tropical climate and is hot all year round. In addition, it is generally dry. People experience a minimum temperature of 25 and a maximum of 35 degrees Celsius.</p>

<h4>8. Religion</h4>

<p>99% of the Somali population are Muslims. Prisoners are allowed to perform their daily prayers.</p>

<h4>9. Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h4>

<p>Prisons rules and regulations are explained to prisoners. Illegal drug trafficking or use of drugs within the prison walls are prohibited.</p>

<p>Safety within Somalia prison is a concern as there is no separation of prisoners.</p>

<h3>Prison: access to help and services</h3>

<h4>1. How can I receive money?</h4>

<p>There are 2 ways in which you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Private funds: deposited to you by your family or friends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prisoners Abroad: depending on where you are detained, if your family can’t support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The British Government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.</p>
</div>

<h4>2. Private funds</h4>

<p>While the FCDO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family.</p>

<p>The Foreign Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) operates a “Prison Comfort” system for money transfers to prisoners. Please ask your family to get in touch with the FCDO in order to discuss this.</p>

<p>We are unable to receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<h4>3. Prisoners Abroad</h4>

<p>In addition, Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity, may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not in receipt of any regular donations from other sources.</p>

<p>In all cases, getting money to prisoners in Somalia can be challenging, especially if you do not have friends or family in Somalia.</p>

<h4>4. Can I receive medical and dental treatment?</h4>

<p>While you are in detention, Somalia is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met. However, health care in prisons does not met the threshold of the minimum standards required.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of the police or prison doctor. We can also liaise with your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests.</p>

<h4>5. Mail/ Parcels</h4>

<p>You have to seek permission from prison authorities in order to receive a parcel.</p>

<h4>6. Can I make telephone calls?</h4>

<p>Somali prisons do not have landlines. Mobile phones are not allowed in the prisons. Prisoners are expected to make phone calls through the prisons officials.</p>

<h4>7. How can I make a complaint about mistreatment?</h4>

<p>If you have been mistreated, please inform Consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to check on your welfare through phone calls, discuss the allegations, and inform you of any local complaints procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider.</p>

<p>With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally-accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, please try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible photos of the injuries you received.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: the Somalia judicial system</h2>

<h3>Overview and first steps</h3>

<h4>1. Is the system the same as the UK?</h4>

<p>In principle, there are similarities between the UK and Somali court systems. For example, detainees are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty, have the right to legal representation, and have the right fair trial and to appeal.</p>

<p>However, in practice, breaches of due process and minimum international standards are not uncommon. The hierarchy of the Somalia courts is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>District court</li>
  <li>Regional court</li>
  <li>Appeal court</li>
  <li>Supreme Court</li>
</ul>

<p>Practices and procedures in the military court system may diverge significantly from those in the civilian court system. If you are accused of a crime which will be tried through the military court system, you should ask the authorities to contact consular staff at the British Embassy at the earliest opportunity. It is your right.</p>

<p>There are no pre-trial hearings in the Somalia legal system.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>
</div>

<h4>2. What should happen when I am arrested?</h4>

<p>You have the right to be informed of the reason for your arrest in a language you understand. You have the right to a lawyer and if you cannot afford one the state should appoint one for you. You can inform your family of your arrest.</p>

<p>Somalia is party to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and you therefore have the right to request consular assistance from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Should you have any questions concerning the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. A list of local English-speaking lawyers can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/somalia-list-of-lawyers">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>3. For how long can I be remanded in custody?</h4>

<p>Ordinary time limits for detention on remand (i.e. detention before trial) are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>90 days for the crimes pending before the Extraordinary Section of the Regional Court and punishable with death penalty or life sentence</li>
  <li>60 days for the other crimes within the competence of the Extraordinary Section of the Regional Court</li>
  <li>45 days for the crimes within the competence of the Ordinary Section of the Regional Court</li>
  <li>15 days for the crimes within the competence of the Penal Section of the District Court</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be detained in prison pending trial. You will be remanded in the prison regardless of the offence in question.</p>

<h4>4. What happens when I am charged?</h4>

<p>You should be taken for your first court appearance before the competent judge. In such an appearance, your case will be presented to the judge, along with the investigation report. Then, the judge will examine such a report and decide whether to release you, to order further investigation or transfer you to the Central Prison.</p>

<h4>5. What provision is there for bail?</h4>

<p>You may have the right to bail in certain circumstances, depending on the charges against you. You should seek advice from your lawyer as to your right to bail.</p>

<p>You have the right to appeal against the decision of refusal of the bail. Bail shall only be granted on condition of a guarantee being met. Such a guarantee might be an amount of money paid to the court or a promise of paying such an amount if you violate the obligations of the bail. Such bail conditions are not subject to any form of periodic review.</p>

<p>Also, they cannot be changed or removed on application by the individual (directly or through his/ her lawyer).<br>
The bail will be revoked if the accused breaches the bail conditions</p>

<p>The FCDO is not able to facilitate the transfer of bail funds.</p>

<h3>Trial and legal assistance</h3>

<h4>1. What kind of legal assistance is available?</h4>

<p>If you wish to hire a private lawyer, see our list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/somalia-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyers</a>. Prisoners Abroad can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>Usually, the courts will appoint a lawyer if you lack legal representation at the beginning of your trial, though the law does not mention any specific time.</p>

<h4>2. What happens at the trial?</h4>

<p>The different stages of a trial before the relevant courts are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Introductory stage, in which the charge is presented to the accused person, to answer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>he/ she has objections to be raised</li>
  <li>he/ she admits to be guilty</li>
  <li>he/ she denies being guilty</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Prosecution stage, in which the Attorney General or one of his Deputies gives their opening statement along with introduction to the evidences in support of the charge.</p>

<p>3. Defence stage, in which the accused person or the defence lawyer delivers his/her opening statement along with introduction to the evidences in support of the defence.</p>

<p>4. Conclusion phase, in which both the prosecutor and the defence respectively deliver their concluding arguments.</p>

<p>Victims can participate in trials as a civil party by joining the penal case to request their damages. In such a case, the accused person shall file their compensation claim before the conclusion phase. The civil participation of the victim is voluntary, and they may retain only one lawyer.</p>

<p>There no any specific provision to protect vulnerable victims/witnesses when giving evidence. However, the court may order to perform trial proceedings in close doors on the basis of security reasons.</p>

<p>A translator should be provided if you do not speak the language of the court.</p>

<h4>3. Sentences</h4>

<p>Sentences will be passed by the judge or the members of the judging college.</p>

<p>Sentencing powers are prescribed in law. The judge has guidelines, within which he can use a degree of discretion to determine a sentence.</p>

<p>Somalia retains and implements the death penalty for certain serious offences. If this is a risk in your case, you should contact consular staff at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<h4>4. How can appeals be made?</h4>

<p>The appeals available after a criminal conviction are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appeal to the Court of Appeal</li>
  <li>complaint to the Supreme Court</li>
  <li>request for Revision to the Supreme Court</li>
</ul>

<p>The deadline for appeals is 30 days after the conviction judgement. The prosecution can appeal against the acquittal judgement. In such a case, the individual has to stay in country for the appeal.</p>

<h3>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>1. What provision is there for reduction of sentence (remission) e.g. for good behaviour?</h4>

<p>There is no specific provision for reduction of sentence, but there is conditional release for good behaviour.</p>

<h4>2. What provision is there for early release e.g. on parole?</h4>

<p>Conditional release is only available when a person sentenced to life imprisonment has served at least twenty five years or half to three-quarters of their sentence provided he/ she has continuous proof of good conduct.</p>

<h4>3. What provision is there for clemency or pardon?</h4>

<p>The president can pardon. There is judicial pardon for persons under 18 or over 70 years of age. A judicial pardon may not be granted more than once.</p>

<h4>4. What about any financial penalties?</h4>

<p>You may be ordered to pay compensation in civil cases.</p>

<h4>5. Is transfer to another prison within Somalia possible?</h4>

<p>Prison transfer within Somalia is an internal government decision.</p>

<h4>6. Is transfer to the UK a possibility?</h4>

<p>No, the UK does not have a prisoner transfer agreement with Somalia.</p>

<h4>7. What are the procedures for release and deportation?</h4>

<p>A UK citizen will be deported after they have completed their sentence. Somalia Immigration authorities will facilitate the deportation.</p>

<p>If your passport has expired, or has less than 6 months validity remaining, you might need to obtain a new passport or an Emergency Travel Document before you can be deported. This could take several days, depending on what documentation you have. To avoid deportation delays, we recommend that you check your passport status well in advance of your release and deportation.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. Possibly you have never lived in the UK and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may simply want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Prisoners Abroad you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing.</p>

<p>If you know your release date in advance it is best to write and tell your caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroad’s Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</li>
  <li>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</li>
  <li>making appointments with doctors and dentists</li>
  <li>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency. Other sources of practical help back in the UK are The Salvation Army – UK Helpline 020 7367 4888, Monday to Friday 08h00 to 16h00, or contact your local Salvation Army branch – and The Prison Fellowship, UK Helpline 020 7799 2500, Monday to Friday 09h00 to 17h00.</p>

<h4>8. Would I have a criminal record in the UK?</h4>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities.</p>

<p>It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: Additional information</h2>

<h3>Prisoners Abroad</h3>

<p>Since 1978 the charity Prisoners Abroad has offered practical support and advice to British citizens imprisoned overseas. It is the only UK charity providing this service and it is available to all, whether guilty or innocent, convicted or awaiting charge or trial.</p>

<p>Prisoners Abroad is concerned with your health and welfare, both during your imprisonment and also on your return to the UK, through their resettlement service (if you have registered whilst in prison). They can also provide support and advice to your family during your imprisonment. In order to access any services, prisoners must first register with Prisoners Abroad by signing and returning their authorisation form.</p>

<p>Once you seek help from Prisoners Abroad, the Prisoner &amp; Family Support Service will be your point of contact for advice and information. The type of assistance they can offer will vary from country to country, but generally they can provide you with information, in English, on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your rights as a prisoner and issues that may affect you such as health or transfer to the UK</li>
  <li>obtaining magazines, newspapers, books and the regular Prisoners Abroad newsletter</li>
  <li>learning the language of your country of imprisonment</li>
  <li>translation of documents</li>
  <li>grants for food if you are in a developing country and don’t have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>grants for essential medicines and toiletries if you don’t have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>preparing for release</li>
  <li>help for your loved ones, including information, family support groups and, in a few cases, assistance with the cost of visiting</li>
</ul>
