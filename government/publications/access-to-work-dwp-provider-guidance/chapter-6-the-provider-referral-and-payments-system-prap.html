<h2>
<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Support Plan Start</h2>

<p>6.22.	Once the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager has reviewed the Support Plan, all rework has been undertaken and the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager notifies you they have approved the Support Plan, the Support Plan Start Line that initiates the payment can be claimed.</p>

<p>6.23.	The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Support Plan Start Line has four options. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>did not attend (<abbr title="did not attend">DNA</abbr>) when the customer did not attend the initial assessment meeting;</li>
  <li>did not start (<abbr title="did not start">DNS</abbr>) when the customer does not want to join <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>;</li>
  <li>no contact (<abbr title="no contact">NC</abbr>) when you are unable to contact the customer.  Note this must be approved by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager; and</li>
  <li>start when a suitable appointment with the customer has been undertaken, the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Initial Assessment has been delivered to <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager, all Rework has been undertaken and the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager has issued approval for the claim to be made.</li>
</ul>

<p>6.24.	You are required to input dates into <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> to confirm the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Support Plan Start. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a unique reference - this is something to easily identify this Advance Shipping Notice (<abbr title="Advance Shipping Notice">ASN</abbr>) to you. It could be a reference which relates directly to your own system, or something to help you identify this customer. This must not contain a <abbr title="National Insurance number">NINO</abbr>;</li>
  <li>date 1: the date the Support Plan was submitted to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager (as notified by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager in the Support Plan approval email); and</li>
  <li>date 2: the same date as date 1.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> 6 Month Report Outcome</h2>

<p>6.25.	Once the customer has remained in work for six months, the <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> 6 Month Report has been completed, all rework has been undertaken and the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager notifies you they have approved the <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> 6 Month Report, the 6 Month Report Outcome Payment can be claimed in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.26.	<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> 6 Month Report has been delivered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a unique reference - this is something to easily identify this Advance Shipping Notice (<abbr title="Advance Shipping Notice">ASN</abbr>) to you. It could be a reference which relates directly to your own system, or something to help you identify this customer. This must not contain a <abbr title="National Insurance number">NINO</abbr>;</li>
  <li>date 1: the date the Support Plan was submitted to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager (as notified by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager in the Support Plan approval email); and</li>
  <li>date 2: the date you submitted the 6 Month Report to <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager, (as notified by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Managers in the 6 Month Report approval email).</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Exit Report Outcome</h2>

<p>6.27.	If the customer remains in employment and the Exit Report has been completed, rework undertaken and the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager notifies you they have approved the Exit Report, the Exit Report Outcome can be claimed in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.28.	Exit Report has been delivered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a unique reference - this is something to easily identify this Advance Shipping Notice (<abbr title="Advance Shipping Notice">ASN</abbr>) to you. It could be a reference which relates directly to your own system, or something to help you identify this customer. This must not contain a <abbr title="National Insurance number">NINO</abbr>;</li>
  <li>date 1: the date the Support Plan was submitted to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager (as notified by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager in the Support Plan approval email); and</li>
  <li>date 2: the date you submitted the Exit Report to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager (as notified by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager in the Exit Report approval email).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Referral end date</h2>

<p>6.29.	The end date should be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> following claiming the Sustained Outcome.  If an Assessment has not been delivered, for example, where a customer arranges an appointment and subsequently cancels it, the end date must always be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.30.	<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> will automatically record an end date 365 days after the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Support Plan Start which will prevent any outcomes being claimed.  All outcomes must be claimed within 365 days of the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Support Plan Start.</p>

<p>6.31.	The following End Date information needs to be entered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a unique reference: this is something to easily identify this Advance Shipping Notice (<abbr title="Advance Shipping Notice">ASN</abbr>) to you. It could be a reference which relates directly to your own system, or something to help you identify this customer. This must not contain an <abbr title="National Insurance number">NINO</abbr>;</li>
  <li>date 1: the date the end has been entered into the system;</li>
  <li>date 2: the date the end has been entered into the system; and</li>
  <li>end reason: the reason the provision has ended.</li>
