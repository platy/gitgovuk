<h2>Background</h2>

<p>1.01.	People with mental health conditions have low employment rates and can fall out of work without the right support. The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Mental Health Support Service (<abbr title="AtW Mental Health Support Service">AtW MHSS</abbr>) is an essential element of Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) support for customers with a mental health issue or condition; its aim is to help more people to stay in work or move to more suitable work.</p>

<p>1.02.	The Mental Health Support Service (<abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>) is delivered through the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> programme - a Jobcentre Plus discretionary grant scheme which assists disabled people who are in paid employment, self-employed or participating in an agreed Job/Work Trial which may have already started, or is due to start, by providing practical support to overcome work related obstacles resulting from their disability.</p>

<p>1.03. The <abbr title="AtW Mental Health Support Service">AtW MHSS</abbr> provides flexible and personalised support for customers experiencing mental health issues or conditions within the workplace.</p>

<h2>Eligibility conditions for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>
</h2>

<p>1.04.	<abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> is available for people who have a disability, health or mental health condition that impacts on their ability to work.</p>

<p>1.05.	To receive <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support, the following eligibility conditions must be satisfied. Customers must be:</p>

There is no minimum number of hours to be worked and the total amount of any wage is immaterial to eligibility:
    <ul>
      <li>National Living Wage is applicable to those aged 25 or over 	(but not in the first year of an apprenticeship);</li>
      <li>National Minimum Wage is applicable to those aged under 25; 	and</li>
      <li>National Minimum Wage rates do not apply to people on 	apprenticeships.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>be in need of help at a job interview with an employer;</li>
  <li>about to start employment;</li>
  <li>about to start a Job/Work Trial (Jobcentre Plus organised or individually established where there is a reasonable prospect of employment after the work trial);</li>
  <li>not receiving Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) and/or <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> credits only as part of an <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> claim, (or will cease to claim whilst in work) unless the customer is about to start a <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> agreed Work Trial; on Permitted Work Higher Level; Permitted Work (<abbr title="Personal Capability Assessment">PCA</abbr> exempt) or Supported Permitted Work, employed and receiving <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> after exhausting statutory sick pay; and</li>
