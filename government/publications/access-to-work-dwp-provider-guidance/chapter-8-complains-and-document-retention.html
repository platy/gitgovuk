<h2>Enquiries and complaints</h2>

<p>8.01.	You must have an appropriate and effective complaints process across your whole supply chain to resolve customers’ complaints. You must explain your complaints process to the participant in your first contact with them.</p>

<p>8.2.	Where a formal complaint has been received from a customer, a drafted response should be submitted to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Contact Liaison Point at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ATWPROVIDER.CONTRACTCORRESPONDENCE@DWP.GOV.UK">ATWPROVIDER.CONTRACTCORRESPONDENCE@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a> before replying to the customers complaint. <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Operations will review the draft response and request a rework if appropriate or confirm their approval.  Once you have received an approval from <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Operations, the response should then be sent to the customer.</p>

<p>8.3.	You should refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complaint-resolution-core-briefing-pack-dwp-provider-guidance">Complaint resolution core briefing pack: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provider guidance</a> - GOV.UK and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-customer-charter"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>: customer charter</a> - GOV.UK when reviewing your processes.</p>

<p>8.4.	If a customer is unhappy about the service they receive from you and raises a complaint, you should ensure that you follow each step of your detailed process robustly in order to bring the complaint to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>8.5.	After following all steps in your process, you must include in your final response a standard text which signposts the customer to contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/independent-case-examiner">Independent Case Examiner</a> (<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>) should they wish to pursue their complaint. The text can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-work-dwp-provider-guidance">Annex H</a>.</p>

<p>8.6.	Complainants should be advised that they can escalate their complaint to the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> within six months from the date of the final response that you issue.</p>

<p>8.7.	On receipt of a complaint, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will contact you to confirm that each step of your internal process has been completed.  If they feel that you have not completed your process satisfactorily, you may be asked to revisit some steps to seek resolution before <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> are prepared to investigate further.</p>

<p>8.8.	You must deal with any correspondence of any nature from <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> within the stated timescales or at least within five working days.</p>

<p>8.9.	<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> is an independent office holder, supported by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff. The <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> does not act on behalf of individuals, but as an independent arbiter.  The <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> Office has two primary purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to provide a free complaint resolution and investigation service to individuals who are unhappy with the final response to their complaint from the relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Agency, Business, Access to Work Provider; and</li>
  <li>to support <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Agencies, Businesses, Access to Work Providers in improving their services, by highlighting where things have gone wrong and making constructive recommendations based on the complaints the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> Office identify. Recommendations might be systemic in nature or case specific.</li>
</ul>

<p>8.10.	The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/independent-case-examiner">Independent Case Examiner</a> (<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>) will mediate between you and the customer to broker a resolution. If a resolution cannot be agreed between either party, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will ask to see the evidence. You must provide all the evidence which relates to the complaint. <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will again attempt mediation between you and the customer (known as a ‘settlement’ if the evidence is needed to broker an agreement). If this cannot be achieved, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will undertake a full investigation of the complaint.</p>

<p>8.11.	<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> has three stages of complaint examination, which will be applied to any complaints made about you.  At every stage, you, the provider, will have the opportunity to give your version of events and offer any supporting evidence.</p>

<p>8.12.	 Further information regarding the three stages of complaints can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Generic Guidance- Chapter 2 Delivering Provision</a>.</p>

<p>8.13.	Please note that under normal circumstances, if a complaint is upheld against you at investigation stage, a financial contribution s recovered from you to go towards funding the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> service for provider complaints in the following year.</p>

<p>8.14.	Further information on complaints procedures can be found in your contract and in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Generic Guidance- Chapter 2 Delivering Provision</a>.</p>

<p>8.15.	For more information about <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>, please visit the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> website at: Independent Case Examiner.</p>

<h2>Issues management</h2>

<p>8.16.	When you identify problems relating to any aspects of the services you deliver, you should resolve such problems in an appropriate manner.</p>

<p>8.17.	You should report any proposed changes to the way in which your services are accessed or suggestions for improving the efficiency of the services provided to your Performance Manager in writing. Their approval is required prior to implementation.</p>

<h2>Document security</h2>

<p>8.18.	Please refer to Chapter 8 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance">Generic Guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Document retention</h2>

<p>8.19.	You should keep and maintain for 6 years after the end of the contract period, (or as long as may be agreed) a full and accurate record of the contract including the services supplied under it, all expenditure reimbursed by the Department and all payments made by the Department.</p>

<p>8.20.	In respect of completed specified reports, documents and personal notes, these can be retained for up to six months after the exit report payment. At which point they can either be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>securely destroyed and disposed of; or</li>
  <li>anonymised and retained for up to 6 years.</li>
</ul>
