<p>3.01.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> expects service and provision under <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> to be of the highest quality and considers this to be a shared responsibility.</p>

<p>3.02.	You are responsible for ensuring that customers and their employers have access to suitable and high quality support in a way that provides a good service and an excellent customer experience. For <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> to offer the most effective support possible to customers, a number of key features are integral to delivery. We expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>focus strongly on speed and accuracy; and</li>
  <li>demonstrate a sound understanding of the breadth of mental health issues which may be experienced by Access to Work customers and appropriate support options to address the customer’s workplace barriers.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.03.	The <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Support Plan, <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Monthly Updates, <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> 6 Month Report and the <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Exit Reports are required to enable <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Managers to determine that customers are receiving or have received the support they require to help them sustain employment.</p>

<p>3.04.	It is important that the reports are of good quality and the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Operational team will define whether reports are ‘to the specified standard’, based on the criteria in the following paragraph. (Please note: this is not an exhaustive list).</p>

<p>3.05.	Support Plans, Monthly Updates, 6 Month Reports or Exit Reports may be deemed as not meeting the specified standard and therefore rejected and returned for re-work if one or more of the following reasons applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>incorrect information is reported;</li>
  <li>there are spelling and grammatical errors;</li>
  <li>there is no full justification for the support recommended;</li>
  <li>there is no explanation of how recommendations will overcome difficulties;</li>
  <li>it contains personal/confidential information reported to your staff that is identified that the customer requested be confidential and did not want disclosing on the report;</li>
  <li>your staff should ensure that they advise the customer that they will report anything they tell them unless otherwise stated; and</li>
  <li>if your staff want to make the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager aware of any issues, a separate document can be added for the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Case Manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.06.	If the report has been rejected, you will be notified by e-mail. Whenever possible, this will be within 5 working days of the receipt of the report. The standard notification stencil which will be used to inform you can be found at  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance">Annex G</a>.</p>

<p>3.07.	3.07	If the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Operational team decides that a report is not to the specified standard, you will be notified of the reason and you will be required to review and resubmit the report using secure encrypted email within 1 working day of its return.</p>

<p>3.08.	If you are concerned about reports that have been returned for rework, you should refer to your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SPOC</abbr>, the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Contract Liaison Point, within the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Operational Team. In the absence of the <abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SPOC</abbr> you can contact the Contract Support Officer to determine the appropriate action to take.</p>

<p>3.09.	The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Operational team will monitor the quality of reports and the number returned to each provider as unacceptable on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>3.10.	This information will be discussed formally as part of regular performance reviews led by your Performance Manager. When appropriate, remedial measures, including a Performance Improvement Plan, will be agreed to address areas requiring improvement.</p>
