<h2>How to refer a customer to <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>
</h2>

<p>4.01.	Customers can apply for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> support in any of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>online at the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> section of GOV.UK;</li>
  <li>by telephoning the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Service Centre between 8am to 7.30pm Monday to Friday on 0800 121 7479 (Textphone 0800 121 7579); or</li>
  <li>directly applying to the provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>4.02.	Applications made to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for the Mental Health Support Services will be referred to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser on the same day.  The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser will contact the customer to discuss their eligibility and how the customersâ mental health condition affects then in the workplace.  Customers who are eligible for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>, the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser will email the <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Referral Form to the Provider, and a referral will be made via the Provider Referrals and Payment system (<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>), to the Provider.  Providers may commence engagement activities.  However, if you have not received the associated <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral the following working day, you must e-mail the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser immediately, sending a copy of this e-mail to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Contract Liaison Point at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ATWPROVIDER.CONTRACTCORRESPONDENCE@DWP.GOV.UK">ATWPROVIDER.CONTRACTCORRESPONDENCE@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>

<p>4.03.	Referrals will be allocated to providers on a National Insurance Number split.  Referrals will be regularly monitored by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Team to ensure an equal market share to each provider.  Any provider having excess referrals, <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Advisers will make additional referrals to the competing provider.</p>

<p>4.04.	Customers applying to you through your marketing and promotional activity, you should send the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Direct Referral form, Annex A, by encrypted email to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser, for the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> to determine eligibility.  The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser will notify you if the customer is eligible for the Mental Health Support Services and a referral will be made via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.05.	The decision if a customer is eligible for <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Mental Health Support Service remains with the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser.</p>

<h2>Identity checks</h2>

<p>4.06.	You must ensure that in all communication with Customers that you are satisfied that you are engaging with the correct person.</p>

<p>4.07.	To do this you may decide to ask them to state a combination of their personal information, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name;</li>
  <li>address;</li>
  <li>NINO;</li>
  <li>other information that was included in the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser referral; and</li>
  <li>details you hold on your records.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>To note: COVID-19 Provider Q&amp;A Log issued (via Jaggaer) on 3 April 2020 gives more detail on handling ID checks in the present circumstances.</p>
</div>

<h2>Inappropriate referrals</h2>

<p>4.08.	Situations may arise where <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Advisers may make an inappropriate <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral in error.  When the error is discovered by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser, they will contact you and advise how the error occurred.  If you discover the error, you must contact the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser and inform them.</p>

<p>4.09.	Where the error is discovered prior to acknowledging the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral, you should reject the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> with the rejection reason âOtherâ.</p>

<p>4.10.	Where the error is discovered before and notified after acknowledging the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral, prior to start in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>, you should cancel the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> recording the reason as âDid Not Startâ</p>

<p>4.11.	Where the error is discovered after the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> Support Plan Start has been recorded, you should complete a <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> 14 form and send it to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Policy inbox: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:atwproviderguidance.policy@dwp.gov.uk">atwproviderguidance.policy@dwp.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>4.12.	The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Policy team will then consider your request and you will be notified of the outcome.  We may need to gather further information from you to enable us to process your request. If the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> 14 request is agreed, it will be sent to the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>): <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:prap.support@dwp.gov.uk">prap.support@dwp.gov.uk</a>. The <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> team will then take action to remove the incorrect date(s) enabling you to input the correct ones, if required.</p>

<h2>Starting <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Mental Health Support Services</h2>

<p>4.13.	Key to scheduling a meeting with the customer to develop and agree the Support Plan is to ensure that it takes place as quickly as possible but takes into account the availability of all parties to be involved. We expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> customer within 2 working day (not including weekends or public holidays) of receiving the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral, (the day you receive the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral is the first (1st) working day), to arrange and agree a date and time to meet with the customer, to develop and agree a Support Plan;</li>
  <li>offer the customer several appointment slots within the timeframe specified in your contract;</li>
  <li>keep a record of all appointments offered to the customer;</li>
  <li>make several attempts at various times within 2 working days of the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral to contact the customer to agree a meeting.  Once the initial contact has been made and an appointment scheduled, record on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> within 5 working days of receipt of the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral, (receipt of referral being 1st working day);</li>
  <li>use a variety of media (eg: mobile phone, landline, email, whichever is the customerâs preferred method) and record all information regarding attempted customer contact; and</li>
  <li>ensure that the attempts to contact the customer are made at different times of the day to avoid conflicting with regular scheduled commitments the customer may have (eg: school run).</li>
</ul>

<p>4.14.	If you are unable to contact the customer within the first 2 days, you should confirm the customer contact details with the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser, informing them of the dates and methods you have used when attempting to contact the customer. The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser will offer advice on further action to be taken.</p>

<p>4.15.	At the face to face meeting you must develop and agree a Support Plan with the customer: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-work-dwp-provider-guidance">Annex C</a>. Discuss the Customer Consent Form: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-work-dwp-provider-guidance">Annex B</a> to confirm if the customer agrees for you and the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to contact their employer.  The Support Plan and the Consent form should be sent to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser within 1 calendar month, ensuring this meets the required quality and standard.  Record in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>, within 5 working days of confirmation by the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser that the Support Plan has met the required standard.</p>

<h2>Cancellation of an <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Mental Health Support Service Referral</h2>

<h3>Cancellation by the customer</h3>

<p>4.16.	If a customer cancels an appointment it is important that you act quickly, as delays could impact on the achievement of the target specified in your contract.  This applies if a customer cancels a scheduled appointment or does not require <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.17.	If a customer cancels an appointment it is important that you act quickly, as delays could impact on the achievement of the target specified in your contract.  This applies if a customer cancels a scheduled appointment or does not require <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.18.	In the event of a cancellation by the customer, you should reschedule a new appointment. However, you should notify the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the customer is not available in the timeframe specified in your contract from the original referral. The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser must be informed of the reasons for the customer cancellation and any rescheduling attempts you have made;</li>
  <li>the customer does not want to join the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>;</li>
  <li>the customer is not sure when they will be available;</li>
  <li>you are unable to contact the customer within 2 days of the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral and the customer has not contacted you. The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser must be informed of all the dates and times you have attempted to contact the customer and the method of contact used;</li>
  <li>where you are unable to contact a direct referral customer within 2 working days of receiving the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral, you must contact the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser on the second working day (if the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser confirms that no further contact attempts are required, a No Contact can be input to <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>); and</li>
  <li>the Support Plan is going to be sent outside the 1 calendar month period stating the reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>4.19.	You will need to notify the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser if the customer does not wish to join the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> provision, and close the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referral accordingly.</p>

<p>4.20.	Please note, no <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> referrals should be cancelled prior to contacting the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser.</p>

<h2>Cancellation by the Provider</h2>

<p>4.21.	If you need to postpone a scheduled appointment or if you are unable to meet with the customer to develop and agree the support plan, you should contact the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser for advice, giving the reasons for cancelling the appointment.</p>

<p>4.22.	It is not acceptable to return referrals due to providerâs staff availability.</p>

<h2>Support Period</h2>

<p>4.23.	Customers will receive the initial work related support period for 6 months, (182 days from <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser notifying you that the Support Plan has been approved), from the date of acceptance of the Support Plan.  Customers can work independently to manage their mental health condition in the work place.  At the end of the 6-month support, you and the customer should agree and complete the Mental Health Support Service 6 Month Report: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-work-dwp-provider-guidance">Annex E</a>, to the required standard and forward to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser.</p>

<p>4.24.	You must ensure a Monthly Meeting is held with the customer each month, and is conducted within 10 working days of the monthly anniversary date, (the date the Support Plan was sent to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser, subject to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviserâs approval of the Support Plan or any subsequent approved re-work).</p>

<p>4.25.	The Monthly Update, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-work-dwp-provider-guidance">Annex D</a>, should be completed each month, recording agreed activities and progress made whilst the customer has been supported. This should be forwarded to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser by encrypted email, within ten working days of the monthly anniversary date. They must not be sent before the monthly anniversary date, ensuring the customer has the opportunity to receive full support, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-work-dwp-provider-guidance">Annex D</a> reflects the support received. The 10 working days from the monthly anniversary date, will allow flexibility for customer availability.</p>

<p>4.26.	In exceptional circumstances, where the customer is unavailable for longer periods due to holidays, illness, etc., and you are unable to meet the 10 working day deadline, you must contact the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser, explaining the reason for the delay.  The Monthly Meeting and submission of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-work-dwp-provider-guidance">Annex D</a> must then be completed at the earliest convenience.  Please note: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> does not expect this to be a frequent occurrence and will be monitored.</p>

<h2>Disengaged Customers</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>During COVID-19 any stipulation in this guidance requiring an original signature (sometimes termed a âwet signatureâ) can be disregarded if interactions cannot be conducted face-to-face. 
<br><br>
As noted in the COVID-19 Provider Q&amp;A Log (issued 27 March 2020) please annotate âDue to COVID-19â on the signature line. In due course you will be expected to obtain an original signature retrospectively, wherever possible.</p>
</div>

<p>4.27.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> expects <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> providers to have a strategy in place to minimise the instances where customers disengage from the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> programme.</p>

<p>4.28.	If the customer leaves their job, becomes long term sick or decides they no longer need or require your support within the 6 Month Support Period or 3 Month Sustainment Period, you must notify the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser immediately by encrypted e-mail.  The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser will update the Departmentâs systems noting the customer has disengaged from the provision.</p>

<p>4.29.	You should not record an end date in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> under the circumstances above.  An end date should only be recorded when you are certain the customer will not re-engage with the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr> provision.</p>

<p>4.30.	Where the customer has informed you not to attempt to contact them again as they have decided that they will not re-engage with the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> <abbr title="Mental Health Support Service">MHSS</abbr>, you should advise the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Adviser by encrypted e-mail and submit a final Monthly Update form, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-to-work-dwp-provider-guidance">Annex D</a> within 10 working days of the monthly anniversary date, recording the date of the final contact and a brief explanation of the customer requesting no further contact.</p>

<p>4.38.	Should it not be possible to deliver the balance of the 6 Month Support Period/3 Month Sustainment Period and claim the associated outcomes before the automatic end-date is recorded, you will not be able to claim the associated outcomes.  Under these circumstances, you should direct the customer back to <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr>.</p>
