<p>Applies to England only.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>If you’ve been told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace on or after 28 September 2020, you’re under a legal obligation to do so.</p>

<p>If you’ve received a notification via the NHS COVID-19 app to self-isolate as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, and you make an application for the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme, you will also come under the legal obligation to self-isolate during this application process.</p>

<p>You could be eligible for a £500 Test and Trace Support Payment if you live in England and meet all the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ve been told to stay at home and self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS COVID-19 app, either because you have tested positive for coronavirus or have recently been in close contact with someone who has tested positive</li>
  <li>you’ve responded to messages received from NHS Test and Trace and have provided any legally required information</li>
  <li>you’re employed or self-employed</li>
  <li>you’re unable to work from home and will lose income as a result of self-isolating</li>
  <li>you’re currently receiving or are the partner of someone in the same household who is receiving, at least one of the following benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>Universal Credit</li>
      <li>Working Tax Credit</li>
      <li>income-based Employment and Support Allowance</li>
      <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
      <li>Income Support</li>
      <li>Housing Benefit</li>
      <li>Pension Credit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re not on one of these benefits, you could be eligible for a £500 discretionary payment if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you meet all the other criteria listed above</li>
  <li>you’re on a low income</li>
  <li>you will face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating</li>
</ul>

<p>You can make a claim for the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme or a discretionary payment up to 28 days after the first day of your period of self-isolation.</p>

<p>If you’re eligible for either the Test and Trace Support Payment or a discretionary payment, you will receive the £500 payment on top of any benefits and Statutory Sick Pay that you currently receive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support" class="govuk-link">See more information about financial and other support</a></p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>In England, the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme is administered by unitary authorities and district councils. You should contact your local authority to find out how to apply.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/test-and-trace-support-payment" class="govuk-link">Apply for a Test and Trace Support Payment</a> through your local council.</p>

<p>To apply, you will need to provide all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an NHS Test and Trace Account ID, sometimes referred to as a CTAS number. If you test positive for coronavirus, or are told to self-isolate by contact tracers, you will be provided with an NHS Test and Trace Account ID</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>proof of receipt of one of the qualifying benefits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a bank statement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>proof of employment or, if you are self-employed, evidence of self-assessment returns, trading income and proof that your business delivers services that cannot be undertaken without social contact</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the NHS COVID-19 app has told you to self-isolate because you’ve been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will need to follow some <a href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01339" rel="external" class="govuk-link">additional steps to request your NHS Test and Trace Account ID</a>.</p>

<h2>Tax and the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</h2>

<p>Payments made under the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme are subject to income tax, if you are a taxpayer, but they are not subject to National Insurance contributions. If you’re employed, HMRC will automatically recover the tax from your pay with a change to your tax code.</p>

<p>Self-employed recipients will need to report the payment on their 2020 to 2021 Self Assessment tax return.</p>
