<h3>Background and responsibilities of both organisations</h3>

<p>The main responsibilities of the Scottish Fiscal Commission (<abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr>) are set out in legislation, namely the Scottish Fiscal Commission Act 2016 and associated regulations. The <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> is a non-Ministerial Office in the Scottish Administration, consisting of Commissioners and staff, who develop and run the forecasting models and produce the forecasts required to fulfil the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> statutory duties.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the Commission to prepare forecasts at least twice a year to inform the Scottish Budget. These forecasts should cover five years and include Scottish onshore GDP, non-savings non-dividend income tax, assigned VAT, fully devolved taxes and devolved social security revenues. The Commission must also assess the reasonableness of Ministers’ projections as to their borrowing requirements and provides commentary on the overall Scottish Budget. The Commission may also at any time produce forecasts, assumptions and projections in relation to any other fiscal factors it considers appropriate. The <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> also has a central role in the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework which determines funding for the Scottish Government.</p>

<p>The Treasury (<abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr>) is the UK Government’s economic and finance ministry, responsible for overall fiscal and macroeconomic policy, and policy costings. It is also responsible for the UK Government’s fiscal framework and responsible for meeting the fiscal rules as outlined in the Charter for Budget Responsibility.</p>

<h3>Purpose of this <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The arrangements set out in this document will support effective regular engagement and communication between <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> and <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> to facilitate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a better shared understanding of the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework and its effect on the Scottish Government’s funding</li>
  <li>improve <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> forecasts and commentary on Scottish fiscal issues</li>
  <li>ensuring <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> has access to required information on UK Government policy changes which affect devolved revenues or spending.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Principles</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> for engagement between the Commission and <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> is based on the following principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> recognises that the Commission is an independent, apolitical and impartial analytical organisation and understands its functions.</li>
  <li>Any data or information shared by <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> with the Commission, and any broader collaboration and engagement with the Commission, will only be used by the Commission in delivering its functions as set out in the Scottish Fiscal Commission Act 2016. It is not within the Commission’s functions to comment on <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> activities, publications or analysis or UK Government policy more generally. The Commission reserves the right to comment on 2 <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> publications and analysis in so far as they relate to the delivery of its functions.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> and the Commission are committed to operating an open and transparent approach to sharing relevant information.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> and the Commission will allow and encourage their officials to collaborate in a positive manner, maintaining effective communication.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Working relationships</h3>
<p>To facilitate collaboration <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> and the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> will regularly share lists of officials for staff working in relevant areas. Staff working in these areas will be made aware of this <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> and in particular the respective roles of the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> and <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> in these areas. They will also be made aware of each organisation’s work cycles in relation to the Scottish and UK budgets.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> is jointly owned by <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> and <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr>. The <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> will have designated signatories who will sign on behalf of the respective parties.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> and <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> will nominate main points of contact who will be responsible for ensuring efficient and effective communication between the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> and <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr>. There will be a contact in the <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> Devolution team and a contact in the Fiscal Statistics and Policy team.</p>

<p>The ongoing relationship between the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> and the <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> Devolution team will generally support engagement on matters relating to the Scottish Government’s funding arrangements.</p>

<p>The contact in the Fiscal Statistics and Policy team will be responsible for the process following UK fiscal events and ensuring the Scottish Fiscal Commission has access to the information required on UK Government policy changes affecting devolved revenues and spending.</p>

<h3>Roles in the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework</h3>

<p>Both <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> and the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> play central roles in the operation of the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework and are committed to working together to ensure smooth operation and clear communication of the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework.</p>

<p><abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> is responsible for the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework in the UK Government. <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> can approach <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> to ask questions about the implementation of the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework, and any agreements reached between the Scottish Government and <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr>’s forecasts of GDP can trigger a Scotland-specific economic shock. The <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> is responsible for notifying <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> when a shock is triggered by its forecasts and will inform the Devolution team in <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> no less than 48-72 hours in advance of publication of its forecast.</p>

<p><abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> fiscal forecasts inform the operation of the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework and <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> officials can discuss the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> forecasts with <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> officials after publication of those forecasts.</p>

<h3>Support for the Scottish Fiscal Commission with other departments</h3>

<p><abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> are responsible for ensuring the relevant UK Government departments are aware of the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr>, their remit and responsibilities and that appropriate information-sharing arrangements are in place to enable the Scottish Fiscal Commission to undertake their responsibilities. These arrangements are supported by Memorandum’s of Understanding between the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr>, the DWP and HMRC.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p><abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> can call on the <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> point of contact to support engagement with other relevant parts of <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> and other UK departments, namely the DWP and HMRC. <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> will provide support identifying the correct individuals in those departments to speak to, and can support the Scottish Fiscal Commission in making requests for information held by those departments.</p>

<h3>Information sharing</h3>
<p>Under the 2016 agreement between the UK Government and Scottish Government on the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> should be given access to the data and information necessary to fulfilling of its statutory duties <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. The agreement specifies the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> should have access to the necessary data, information and models held by the UK Government to support policy development and produce forecasts of a comparable quality to those produced by the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR).</p>

<p>For the purposes of this <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> there is a distinction between personal data and information. Information is defined as any piece of documentation, statistical information, financial information, contracts and other information that does not contain personal data. Personal data would be considered as defined in Part 1 Section 3 of the Data Protection Act 2018 and Article 4.1 of the UK General Data Protection Regulations. Personal data will not be shared as part of this <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Information will relate to policy or analysis affecting social security benefits, tax revenues or wider public finances. Information shared will support <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> to carry out their statutory functions. This information can relate to Scottish specific data as well as UK, Great Britain or England &amp; Wales data.</p>

<h3>Handling of sensitive information and FOI</h3>
<p>Where information is shared between <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> and the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr>, the organisation which shares the information will make it clear at the time it is shared whether the information is considered by that organisation to be sensitive or restricted.</p>

<p>If a request is made to the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> for the disclosure of information received from <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr>, or that concerns <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> information which might be sensitive or exempt under FOI legislation, the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> will inform <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> before disclosing information in response to the request.</p>

<p>If a request is made to <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> for the disclosure of information received from <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr>, or that concerns <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> information which might be sensitive or exempt under FOI legislation, <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> will inform the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> before disclosing information in response to the request.</p>

<h3>Information on UK Government policy which affects Scottish Government tax revenues and social security spending</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> may require information on announced UK policy changes which have a material effect on Scottish devolved taxes and spending, in order to reflect the effects of these policy changes in their forecasts. <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> will support the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> to understand UK Government policy changes at UK fiscal events and the effects on Scottish Government revenues and spending. This includes changes to policies which affect the NSND income tax base and changes to social security benefits which are devolved but administered by DWP based on UK Government policy.</p>

<p>For each UK Government fiscal event a working group will be established by the Fiscal Statistics and Policy team in <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr>. This working group will consist of officials from the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr>, <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr>, OBR and relevant UK Government departments as needed (DWP and HMRC principally). Prior to the fiscal event <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> and the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> will agree the timing for the working group to meet. <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> recognise that the Scottish Budget can take place within three weeks of a UK fiscal event. Therefore the turnaround times for the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> to produce its forecasts can be very short. In the event that the Scottish Budget follows the UK fiscal event in three weeks the working group will meet within three working days after the UK fiscal event. If in the event that the Scottish Budget occurs more than three weeks following the UK fiscal event, the working will meet in no more than eight working days after the UK fiscal event.</p>

<p>Immediately following any UK fiscal event <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> will contact <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> to agree the UK Government policy changes on which the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> requires information. <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> will liaise with the relevant analysts and policy officials and agree attendance at the working group meeting. At the meeting it will be agreed whether any further pieces of information need to be shared, this may include data to support the costing or sections of policy costing notes provided to the OBR. Timelines for the return of any information requested following the meetings will be agreed by officials.</p>

<p>Separate meetings may be required for each policy change being discussed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> and <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> will not share policy information from either Government before the policies are publicly announced.</p>

<h3>Fact-checking</h3>
<p>Where <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> publications refer to UK Government funding arrangements or <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> policy, the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> will provide <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> with pre-release copies of relevant sections of its reports 5 working days in advance of publication. <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> will be invited to comment on the factual accuracy of the reports insofar as the content relates to the presentation of <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> information and the operation of the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework and return comments 3 working days in advance of publication.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> publications refer to <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> forecasts or operating arrangements, <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> will provide the <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> with pre-release copies of relevant sections of its reports 5 working days in advance of publication. The <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> will be invited to comment on the factual accuracy of the reports insofar as the content relates to the presentation of <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> forecasts and information and return comments 3 working days in advance of publication.</p>

<h3>Escalation process</h3>

<p>Both <abbr title="The Treasury">HMT</abbr> and <abbr title="Scottish Fiscal Commission">SFC</abbr> are committed to working together in an environment of mutual trust and respect and promoting a culture of openness. Should disputes arise, they should be resolved informally between the staff concerned and failing that through the points of contact. If issues cannot be resolved through the points of contact or their line management chain, in exceptional cases due to the seriousness of the issue or because prompt senior management action is required, either organisation may approach the signatories of this <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> or their successors.</p>

<h3>Further revisions</h3>
<p>This <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> may be varied by mutual written agreement of each party at any time. Variations to this <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> will be agreed by each party in writing and form an amendment to this <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr>. 32.The upcoming review of the Scottish Government’s fiscal framework may require revisions to this <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr>. This <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> will be formally reviewed no later than six months after the conclusion of that review. If revisions are required these will be agreed by both parties and a revised <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> will be published.</p>
