<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>As part of the Withdrawal Agreement signed with the EU, UK nationals may need to apply for residence status in the EU country where they live. The UK has also concluded the Separation Agreement with EEA EFTA states, and UK nationals may also need to apply for residence in these countries. The UK Nationals Support Fund (UKNSF) was launched in March 2020 to provide practical support to those UK nationals that may need additional help when applying for residency. This support is being delivered through 8 implementing partners across several EU and EFTA Member States. Funding to support this work is managed through the International Programme.</p>

<h2>Objectives on UK Nationals Support Fund</h2>

<ul>
  <li>to protect the citizens’ rights of UK nationals under the Withdrawal and Separation Agreements who are resident in EU/EFTA member states as at the end of the transition period</li>
  <li>to provide practical support to UK nationals that need additional help when applying for residency in the EU/EFTA country where they live. This may include pensioners, disabled people and people living in remote areas. The support may consist of providing guidance on the documents needed to support an application, how the application process works, and if necessary, support where there are language barriers or difficulty accessing online information and services</li>
  <li>to ensure that the Fund operates with a suitable geographical coverage across EU/EFTA states</li>
  <li>to ensure that support is inclusive and delivered to meet the diverse needs of a diverse UK national population</li>
  <li>to complement outreach activities and support for UK nationals provided by our network of Embassies, Consulates and High Commissions across Europe</li>
  <li>to complement the support services put in place by Member States themselves</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official Development Assistance (ODA) and the UK Nationals Support Fund</h2>

<p>The UKNSF is entirely non-ODA funded.</p>

<h2>UK Nationals Support Fund during FY 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>The UKNSF ran for the whole of financial year 2020 to 2021 with a total spend of £2.3m. During this period the implementing organisations provided direct support to 14,109 UK nationals in 13 European countries.</p>

<h2>UK Nationals Support Fund Allocation for FY 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>The UKNSF budget for 2021 to 2022 is £1.25m, allocated on a grant basis to 8 implementing partners. The Fund will close at different times in the countries where it operates depending on demand, and the date that countries close their residency application systems for Withdrawal and Separation Agreement applicants. The Fund will close in all countries by 31 March 2022.</p>
