<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>
<p>As set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-overseas-territories">UK’s Overseas Territories White Paper</a>, the UK has specific constitutional and legal responsibilities for its 14 Overseas Territories. This includes a responsibility to ensure their security and good governance, which we work on through a partnership approach based on shared values and a right to self-determination. As part of this work, and in support of our strategic objectives, the FCDO is working to develop good governance, robust public financial management, sound economic planning, and effective crisis preparedness. Core departmental funding to support this work is managed through the International Programme.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Objectives on Overseas Territories</h2>

<p>In the White Paper, the Government set out its strategy for working with its Overseas Territories. This focused on 3 practical policy goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to strengthen the engagement and interaction between the UK and the Territories</li>
  <li>to work with the Territories to strengthen good governance arrangements, public financial management and economic planning, where this is necessary</li>
  <li>to improve the quality and range of support available to the Territories</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of this work, and specifically in support of goal 2, the FCDO, working with the Overseas Territories, and with cross-Whitehall partners, seeks to improve security and governance standards and support the rule of law in the Overseas Territories governments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Overseas Territories</h2>

<p>The International Programme’s work in the Overseas Territories (OT) is funded by a blend of Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) and non-ODA funds. The ODA contribution is limited to ODA-eligible activities in the 4 ODA-eligible Territories i.e. Montserrat, St Helena, Tristan da Cunha, and the Pitcairn Islands. ODA funded work there ensures their governments can provide effective public services to their citizens as efficiently as possible. It helps us to work in cooperation with the 4 Overseas Territories governments to: reduce their dependency due to their remote locations, strengthen their economies, and support them to upskill their workforce to fill critical roles.</p>

<p>All 4 OTs are also vulnerable to financial instability and natural disasters. ODA helps ensure physical access to the islands and essential services such as health and social care, education, transport and policing, as well as support for vulnerable people including the elderly, low-earners, physically and mentally disabled people, and children at risk of harm. This helps us contribute to advancement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in these 4 Territories.</p>

<p>Concerning natural disasters, the main threats to the Territories are hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis. There is also a risk of man-made disasters, in particular air and sea accidents and environmental disasters such as oil spills. As such, support to Montserrat, St Helena, and Tristan da Cunha in their disaster preparedness is necessary to ensure they can respond well in the event of a crisis or natural disaster.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Overseas Territories Project Objectives for FY 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>The FCDO programme this year has concentrated primarily on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting environmental protection, including sustainable marine management</li>
  <li>promotion good governance and sustainable economic development</li>
  <li>upholding UK sovereignty and meeting international obligations</li>
  <li>increasing capacity so that the Overseas Territories are better able to respond to, and recover from, a crisis or natural disaster</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Overseas Territories Programme during FY 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>In financial year 2020 to 2021, the International Programme ODA spend was predominantly focussed on supporting environmental protection. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Blue Belt programme supports the UK Overseas Territories to enhance marine protection and sustainable management. In 2020, Tristan da Cunha designated the largest marine protection zone in the Atlantic, meaning that the Blue Belt programme had reached its target to protect 4 million km2 of ocean around the UK OTs</li>
  <li>the programme conducts satellite surveillance across the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in place around Pitcairn, St Helena and Tristan da Cunha, to guard against illegal, unregulated or unreported fishing and other environmental activities. The programme has also assisted Overseas Territories to put in place MPA management plans, and helped to draft legislation to underpin the MPAs’ protection for the future</li>
  <li>The Blue Belt programme has also supported the deployment of baited remote underwater video cameras (BRUVs) in Pitcairn, St Helena, Tristan da Cunha and Montserrat as part of the UK-Overseas Territory Global Ocean Wildlife Analysis Network, to assess the health of fish and shark populations around these Overseas Territories</li>
  <li>The International Programme also continued to support the Montserrat Scientific Advisory Committee, which oversees the work of the Montserrat Volcano Observatory and annually reviews volcanic activity to assess risks and hazards on island</li>
  <li>The International Programme has also helped to strengthen Montserrat’s Disaster Management and Coordination Agency (DMCA), as well as bolstering its general hurricane resilience. The programme has funded new equipment such as extra drone batteries to enhance search and rescue capabilities</li>
  <li>in St Helena and Tristan da Cunha, International Programme funding has enabled the installation of early weather warning systems, to ensure the territory is given ample time to prepare for incoming storms</li>
  <li>ongoing annual support for the cover of satellite phone airtime for emergency use</li>
</ul>
