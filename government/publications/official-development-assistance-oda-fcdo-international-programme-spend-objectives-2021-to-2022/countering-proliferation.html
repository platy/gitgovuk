<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The government’s approach to counter proliferation is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=FCDO&amp;utm_campaign=IntegratedReview">2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (IR)</a>. This highlights the Government’s vision for the UK’s role in the world over the next decade and the actions it will take to 2025. UK action is also underpinned by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/510716/National_Counter_Proliferation_Strategy_to_2020_-_updated_24_March.pdf">National Counter Proliferation Strategy (NCPS)</a>. The counter-proliferation programme supports these goals by improving international implementation of the obligations set out in the major treaties, conventions and regimes which seek to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the illicit transfer of conventional weapons. A significant part of this effort involves assistance to countries – in taking the necessary steps to sign, ratify or join the counter proliferation treaties and regimes, and to develop national legislation and capacity to implement those obligations. Delivery of objectives is underpinned by financial resources provided by the CSSF and IPF.</p>

<h2>Objectives on Countering Proliferation</h2>

<p>The Integrated Review states that counter proliferation is integral to the UK’s security and prosperity. It helps to maintain regional and global stability, reduces threats to our citizens and armed forces, facilitates safe trade for our industry and protects high-skilled jobs across the UK. Our successes in the past 5 years - including the response to Russia’s Salisbury attack and the attribution of chemical weapons use in Syria - have contributed to our global reputation as a force for good and a science and technology power.</p>

<p>To protect these gains, we must: address growing threats from states such as Iran, Russia and North Korea; respond to emerging threats such as the illicit acquisition of advanced and dual-use technologies; and reinforce the global counter-proliferation architecture against growing pressures, shaping its future in our interest.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counter-terrorism-strategy-contest-2018">Counter Terrorism Strategy 2018</a> (CONTEST) includes the following objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>influencing intent: encourage all states to adhere to norms on the possession and use of particular weapons, and to demonstrate the consequences of breaching those norms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>controlling access: control access to materials and knowledge globally to make it as hard as possible for states or terrorists to acquire or develop capabilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disrupting networks: disrupt illicit attempts to circumvent controls</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the UK’s Integrated Review highlights 2 proliferation risks which may become even more likely and/or impactful over the longer-term:</p>

<p>It is likely that a terrorist group will launch a successful CBRN attack by 2030.</p>

<ul>
  <li>proliferation of CBRN weapons, advanced conventional weapons and novel military technologies will increase the risk and intensity of conflict and pose significant challenges to strategic stability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Countering Proliferation</h2>

<p>The FCDO’s countering proliferation programme did not receive any ODA funds in Financial Year 2021 to 2022. In the previous years the programme was funded by a blend of ODA and non-ODA funds. ODA scoring within the programme was limited to ODA-eligible activities in DAC-listed countries. Activities funded by this programme supported the security, prosperity and development of ODA-eligible countries in various ways, including through activities which strengthened global rules and institutions supporting international peace and security which ODA-eligible countries rely on in order to develop. Assistance also helped developing countries use science and technology for permitted peaceful purposes to aid their development.</p>

<p>Counter-proliferation is a part of any country’s national security. Activity such as promoting robust export controls prevents the unregulated transfers of conventional arms and dual use goods which can feed instability and conflict in poorer countries. To that end, we are working to strengthen security; improve law enforcement cooperation e.g. in sub-Saharan Africa. Establishing and maintaining rules and laws to counter the proliferation of CBRN allows developing economies to benefit from the peaceful uses of these technologies, while ensuring that the technologies do not fall into the hands of terrorists or criminals.</p>

<h2>Counter Proliferation project objectives for financial year 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>The financial year 2021 to 2022 programme is focused on 3 key themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>counter-proliferation norms and treaties function effectively by enhancing efforts to uphold, preserve and strengthen the Rules Based International System</li>
  <li>states’ increased adherence to international security regimes and treaties; to promote UK values, influence and soft power to address shared proliferation challenges</li>
  <li>access control: control access to materials and knowledge globally to make it as hard as possible for states or terrorists to acquire or develop capabilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Geographical Coverage of Countering Proliferation Programme during financial year 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>This programme’s work is conducted through a multilateral regimes, such as the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and the Convention on Cluster Munitions; and non-governmental organisations with expertise in counter-proliferation issues. We work closely with such partners to deliver impact across a wide range of geographical areas where there is a need to support counter-proliferation efforts.</p>

<h2>Countering Proliferation Programme during financial year 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>Past successes under this programme have included support to international investigations into chemical weapons use in Syria and help to prospective and new members of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) to improve their arms control systems so that they meet the Treaty’s obligations.</p>

<p>Notable ODA successes in financial year 2020 to 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting the Ammunition Management Advisory Team at the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining to develop a training programme to support the development and implementation of national standards, strategies and procedures in line with International Ammunition Technical Guidelines, with the ultimate aim of avoiding future humanitarian disaster</li>
  <li>supporting the Implementation Support Unit of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention to implement key outputs, such as the 19th Meeting of States Parties, to advance the Convention and UK government’s goal of a mine-free world by 2025</li>
  <li>supporting the Implementation Support Unit of the Convention on Cluster Munitions to develop reference material to help States Parties with reporting obligations in support of Convention objectives</li>
</ul>
