<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Human rights violations, abuses, and the absence of the rule of law lead to unstable and less prosperous societies. They create a world where the safety of all individuals, including British citizens, is at greater risk.</p>

<p>The struggle to protect, promote, and strengthen human rights is real and constant. The inadequate protection of human rights creates a cycle of insecurity, instability, and poverty. Human rights are more than just principles enshrined in international law. They are the bedrock of successful and progressive societies. Countries where human rights are respected, including those with a strong record on gender equality, tend to be more prosperous, democratic, and stable. Corruption is less likely to take root, and extremism is less likely to find fertile ground. That is why safeguarding, promoting, and defending human rights is an integral part of our work.</p>

<p>The FCDO works to tackle the root causes of human rights violations and abuses, strengthen institutions and governance, promote and protect human rights, and support democracy and the rule of law. The principal funding vehicle for the FCDO’s human rights work is through the International Programme. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the pressures on human rights, and the UK has continued its support to deliver objectives through difficult global circumstances.</p>

<h2>Objectives on Supporting Open Societies and Human Rights</h2>

<p>The UK promotes and defends the full range of universal human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. The UK strongly encourages all States to abide by and fulfil their obligations under international law. FCDO human rights objectives currently place a particular emphasis on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working closely with domestic and international partners to drive the international effort to combat modern slavery and ensure that this effort is recognised as a global moral imperative</li>
  <li>standing up for the freedom of people of any or no religion to practise their beliefs in peace and safety, including preparations for the freedom of religion or belief conference in London in July 2022</li>
  <li>supporting the right of human rights defenders to carry out their work, and be able to voice their opinions freely and safely</li>
  <li>promoting the development and strengthening of democracy</li>
  <li>opposing the death penalty and the use of torture as a matter of principle, in all circumstances</li>
  <li>continuing the UK’s&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;to&nbsp;defend and support media freedom internationally, building on commitments made at the 2019 global conference.</li>
  <li>working with Commonwealth countries across a range of human rights issues, including work to strengthen National Human Rights Institutions</li>
  <li>supporting the International Criminal Court and other tribunals involved in global efforts to end impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern</li>
  <li>working with international partners, business and civil society, to support and promote responsible practice&nbsp;in the global extractives sector and by the domestic and international private security sector, to reduce and prevent conflict and protect human rights</li>
  <li>strengthen the core functions of human rights institutions in Europe, defending them from dilution or malign activity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Supporting Open Societies and Human Rights</h2>

<p>This programme strand is a blend of ODA and non-ODA. ODA scoring within this programme is limited to ODA-eligible countries. The majority of the 31 Human Rights Priority Countries identified in the FCDO’s Annual Human Rights Report are eligible to receive ODA funding. Additionally, we also support multilateral organisations with ODA funding.</p>

<p>The Open Societies and Human Rights Directorate (OSHRD) seeks to promote and support a world in which open, resilient, and inclusive societies, with strong democratic foundations, effective civil society organisations and respect for human rights, flourish, and no one is left behind. The importance of Open Societies and Human Rights features prominently in the recent Integrated Review. The OSHRD programme portfolio includes UK development investments in democracy and democratic governance, media freedom, anti-corruption, tackling illicit finance globally and managing our strategic relationships with Commonwealth institutions and the UK civil society organisations in developing countries.</p>

<p>This programme complements the FCDO’s wider work in support of open societies and human rights, including projects under the cross-government Conflict, Stability and Security Fund.</p>

<h2>Supporting Open Societies and Human Rights Objectives for FY 2021 to 22</h2>

<p>This programme supports the FCDO’s strategic objective to project our global influence and promote a network of liberty. It also helps to advance the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions). Projects cover a wide range of themes, reflecting the newly formed Open Societies and Human Rights Directorate in the FCDO. This Directorate works to build the network of liberty and advance the frontiers of freedom. Policy areas previously covered by this programme, namely the Rules-Based International System, Women Peace and Security and Gender Equality are now funded through different programme streams to reflect the makeup of the FCDO Directorate structure.</p>

<h2>Supporting Human Rights, Democracy, and the Rules-Based International System Programme during FY 2020/21</h2>

<p>In 2020 to 2021, the programme supported projects across the range of themes. The FCDO publishes an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/human-rights-and-democracy-report-2020/human-rights-and-democracy-2020-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-report">Annual Human Rights report</a>, including delivery through policy programmes.</p>

<h2>Support Open Societies and Human Rights Programme Allocation for FY 2021 to 22</h2>

<p>The ODA allocation for 2021 to 22 for the human rights programme was £4,625,026. This amount was agreed as part of the one-year FCDO spending review, completed in early 2021.</p>
