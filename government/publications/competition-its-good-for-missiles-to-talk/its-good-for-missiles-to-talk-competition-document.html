<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-and-security-accelerator">Defence and Security Accelerator</a> (DASA) competition, run on behalf of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory">Defence Science and Technology Laboratory</a> (Dstl), aims to identify and develop novel technologies that could be exploited in the development of a new category of missile – cooperative missiles.</p>

<p>Cooperative missiles can communicate with each other, share situational awareness and organise themselves to ‘work together’ efficiently to achieve a common objective. The aim of the work is to investigate how inter-missile communication and cooperative behaviours can be technically achieved to solve UK military challenges.</p>

<p>It is envisioned that by working together, cooperative missiles will offer the UK armed forces far more capability in the future than they have today. There are many benefits of enabling cooperation between missiles. For example, when considering collateral damage during missions or the live updating of safety data within missions if non-combatants enter the battlefield post-launch. This information could be shared by cooperative missiles to ensure an abort function is carried out live during a mission, under human operator authority.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the operation of UK missile systems will always remain under human control and we are only interested in technologies that could enable cooperation between missiles within this context.</p>

<p>This DASA competition seeks ideas for the early development of technologies to underpin the future or ‘Generation After Next’ of UK missile systems. It will inform future discussions on how Generation After Next technologies associated with cooperative missiles could be exploited within Defence. Successful submissions will identify and increase the maturity of novel technologies to enable exploitation in future cooperative missiles.</p>

<p>We encourage proposals where the innovation starts at a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance#what-dasa-funds">Technology Readiness Level</a> (TRL) of approximately 2-3. By the end of the project, we expect the innovation to be sufficiently developed to achieve approximately TRL 4-5.</p>

<p>Successful proposals will present credible plans for progressing new, advanced technologies which could underpin a future cooperative missile.</p>

<h4>Cooperative Missile Project</h4>

<p>This DASA competition is funded by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy">Integrated Review</a>. It forms part of the Cooperative Missile Project managed under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mod-science-and-technology-strategy-2020">MOD’s Science &amp; Technology</a> (S&amp;T) Programme. Further information about the Cooperative Missile Project can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAgM9cIYKmU" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>DASA projects taken into the Cooperative Missile Project for exploitation (subject to agreement between all parties) will require successful bidders to collaborate with defence strategic suppliers; however, there is no requirement for proposals funded through this phase of the competition to follow this route to market. Suppliers are encouraged to consider how they might work with defence strategic partners to exploit their innovation in the future.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Competition key information</h2>

<h4>Submission deadline</h4>

<p>Midday on 2 August 2022 (BST)</p>

<h4>Total funding available</h4>

<p>The total funding available for Phase 1 of this competition is £800K (ex VAT). This is expected to fund multiple proposals between £100k to £200k (ex VAT) over a maximum project duration of 6 months. We are looking to fund bids at a relatively low TRL, starting at approximately TRL 2-3 for development up to approximately TRL 4-5.</p>

<p>Further funding may be made available for a second phase to develop higher TRL technologies. We would aim to launch Phase 2 on completion of the Phase 1 contracts.</p>

<p>The results or deliverables from Phase 1 projects may be shared under appropriate confidentiality arrangements with defence strategic suppliers to help formulate Phase 2 of the competition. Within this second phase, innovators will be strongly encouraged to collaborate with defence strategic suppliers, however it is not required to collaborate with defence strategic suppliers in Phase 1.</p>

<p>Success in Phase 1 will not be a pre-requisite for applying to Phase 2.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Competition Scope</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Background: Why are we interested in cooperative missiles?</h3>

<p>The development of cooperative missiles for future UK missile systems is a novel and key challenge that Defence is actively seeking to solve.</p>

<p>Currently, we seek to overmatch the capability of potential adversaries by improving the performance of individual missiles. For example, through use of a more sophisticated seeker or navigation system. With the cooperative approach, performance improvements can be achieved through leveraging networked technologies. This approach has disruptive potential as the sub-systems used may be comparatively less complex but, when they ‘work together’, they are greater than the sum of their parts.</p>

<p>This DASA competition seeks to fund hardware, software and system innovations that could underpin a future cooperative missile system.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Scope: The operating environment</h3>

<p>The operating environment for cooperative missiles will be highly complex. Adversaries will be well defended and the threat they pose will push our launch platforms and supporting assets further away from the area of engagement. The target may be partially or fully concealed and is likely to be surrounded by buildings, trees and vegetation, which can make identification more challenging. There will be uncertainty in the scene as well as changing conditions, including metrological variation. GNSS will be degraded if not denied. It is this complexity that drives the need for introducing cooperation between missile systems.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/152346/Strike_Challenges_01_Resized.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>The complex scene pictured above depicts an operating environment that may be common to other military capabilities, but its application to missile systems faces unique challenges. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>missile flight durations are relatively short (in the order 10s to 1000s of seconds) and thus time is limited to share situational awareness data</li>
  <li>missiles fly faster than aircraft and their high velocity causes frictional heating and significant vibration, which can affect sub-system performance</li>
  <li>missiles typically, but not always, fly at a low level. This limits the seeker’s view of the target area and communications between missiles can be degraded by buildings or other objects</li>
  <li>missile subsystems are size, weight and power limited</li>
  <li>the above factors all limit the bandwidth and latency of missile to missile communications</li>
  <li>missile to missile communications are typically limited by bandwidth due to size, directionality, power, environment etc.</li>
  <li>missiles can only be used for one mission and hence sub-systems are typically much lower cost (and performance) compared to military aircraft</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Competition challenges</h2>

<p>This competition has 4 challenges.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Challenge 1: Distributed target detection and identification</h3>

<p>The seeker is the part of the missile that detects, recognises and identifies the target. It ensures that the missile tracks the target and guides it until impact, and is often the most complex and expensive part of the missile. Increases in performance such as detecting targets at longer range require ever more sophisticated seekers, which drives up costs. Using multiple seekers in a cooperative fashion offers an alternative way to improve performance.</p>

<p>This challenge is looking for novel ways to detect, recognise and identify intended targets using multiple missile sensors distributed over a cooperative group. Static and moving targets should be considered in the operational context of a complex scene, including clutter. For this competition we are interested in visual band, infrared band and radio frequency (RF) band (Active or Passive) seekers. Proposals should consider how they would quantify the benefit of their proposed innovation compared to a single sensor.</p>

<p>Particular areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>combining sensor data to build a shared image of the target area, with multiple missiles potentially approaching the target from different directions</li>
  <li>increasing detection and identification range though use of multiple, distributed lower cost sensors</li>
  <li>improving the accuracy of target tracking in a complex scene by combining data from multiple sources. By combining sensor data, cooperative missiles could be made more robust against camouflage, concealment and deception</li>
  <li>approaches to the above with homogenous and/or heterogeneous arrays of sensors</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Challenge 2: Data processing onboard and between missiles</h3>

<p>Many cooperative functions, e.g. sensing or navigation, are likely to be computationally expensive and require inputs from many different systems. This challenge is concerned with the processing of large quantities of data across cooperative missile networks for particular missions.</p>

<p>Ideas that will help solve this challenge area may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>distributed processing in a missile environment. Distributed processing refers to computer systems that use processing spread over different sites, in this cases multiple missiles</li>
  <li>distributed database systems within a cooperative missile network</li>
  <li>edge processing – this is an alternative and complimentary technique where processing, analysing and storing data is performed at the point of generation to enable rapid, near real-time analysis</li>
  <li>transmission of data within a limited bandwidth cooperative missile network. Consideration should be given to the need for secure and robust data flows</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Challenge 3: Enhanced navigation through cooperation</h3>

<p>Global Navigation Satellite Services (GNSS) are likely to be unavailable or severely degraded in the operational environment of cooperative missile networks, making navigation more challenging. The distribution of sensors offers a potential solution. For this challenge, we are interested in applications of novel alternative navigation (AltNav) technologies and distributed navigation sensors.</p>

<p>Particular areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use of multiple low cost Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) across the cooperative missile network to improve group navigation</li>
  <li>use of multiple GNSS feeds across the cooperative missile network when some are jammed or degraded to improve group navigation</li>
  <li>geolocation using diverse technologies that are distributed across the cooperative missile network</li>
  <li>synchronisation of timing information within the cooperative missile network</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Challenge 4: Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>

<p>The application of AI has been explored for use in non-distributed missile systems. This includes advancements in target recognition for missiles operating within human-machine teams. More recent advancements in AI provide further opportunities in the context of cooperation within distributed missile networks, enabling potentially novel applications for the Generation After Next of UK missile systems.</p>

<p>This is a general challenge to understand how advances in AI could be exploited in cooperative missile systems. Particular areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improving the robustness of limited bandwidth communications between the cooperative missile network</li>
  <li>optimising the searching of a scene across the distributed cooperative missile network</li>
  <li>target detection in the presence of obscurance (e.g. smoke or camouflage systems) across a distributed cooperative missile network</li>
  <li>target recognition and identification within the distributed cooperative missile network</li>
  <li>prioritisation and allocation of targets across the cooperative missile network</li>
  <li>execution and monitoring of tactical navigation in a dynamic environment within the cooperative missile network</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that the operation of UK missile systems will always remain under human control and we are only interested in technologies that could enable cooperation between missiles within this context.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>We are interested in…</h3>

<p>Novel ideas that ultimately bring benefit to end-users working in UK Defence and Security through integration into the Generation After Next of UK missile systems. Your proposal should include evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>solutions focused on one or more of the challenge areas listed above</li>
  <li>consideration of how low TRL technology demonstrators might transition to exploitable technologies and contribute to the future of cooperative missiles</li>
  <li>theoretical development, method of advancement or proof of concept research which demonstrates the potential for translation into practical demonstration in later phases</li>
  <li>an innovation or a creative approach, with ambition to deliver workable demonstrations of new concepts</li>
  <li>clear demonstration of how the proposed work applies to the defence context</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>We are not interested in…</h3>

<p>We are not interested in proposals that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remove human control from the operation of missile systems</li>
  <li>focus specifically and solely on development of the warhead, payload, propulsion or actuator sub systems and guidance and control algorithms within missile systems</li>
  <li>focus solely on new missile concepts</li>
  <li>constitute consultancy, paper-based studies or literature reviews which summarise the existing literature without any view of future innovation</li>
  <li>are unsolicited resubmissions of a previous DASA bid</li>
  <li>offer demonstrations of off-the-shelf products requiring no experimental development (unless applied in a novel way to one of the challenges)</li>
  <li>offer no real long-term prospect of integration into the Generation After Next of UK missile systems</li>
  <li>offer no real prospect of out-competing equivalent technologies</li>
  <li>utilise existing commercially restricted algorithms</li>
  <li>are from organisations not willing to co-operate with defence strategic suppliers in potential subsequent phases</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Accelerating and exploiting your innovation</h2>

<p>It is important that over the lifetime of DASA competitions, ideas are matured and accelerated towards appropriate end users to enhance capability. How long this takes will be dependent on the nature and starting point of the innovation. Early identification and appropriate engagement with potential end users during the competition and subsequent phases are essential in order to develop and implement an exploitation plan.</p>

<p>All proposals to DASA should articulate the expected development in technology maturity of the potential solution over the lifetime of the contract and how this relates to improved operational capability against the current known (or presumed) baseline. Your deliverables should be designed to evidence these aspects with the aim of making it as easy as possible for potential collaborators/stakeholders to identify the innovative elements of your proposal in order to consider routes for exploitation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>How to outline your exploitation plan</h3>

<p>A higher technology maturity is expected in subsequent phases. Include the following information to help the assessors understand your exploitation plans to date:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the intended defence or security users of your final product and whether you have previously engaged with them, their procurement arm or their research and development arm</li>
  <li>awareness of, and alignment to, any existing end user procurement programmes</li>
  <li>the anticipated benefits (for example, in cost, time, improved capability) that your solution will provide to the user</li>
  <li>whether it is likely to be a standalone product or integrated with other technologies or platforms</li>
  <li>expected additional work required beyond the end of the contract to develop an operationally deployable commercial product (for example, “scaling up” for manufacture, cyber security, integration with existing technologies, environmental operating conditions)</li>
  <li>additional future applications and wider markets for exploitation</li>
  <li>wider collaborations and networks you have already developed or any additional relationships you see as a requirement to support exploitation</li>
  <li>how your product could be tested in a representative environment in later phases</li>
  <li>any specific legal, ethical, commercial or regulatory considerations for exploitation</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Is your exploitation plan long term?</h3>

<p>Long term studies may not be able to articulate exploitation in great detail, but it should be clear that there is credible advantage to be gained from the technology development.</p>

<p>Include project specific information which will help exploitation. This competition is being carried out as part of a wider MOD programme and with cognisance of cross-Government initiatives. We may collaborate with organisations outside of the UK Government and this may provide the opportunity to carry out international trials and demonstrations in the future.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>What your proposal must include</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the proposal should focus on the Phase 1 requirements but must also include a brief (uncosted) outline of the next stages of work required for commercial exploitation</li>
  <li>when submitting a proposal, you must complete all sections of the online form, including an appropriate level of technical information to allow assessment of the bid and a completed finances section</li>
  <li>completed proposals must comply with the financial rules set for this competition. The upper-limit for this competition is £200k (ex VAT). Proposals will be rejected if the financial cost exceeds this capped level</li>
  <li>you must include a list of other current or recent government funding you may have received in this area if appropriate, making it clear how this proposal differs from this work</li>
  <li>a project plan with clear milestones and deliverables must be provided. Deliverables must be well defined and designed to provide evidence of progress against the project plan and the end-point for this phase; they must include a final report</li>
  <li>you should also plan for attendance at a kick-off meeting at the start of Phase 1, a mid-project event and an end of project event at the end of Phase 1, as well as regular reviews with the appointed Technical Partner and Project Manager; all meetings will be in the UK. Meetings may also take place virtually</li>
  <li>your proposal must demonstrate how you will complete all activities/services and provide all deliverables within the competition timescales (6 months). Proposals with any deliverables (including final report) outside the competition timeline will be rejected as non-compliant</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>What your resourcing plan should include</h3>

<p>Your resourcing plan must identify, where possible, the nationalities of proposed employees that you intend to work on this phase.</p>

<h4>If your proposal is recommended for funding</h4>

<p>In the event of a proposal being recommended for funding, the DASA reserves the right to undertake due diligence checks including the clearance of proposed employees. Please note that this process will take as long as necessary and could take up to 6 weeks in some cases for non-UK nationals.</p>

<p>You must identify any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-ethical-legal-and-regulatory-guidance">ethical / legal / regulatory factors</a> within your proposal and how the associated risks will be managed, including break points in the project if approvals are not received.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-ethical-legal-and-regulatory-guidance#mod-research-ethics-committee">MODREC</a> approvals can take up to 5 months therefore you should plan your work programme accordingly. If you are unsure if your proposal will need to apply for MODREC approval, then please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-ethical-legal-and-regulatory-guidance">MODREC Guidance</a> for Suppliers or contact your Innovation Partner for further guidance.</p>

<p>Requirements for access to Government Furnished Assets (GFA), for example, information, equipment, materials and facilities, may be included in your proposal. DASA cannot guarantee that GFA will be available. If you apply for GFA, you should include an alternative plan in case it is not available.</p>

<p><b>Failure to provide any of the above listed will automatically render your proposal non-compliant.</b></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Export control for overseas partners</h3>

<p>All relevant export control regulations will apply if a company ultimately wants to sell a developed solution to a foreign entity. All innovators must ensure that they can obtain, if required, the necessary export licences for their proposals and developments, such that they can be supplied to the UK and other countries. If you cannot confirm that you can gain the requisite licences, your proposal will be sifted out of the competition.</p>

<p>Additionally, if we believe that you will not be able to obtain export clearance, additional checks may be conducted, which may also result in your proposal being sifted out of the competition.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Cyber risk assessment</h3>

<h4>Supplier Assurance Questionnaire (SAQ)</h4>

<p>Innovators must complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=7WB3vlNZS0iuldChbfoJ5Tv4OR9pb0BHial1Ag-WKXVUOFk3Sk9SS0JDQ0FRWjhYNDhTVldHUDJaNy4u&amp;fswReload=1&amp;fswNavStart=1626433019393" rel="external">Supplier Assurance Questionnaire (SAQ)</a>, using the DASA Risk Assessment Reference (RAR) for this competition: <b>RAR-549009228</b> and answer questions for risk level “very low”.</p>

<p>DASA has completed a Cyber Risk Assessment (CRA) for this competition. In order to submit to this competition innovators are required to work towards cyber resilience. If selected for funding, the innovator must prove cyber resilience before a contract will be awarded.</p>

<h4>Defence Cyber Protection Partnership</h4>

<p>The Defence Cyber Protection Partnership (DCPP) will review your SAQ submission and respond with a reference number within 2 working days. <b>The completed SAQ form and resulting email response from DCPP must be downloaded and included within the DASA submission service portal when the proposal is submitted.</b> Please allow enough time to receive the SAQ reference number prior to competition close at midday on 02 August 2022 (BST).</p>

<p>If the proposal is being funded, the SAQ will be evaluated against the CRA for the competition, and it will be put it into one of the following categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>compliant – no further action</li>
  <li>not compliant – if successful in competition and being funded, the innovator will be required to complete a Cyber Implementation Plan (CIP) before the contract is placed, which will need to be reviewed and agreed with the relevant project manager</li>
</ol>

<p>Innovators can enter a proposal without all controls in place, but are expected to have all the cyber protection measures necessary to fulfil the requirements of the contract in place at the time of contract award, or have an agreed Cyber Implementation Plan (CIP).</p>

<p>The CIP provides evidence as to how and when potential innovators will achieve compliance. Provided the measures proposed in the Cyber Implementation Plan do not pose an unacceptable risk to the MOD, a submission with a Cyber Implementation Plan will be considered alongside those who can achieve the controls.</p>

<p>A final check will be made to ensure cyber resilience before the contract is placed. Commercial staff cannot progress without it. This process does not replace any contract specific security requirements.</p>

<p>Further guidance for completing this process can be requested by emailing the DASA Help Centre: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accelerator@dstl.gov.uk">accelerator@dstl.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>Public facing information</h3>

<p><b> When submitting your proposal, you will be required to include a title and a short abstract. The title and abstract you provide will be used by DASA, and other government departments, to describe your project and its intended outcomes and benefits. They may be included at DASA events in relation to this competition and in documentation such as brochures. The proposal title will be published in the DASA transparency data on GOV.UK, along with your company name, the amount of funding, and the start and end dates of your contract. As this information can be shared, it should not contain information that may compromise Intellectual property. </b></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span>How your proposal will be assessed</h3>

<p>At Stage 1, all proposals will be checked for compliance with the competition document and may be rejected before full assessment if they do not comply. Only those proposals that demonstrate compliance against the competition scope and DASA mandatory criteria will be taken forward to full assessment.</p>

<p>Proposals that pass Stage 1 will then be assessed against the standard <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-how-your-proposal-is-assessed">DASA assessment criteria</a> (Desirability, Feasibility and Viability) by subject matter experts from the MOD (including Dstl), other government departments and the front-line military commands. You will not have the opportunity to view or comment on assessors’ recommendations.</p>

<p>DASA reserves the right to disclose on a confidential basis any information it receives from innovators during the procurement process (including information identified by the innovator as Commercially Sensitive Information in accordance with the provisions of this competition) to any third party engaged by DASA for the specific purpose of evaluating or assisting DASA in the evaluation of the innovator’s proposal. In providing such information the innovator consents to such disclosure. Appropriate confidentiality agreements will be put in place.</p>

<p>Further guidance on how your proposal is assessed is available on the DASA website <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-how-your-proposal-is-assessed">here</a>.</p>

<p>After assessment, proposals will be discussed internally at a Decision Conference where, based on the assessments, budget and wider strategic considerations, a decision will be made on the proposals that are recommended for funding.</p>

<h4>Innovators are not permitted to attend the Decision Conference.</h4>

<p>Proposals that are unsuccessful will receive brief feedback after the Decision Conference.</p>

<h3>
