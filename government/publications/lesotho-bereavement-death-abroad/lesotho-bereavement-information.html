<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, nor is it to be taken as a substitute for independent legal advice. Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information. Some of the information may not be relevant to your circumstances. The language used is intended to be general and factual and is not meant to cause offence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>When a relative or friend dies abroad, the different procedures, laws or language can cause additional distress. You may be uncertain about what to do or who to contact.</p>

<p>This country specific information is designed to help you through some of the practical arrangements you may need to make. It supplements the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">general information on death abroad</a> produced by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, which applies to all countries.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note, as each country has its own laws and customs when a death occurs, it may not be possible to make the arrangements that you prefer, or at the time you would like.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How to contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office</h2>

<p>There is a lot of information below, but you may have questions. You can speak to someone by phone 24/7, any day of the year by contacting the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London on 0207 008 5000.</p>

<p>If you are not in the UK, you can find the contact details of the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>

<p>The priority of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office is to provide assistance to British nationals overseas who need the most help. The level and type of assistance they can offer is tailored to the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Next of kin</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who died will usually need to make decisions and practical arrangements.</p>

<p>If you are not the next of kin, they will need to be informed. If required, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office can help you do this.</p>

<p>There is no legal definition of next of kin in the UK. Please note that if there is a disagreement over who is the next of kin, or the person who died did not choose a next of kin, this can cause additional complications.</p>

<p>In Lesotho, the next of kin may be the spouse, a parent, an immediate family member or any person with a power of attorney. Same-sex marriages and civil unions are not recognised in Lesotho.</p>

<p>If the Lesotho Mounted Police Service (LMPS) is unable to locate the next of kin, we have been informed that they may contact the British High Commission Maseru. If they contact us, we will do our best to inform the next of kin of the death as soon as we can.</p>

<p>If it is not possible for the next of kin to travel to Lesotho in order to handle arrangements, they may appoint another person to act on their behalf. This will require a letter from the next of kin authorising the third party to act on their behalf. You should include certified copies of valid identification documents for all parties.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Release of information to next of kin</h3>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will try to obtain as much information as possible after your relative or friend has died abroad. Some of this may be only available to next of kin. Consular officers may be able to obtain this themselves, or they may put you in touch directly with the authorities overseas. They may be able to provide you with details of others who can advocate on your behalf such as lawyers, charities, or other organisations.</p>

<p>In Lesotho, there are no laws preventing the next of kin or the High Commission from requesting information from the authorities. The appointed funeral director will usually keep the next of kin informed of any developments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Insurance</h2>

<p>It is very important to check if the person who died had insurance. If they had insurance, contact the insurance company as soon as possible. They may have a list of approved funeral directors to help you make arrangements, or be able to cover some of the costs.</p>

<p>Most funeral directors are willing to work directly with international insurance providers to carry out the wishes of the next of kin.</p>

<p>If the person who died did not have insurance, the next of kin will usually have to appoint a funeral director and will usually be responsible for all costs. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot help with these costs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Appointing a funeral director</h2>

<p>If you decide to bring the deceased to the UK for the funeral or cremation, you may only need to appoint an international funeral director. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office produces a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk">list of international funeral directors based in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>If you wish to hold a funeral in Lesotho, you can find a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lesotho-list-of-funeral-directors">Lesotho funeral directors here</a>.</p>

<p>If you wish to hold a cremation in South Africa, or repatriate the deceased to the UK, the body will need to travel to or via South Africa (more details below). A funeral director from either Lesotho or South Africa can be appointed to assist with your wishes. You can find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-funeral-directors-south-africa">list of funeral directors in South Africa here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Registering the death and obtaining a death certificate</h2>

<p>You will need to register the death with the local authorities in the country where the person died. The responsible authority in Lesotho is the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.homeaffairs.gov.ls/" rel="external">Ministry of Home Affairs</a>, National Identity and Civil Registry (NICR) department. The time period allowed for registering a death is one year. There is no fee for registration but penalties are charged for late registration.</p>

<p>You can register a death at the NICR office in the district where the death occurred. If you appoint a local funeral director to register the death on your behalf, you will be required to provide a letter of authorisation. When reporting a death you will need either the medical death certificate or police post mortem, identification of the reporter and the deceased. The informant will be required to complete Form D and will be interviewed by the Registration Officer. If the death was by unnatural causes, the cause of death will only be recorded once determined. Upon registration, the registrar will issue the death certificate and a burial permit (if applicable) in English.</p>

<p>You do not need to register the death with the UK authorities. The local death certificate can usually be used in the UK for most purposes, including probate.</p>

<p>You can sometimes apply for a consular death registration. This is not mandatory and cannot be used instead of a death certificate from the country where the person died. It is only available in some countries. If you wish to do this, you can [find more information on registering a death and apply online(http://www.gov.uk/register-a-death).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Post mortem examinations (autopsies)</h2>

<p>A post mortem is required where a person has died of unnatural causes in Lesotho. The decision to conduct a post-mortem is usually made by the Lesotho Mounted Police Service (LMPS).</p>

<p>The local authorities will need to be told if the person suffered from an infectious condition such as hepatitis or HIV so they can take precautions against infection.</p>

<p>The next of kin will be required to identify the body of the deceased. If the next of kin are unable to be present, they can send a letter of consent for another party to conduct the identification on their behalf.  If there is an investigation into the death of the deceased and where it is not possible to visually identify the body of deceased, the LMPS may conduct DNA or other identification tests using facilities outside of Lesotho.</p>

<p>If it is not possible to identify the deceased, the body may be kept at the mortuary for up to 3 months after which the state will approve the local burial. The burial may be further delayed whilst finalising burial preparations.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Health will appoint a state pathologist to conduct the post mortem examination. Forensic toxicology samples are sent to South Africa for processing, where there are often processing backlogs. The next of kin may request a copy of the initial post mortem report however toxicology reports may take up to three years to finalise.</p>

<p>The next of kin can also request a private post mortem, however the costs will be for their account.</p>

<p>The organs of the deceased are not retained after the post mortem examination. It is not possible to donate organs in Lesotho.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Mortuary facilities</h2>

<p>Lesotho mortuary facilities may not meet the same standard that you would experience in the UK. Mortuaries are usually attached to local hospitals and private funeral parlours, there are no dedicated state mortuary facilities. Private mortuary facilities are available throughout Lesotho and offer refrigerated units with standby generators. Mortuary services are free for expatriates.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Burial, cremation, repatriation</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who has died will usually need to decide between a local burial, cremation or bringing the person home, which is known as repatriation. Your funeral director will usually be able to explain the options available, the costs, and help you make arrangements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span>Burial</h3>

<p>It is possible for a foreign national to be buried in Lesotho. If the person that died has no formal ties to the country, approval should be obtained from the local municipality or Village Chief, in which the burial is intended. You will be asked to provide the reason for your request. The next of kin will be required to provide written consent for the burial to take place.</p>

<p>Lesotho law requires the remains to be embalmed within 3 days of death, or prior to a cross-border transfer.</p>

<p>The law governing the burial of COVID-19 deaths require burial of the deceased within 3 days. Foreign nationals may be provided with additional time to acquire the paperwork for repatriation, subject to any additional regulations by South Africa and the United Kingdom at the time of repatriation. Where it is not possible to repatriate the deceased’s body, arrangements will be made with the relevant local authorities to bury locally. The next of kin of the bereaved should consult their appointed funeral director for up to date information on COVID-19 related deaths.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span>Cremation</h3>

<p>Lesotho does not have cremation facilities anywhere in the country. Cremations are performed on request in facilities located in Bloemfontein, South Africa (a short drive from the capital of Lesotho, Maseru). This will be arranged by the local funeral director on request. The body of the deceased will be transported to South Africa by road. This will incur additional costs which you should confirm with the local funeral director beforehand.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span>Repatriation</h3>

<p>If a body needs to be repatriated from Lesotho, they must travel via South Africa. There are no airlines currently operating repatriation services from Lesotho. For repatriation to the UK, the deceased’s body is transported by hearse to Oliver Tambo International Airport, Johannesburg (in South Africa). From there the body can be repatriated by one of the many commercial airlines that operate between Johannesburg and the UK.</p>

<p>The Lesotho funeral director will make the necessary arrangements with an international, and possibly South African, funeral director, on behalf of the next of kin. This includes requesting a cross border permit from the South African authorities which may take up to 5 days to finalise once all paperwork is in order. The funeral director will request a supporting letter from the next of kin providing consent for cross-border transport to South Africa.</p>

<p>The body of the deceased must be embalmed within three days of death, and before transportation to South Africa. Caskets and containers are available which meet the requirements for repatriation from Lesotho. Once the body of the deceased is embalmed, it is placed in a hermetically sealed zinc coffin which is placed in a packing crate.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note if a local burial or cremation takes place, then an inquest in the UK will not be possible. For more information on inquests, see the information below on <a class="govuk-link" href="#uk-coroners">UK coroners and inquests</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If the next of kin cannot be traced or if they do not have the financial means to consider any of the above options, a pauper’s burial can be requested from the Government of Lesotho. You may make an application to the Ministry of Social Development to request assistance.

<span class="number">15. </span>UK coroners and inquests</h2>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to England and Wales, there may be an inquest. The decision on when to hold an inquest is made by Her Majesty’s Coroner. Please note, an inquest will usually only happen in certain situations, for example, when someone has died in suspicious, unnatural, and violent circumstances or whilst in detention. If the person who died is cremated and only their ashes are brought home, there will not be an inquest.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal may decide to call for a Fatal Accidents or Injuries Inquiry.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Northern Ireland, there will be no coronial inquest or further inquiry.</p>

<p>Please note, Procurators Fiscal and Coroners do not have jurisdiction in another country, nor do they seek to apportion blame to a named individual.</p>
