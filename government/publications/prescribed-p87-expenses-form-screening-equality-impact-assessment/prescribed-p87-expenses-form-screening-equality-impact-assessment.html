<h2>Project objectives</h2>

<p>The P87 expenses claim form will become a prescribed form in May 2022.</p>

<p>Regulations were laid 7 March 2022 to enable HMRC to prescribe the format of the form P87 from 7 May 2022.&nbsp; Many agents currently send P87 forms in their own format and moving to a&nbsp;prescribed standard P87 form will improve how we process claims.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-income-tax-relief-for-your-employment-expenses-p87">current P87 print and post&nbsp;form</a> is being revised to include multiple years and multiple employments.&nbsp;Standardising the form will improve the quality and efficiency in processing the P87 submissions. In addition, this form will contain a nomination which combined with the standard form will provide the most effective method of getting a claim processed through automation and reduce manual intervention.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Customer groups affected</h2>

<p>The customer groups affected are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>agents who currently use their own form design to submit claims for their customers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>individual claimants will still find the form on GOV.UK as they do now or use the iForm digital route available for individuals or phone to make a claim</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What customers will need to do</h2>

<h3>What customers need to do as a result of the change</h3>

<p>Individuals will access the form on GOV.UK as they did before, which was published on the 21 March 2022. They can also claim for expenses either through the digital iForm channel by following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-income-tax-relief-for-your-employment-expenses-p87">guidance</a> or they can contact HMRC by phone to receive a paper copy of form.</p>

<p>Agents will need to move away from bespoke expenses submission and use the prescribed P87 form from 7 May 2022.</p>

<h3>How customers will access this service</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-income-tax-relief-for-your-employment-expenses-p87">printable form</a> was published on 21 March 2022.</p>

<h3>When customers need to do this</h3>

<p>When they need to make a claim for expenses after the 7 May 2022.</p>

<h2>Assessing the impact</h2>

<p>We assessed the equality impacts on all the protected characteristic groups in line with the Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty; and Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act.</p>

<p>We assessed the equality impacts on all the protected characteristic groups in line with the Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty; and section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act: racial groups, disabled, sex, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, age, religion or belief, pregnancy and maternity, marriage and civil partnership, carers, political opinion (for Northern Ireland only), people who use different languages (Including Welsh Language and British Sign Language).</p>

<p>There is no evidence to suggest any specific impacts on those customers within any of the protected characteristic groups. A paper form will remain available. As before, extra support will be provided as required, including for those who are unable to interact digitally. Both the digital form and paper form will remain available in Welsh.</p>

<h3>Opportunities to promote equalities</h3>

<p>We have considered opportunities to promote equalities and good relations between people in each of the protected characteristic groups and those outside of that group. We have not identified any.</p>

<p>A full equality impact assessment is not recommended.</p>
