<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1). The Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations (<abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>) 2011 implemented the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) Defence and Security Procurement Directive  (the “Directive”)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> into United Kingdom (UK) law.  They came into force on 21 August 2011.</p>

<p>2). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> is ‘retained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law’ by virtue of section 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.  This means that the regulations will remain in place and continue to have effect after 31 December 2020 (Transition Period completion day) in the UK.</p>

<p>3). However, the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> has been amended by two Statutory Instruments to ensure the rules continues to operate effectively after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.  Those Statutory Instruments are: The Defence and Security Public Contracts (Amendment) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and The Defence and Security Public Contracts (Amendment) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. After 31 December 2020, the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> are national regulations which sit outside the Directive.</p>

<p>4).	Decisions made by the Court of Justice of the European Union (<abbr title="Court of Justice of the European Union">CJEU</abbr>) after 31 December 2020 will not be binding on UK domestic courts and tribunals. However, UK domestic courts and tribunals will, when interpreting and applying retained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law, be bound to follow judgments of the <abbr title="Court of Justice of the European Union">CJEU</abbr> and domestic courts that were passed before 31 December 2020, insofar as they apply to unmodified retained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law. This is known as retained case law.</p>

<p>5). The fact that retained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law such as the DSCPR has been modified does not of itself prevent it from being interpreted in accordance with retained case law – the Withdrawal Act provides that modified retained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law should still be interpreted in accordance with retained case law where that would seem to have been the legislative intention.</p>

<p>6). <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> exit issues rectified by the revised <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> are:</p>

<p>The definition of “economic operator”, a collective term for ‘contractor’, ‘supplier’ and ‘services providers’, has been amended so that it refers only to economic operators from the UK and Gibraltar.</p>

<p>References to the Official Journal of the European Union (<abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr>) for procurements launched after 31 December 2020 have been deleted and replaced with the new UK e-notification service. This is because the UK no longer has access to the <abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr> for procurements launched after 31 December. The UK e-notification service has now been developed and is to be known as the Find a Tender Service (<abbr title="Find a Tender Service">FTS</abbr>).  For procurements launched before 31 December 2020, please refer to paras 95-98 below on ‘Transitional Procurements’.</p>

<p>The effect of Article 346 has been preserved by writing it into the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> at regulation 6(3A) to 6(3C). Further information can be found in Chapter 4-Exemptions.</p>

<p>7). There are other less significant changes which are covered by the broader <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> guidance and are marked in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://aof.uwh.diif.r.mil.uk/aofcontent/tactical/toolkit/downloads/eudspcr/dspcr2011.pdf" rel="external">consolidated version of the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>8). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> applies to defence and sensitive security procurements by contracting authorities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> and utilities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> (the “procurers”) throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>9). The Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) is responsible for the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> including statistical reporting and amendments.  We work closely with the Cabinet Office, who are custodians of the UK Government’s public procurement policy and are responsible for the other  procurement regulations.</p>

<h2>What contracts are covered?</h2>

<p>10). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> covers specific contracts in the fields of defence and sensitive security for the procurement of:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	the supply of military equipment, including any parts, components or sub-assemblies of military equipment;   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	the supply of sensitive equipment, including any parts, components or sub-assemblies of sensitive equipment;    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	work<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>, works<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>, goods and services directly related to the equipment referred to in sub-paragraphs a. and b. for any and all elements of its life cycle;    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	work, works and services for specifically military purposes or sensitive work or works and sensitive services;
including the supply of specific tools, test facilities or support.  You can find full guidance on the scope of the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> in Chapter 2.</p>

<p>11). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> applies to all contracts within its scope which have a value<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> (exclusive of VAT) equal to or greater than:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	£378,660 for Goods and Services; and   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	£4,773,252 for Works.</p>

<p>12). You can find full guidance on financial thresholds in Chapter 3.</p>

<p>13). The Public Contracts Regulations (<abbr title="Public Contracts Regulations 2015">PCR</abbr>) 2015 and the Utilities Contract Regulations (<abbr title="Utility Contracts Regulation 2016">UCR</abbr>) 2016 and their equivalent Regulations in Scotland cover procurement of civil and non-sensitive security works, goods and services.</p>

<h2>What are our obligations to economic operators outside the UK and Gibraltar?</h2>

<p>14). One of the major changes under the 2019 amendment is the rights and remedies UK procurers are legally required to afford to economic operators outside the United Kingdom or Gibraltar.</p>

<p>15).	The definitions of “contractor”, “supplier” and “service provider” in regulation 3, which feed into the economic operator definition at regulation 5 have been amended so that they are geographically limited to the UK and Gibraltar.</p>

<p>16.).	Left unchanged, the original wording would mean UK industry would not have legal rights to participate in procurement opportunities or access to remedies in the UK market.  Moreover, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-27 industry would continue to enjoy the right to participate and have remedies in the UK market.</p>

<p>17).	Suppliers established outside the UK and Gibraltar are no longer economic operators as defined in the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>.  They do not have the right, under the DSCPR, to participate in a procurement procedure, and do not have access to the remedies in Part 9 (Applications to the court) of the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>. Suppliers in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-27 will now be treated the same as suppliers outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> were treated when the UK was an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member State.</p>

<p>18).	Details on the transitional arrangements for economic operators in procurements started before 31 December 2020 can be found at paragraphs 95-98.</p>

<p>19).	 This change does not mean that competition should be limited to UK industry only.  <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> policy is to use open competition as widely as possible to provide best value for money.  The Armed Forces benefit from the UK acquiring military capability from an open market, as open competition pushes innovation and efficiency in the market.</p>

<p>20). Procurers should be aware that where you seek and receive responses to an invitation to tender, an implied contract may come into existence, whereby the procurer agrees to consider all tenderers submitted on the basis of the terms set out in the tender.  This may benefit suppliers from outside the UK or Gibraltar whom you have allowed to participate in the procurement.  Alternatively, a public law claim (judicial review) may also be available to such suppliers.</p>

<h2>What are the main features of the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>?</h2>

<p>21). Procurement under the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> must follow the advertising rules for publishing on the Find a Tender service.  You must follow the correct procurement procedures and draft the necessary notices, tender and contract documents with care to ensure you give the correct information.</p>

<p>22). Unlike as provided by the <abbr title="Public Contracts Regulations 2015">PCR</abbr> 2015, the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> does not include the open procedure, dynamic purchasing systems or provisions relating to concession contracts.  Neither does it include the many simplified and modernised rules of the <abbr title="Public Contracts Regulations 2015">PCR</abbr> 2015.  It is important to be aware of this divergence and not assume that the rules are the same.  An overview of the main features of the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> is set out below.</p>

<h2>Advertising</h2>

<p>23). The Find a Tender service has replaced <abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr> in the amended <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> for all procurements launched after 31 December 2020.  If your procurement was launched prior to 31 December 2020 however, you will continue to post adverts on on the <abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr>, as your procurement is a ‘transitional procurement’  . Further details on transitional procurements can be found at paras 95-98.  Overall these changes will have little impact on procurers, as you will continue to place your adverts through Defence Contracts Online which will place the advert in the appropriate place.</p>

<h2>Procurement procedures</h2>

<p>24). The default procedures in the <abbr title="Public Contracts Regulations 2015">PCR</abbr> 2015 are the open and restricted procedures.  However, your starting position in the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> will be a free choice of running a competition under the restricted procedure or using the negotiated procedure with prior publication of a contract notice (referred to as the “competitive negotiated procedure” in this guidance).</p>

<p>25). You may only use the competitive dialogue procedure for particularly complex procurements if you cannot place the contract under the restricted or negotiated procedure with prior publication of a contract notice.</p>

<p>26). In the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>, you may carry out non-competitive procurement (or in certain instances limited competition) under the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice, but only if it is justified for the following reasons:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	If you receive irregular, unacceptable, unsuitable tenders or no applications in response to a call for competition during a restricted, competitive dialogue or competitive negotiated procedure.   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Where for technical reasons or for reasons connected with protection of exclusive rights you may only award the contract to a particular supplier.     <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Where the normal and accelerated time limits laid down for the restricted and competitive negotiated procedures cannot be met:</p>

<p>(1)	for reasons of urgency resulting from a crisis;   <br>
(2)	due to the nature of the market for air and maritime transport services when deploying military or security forces abroad; or   <br>
(3)	for extreme urgency brought about by events not foreseeable or attributable to the procurer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	For additional deliveries by the original supplier ensuring that the length of these contractual arrangements may not generally exceed five years.    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.	Where goods are quoted and purchased on a commodity market.   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.	To benefit from particularly advantageous terms in a closing down sale or where a supplier is bankrupt, insolvent or being wound up.    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.	For research and development services other than those services exempt under the research and development exclusion.   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h.	Where you are procuring goods solely for research, experiment or development, and not with a view to establishing commercial viability or recovering research and development costs.    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.	For new works or services which are a repetition of the contracted for works or services, if you commence the procedure for the new contract within 5 years of the original contract being entered and the possibility was referred to in the original contract notice.</p>

<p>27). You can find full guidance on procurement procedures in Chapter 8.</p>

<h2>Framework agreements</h2>

<p>28). The provisions in the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> on framework agreements (Regulation 20) allow you to place a framework agreement with a permitted maximum duration of 7 years.</p>

<p>29). You can place a framework agreement longer than 7 years only in exceptional circumstances.  You must determine the circumstances by considering the expected service life of any delivered items, installations or systems and the technical difficulties that a change in supplier may cause.  You will need to include the justification in the contract notice.</p>

<p>30). You can find full guidance on framework agreements in Chapter 11.</p>

<h2>Central purchasing bodies</h2>

<p>31). The definition of a central purchasing body in the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> includes a European public body. This has been maintained post exit day as it may be appropriate for the UK to continue to purchase through a European public body as such bodies are not necessarily institutions of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and participation is not necessarily linked to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> membership. Although the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> does not define a European public body, it may include, for example, the European Defence Agency.</p>

<p>32). Regulation 22 (Central purchasing bodies) sets out the provisions relating to purchases by central purchasing bodies.  If a procurer purchases from or through a central purchasing body, the procurer has complied with the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	to the extent that the central purchasing body has itself complied with the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>; or   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	if the central purchasing body is, for example, a European public body:  <br>
(1)	the contract award rules applied by it are compliant with the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>; and    <br>
(2)	the contracts awarded are subject to efficient remedies provisions which are comparable to those set out in the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>.</p>

<h2>What are the rules on technical specifications?</h2>

<p>33). The term “technical specifications” means the document identified in the contract documents by the procurer, which sets out their requirements in respect of the provision of works, goods or services.</p>

<p>34). Technical specifications must not have the effect of creating unjustified obstacles to open competition.  The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> does not permit technical specifications which have the effect of favouring or eliminating particular companies or goods.</p>

<p>35). The provisions in the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> takes into account a number of additional defence-specific standards. To guarantee interoperability, they refer to technical requirements to be met by the UK under international standardisation agreements.</p>

<p>36). You can find full guidance on technical specifications in Chapter 7.</p>

<h2>What are selection criteria?</h2>

<p>37). The purpose of selection criteria is to ensure that the tenderers have sufficient financial, economic, technical and professional capacity to fulfil the contract.  However, you are also able to limit the number of suitable candidates through the application of additional objective and non-discriminatory criteria.</p>

<p>38). You will have to draw up clear and non-discriminatory selection criteria regardless of the value of the contract and the type of procurement procedure you use.</p>

<p>39). The chosen selection criteria must not go beyond what is relevant and proportionate to the subject matter of the contract.  You must declare the criteria in full in the contract notice.</p>

<h3>Personal situation of the candidate or tenderer</h3>

<p>40). The selection criteria for the rejection of potential suppliers include convictions for terrorist offences or offences linked to terrorist activities as mandatory grounds for exclusion.  There are several defence and sensitive security specific discretionary grounds for exclusion. The list of offences has been amended.</p>

<p>41). A procurer may exclude candidates or tenderers from a procurement if they have committed an act of grave misconduct in the course of their business.  An act of grave misconduct could include a previous breach of contractual obligations relating to security of supply or security of information, which were imposed in a previous contract.</p>

<p>42). There is also a provision that gives you the ability to exclude a candidate or tenderer where you can establish, through any evidence (which may include evidence provided by a protected data source) that the candidate or tenderer lacks the “reliability” necessary to exclude risks to the security of the UK.  You can find guidance on this in Chapter 12 – Security of Information.</p>

<h3>Economic and financial standing</h3>

<p>43). The selection criteria for economic and financial standing set out in Regulation 24 (Information as to economic and financial standing) ensure the prospective tenderers can handle the commercial and financial risks of the proposed contract.  The suppliers must be in a sound financial position to participate in the procurement.  You may wish to state what level of financial standing is acceptable.  You could use this level as a trigger for seeking bank or parent company guarantees to ensure the supplier has the financial capability to carry out the work.</p>

<h3>Technical and professional ability</h3>

<p>44). The selection criteria for technical or professional ability are specifically suited to the defence sector.  For example, in terms of the evidence of technical and professional ability for suppliers to provide, the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> permits:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	The required list of principal deliveries or services provided up to 5 years.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Checks on production capacities, study and research facilities and quality control measures may be carried out as a matter of course rather than just where the products or services to be provided are complex or required for a special purpose.   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	A description of the tools, materials, technical equipment, staff numbers, know-how and sources of supply available to: <br>
(1)	perform the contract;   <br>
(2)	demonstrate the ability to cope with additional purchases resulting from a crisis, if required; or  <br>
(3)	carry out maintenance, modernisation or adaptation of the goods covered by the contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	Evidence of the ability to process, store and transmit classified information at the level of protection required by the procurer.  This may include evidence of holding a security clearance, recognised by the UK, equivalent to the relevant protective mar
king.</p>

<p>45). A procurer may grant additional time, where appropriate, for a supplier to obtain necessary security clearances.</p>

<p>46). You may ask suppliers to provide evidence of their technical or professional ability by other documents as considered appropriate if, for valid reasons, for example, obligations of confidence to third parties, the supplier cannot provide the required references.</p>

<p>47). You can find full guidance on selection criteria and choosing tenderers in Chapter 15 – Supplier Selection.</p>

<h3>Quality assurance standards</h3>

<p>48). The selection criteria for quality assurance requires accreditation from an independent accredited body established in the UK or Gibraltar which conforms to European accreditation and certification standards. This is because the organisations who set these accreditations and standards are not linked to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> membership and the UK is likely to want to stay closely aligned.  However, procurers can accept, if they consider it appropriate, other evidence of conformity to equivalent quality management system standards.</p>

<h2>What award criteria can I use?</h2>

<p>49). You must award the contract based on either the “lowest price” or the “most economically advantageous tender”.</p>

<p>50).	If the award criterion chosen is “lowest price”, after checking to ensure the tenders meet the requirement, you must award the contract to the tender who offers the lowest price.</p>

<p>51). If the award criterion chosen is “most economically advantageous tender”, you must use award criteria that are objective and linked to the subject matter of the contract to assess the tenders and determine which is most economically advantageous.</p>

<p>52). You must publish the weightings or rankings applied to the award criteria in the contract documents.  The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of criteria, and includes new criteria such as security of supply, interoperability and operational characteristics.</p>

<p>53). You can find full guidance on award criteria and tendering in Chapter 16 – Conducting the Tendering Exercise.</p>

<h2>What special contract conditions can I use?</h2>

<p>54). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> allows you to impose special contract performance conditions if you indicate them in the contract notice or contract documents and are compatible with retained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law.</p>

<p>55). Contract conditions must not therefore breach the procurement principles of transparency, non-discrimination, and equality.  If you consider that a proposed contract condition may breach these principles, you should seek legal advice.</p>

<h2>Security of Information</h2>

<p>56). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> are intended to provide procurers with the ability to protect classified information throughout the tendering and contracting process, which includes the ability to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	impose obligations on contractors and require flow-down of those obligations to subcontractors to safeguard information throughout the tendering and contracting process;   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	reject contractors and subcontractors where they:  <br>
(1)	do not possess the necessary reliability to exclude risks to national security; or   <br>
(2)	have breached obligations relating to security of information during a previous contract in circumstances amounting to grave misconduct;   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	request information from contractors and subcontractors to assess their ability to protect information;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	impose contractual obligations to protect information to the required level.</p>

<p>57). You can find full guidance on security of information in Chapter 12.</p>

<h2>Security of Supply</h2>

<p>58). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> includes provisions to enable the procurer to assess the capability of a contractor and its subcontractors to meet the procurer’s security of supply requirements.</p>

<p>59). You can, for example, require tenderers to provide information:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	demonstrating that they can honour their contractual obligations by obtaining the necessary export licences;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	identifying any restrictions on the disclosure, transfer or use of technology arising out of export controls or security arrangements;   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	demonstrating that their supply chains will be able to comply with the security of supply requirements set out in the contract documents.</p>

<p>60). You can also require suppliers to provide commitments on security of supply.  These can include commitments from the supplier to: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	ensure that changes in their supply chain during the performance of the contract will not adversely affect the security of supply requirements;   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	establish or maintain the industrial capacity required to meet additional needs arising from a crisis on terms to be agreed;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	carry out the maintenance, modernisation or adaptation of the goods covered by the contract;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	provide the procurer with all necessary licences and information to produce spare parts, components,  assemblies and testing equipment in the event that the supplier is no longer able to provide these goods.</p>

<p>61). These requirements and any award criteria must be relevant and proportionate to the subject matter of the contract.  You can find full guidance on Security of Supply in Chapter 13.</p>

<h3>Directing Subcontracts to Third Parties</h3>

<p>62). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> gives you the option to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	require tenderers to indicate what they propose to subcontract and to whom;    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	require tenderers to indicate any planned changes of subcontractors before or during the life of the contract;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	oblige successful tenderers to award all or a certain portion of its proposed subcontracts to third parties through advertising on the UK e-notification service;    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	reject a subcontractor selected by a tenderer at any stage of the contract award procedure or during contract performance in accordance with all or part of the selection criteria for the main contract.</p>

<p>63). Generally, the tenderer you select will take full responsibility under the contract for delivering the requirement.  That said, even if you do not mandate advertisement of proposed subcontracts on the Find a Tender service, you should encourage the prime contractor where appropriate to use competition to select subcontractors and advertise subcontract opportunities on the Government’s Contract Finder portal through Defence Contracts Online (DCO).</p>

<p>64).	Using the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> to direct the successful tenderer to advertise subcontracts to third parties requires very careful consideration.  Inappropriate use of these measures will add costs and delays to the procurement without providing benefits to either the procurer or the contractor.  You will need to justify any mandate by considering:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	the value of the contract (e.g. it may be disproportionate to mandate subcontract competition for contracts valued below £10-million as it would discourage small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) from bidding for these contracts);    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	the nature of the contract (e.g. using subcontract competition for high technology equipment may not be possible due to exclusive intellectual property rights or technical reasons); and   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	the structure of the market (e.g. is there likely to be a sufficient response from the market to challenge the existing supply chain).</p>

<p>65). You can find full guidance on directing subcontracting to third parties in Chapter 14 – Subcontracting under the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Procurement Principles</h2>

<p>66). UK contracting authorities remain obliged to treat all economic operators (as defined by the DSCPR) equally and in a non-discriminatory and transparent way in accordance with regulation 5(2) <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Regulation 6(3A), formerly Article 346 TFEU</h2>

<p>67). The amended regulations have replicated the effect of Article 346 TFEU by importing its terms into the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> at regulation 6(3).  If this was not done, there would have been an obligation under the regulations to advertise all procurements which were not otherwise outside of the scope of the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>68). Regulation 6(3A) permits the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to protect its essential security interests in two circumstances:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	By not obliging <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to supply information in a procurement process which would be contrary to its essential security interests (regulation 6(3A)(a)); or    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	To take such measures <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> considers necessary to protect its essential security interests in relation to the production or trade in arms, munitions and war material, provided that such measures do not adversely affect the conditions of competition regarding products which are not intended for specifically military purposes (regulation 6(3A)(b)).</p>

<h2>Regulation 6(3A)(a) – the “security of information” exemption</h2>

<p>69). This regulation copies out Article 346(1)(a) TFEU into domestic law. It permits <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to disapply all or part of the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> where following the procurement process under the regulations would require <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to disclose classified information which it considers would prejudice its essential security interests.</p>

<p>70). One example may be that the procurement is so sensitive that it is considered that the obligation to advertise the requirement itself would prejudice the UK’s essential security interests.  Another example may be that the information is classified as UK Eyes Only resulting in the requirement to restrict the competition to those suppliers that can provide the requirement with employees who are UK nationals.</p>

<p>71). It should be noted that because the definition of economic operator is now limited to those who are established in and nationals of the UK and Gibraltar, there may be cases where previously a procurement may have been considered exempt under Article 346(1)(a) TFEU but can now be carried out under the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Regulation 6(3A)(b), the “warlike stores” exemption.</h2>

<p>72). This regulation replicates the effect of Article 346(1)(b) TFEU into domestic law. It permits the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to disapply all or part of the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> to protect its essential security interests subject to two conditions:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	the procurement must relate to arms, munitions and war material which are listed on the ‘1958 List’.  The 1958 List is the list of military equipment which was included in Council Decision 255/58 and which has now been incorporated into <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	the measure taken (such as single sourcing to a particular supplier) cannot affect the conditions of competition regarding products which are not intended for specifically military purposes.
Retained case law on Article 346 TFEU.</p>

<p>73). Section 6 of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (Withdrawal) Act makes it clear that the UK Courts (other than the Supreme Court) continue to be bound by “retained case law” in relation to the interpretation of retained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law (which includes the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>).  Retained case law is defined as including decisions of both the domestic courts and those of the Court of Justice of the European Union (<abbr title="Court of Justice of the European Union">CJEU</abbr>) which were made before exit day where retained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law is not modified.</p>

<p>74). However, even where retained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law is modified (as in the case of Article 346 TFEU through regulation 6(3A) <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>), provisions can still be interpreted in accordance with retained case law where the intent is for the law to operate in the same way. Given regulation 6(3A) replicates the terms of Article 346 TFEU almost verbatim it is likely the existing case law from the <abbr title="Court of Justice of the European Union">CJEU</abbr> will continue to be used by the domestic courts to interpret the scope and extent of regulation 6(3A).</p>

<p>75). Therefore, unless and until the domestic courts find otherwise, regulation 6(3A) should only be used where it is strictly necessary to protect the UK’s essential security interests.  There should continue to be a clear link between the measure taken and the essential security interest being protected; and the measure taken should be the minimum measure necessary to protect that essential security interest.</p>

<h2>What general exclusions are in the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>?</h2>

<p>76).In addition to the exemptions, there are general exclusions in the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> which allow you not to apply the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>, including exclusions for:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	contracts awarded in accordance with specific procedural rules of:  <br>
(1)	international agreements or arrangements between the UK and another State;  <br>
(2)	international agreements or arrangements on the stationing of troops between the UK and  another State; or
(3)	international organisations that have specific procurement rules;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	contracts which would oblige the UK to supply information, the disclosure of which is contrary to its essential security interests;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	contracts for intelligence activities;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	cooperative programmes between the UK and an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member State(s)based on research and development for a new product;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.	contracts awarded in a  country other than the UK or Gibraltar during military or security operations taking place outside the UK or Gibraltar, if operational needs require them to be placed with local suppliers;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.	research and development services except where the benefits accrue exclusively to the procurer for the conduct of its own affairs and where the procurer wholly pays for the service.</p>

<p>77). You can find full guidance on exclusions in Chapter 5.</p>

<h2>What about “in-house” procurement?</h2>

<p>78). You also need to consider whether the works, goods or services you are procuring are from an “in-house” body (e.g. Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) as this may determine whether the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> applies.</p>

<p>79). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> will not apply if the procurement is from:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	organisations which are part of the same legal person, for example, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> procuring from <abbr title="Defence Electronics and Components Agency">DECA</abbr> or <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">DSTL</abbr>; or   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	organisations which are legally separate but so closely connected that it is inappropriate to make their dealings subject to procurement law, and they are therefore considered to be indistinguishable for procurement purposes.</p>

<p>80). The classification of bodies of the type referred to in paragraph 69(b) above as “in-house” follow the decision of the European Court of Justice in the Teckal case (Case C-107/98). This interpretation remains valid as it is saved under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Withdrawal Bill.  You can find further guidance on in-house procurement in Chapter 2 - Scope.</p>

<h2>What about industrial participation or offset?</h2>

<p>81). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> do not mention industrial participation, offset or any other form of economic compensation for awarding a contract to a foreign supplier.</p>

<p>82). You must not seek offers of industrial participation or offset that would distort competition under the DSCPR. For <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> procurers, you may consult DES IRG for advice on how <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> encourages industrial investment in the UK. If in any doubt you should consult your legal advisers.</p>

<h2>What do I need to consider for my procurement strategy?</h2>

<p>83). You need to consider as a minimum the following questions to decide if the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> will apply to your procurement:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Does the procurement involve a new contract(s) or a material amendment to an existing contract?  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Is the procurement from an in-house body?  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Are you a procurer?   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	Does regulation 6(3) apply to the procurement?  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.	Does the procurement fall within the scope of the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>?   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.	Does the value of the procurement exceed the threshold?  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.	Does an exclusion set out in Regulation 7 apply to the procurement?</p>

<p>84). The flowchart at Annex A illustrates the decision making process which you should use as part of drawing up the procurement strategy.</p>

<h2>Can procurement decisions be challenged?</h2>

<p>85). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> contains review procedures that enable suppliers to challenge procurement decisions and provide effective remedies to protect their rights.  These procedures are very similar to those in the <abbr title="Public Contracts Regulations 2015">PCR</abbr> 2015 but contain important elements that are tailored to the defence and sensitive security market.</p>

<p>86). You must be aware that any procurement decision may be subject to a legal challenge.  This includes but is not limited to any decision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	to apply an exemption or exclusion in the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>;  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	to use the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice;   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	to not select a supplier to tender after it has expressed an interest in the requirement;   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	to award the contract to a particular supplier.</p>

<p>87). You must ensure that you record the reasons for taking any procurement decision, including any defence or security issues, at the time that the decision is made.  This evidence will be required in the event of future challenge.</p>

<p>88). Any decisions to exempt procurements from the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> are likely to come under greater scrutiny.  You should only use an exemption or general exclusion for the purpose that it is intended (i.e. to protect the interests that it is designed to safeguard).</p>

<p>89). You must consult your legal advisers if you are not clear whether you can use an exemption or general exclusion for a specific procurement.</p>

<p>90). Any failure to comply with the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> could result in an aggrieved supplier or would-be supplier bringing an action in the UK courts for damages and / or for the decision or action to be set aside, or both.</p>

<p>91). Like the <abbr title="Public Contracts Regulations 2015">PCR</abbr> 2015, the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> requires a ‘standstill period’, before concluding a contract.  This gives rejected tenderers the opportunity to start a review procedure at a time when the Court can correct unfair decisions.  If a procurer has not respected this standstill period, the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> requires the UK courts under certain conditions to set aside a signed contract, by rendering the contract “ineffective”.</p>

<p>92). The <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> also seek to combat illegal direct awards of contracts, which is the most serious infringement of UK procurement law.  The UK courts may render contracts ineffective if the procurer has awarded the contract without prior publication of a contract notice on the Find a Tender service where the <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> requires one.</p>

<p>93). The UK courts will have to consider defence and sensitive security interests when considering applications for interim orders (such as injunctions) or when deciding whether to make a declaration of ineffectiveness.</p>

<p>94). You must maintain an audit trail of any major procurement decision (for example, use of an exemption) in case of a legal challenge.</p>

<h2>Transitional Procurements</h2>

<p>95). If your procurement procedure was launched but not finalised by 31 December 2020, the end of the Transition Period, your procurement is a ‘Transitional Procurement’ and will continue to follow the Regulations under which your procurement commenced:  the pre-Transition Period <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>96). Transitional Procurements are procurement procedures for contracts and framework agreements (and procedures for the call-off of contracts placed under them), launched but not finalised before the end of the Transition Period, together with procedures for the calling-off of contracts under framework agreements where the framework agreements had not expired or been terminated prior to 31 December 2020.  The definition of launched and finalised are below:</p>

<p><strong>Launched:</strong> a procedure is launched when a call for competition or any other invitation to submit applications has been made in accordance with the pre-Transition Period <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>. Where the pre-Transition Period <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr> do not require such a call or invitation, it is the date when you contacted economic operators in relation to the specific procedure.</p>

<p><strong>Finalised:</strong> a procedure is finalised upon publication of a contract award notice in accordance with the pre-Transition Period <abbr title="Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations">DSPCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where the 2011 Regulations do not require the publication of such a notice, upon conclusion (award) of the relevant contract. Where you have decided not to award a contract, upon informing the tenderers, or persons otherwise entitled to submit applications, of the reasons why the contract was not awarded.</p>

<p>97). This means that if you launch a procurement process before the end of the transition period, but that procurement process has not finalised by the end of the Transition Period, you will need to continue to publish notices relating to your procurement on the <abbr title="Official Journal of the European Union">OJEU</abbr>. This includes any relevant notices such as contract notice, contract award notice, contract amendments notice and corrigenda. Overall however this will have little impact on procurers, as you will continue to place your adverts through Defence Contracts Online, which will place the advert in the appropriate place.</p>
