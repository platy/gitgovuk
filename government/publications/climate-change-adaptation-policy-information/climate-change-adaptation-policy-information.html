<p>Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/climate-change-explained">climate is changing</a> and will continue to do so as a result of global greenhouse gas emissions. Despite efforts to reduce emissions, the effects will have impacts for years to come.</p>

<p>Preparing for a changing climate, or climate adaptation, will help the UK to reduce negative consequences of climate change and take advantage of new opportunities. Building the UK’s preparedness and resilience to climate change impacts is a cost-effective and essential way to protect our people, economy and environment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Background and legislation</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/27/contents" rel="external">Climate Change Act 2008</a> sets out a policy framework to reduce domestic emissions and ensure the UK adapts to climate change. This includes commitments to produce a UK Climate Change Risk Assessment to identify risks, followed by a National Adaptation Programme to address those risks every five years.</p>

<p>Defra is the lead department for domestic climate adaptation, but actions and policies are implemented across government. Adaptation is also embedded in other key government commitments such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan">25 Year Environment Plan</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Action</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Understanding the risks: UK Climate Change Risk Assessment</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017">UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (<abbr title="Climate Change Risk Assessment">CCRA</abbr>)</a> sets out the risks and opportunities facing the UK from climate change. It provides the evidence base to inform National Adaptation Programmes in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The Adaptation Committee of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/" rel="external">Climate Change Committee (<abbr title="Climate Change Committee">CCC</abbr>)</a> advises the government on the <abbr title="Climate Change Risk Assessment">CCRA</abbr>. The <abbr title="Climate Change Committee">CCC</abbr> produces a Climate Risk Independent Assessment, setting out the risks facing the UK and providing advice to government. The <abbr title="Climate Change Committee">CCC</abbr> published the latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukclimaterisk.org/" rel="external">independent assessment of climate risk in 2021</a>. The government will assess and respond to this advice by publishing the next <abbr title="Climate Change Risk Assessment">CCRA</abbr> in 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Preparing for climate change: National Adaptation Programme</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/climate-change-second-national-adaptation-programme-2018-to-2023">National Adaptation Programme (NAP)</a> sets out the actions that government and others will take to adapt to the challenges of climate change in England over a five-year period. The second NAP period runs from 2018 to 2023, and covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the natural environment</li>
  <li>infrastructure</li>
  <li>people and the built environment</li>
  <li>business and industry</li>
  <li>local government sectors</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Adapting essential services and infrastructure: Adaptation Reporting Power</h3>

<p>We need to make sure that essential services and infrastructure, such as energy supplies or railways, are prepared for climate change. Under the Adaptation Reporting Power (<abbr title="Adaptation Reporting Power">ARP</abbr>), we’ve invited infrastructure providers and public bodies to report on their preparedness for climate change risks.</p>

<p>You can read the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/climate-change-adaptation-reporting-third-round-reports">individual adaptation reports&nbsp;from the third round of reporting</a>, along with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/understanding-climate-risks-to-uk-infrastructure-evaluation-of-the-third-round-of-the-adaptation-reporting-power/" rel="external">an evaluation of this round</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Adaptation at international level</h3>

<p>As part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-adaptation-communication-to-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change-unfccc-2020">UK’s Adaptation Communication</a> to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change we have set out what the UK is doing to prepare for the effects of climate change at home and to support those facing impacts overseas.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adaptation-action-coalition-an-overview">Adaptation Action Coalition</a> aims to support action to adapt and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. This was developed by the UK in partnership with Egypt, Bangladesh, Malawi, the Netherlands, Saint Lucia and the United Nations Development Programme.</p>

<p>At <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ukcop26.org/" rel="external">COP26</a>, increasing ambition on adaptation, resilience and loss and damage will be a priority. As one of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ukcop26.org/cop26-goals/" rel="external">core goals</a> of our COP26 Presidency, we will call on countries to increase action on adaptation and reduce loss and damage.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Who we’re working with</h2>

<p>Adapting to climate change is a government wide issue and should be considered in all relevant policies. To support this, Defra works with a wide range of government departments and other partners to prepare the country for climate change.</p>

<p>Business, local government, civil society and communities also have important roles to play in ensuring we are ready for a changing climate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>The Climate Change Committee</h3>
