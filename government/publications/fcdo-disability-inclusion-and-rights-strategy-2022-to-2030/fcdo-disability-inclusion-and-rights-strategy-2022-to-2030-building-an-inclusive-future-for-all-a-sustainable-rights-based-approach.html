<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>) purses the United Kingdom’s (UK) national interests and projects the UK as a force for good in the world. It promotes the interests of British citizens, safeguards the UK’s security, defends the UK’s values, reduces poverty and tackles global challenges with its international partners.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>This strategy has been shaped by many organisations and individuals and we are grateful to all those involved. We are especially thankful for the participation of the people with disabilities and their representative organisations and our civil society partners.</p>

<p>Staff across <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> provided valuable inputs through consultations and written contributions, including the staff Disability Inclusion and Awareness Network.</p>

<p>We conducted a series of external consultations with over 100 organisations (see annex) within the global disability movement between October – December 2021. This involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eight country-based meetings in Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, Bangladesh and Indonesia</li>
  <li>four regional trainings and workshops bringing together a range of Organisations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) from around Africa, facilitated through the International Disability Alliance (<abbr title="International Disability Alliance">IDA</abbr>) and the African Disability Forum</li>
  <li>one virtual consultation bringing together OPDs from across the world, facilitated by the Commonwealth Disabled People’s Forum</li>
</ul>

<p>These consultations were made possible by the following organising partners: ADD International, Commonwealth Disabled People’s Forum, Disability Rights Fund/Disability Rights Advocacy Fund, International Disability Alliance, Leonard Cheshire and Sightsavers. Discussions focused on the thematic pillars of the strategy, particularly on the new pillars and cross-cutting themes, as well as on ways of working with <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>. The consultations gave a valuable contextual insight into the lived experience of people with disabilities and their families.</p>

<p>We would also like to express our gratitude for the invaluable virtual consultations and written feedback from the International Disability Alliance, Disability Rights Fund/Disability Rights Advocacy Fund and the Bond Disability and Development Group.</p>

<h2>Ministerial foreword</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/142692/Liz_Truss.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>We can be proud that the United Kingdom is one of the best places in the world to live, no matter who you are. But with over one in seven of people in the world having a disability, there is more we all need to do to further advance rights and freedoms of people with disabilities.</p>

<p>Our strategy is rooted in the core principles of freedom, individual agency and dignity. That is why we are determined to ensure that people with disabilities have the same opportunity to thrive as anyone else – free from stigma, discrimination or exclusion.</p>

<p>For me, this is a moral and practical mission. Its urgency has been heightened in the wake of the pandemic, which exacerbated the challenges people with disabilities face around the world. Women and girls with disabilities have been hit especially hard.</p>

<p>At this critical moment, we can ill afford to let so much potential go to waste. That is why the UK is proud to have a strong track record of galvanising global progress on disability rights. In 2018, we started a new movement through co-hosting the first Global Disability Summit and in July 2021, the UK Government launched the National Disability Strategy recognising the critical role of the UK as a global leader of disability rights internationally.</p>

<p>We know a fairer Britain and fairer world go hand in hand. This is vital as we build back from the impact of COVID.  That is why this strategy relies on the UK leading the fight for fairness beyond our shores: working with, listening to and answering the needs of people with disabilities across the globe.</p>

<p>Including people with disabilities is not just the right thing to do - it creates healthier, fairer and more prosperous societies for everyone to enjoy. Globally, people with disabilities represent over $1.2 trillion in annual disposable income and with equal opportunity can contribute between 3-7% of GDP.</p>

<p>Harnessing the full force of our diplomatic and development expertise, the UK will take an empowering approach working with people with disabilities to deliver, real change.  We will champion individual dignity, and full rights and freedoms without discrimination using evidence to inform our approach. We will drive forward this work by accelerating our own and our partners’ implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>

<p>Informed by consultations with people with disabilities and their representative organisations, this strategy recognises the importance of making sure everyone has the opportunity to succeed. By working together, we can make strides towards a freer, fairer and better society for people across our country and beyond.</p>

<p>The Rt Hon Liz Truss MP</p>

<p>Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs </p>

<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s Disability Inclusion and Rights Strategy upholds the UK’s ambitious approach for our work with, and for, people with disabilities. Looking to 2030, the strategy sets out how we will maintain and build on the significant progress we have made since the Global Disability Summit and Disability Inclusion Strategy in 2018. It reaffirms our commitment to act as a global leader on disability inclusion across our diplomatic and development efforts. Our work is underpinned by British values and principles of freedom, individual agency and dignity and aligns with core <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> priorities.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s approach</h3>

<p>Our strategic vision is a sustainable, inclusive and equitable future where:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">People with disabilities in all their diversity - including marginalised and under-represented groups - are meaningfully engaged, empowered and able to exercise and enjoy their full rights and freedoms on an equal basis with others, without discrimination and across the life-course. They are full and active members of society and decision-makers in all aspects of life, including diplomatic and development efforts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> takes a human rights-based approach to disability inclusion, underpinned by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (<abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr>).</p>

<p>We are committed to taking concrete action towards four outcomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Rights: people with disabilities in all their diversity have full and equal enjoyment of all rights and fundamental freedoms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voice: full and meaningful participation and leadership of people with disabilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choice: people with disabilities have more choice and control in all aspects of their lives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visibility: greater visibility of people with disabilities through quality comprehensive data and evidence</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We will prioritise six intervention areas, one emerging area, and three enablers for inclusion:</p>

<h4>Key intervention areas:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Universal human rights, freedom and democracy</li>
  <li>Inclusive education</li>
  <li>Inclusive health</li>
  <li>Inclusive social protection</li>
  <li>Inclusive economic empowerment</li>
  <li>Inclusive humanitarian action</li>
</ol>

<h4>Emerging area:</h4>

<p>1. Inclusive climate action</p>

<h4>Enablers for inclusion:</h4>

<p>1. Assistive technology</p>

<p>2. Strengthening organisation of persons with disabilities</p>

<p>3. Empowerment of people with disabilities</p>

<p>We are guided by our commitments and responsibilities under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html" rel="external"><abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr> and its Optional Protocol</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/2260/contents/made" rel="external">Public Sector Equality Duty</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda" rel="external">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a> and <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Sustainable Development Goals (<abbr title="United Nations Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the UK’s commitments to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.globaldisabilitysummit.org/resources/global-disability-summit-2-years-progress-on-implementation-of-commitments" rel="external">Global Disability Summits</a> in 2018 and 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>We will continue to implement a ‘twin track approach’ - mainstreaming a disability inclusive and human rights perspective across all our work while providing targeted support to people with disabilities through disability-specific initiatives.</p>

<p>We will draw on our development and diplomatic expertise to advance rights and freedoms of people with disabilities. We will encourage countries to put in place polices, practices, legislation and accountability frameworks to meet their responsibilities under the <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr>.</p>

<p>We will prioritise active and meaningful participation of people with disabilities in our work and step-up efforts to strengthen organisations of persons with disability. We will work across the life-course, actively encouraging inclusion of people with disabilities in all their diversity, empowering the most marginalised and under-represented groups.</p>

<p>We will build a more complete evidence base on the lived experience of people with disabilities and strengthen collection, analysis and disaggregation of quality data.</p>

<h3>Mainstreaming disability inclusion</h3>

<p>Equality and inclusion remain at the heart of <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s integrated approach. We will take a differentiated approach across our global network which will vary from country to country, in line with local needs, capabilities and UK partnerships.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>policy: a new approach to equalities will consider inclusion more comprehensively and holistically. We will use a continuum moving from ‘equality awareness’ to ‘equality transformation’ to support mainstreaming of disability inclusion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>diplomacy and influencing: we will use our voice as a global leader on disability inclusion to accelerate change for people with disabilities, using our diplomatic networks, position in national and international fora, and strategic partnerships</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>programming: we expect programme teams to take a systemic approach to disability inclusion, supported by templates, guidance, and training. <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s new Programme Operating Framework requires evidenced consideration of impact on disability inclusion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>procurement: we continue to harness <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s purchasing power to benefit people with disabilities. We expect our delivery partners to demonstrate their technical understanding of, and commitment to, disability inclusion and meaningful consultation</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Accountability</h4>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> Governance Boards will provide senior oversight and an External Disability Board will guide our implementation. The strategy will be underpinned by a delivery plan that sets out initial priorities and focus, developed with meaningful participation from people with disabilities and their representative organisations. We will review the strategy and delivery plan periodically, starting after the end of the UK Government’s Spending Review period in 2025.</p>

<span class="number">1. </span> Building an inclusive future for all</h2>

<h3>The UK as a global leader</h3>

<p>The UK is a leader in disability inclusion with a strong legacy. We are proud of our reputation as a principled champion of the rights of people with disability in all their diversity. We were the host of the precursor to the Paralympics and a proud co-host of the first <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/global-disability-summit-2018">Global Disability Summit 2018 (GDS18)</a>.</p>

<p>The Summit was a historic moment for the rights of people with disabilities. Over 170 national governments, multilateral agencies, foundations, private sector and civil society organisations made nearly 1,000 wide-ranging <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.globaldisabilitysummit.org/commitments" rel="external">commitments</a> which have been critical in achieving <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org/sites/default/files/final_en_-_global_disability_summit_2_years_-_progress_on_implementation_of_commitments_-_pm_final_0.pdf" rel="external">real change</a> on disability inclusion. The 2022 Global Disability Summit hosted by the International Disability Alliance and the governments of Norway and Ghana builds on this legacy.</p>

<p>We have made significant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/934618/Progress_Paper_of_the_Disability_Inclusion_Strategy_November_2020.pdf" rel="external">progress</a> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> in our international work on disability inclusion through implementation of the first <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfids-disability-inclusion-strategy-2018-to-2023">Disability Inclusion Strategy</a> launched in 2018. Despite challenging domestic and global circumstances, we have delivered across all our strategic priorities - inclusive education, economic empowerment, social protection and humanitarian action - and within our organisational leadership, culture, systems and processes as a result of our mainstreaming efforts. This laid strong foundations for <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> to build on.</p>

<p>We have launched and funded both disability-specific and mainstream development programmes to support people with disabilities - including the flagship Disability Inclusive Development programme. Our policy, influencing and programmes are responding and adapting to the emerging priorities of people with disabilities. During the COVID-19 crisis, we surged capacity and pivoted to provide critical support for the most marginalised people with disabilities and their representative organisations.</p>

<p>The UK’s 2030 vision on global disability rights will look to maintain and build on the great work achieved since 2018. We will take a differentiated approach across our global network which will vary from country to country, in line with local needs, capabilities and UK partnerships. Our work is underpinned by British values and principles of freedom, individual agency and dignity.  It aligns with core <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> priorities including building strategic partnerships based on economic empowerment and investment in technology and infrastructure, as well as tackling climate change, unlocking the potential of women and girls and providing humanitarian aid to those most in need.</p>

<p>We know this is a long-term process with much still to learn and deliver. However, our ambition for disability inclusion remains high. Inclusion is central to the work of <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>, and we are committed to supporting a long-term movement for change on disability inclusion, as envisaged by the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (<abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr>).</p>

<h3>The changing global context</h3>

<p>The world is at a watershed moment. Conflict<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, climate change<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>, and COVID-19<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> are driving a rising tide of humanitarian need, forced displacement, and decline in global freedom and democracy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. Crises are disproportionally affecting marginalised people, especially women and girls and people with disabilities <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>, trapping them in cycles of poverty and vulnerability. Recent global shocks have exposed deeply entrenched social, economic, and political inequities that restrict individual liberty and agency. As one of the most excluded groups in society, people with disabilities are more likely to be impacted by these shocks<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> and experience abuse, exploitation, and deprivation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> as a result.</p>

<p>COVID-19 has had a devastating and disproportionate impact on the one billion people with disabilities and reversed many hard-won gains<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>. Among the hardest hit in terms of infection, severe complications and fatalities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>, people with disabilities and older people have been adversely impacted in all areas of life<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> [A] and excluded from response and recovery efforts<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>. The crisis has exposed and exacerbated pre-existing inequalities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>, exclusion, stigma<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup>, discrimination, marginalisation and violence<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>. Women and girls with disabilities, older people with disabilities and under-represented groups<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>, including people with intellectual disabilities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup> [B], have been among the worst affected<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>. The increased barriers to inclusion have reduced the independence, autonomy and dignity<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup> of people with disabilities.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, people with disabilities and their families were poorer across all socio-economic indicators<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>. In low and middle-income countries, more than half of the 65 million children with disabilities were not in school<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup> - disproportionately affecting girls with disabilities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup>. COVID-19 has reversed years of education gains for children with disabilities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup>. As schools shut down, children with disabilities have been the least likely to benefit from remote learning <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup> [C]. Many education systems have failed to meet even their basic learning needs<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup> and they are at greatest risk of never returning to school<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>People with disabilities were already poorly represented in the job market with a large majority unemployed or stuck in underpaid and insecure roles<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>. Only 20% of women with disabilities are in employment<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup> and their paid and unpaid contributions to their families, communities and economies are frequently unrecognised – especially for older women<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup>. Given the opportunity people with disabilities can contribute an additional 3-7% to GDP<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>People with disabilities have experienced high loss of employment and income and financial hardship, reversing decades of progress on poverty reduction<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup>. Their experience has been compounded by weak coverage of social safety nets and systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where 80% of people with disabilities live. Only 8.6% of people with severe disabilities in low-income countries receive social protection benefits<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Underpinning these challenges are exclusionary and discriminatory public systems, procedures, and processes. COVID-19 has demonstrated how global systems, including global health systems [D], still fail people with disabilities. As well as direct physical and mental health impacts, we have seen harmful consequences for people with disabilities from overwhelmed health and social systems worldwide.</p>

<p>The pandemic has brought to the forefront what the disability movement has long said – progress on disability rights has been too slow and exclusion is still built into our collective systems and processes <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup>. However, recent global shocks provide an opportunity for us to work with likeminded partners and people with disabilities to rebuild an inclusive future for all.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[A] Facing extreme isolation, breakdown of critical support services such as food, medication and healthcare as well as loss of rights-based supports, and disproportionately affected by the health, economic and social impacts of the pandemic.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[B] In the UK, people with intellectual disabilities were 6.3 times more likely to die and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://inclusion-international.org/a-global-agenda-post-covid/" rel="external">Inclusion International</a> found over 90% respondents reported reduced access to health/support services</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[C] Lack of support, access to the internet, accessible software and lack of access to learning materials is likely to deepen the gap for students with disabilities. Many have lost access to critical therapies, such as speech and language therapy, and support such as specific assistive devices or tailored education curricula that is only available in schools</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[D] About 90 per cent of countries are still reporting disruptions to essential health services, and available data from a few countries show pandemic has shortened life expectancy with the virus disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups inc. people with disabilities.</p>
</div>

<h3>Maintaining our momentum</h3>

<p>To reverse these trends, we need to build societies that are more resilient to humanitarian crises and fully inclusive and accessible for all people with disabilities, including people with intellectual disabilities, people with psychosocial disabilities and other marginalised groups. The UK is well placed to support international efforts, with our strong track record on disability inclusion and reputation as a dedicated implementing partner.</p>

<p>In 2021, the UK government launched the National Disability Strategy (NDS) which reconfirmed our commitment to supporting people with disabilities in the UK and around the world, and to put the needs and experiences of people with disabilities at the heart of government policy-making and service delivery<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup>. The NDS [E] recognises the critical role the UK has played in raising the profile of disability internationally and commits <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> to continuing this global leadership role.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[E] The NDS is underpinned by five areas that complement the UNCRPD and are reflected in this strategy: ensuring fairness and equality, considering disability from the start, supporting independent living, increasing participation, and working across organisational boundaries and improving data and evidence to better understand and respond to complex issues that affect disabled people.</p>
</div>

<p>We now need to build back better from global shocks by unlocking the full potential of people with disabilities at all levels in society. As a champion of freedom, democracy and universal human rights, the UK supports countries who choose to work towards greater social and economic freedoms for all. We will continue to showcase the benefits to inclusive democratic institutions and help partners, where welcome, to create fairer, more inclusive, and accountable systems. We will promote practical implementation of the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (<abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr>), for which the UK is also a signatory, to guide our work and the work of our partners.</p>

<p>Our approach will promote removing stigma, discriminatory and exclusionary beliefs, practices, laws and structures that prevent the full and equal participation of people with disabilities in society. We will support our partners to develop inclusive, accessible enabling environments and deliver truly inclusive public policy from the start. We will work in partnership with governments to effectively utilise our diplomatic influence, <abbr title="Official development assistance">ODA</abbr> and non-<abbr title="Official development assistance">ODA</abbr> spend and expertise to advance lasting reform that enables disability inclusion across our broader global network.</p>

<p>We will expand our focus on local leadership and locally-led change, steered by partner governments and the active involvement of people with disabilities and their representative organisations. We will facilitate and support development solutions which are informed by and respect people with disabilities’ lived experience, expertise, and knowledge on what works to transform their own lives. We will work towards embedding the meaningful participation, representation, and leadership from people with disabilities throughout our strategy, policy and programme development in our key intervention areas.</p>

<p>We will continue to work with partners to push for coordinated disability-inclusive COVID-19 responses<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup>, as we have done through the Global Action on Disability (GLAD) Network. We know people with disabilities, older people, and marginalised groups must be meaningfully involved in response and recovery efforts if we are to create a more sustainable, equitable and inclusive world.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s approach to disability</h2>

<h3>Our vision and key outcomes</h3>

<p>Towards 2030, our vision is a sustainable, inclusive and equitable future where:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">People with disabilities in all their diversity [F] - including marginalised and under-represented groups - are meaningfully engaged, empowered and able to exercise and enjoy their full rights and freedoms on an equal basis with others, without discrimination and across the life-course. They are full and active members of society and decision-makers in all aspects of life, including diplomatic and development efforts [G].</p>
</blockquote>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[F] Expanded to include the full and diverse range of persons with disabilities. According to General Comment 5 (UNCRPD/C/GC/5), para 70/General Comment 6 (UNCRPD/C/GC/6), para 33 this includes women, older people, children and adolescents, persons with psychosocial disabilities. intellectual disabilities and neurodiversity, persons with a genetic or neurological conditions, persons with rare and chronic diseases, persons with albinism, persons of diverse SOGIESC, indigenous persons, persons with disabilities in rural communities, victims of armed conflicts, persons with disabilities with an ethnic minority or migrant background.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[G] Reflective of the broader mandate of the integrated FCDO, this is inclusive of peace and stability, human safety and security, conflict resolution and poverty reduction.</p>
</div>

<p>To realise our vision, we will take concrete action towards four key outcomes for people with disabilities - Rights, Voice, Choice, and Visibility. This means:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>People with disabilities in all their diversity have full and equal enjoyment of all their RIGHTS and fundamental freedoms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People with disabilities have a greater VOICE through full and meaningful participation, representation and leadership in society and through their representative organisations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People with disabilities have more CHOICE and control in all aspects of their economic, political and social and cultural lives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People with disabilities have greater VISIBILITY through comprehensive, quality data and evidence enabling more responsive programmes, policies and systems.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These four outcomes are fundamental to all our work on disability inclusion. We will embed them across our diplomatic influencing, programmes, and UK leadership across the world.</p>

<h3>Our rights-based approach</h3>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> adopts a person-centred and human rights-based approach to disability inclusion that is underpinned by the <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr>.</p>

<p>A human rights-based approach to disability….</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…seeks ways to respect, support and celebrate human diversity by creating the conditions that allow meaningful participation by persons with disabilities.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Protecting and promoting their rights is not only about providing disability-related services. It is about adopting measures to change attitudes and behaviours that stigmatize and marginalize persons with disabilities.’
It is also about putting in place the policies, laws and programmes that remove barriers and guarantee the exercise of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights by persons with disabilities. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our approach is grounded in principles of dignity, non-discrimination and inclusive equality.</p>

<p>It is underpinned by British values and aligns with core <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> priorities, including unlocking the potential of women and girls.</p>

<p>We consider people with disabilities in all their diversity - inclusive of diverse sexual orientations, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC), ages, races, ethnicities, and indigenous identities - and consider the full range of experiences and requirements across the life-course.</p>

<p>We will continue to implement a ‘twin-track approach’ – mainstreaming a disability inclusive and human rights perspective across all our work, while providing targeted support to people with disabilities through disability-specific initiatives. Our approach will vary from country to country, in line with local needs, capabilities and UK partnerships.</p>

<p>Looking to 2030, we will build on our disability inclusion work in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring equitable, quality and inclusive education</li>
  <li>realising inclusive economic empowerment</li>
  <li>building inclusive social protection systems</li>
  <li>delivering inclusive humanitarian action</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also expand our ambition to include two new intervention areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advancing human rights, freedom and democracy</li>
  <li>achieving inclusive health for All</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the UK’s leadership on global climate action, we are introducing inclusive climate action, an emerging area for the disability community that we will develop and implement across our sectoral interventions. Supporting people to respond to and recover from COVID-19 and ‘building back’ a more disability-inclusive world will be crucial for our work.</p>

<p>We recognise our work must be built on strong foundations for sustainable and transformative change. We will embed three enablers for inclusion across our work: expanding our work on assistive technology, stepping-up efforts to strengthen OPDs and empowering all people with disabilities – including the most marginalised and under-represented.</p>

<p>We remain committed to tackling stigma and discrimination at all levels to ensure the rights, dignity, capabilities, and contributions of all people with disabilities are respected.</p>

<p>We recognise we must lead by example and live our values. We will work together with our staff with disabilities to fully embed disability inclusion within our culture and leadership.</p>

<h3>The wider framework</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise people with disabilities must have the opportunity to choose the way they want to live and participate in their community. We will work with people with disabilities to identify, address and remove physical, institutional, attitudinal, and information and communication barriers, using appropriate standards and guidelines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will work with people with disabilities, their representative organisations and our partners to create inclusive, accessible enabling environments and community services [K] that use principles of universal design and meet the diverse requirements of all people with disabilities. We will improve access to affordable, available and quality support and services that enable choice, dignity, autonomy and full participation of people with disabilities in society. We will include provision of timely, accurate, accessible information to support informed decision-making.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We continue to support the global commitment to shift from institutional care of children to community and family-based care. De-institutionalisation is a long-term process that requires quality, accessible and inclusive structures and services at both government and community levels. We will continue to tackle the underlying drivers of institutionalisation and strengthen protective systems for children with disabilities.</p>

<h3>Visibility</h3>

<p>Building a more complete and transparent evidence-base on the lived experience of people with disabilities, and strengthening collection, analysis and disaggregation of data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise limited data contributes to exclusion of people with disabilities by rendering their experiences invisible. Lack of reliable disaggregated data has been a significant barrier in exposing the scale of systemic exclusion and discrimination. We will continue to strengthen collection, analysis and disaggregation of robust and comparable data by disability, age, sex and geography using appropriate measurement tools such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/" rel="external">Washington Group Questions on disability</a>. We recommend the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/question-sets/wg-short-set-on-functioning-%e2%80%93-enhanced-wg-ss-enhanced/" rel="external">enhanced short set</a> but the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/question-sets/wg-short-set-on-functioning-wg-ss/" rel="external">short set</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/question-sets/wg-extended-set-on-functioning-wg-es/" rel="external">extended set</a> may be more appropriate in certain situations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will disaggregate data [L] to help us better understand the gaps that disadvantage people with disabilities and what works to improve their outcomes. We will use these datasets to design and implement effective interventions, working towards disability inclusion at scale. We will test interventions and use impact evaluations where appropriate, to support the development of context-specific, accessible, evidenced-based policies, programmes and services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will publish disaggregated data and disability prevalence data as a global public good wherever possible and work with the Washington Group to encourage others to do the same. Our flagship disability inclusion programmes will continue to contribute to the global evidence-base and we will share learning widely, using networks such as the Global Action on Disability (GLAD) Network as well as within <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Our key intervention areas</h2>

<h3>i. Advancing universal human rights, freedom and democracy</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> ambition</h4>

<p>For all people with disabilities to have full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, with respect for their inherent dignity and without discrimination; able to participate fully and effectively in society on an equal basis with others, including in political and public life both directly and through representation; and with the personal freedom to make informed choices in their own lives.</p>

<p>Respect for universal human rights and democratic freedoms is at the heart of the UK’s foreign policy. Our international initiatives and engagement on disability inclusion is underpinned by the <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr>*. Using our diplomatic influencing and UK leadership, we will champion the potential, freedoms, and agency of all people with disabilities through full enjoyment of all their rights and full, equal, and meaningful participation, representation and leadership in society. This intervention area is aligned with our ‘Rights’ outcome in the previous chapter.</p>

<p>*In line with Article 32, we will continue to promote international cooperation that is inclusive and, accessible for people with disabilities.</p>

<h4>Towards 2030 we will:</h4>

<p>1. Shape multilateral architecture and international rules to embed disability rights</p>

<p>We will influence key multilateral partners through our leadership and core funding, including the World Bank, IMF, G7/G20, the Commonwealth, UN bodies and support to the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy. We will continue to play a key role as a facilitator of international cooperation on disability inclusion through the Global Action on Disability (GLAD) network and Global Disability Summits, actively supporting practical implementation of globally agreed commitments. We will strengthen our work to ensure disability rights are embedded in General Assembly and UN Human Rights Council resolutions, including mainstreaming of disability in resolutions related to gender, decent work and tackling labour exploitation, global health and climate action, and identifying gaps where new resolutions are needed.</p>

<p>2. Support diverse meaningful participation and leadership in political and public life</p>

<p>We will support governments to increase the political participation and leadership of people with disabilities at all levels, including through meaningful engagement with people with disabilities and their representative organisations. We will promote greater diversity in public office, including women with disabilities and other under-represented groups, and more inclusive accessible election cycles. We will integrate people with disabilities into election observation roles, including participation in international election observation missions. The Westminster Foundation for Democracy and the Commonwealth, including the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, will continue to be key delivery partners.</p>

<p>3. Tackle discriminatory beliefs, practices, structures and systems at all levels</p>

<p>We will support creation of inclusive institutional environments to counter exclusion and discrimination on the basis of disability, including the deep-rooted unequal power relations experienced by women with disabilities. Through our programmatic work, we will continue to lead innovation in scaling up best practice to reduce stigma and discrimination for people with disabilities. We will encourage governments to establish and strengthen monitoring and accountability frameworks including resourced, independent National Human Rights Institutions with capacity to work on disability.</p>

<p><strong>Working with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD)</strong>: We continue to work closely with WFD and support their work to strengthen human rights by making countries’ political systems fairer, more inclusive, and more accountable. In 2020, WFD worked with the parliament in Sierra Leone to submit its first report on implementing the <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr> and the parliament of North Macedonia to adopt the Declaration for Active Political Participation of Persons with Disabilities. the Commonwealth Partnership for Democracy, led by WFD, has also helped 18 Commonwealth countries improve the representation of people with disabilities and other diversity groups. Successes includes training 3,000 student leaders in Ghana and supporting three disability rights bills in Kenya.</p>

<h3>ii. Ensuring equitable, quality and inclusive education</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> ambition</h4>

<p>For all children with disabilities to realise their right to education, equipped with the foundational skills and knowledge to lead fulfilling lives, and learn in an environment that is inclusive, accessible, safe from all forms of violence, and free from discrimination.</p>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> is committed to ensuring every child can realise their right to quality education. Inclusive education ensures all children can thrive, including the most marginalised girls and children with disabilities, without discrimination. As COVID-19 threatens to reverse 20 years of education gains<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote">[footnote 38]</a></sup>, children with disabilities have been disproportionately impacted and experienced increased exclusion, marginalisation, poverty, and vulnerability.</p>

<p>The UK has championed access to inclusive education and has helped children with disabilities to learn through our policies and programmes – including the DFID Education Policy 2018 and our Girls’ Education Challenge (GEC) Fund that is driving national policy reform on inclusive education, enhancing understanding and responses to disability and inclusive education in the sector. <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> continues to work with bilateral and multilateral partners to ensure children with disabilities in any setting are not left behind. We use our position on the global stage to promote the right to education as demonstrated during our G7 Presidency where we secured ambitious commitments [M] for global progress on girls’ education. At the national level, we have supported governments to create enabling policy environments and supported their implementation of inclusive education policies and priority programmes.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[M] During our G7 Presidency we secured agreement to work together and deliver access to school for 40 million more girls by 2026 and support 20 million more girls to be able to read by 2026 in low and lower-middle income countries.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/986027/FCDO-Girls-Education-Action-Plan.pdf" rel="external">Girls’ Education Action Plan</a> sets out our five year strategy for supporting the world’s most marginalised children into education. For all children, including children with disabilities, we will invest in quality teaching for all to secure foundational skills; focus on transforming education systems; and eliminate barriers marginalised girls, including girls with diverse disabilities, face accessing education.</p>

<p><strong>Promoting disability inclusion through the Girls’ Education Challenge Fund</strong>:  The Girls’ Education Challenge ‘Transition’ and ‘Leave No Girl Behind’ projects support some of the most marginalised girls and all are focused on equity and inclusion. In 2021, despite the challenges of COVID-19 and the multiple barriers and risks faced by girls with disabilities, re-enrolment rates in schools in several projects across Africa and Asia defied expectations, registering equal or higher than overall attendance patterns. Four key approaches underpinned this success: ensuring community support structures were mobilised to help disadvantaged girls learn and be kept safe during the school closure period; girls’ voices informing programme design; gender and social inclusion analysis; and prioritising targeted interventions to support at-risk girls with tailored learning support.</p>

<h4>Towards 2030 we will:</h4>

<p>1. Increase visibility of children with disabilities by contributing to the global evidence base and improving collection, analysis and use of disaggregated data</p>

<p>We will fund cutting-edge research and share learning from our education interventions on what works to reach children with disabilities. We will step-up our work with bilateral and multilateral programmes and partners, including the Global Partnership for Education and Education Cannot Wait (ECW), to improve collection, analysis and use of disability disaggregated data [N], for more responsive policy and programmes for children with disabilities. We will promote use of the Washington Group Question sets and the “Child Functioning Model”. We will strengthen the capacity of UNESCO’s Institute of Statistics and the Global Education Monitoring Report to track and report on the global progress of children with disabilities, with a focus on disaggregated data.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[N] Data must identify the number of children with disabilities in and out of school; document the experiences of children with disabilities in the education system; and identify the educational structures and resources required to deliver a school environment that is adequate.</p>
</div>

<p>$LegislativeList</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure children with disabilities in humanitarian and protracted crises are given an equal opportunity to learn in safe, inclusive, protective environments</li>
</ol>

<p>We will use our role as a leading donor to ECW to identify and reduce barriers faced by children with disabilities in accessing and benefitting from investments in quality education in emergency and protracted crisis settings. We will hold ECW to account for delivery of their Policy and Accountability Framework on Disability Inclusion. We will step up our work with partners, including governments and <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> agencies, to promote inclusive education responses in fragile and conflict affected settings - including through future <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> resolutions and humanitarian response plans.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prioritise interventions that tackle the barriers children with disabilities, especially girls with disabilities, experience in accessing quality education and learning</li>
</ol>

<p>We will adapt our education interventions to ensure they dismantle all forms of barriers children with disabilities face in accessing quality teaching and learning. Some programmes will mainstream inclusive practices, and some will look to provide targeted support for children with disabilities. We will demonstrate what works and how approaches can be taken to scale by governments and other partners. We will work with partner governments, learners with disabilities, their families, and their representative organisations to promote safe, inclusive and effective education systems. We will actively involve youth disability activists in the development of our girls’ education policy and programming. We will use our financial and technical support and influence in global funds to champion inclusive education strategies and frameworks, including supporting GPE to deepen and accelerate work on disability inclusion.</p>

<h3>iii. Achieving inclusive health for all</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> ambition</h4>

<p>For people with disabilities everywhere to access and use affordable, accessible, and quality health services throughout their life so they can make and act on informed decisions about their own health. This includes preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services, as well as sexual and reproductive health and rights services and assistive technology provision.</p>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> remains committed to improving health around the world through development, diplomacy and research. Our ambition for inclusive health for all is guided by our commitment to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and our co-sponsoring of the World Health Organisation (<abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr>) Resolution on the Highest Attainable Standard of Health for People with disabilities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup>. To achieve UHC and unlock transformational change in global health, people with disabilities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup> must be included; thus, equity and disability inclusion are central to <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s broader health objectives<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This work is underpinned by and will be put into practice through our own Health Systems Strengthening Position Paper<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup> (HSS) our Ending Preventable Deaths Approach Paper<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup> (EPD) and our Approach and Theory of Change to Mental Health and Psychosocial Support.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup>  We will work to remove barriers to equal, affordable, accessible and quality health services and ensure people with disabilities have access to gender-sensitive health services including <abbr title="Sexual and reproductive health and rights">SRHR</abbr>, <abbr title="Water, sanitation and hygiene">WASH</abbr> and nutrition programmes, rehabilitation, assistive technology<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:45" rel="footnote">[footnote 45]</a></sup>, medicines and vaccines.</p>

<h4>Towards 2030 we will:</h4>

<p>1. Influence disability inclusion through our bilateral, multilateral and partner engagement and diplomacy</p>

<p>We will mainstream disability inclusion through our global health work including on WASH, SRHR and nutrition. We will work with our bilateral and multilateral partners within our portfolio of health investments to incorporate disability inclusion as part of their operations, including the WHO, World Bank, Unitaid and the Global Fund, our global advocacy programmes such as the Partnership for Maternal, New-born and Child Health, FP2030, and others. We will use opportunities to work with new global health initiatives to promote greater disability inclusion, building on good practice and ensuring we include people with disabilities in our health-related programmes. This includes our work around WASH, accessible and integrated health service delivery, inclusive nutrition guidance, and accessible SRHR Programmes. We will work with our bilateral programmes at country-level, applying a disability inclusion lens.</p>

<p>2. Ensure data, data systems, research and evidence shape inclusive health systems</p>

<p>We will work with countries to strengthen their capacity to collect and disaggregate health data by disability, to better understand health needs and barriers to accessing health services and monitoring health outcomes. We will support them to use the WGQ sets<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote">[footnote 46]</a></sup> in routine monitoring and nationwide surveys where possible, building up an evidence base of who is excluded and what works to include them as highlighted in our EPD approach paper<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:47" rel="footnote">[footnote 47]</a></sup>. We will explore how research can help us identify ways to improve disability inclusion in health systems.</p>

<p>3. Support advocacy, inclusion and meaningful participation of people with disabilities</p>

<p>We will facilitate community empowerment by supporting advocacy, inclusion and increased visibility of people with disabilities in our health investments, bringing their voices to decision-making where possible and promoting greater accountability in governance structures. We will engage with representative groups through our partnerships and programming, building the capacity of those Organisations of Persons with Disabilities most excluded and supporting greater awareness of disability inclusion. We will also strive to ensure women and girls with disabilities in all their diversity can access their full Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights services through influencing global advocacy programmes such as the Partnership for Maternal, New-born and Child Health.</p>

<p><strong>Engaging the <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr> on disability inclusion</strong>: through its £340m (2020-2024) core voluntary contribution, <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> is supporting priorities across the <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr>’s 13th Global Programme of Work, including disability inclusion. <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> will work with the <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr> to support the implementation by Member States of the recommendations contained in the <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr> Resolution on the Highest Attainable Standard of Health for Persons with Disabilities. As part of this resolution, the UK, will influence the development of the Global Report on the Highest Attainable Standard of Health for Persons with Disabilities, through technical support and promoting the recommendations, as well as providing case studies and good practice examples from the UK. We will prioritise our advocacy work, including through the <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr> Governing Bodies, to mainstream a disability-inclusive approach into national policies and planning through encouraging active engagement and inclusion of people with disabilities.</p>

<h3>iv. Realising inclusive economic empowerment</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> Ambition</h4>

<p>For all people with disabilities to have access, choice, voice and control over economic assets, opportunities and outcomes, including equal access to decent jobs, livelihoods, finance and infrastructure.</p>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s work in economic empowerment spans many sectors and approaches, from mobilising job opportunities to making development finance work for people with disabilities. Through our programmes, such as ‘The Skills For Jobs India’ programme and ‘Youth Skills for Economic Growth’ programme, people with disabilities have found employment in the private sector and started their own businesses. We have funded programmes to address barriers into employment through UK Aid Connect, supported youth entrepreneurship through the ‘Private Sector Strategic Partnership’ in Kenya, and expanded our successful BRAC initiative under the Disability inclusive Development programme. We have continued our work on the provision of accessible transport, which is key for connecting people with disabilities to jobs.</p>

<p>Effective inclusive economic empowerment means all people with disabilities can achieve income security, advance economically and have the power and autonomy to make economic decisions within and outside the home. Given the diversity of people with disabilities and the different barriers and discrimination they experience, <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> will promote multiple pathways to economic empowerment for people with disabilities in our work. <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> will continue to support the meaningful inclusion of people with disabilities and their representative organisations in the planning, budgeting, management and governance of economic interventions, such as in urban planning, to ensure they are accessible, inclusive and sustainable<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:48" rel="footnote">[footnote 48]</a></sup>. We recognise multiple intersecting factors all have a crucial role in ensuring access to decent work for people with disabilities in waged employment, self-employment or the informal sector [O].</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[O] Including the nature of the economy; enabling laws and policies; adequate infrastructure and services; and equal access to resources, assets, information, technologies and networks.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Working through British International Investment (BII) on disability inclusion</strong>: In 2021 BII, the UK’s Development Finance Institution, published a guidance note on disability inclusion for fund managers through its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Toolkit. This will be used as a benchmark across the industry, ensuring that disability inclusion matters to fund managers and is taken into account by the companies they fund. BII is raising awareness in demonstrating best practice to the investor community to consider people with disabilities in their investment and to address the barriers to disability inclusion. Disability inclusion has also been embedded in BII’s new Policy of Responsible Investing. Going forward <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> will continue to work with BII to increase ambition on this agenda and support the economic empowerment of people with disabilities.</p>

<h4>Towards 2030 we will:</h4>

<p>1. Disaggregate data to assess impact and opportunities across our economic development programmes</p>

<p>In line with the Inclusive Data Charter, we will disaggregate data by disability, age and sex through more systematic application of the Washington Group Questions wherever possible, so differential outcomes and impact become visible. We will encourage our partners to do the same, especially around job measurement, access to finance and beneficiary reach. Programmes will work from the outset to consider their impact on people with disabilities and address inclusion, setting out clear, meaningful actions to increase positive outcomes, track and report on this throughout the programme cycle and share good practice.</p>

<p>2. Enhance full and meaningful economic and social participation of people with disabilities</p>

<p>We will support people with disabilities as entrepreneurs, leaders, employers and employees. We will expand access to skills, quality jobs and livelihoods throughout our work, and support businesses to target people with disabilities as consumers of goods and services. We will engage with different actors, including but not limited to the private sector and international financial institutions, to remove barriers hindering the empowerment and inclusion of people with disabilities in the economy, especially in the context of COVID-19 economic recovery. We will seek meaningful two-way participation and involvement of people with disabilities and their representative organisations across our economic development work.</p>

<p>3. Address systematic barriers to economic empowerment and increase access to economic assets through disability-inclusive infrastructure</p>

<p>We will invest in and strengthen our approach to accessible, disability-inclusive, universally designed infrastructure, which will enable delivery of better connected and more inclusive cities and infrastructure services for all - ensuring people with disabilities can access services, jobs and amenities and fully participate in society. Whenever we engage with governments on their infrastructure strategies and city plans, we will promote the application of universal design concepts and collaboration with diverse groups including people with disabilities.</p>

<h3>v. Building inclusive social protection systems</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> ambition</h4>

<p>For all people with disabilities to realise their right to social protection, protecting them against poverty and risks to their livelihoods and wellbeing throughout their lives and supporting their economic empowerment and participation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> is committed to progressive realisation of Universal Social Protection, whereby any person who needs social protection can access it at any time. We have a strong record of supporting delivery of more disability inclusive social protection policies, programmes and systems. Through our investments and influence we will support governments to develop social protection systems that are more inclusive of people with disabilities and their families throughout their lives and address their greater exposure to life cycle and large-scale shocks that reduce wellbeing and compound poverty.</p>

<p>The ‘Leave No One Behind’ programme provides technical assistance and financial aid to the Government of Ghana, focusing on social protection and realising the rights of people with disabilities and mental health conditions, while our ‘top up’ grants have supported senior citizens with severe disabilities in Uganda.  Our COVID-19 technical assistance facility (SPACE) is providing advice on disability and age inclusive social protection responses to country teams and partner governments. We continue to work with others to develop disability-specific social protection tools and guidance [P] and we are strengthening the evidence base in the light of increasing need under COVID-19<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:49" rel="footnote">[footnote 49]</a></sup>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[P] Including through the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD).</p>
</div>

<p>We will promote a twin track approach through more inclusive and adapted mainstream social protection and targeted disability-specific programmes so that both basic economic and disability-related care and support requirements are met. We will work to ensure that social protection systems enable people with disabilities to exercise choice and control in their lives and support their economic and social participation.  We will prioritise ensuring that social protection policies and programmes are rights-based, promote the voice of people with disabilities, and take into consideration the diversity of disability and support requirements.</p>

<h4>Towards 2030 we will:</h4>

<p>1. Improve systematic collection and use of disaggregated data and knowledge</p>

<p>We will work with governments and partners to strengthen capacity to collect, analyse, and use quality disaggregated data, and encourage integration of the WGQs into household surveys, information and monitoring and evaluation systems. We will invest in evidence and share learning and good practice. This is critical to understand and address requirements, coverage, barriers to access, and impacts of social protection on the lives of people with disabilities and their households, in order to better design and adapt social protection policies and programmes so they are more accessible and effective.</p>

<p>2. Strengthen social protection policies, strategies, programmes and systems</p>

<p>We will support governments to improve the accessibility, adequacy and coverage of their social protection systems for people with disabilities, through our investments in systems strengthening, technical assistance and knowledge, drawing on local OPDs with relevant expertise. We will support the development of disability-specific and sensitive social protection tools and guidance. We will strengthen the capacity of OPDs to engage and advise on policy and programme design and monitoring. We will support governments to strengthen linkages between social protection and other services and interventions (e.g. health, education and employment) to improve the economic opportunities and wellbeing of people with disabilities, especially the most marginalised and underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>3. Increase global and national focus on disability-inclusive social protection</p>

<p>For maximum impact, we will use our influence and work with likeminded partners and OPDs to increase the visibility of the importance of disability-inclusive social protection and galvanise greater attention to it in global initiatives and country-level dialogue. We will work together to develop capacity and share guidance to shift policy and practice. We will actively encourage our multilateral partners to mainstream disability inclusion into their social protection policies and operations, in order to improve accessibility and coverage of mainstream programmes, and to extend disability-specific programmes.</p>

<p><strong>Ghana’s flagship social protection programme and disability inclusion</strong>: <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> Ghana commissioned a Rapid Scoping Study of the Government of Ghana’s flagship social protection programme, Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), to strengthen disability inclusion in their successor programme. The recommendations have been discussed jointly with government and OPDs to develop an Action Plan owned by the Government of Ghana. This includes priority actions to strengthen disability inclusion from policy and design (e.g., using the Washington Group questions (WGQs) in two national questionnaires) through to implementation (e.g. undertaking a safeguarding review to assess risks to women with disabilities at Paypoint distribution sites). Progress is already being made under the Action Plan with training of enumerators to use the WGQs and an advisory group of OPDs that will include a Disability Monitoring Taskforce. The Taskforce will monitor and identify gaps, experiences and opportunities for disability inclusion in the LEAP programme and provide recommendations and technical advice.</p>

<h3>vi. Delivering inclusive humanitarian action</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> ambition</h4>

<p>For all people with disabilities affected by crises to have equitable access to essential services, in safety and dignity and without discrimination; with unrestricted opportunities to hold humanitarian actors accountable for adequately responding to their diverse needs; and an active role in the planning, delivery and monitoring of crisis anticipation, response and recovery.</p>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> is committed to ensuring humanitarian response efforts deliver on inclusion in crises. At the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit, the UK signed up to the Charter on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action  which enshrines the principles of dignity, equality and non-discrimination of persons with disabilities in all humanitarian action. In all our humanitarian work, the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> adheres to guidance under Article 11 of the <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr> which commits States to all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters.</p>

<p>We have promoted data disaggregation through new e-learning on how to use the Washington Group Questions in humanitarian settings and improved the evidence base of what works in disability inclusive humanitarian responses. We have pursued reform of the international humanitarian system to ensure disability inclusion is effectively and comprehensively addressed and have been successful in ensuring the inclusion of psychosocial support in the Global Compact on Refugees and in UNHCR updated guidance.  With the government of Poland, in 2019 we co-led the first ever <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Security Council Resolution on disability inclusion in armed conflict.</p>

<p>We will work to make our international responses better reflect the voices, requirements, experience, and aspirations of affected populations and in particular marginalised groups, including people with disabilities. We will prioritise improving access to essential services for crisis-affected people in safety and dignity and without discrimination, taking into account specific challenges and barriers that could be faced by people with protected characteristics including disability.  We will continue to lead and influence others to strive for long-term system-wide change.</p>

<h4>Towards 2030 we will:</h4>

<p>1. Hold the international humanitarian system to account in ensuring disability inclusion is effectively integrated across humanitarian response through fulfilment of minimum standards by all actors</p>

<p>We will promote the routine, systematic collection and use of data on the impact of crises and humanitarian action on people with disabilities to inform humanitarian programme and policy [Q]. We will continue to build the capacity of humanitarian actors to incorporate disability data into the humanitarian programme cycle and require all core delivery partners to demonstrate progress on the collection and use of data disaggregated by disability. We will support the operationalisation of the IASC Guidelines on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:51" rel="footnote">[footnote 51]</a></sup> and adherence to Humanitarian Inclusion Standards<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:52" rel="footnote">[footnote 52]</a></sup> through core delivery partners, inter-agency mechanisms, encouraging participation by networks of local and national women-led and women’s rights organisations and organisations of persons with disabilities [R]. We will also hold our partners to account for commitments made at GDS18 and where opportunities arise engage with networks of OPDs in humanitarian systems reform.</p>

<p>Across <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>, we will advocate for the safety and protection of all people with disabilities in humanitarian crises. We will promote and increase accountability for inclusion of marginalised groups with disabilities in humanitarian gender-based violence prevention and response. We will encourage research and learning from <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> Posts to better understand how gender and age intersect with disability to amplify needs and experiences of exclusion, working particularly with women and girls with disabilities. With core delivery partners, we will promote adequate and appropriate provision of essential services required to meet the distinct needs of people with disabilities, including protection from physical, sexual and psychological violence. We will place greater focus on mental health and psychosocial support, including for peoples with disabilities, through our education in emergencies work [T] including our global Education Cannot Wait programme.</p>

<h3>vii. Emerging intervention area: inclusive climate action</h3>

<p>People with disabilities are disproportionately impacted by climate change<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:53" rel="footnote">[footnote 53]</a></sup>. They are more likely to be directly and indirectly severely impacted by climate related disasters<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:54" rel="footnote">[footnote 54]</a></sup>, and less likely to have the information and resources available to respond and adapt to climate change impacts. Building on the UK’s COP 26 presidency, we will develop this emerging area to strengthen and accelerate disability-inclusive climate action.</p>

<h4>Towards 2030 we will:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Step-up embedding disability considerations in our International Climate Finance portfolio. We will initially focus on building more inclusive adaptation and resilience, sustainable and accessible physical environments, promoting locally-led developments and clean energy which is accessible to all.</li>
  <li>Invest in more robust research and evidence on disability inclusive climate action guided by a climate justice framework.  We will also build our internal capability to conduct fully inclusive Environmental Assessments and Climate Risk Analysis.  In line with the UK’s commitment to align all programme spend with the Paris Agreement, we will ensure that new programming under the disability and inclusion agenda includes a climate and environment risk assessment.</li>
  <li>Work in partnership with key allies to accelerate global attention and action including through key funds [U], to institutionalise disability inclusion in their work.</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Enablers for inclusion</h2>

<p>COVID-19 has shown how fragile disability inclusion efforts can be if they are not built on the right foundations. We know there are fundamental building blocks<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:55" rel="footnote">[footnote 55]</a></sup>  that together support the creation of enabling environments for people with disabilities. While we utilise all these enablers  in our disability inclusion work, we are stepping up on assistive technology, strengthening OPDs, and supporting the empowerment of people with disabilities in all their diversity – including the most marginalised and under-represented.</p>

<h3>Assistive technology</h3>

<p>Appropriate accessible and affordable assistive technology (<abbr title="Assistive technology and products">AT</abbr>), including wheelchairs, prosthetics and orthotics, spectacles, hearing-aids and digital devices, is a key enabler for change. <abbr title="Assistive technology and products">AT</abbr> is critical for inclusion and transformative for people with disabilities and older people. It is an area where UK science and innovation is world leading. We will build on the success of the AT2030 programme which tests ‘what works’ to improve access to <abbr title="Assistive technology and products">AT</abbr>, and extend our support to <abbr title="Assistive technology and products">AT</abbr> research and innovation to reach more people. We will continue to assess and address market barriers in Africa and the Indo-Pacific, and develop and scale context specific <abbr title="Assistive technology and products">AT</abbr> innovations, business models and access to finance.</p>

<p>We will continue to support the UK’s Global Disability Innovation Hub, a global centre of expertise for <abbr title="Assistive technology and products">AT</abbr> and <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr>’s <abbr title="Assistive technology and products">AT</abbr> Collaboration Centre. We will build partnerships with UK and LMIC institutions and catalyse investment capital from the Private Sector and multilateral institutions, learning from the best UK innovators, and sharing best practice with global stakeholders. We will continue to support ATscale, the global partnership to catalyse action on <abbr title="Assistive technology and products">AT</abbr>, whose ambition is to reach 500 million people with life-changing <abbr title="Assistive technology and products">AT</abbr> by 2030. We will bridge the disability divide through mobile and digital technologies that can link excluded people to education, jobs, finance and markets and create opportunities for marginalised voices to be heard.</p>

<h3>Strengthening OPDs</h3>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> is committed to strengthening delivery, leadership, and decision-making by people with disabilities through their local and national representative organisations in line with the principle of ‘nothing about us without us’. We will step up the close consultation and active involvement of OPDs in our work in alignment with the <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr>. We will continue to build the organisational capacity of OPDs, particularly those representing marginalised groups, through training, technical assistance, participatory grant-making and research.  We will partner with OPDs in the delivery of programmes and policy objectives and implement feedback mechanisms. We will start by encouraging connections between people with disabilities, <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> posts, and national governments in country, providing guidance and training to posts and learning and improving over time. We will continue to invest in our strategic partnerships, such as the Global Action on Disability Network (GLAD) to co-ordinate our efforts, and work with the International Disability Alliance and other key partners to strengthen OPDs and build relationships with wider civil society. We will also engage with people with disabilities outside the formal movement. We will promote the inclusion of people with disabilities in COVID-19 response and recovery and we will continue to support OPDs to cope with the impact of the pandemic [V].</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[V] Identification of enablers varies across organisations, including the Disability Rights Fund, CBM, the World Federation of Deaf Blind, and the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. They can include but are not limited to accessibility, strengthening OPDs, participation and empowerment of people with disabilities, community-based development, disability-inclusive support services and assistive technologies.</p>
</div>

<h3>Supporting empowerment of all people with disabilities</h3>

<p>People with disabilities represent a diverse population. Their priorities, requirements and experiences depend on a complex and dynamic interaction between their individual characteristics and external factors<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:56" rel="footnote">[footnote 56]</a></sup>. We know people with disabilities who experience multiple, intersecting and compounding forms of discrimination are likely to be amongst the most left behind [W].</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[W] The experience of people with disabilities differs dramatically due to the multiple and intersecting identities they experience, including their SOGIESC, age, ethnicity, race, location, socio-economic status, legal status and other factors.</p>
</div>

<p>We remain committed to our ‘Leave No One Behind’ promise to prioritise the furthest behind and most excluded. We will continue to prioritise the inclusion and rights of marginalised and under-represented groups in all our work on disability inclusion. This includes people with intellectual disabilities and their families, who have been excluded from the vast majority of mainstream and disability-specific interventions. They have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and must be included in response and recovery efforts. Our flagship disability programmes will continue to work with marginalised populations with disabilities to reflect and respond to their priorities and requirements, and equip OPDs to be representative of all people with disabilities - including those with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p>

<h4>Women and girls with disabilities</h4>

<p>This strategy is fully aligned with the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s priority to unlock the potential, agency and freedoms of women and girls in all their diversity. We continue to work to ‘Leave no girl or woman behind’ and focus where progress is slowest because of intersecting discrimination or disadvantage, including for women and girls with disabilities. We will work across our overlapping priorities and invest in accelerators for gender-transformative and disability-inclusive change in services, provisions and policies that promote progress at scale. Women with disabilities are particularly excluded - marginalised and discriminated for their gender as well as for their disability - and we will identify opportunities to support their voice and agency. We will challenge and change discriminatory social, ableist and gender norms and unequal power relations and gender roles, including negative attitudes and discriminatory practices, laws and regulations.</p>

<p>We will equip our staff and delivery partners with the skills, tools and knowledge to better integrate gender equality and disability inclusion in their work. We will challenge orchestrated attempts to rollback disability and gender rights on national and international fronts, protecting and progressing gender equality and disability rights. We will support and listen to diverse local civil society, particularly women’s rights organisations and OPDs, and encourage their work to be mutually supportive and collaborative.</p>

<h4>LGBT+ people with disabilities</h4>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> upholds the rights and freedoms of all LGBT+ people who should be accorded the same dignity, respect and rights as other citizens. We will promote tolerance and non-discrimination against LGBT+ people with disabilities and address discriminatory laws.</p>

<p>We will also support representative organisations of LGBT+ people with disabilities where possible, to increase access to accessible and appropriate services and support. We will encourage the voice and participation of LGBT+ people with disabilities, including at our first global LGBT+ conference, ‘Safe To be Me’ in June 2022.</p>

<h4>Older people</h4>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> takes a life course approach, aiming to protect the rights of all people at all stages of their lives. We will continue to consider the diverse experiences, priorities and requirements of older people, many of whom have disabilities, impacting their autonomy, dignity and social participation. We recognise the critical role of older people and their representative organisations, including older women and widows of all ages who face additional discrimination and abuse.</p>

<p>We will continue to include age as an important dimension across our work, engaging closely with <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> bodies [X], and supporting <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> resolutions on the human rights of older people and widows and encouraging our partners to do the same. We are supportive in principle for a multilateral instrument dedicated to the human rights of older people. We will invest in improving collection, analysis and use of age disaggregated data and will remain a key stakeholder in the Titchfield City Group on ageing to support this work.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[X] Including OCHA, UNFPA, WHO, OHCHR, the Open Ended Working Group on Ageing and the Human Rights Council.</p>
</div>

<h4>Mental health and psychosocial support</h4>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> recognises all people with psychosocial and mental health conditions as rights holders, entitled to meaningfully participate in the decisions that affect their lives with free and informed choice. The UK champions a comprehensive and rights-based approach, as set out in the 2020 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/an-approach-and-theory-of-change-to-mental-health-and-psychosocial-support">Approach and Theory of Change to Mental Health and Psychosocial Support</a> [Y] which provides practical advice to <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> staff. We will support the meaningful participation of people with psychosocial disabilities and mental health conditions, including as part of our work with OPDs and in crisis responses [Z].</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[Y] Developed in consultation with the mental health sector, this promotes wellbeing for all, improves access to quality services and support, and realises the full rights and inclusion of people with psychosocial disabilities. It is underpinned by equitable accessible interventions for all.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>[Z] Crisis responses include opportunities to improve rights-based mental health systems, services and support that respect the rights of people with disabilities and increase resilience.</p>
</div>

<p>We will strengthen the skills and expertise of <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> staff through knowledge sharing, learning forums and networks.  We will work to address experiences of rights violations, coercion, negative attitudes and discriminatory norms, policies, laws and practices. We will use diplomatic opportunities to promote a rights-based approach and encourage partners to implement commitments under the <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr>, the Sustainable Development Goals (<abbr title="United Nations Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr>) and <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr> Mental Health Action Plan.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Mainstreaming disability inclusion</h2>

<p>The creation of <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> brought together a vast network of more than 280 offices worldwide. Equality and inclusion remain at the heart of our integrated approach. We aim to mainstream disability inclusion across the full breadth of the global network over time, adapted to country priorities and capabilities. We will champion disability rights through internal leadership and culture, engaging with people with disabilities, strengthening data and evidence, and using our enablers for inclusion. Our ‘Rights, Voice, Choice, Visibility’ outcomes reflect this approach. We will do this through policy, diplomacy, influencing, programming, procurement and safeguarding. We will learn and share lessons as we go.</p>

<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>Our work on disability inclusion fits within a broad approach to equalities that encourages collaborative work to empower women and girls, people with disabilities, and other socially marginalised groups. We will use a continuum that moves from ‘equality awareness’ to ‘equality transformation’. As a minimum, teams must comply with UK legislation and do no harm, for example not reinforcing inequalities or creating additional safeguarding risks. This is not intended as a static model but will support <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> to develop and adapt approaches to equalities and disability inclusion in line with local needs, capabilities and partnerships. We will use this strategy to guide and support disability-inclusive policies across the organisation.</p>

<h3>Diplomacy and influencing</h3>

<p>We will use our reputation and voice as a global leader on disability inclusion to accelerate change for people with disabilities, through our diplomatic network and position in national and international fora and partnerships. We will work through our strategic partnerships and make the most of key high-level moments, such as forthcoming Global Disability Summits.</p>

<p>We will defend and advance disability rights and non-discrimination and encourage countries to put in place the polices, practices and legislation needed to adhere to the <abbr title="United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (used interchangeably with CRPD)">UNCRPD</abbr>. We will influence national governments and multilateral partners to do more using Board meetings and bilateral discussions. We will continue to provide expert technical advice to governments and international partners, ensuring the priorities and requirements of people with disabilities are central to COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. We will work with the private sector, building on our work with British Investment International to influence financial institutions and set standards.</p>

<p>We will continue to spearhead the global exchange of knowledge and evidence on disability inclusion. We will actively contribute to the evidence-base with new interventions and collection, analysis and use of disaggregated data to improve responses.</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s new Programme Operating Framework sets out clear rules that outline expectations for all policy and programme delivery. Equalities are embedded into the ruleset, the principles and the overarching vision. A new rule explicitly states: “all programmes (and policies) must consider and provide evidence, where relevant, on how their interventions will impact on gender equality, disability inclusion and those with protected characteristics”. Underpinning this are four guiding principles – that our work must do no harm; have clear accountability; include context-specific analysis and participation of excluded groups (including organisations of persons with disabilities); and be firmly evidence-based.</p>

<p><abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> expects programme teams to take a systemic approach to disability inclusion within programming. Programme templates, such as Business Cases and Annual Reviews, contain prompts to ensure staff are addressing and monitoring the impacts of our programmes on excluded groups, including people with disabilities. Guidance and training will be available, including on disability-sensitive Gender Equalities and Social Inclusion analysis. We will work with partners across government so that the UK’s Official Development Assistance is disability inclusive.</p>

<h3>Procurement</h3>

<p>We continue to harness <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s purchasing power to benefit people with disabilities. We are applying the Social Value Model and relevant award criteria to our procurements over the Government Purchasing Agreement threshold. <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s Standard Terms and Conditions of Contract and Supply Partner Code of Conduct include requirements on non-discrimination, equality and social inclusion, and our guidance supports <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> teams to consider disability inclusion throughout the procurement process. Through our supply engagement practices we will place an expectation on <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s delivery partners to demonstrate their technical understanding of, and commitment to, disability inclusion, including consulting and engaging with people with disabilities.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding</h3>

<p>Sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment (<abbr title="Sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>) is unacceptable in the aid sector. The UK set out our vision and action on safeguarding against <abbr title="Sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-strategy-safeguarding-against-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse-and-sexual-harassment-within-the-aid-sector">strategy published in September 2020</a>. People with disabilities are disproportionately at risk of <abbr title="Sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr>, and women, children and those displaced with disabilities are at greatest risk. Through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ablechildafrica.org/news/6759/" rel="external">Able Child Africa</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://safeguardingsupporthub.org/documents/tip-sheet-people-disabilities-and-safeguarding-journey" rel="external">Resource and Support Hub</a> we are supporting the production of guidance for organisations working in the sector. We will continue to strive to improve <abbr title="Sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment">SEAH</abbr> prevention and response in all programmes and across the wider aid sector, paying specific attention to safeguarding people with disabilities.</p>

<h3>Learning and development</h3>

<p>We will equip our staff and delivery partners with skills, tools and knowledge on disability inclusion. The <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> ‘International Academy’ will offer new training on equalities and disability inclusion to staff across the organisation. We will ensure staff are well briefed on risks to people with disabilities and modifications needed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.</p>

<p>We have a community of disability inclusion champions across <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> to support teams by sharing learning and good practice, as well our Social Development network and other <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> communities. Expert advice, tailored training and research and analysis is provided by the Disability Inclusive Development programme and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sddirect.org.uk/our-work/disability-inclusion-helpdesk/" rel="external">disability helpdesk facility</a>. We will continue to invest in high-quality research, monitoring and evaluation and to disseminate this knowledge within and beyond <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>. This includes <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s Programme for Evidence to Inform Disability Action (PENDA) and Disability Inclusive Development (<abbr title="Disability Inclusive Development">DID</abbr>) programme leading our research and evaluation into what works at a programmatic level. We will continue to mainstream disability inclusion across our research programmes.</p>

<h3>Geographic focus and high achievement standards</h3>

<p>We will progressively work towards higher standards in individual posts and departments who are striving to champion disability rights. Initial attention will be focused on two regions: Africa and parts of the Indo-Pacific region. We will draw on our development and diplomatic expertise and build on our existing development partnerships to protect, promote and progress the freedoms, rights and dignity of people with disabilities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Living our values</h2>

<p>From the outset, the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> has committed to putting inclusion at the heart of the organisation. We believe we must lead by example and live the values we are projecting internationally within our own workplace. As a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disability-confident-guidance-for-levels-1-2-and-3/level-3-disability-confident-leader">Disability Confident Leader</a>, we commit to ensuring a kind and respectful organisation, which provides a supportive, inclusive, accessible and equitable working environment and organisational culture for all staff with disabilities.</p>

<p>We recognise our staff with disabilities must have a workplace and a working pattern that enables them to thrive, supporting their best work as well as their physical and emotional wellbeing. We are committed to ensuring all staff with disabilities are supported to reach their full potential across the organisation, at all levels and in all roles, including international deployments. This includes staff with disabilities in all their diversity; long-term conditions including invisible and dynamic conditions; neurodivergent staff; staff with mental health conditions; and staff who are parents of children with disabilities and/or carers.</p>

<p>We are committed to attracting, recruiting and developing staff with disabilities, recognising <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> is below the working age average in its proportion of staff with disabilities, most notably at senior levels. To address this, we will maintain and build on our existing work. We will uphold our guarantee to interview anyone with a disability whose application meets minimum criteria. We will continue to support employees to reach their potential through access to workplace adjustments, and development programmes such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/how-we-can-help/leadership" rel="external">Disability Rights UK Leadership Academy Programme</a>. We will go further to embed the systems and policies needed to build and strengthen a diverse and disability inclusive talent pipeline, working to build staff capability with targeted interventions for staff with disabilities, and support managers to identify and nurture potential.</p>

<p>We have enthusiastic and active disability related employee networks for staff with disabilities and disability allies. These include the Disability Inclusion and Awareness Network; Cancer Support Network; Mental Health, Wellbeing and Listening Network; Parents of Children with Disabilities and <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> Carers. They are supported in their work by senior inclusion sponsors.  We recognise the ongoing challenges and barriers faced by staff with disabilities, and our responsibility to listen and act on their feedback in a transparent, accountable, and systematic way. We commit to meaningfully including and amplifying the voices of staff with disabilities in the decisions that affect them.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> Board commits to working through this strategy to consult with these networks to understand and address issues raised including: how best to tackle experiences of bullying, harassment and discrimination; recruitment; and access to and implementation of workplace adjustments, including for those overseas. The networks provide a strong accountability mechanism for <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> and encourage consistent vocal leadership and strong signalling on disability from all levels in the organisation.</p>

<h3>Towards 2030</h3>

<p>In the newly merged <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>, we have an opportunity to look afresh at how we do disability inclusion across the organisation. We know we have work to do - our aspiration must be matched with action and our commitments with delivery. We want to be leaders not just in the creation of trail-blazing disability inclusion policy but also in its implementation. This means learning from what has worked, what has not, and identifying where transformation is needed across our culture, equipment, systems and processes.</p>

<p>We will use the four pillars of the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> Inclusion Framework (Achieving Potential; Fair Treatment; Building a Supportive Working Environment; and Mutual Respect and Kindness) to develop a disability inclusion delivery plan which empowers, equips and enables employees with disabilities/long term conditions to reach their full potential. We will ensure the plan is based on the lived experience of staff with disabilities and drives concrete, evidence based, action. We commit to work in partnership with our networks and sponsors on the development and implementation of this plan.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> is a member of the Business Disability Forum, including their Global Taskforce. We will draw on this expertise and ensure the plan reflects best practice. Through consultation we will consider how to ensure the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Providing fair and equal opportunities for <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> employees, breaking down barriers that could prevent talented staff with disabilities from succeeding and employing targeted interventions to support their timely progress and development at all levels, including towards senior management.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understanding how we attract and recruit staff with disabilities in all their diversity, including challenges around the Disability Confident recruitment process so we can improve implementation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Promoting a culture of inclusion at all levels in the organisation and investing in activity to prevent bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual harassment against employees with disabilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensuring employees and managers know how to access and implement workplace adjustments, including through effective use of Workplace Adjustment Passports. Adjustments could include flexible working patterns, adapted equipment, specialist software.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Promoting awareness, understanding and implementation of disability inclusion through access to training and resources, as well as sharing good practice across the organisation. This includes ensuring line managers are equipped meet the needs of staff with disabilities and nurture their talent and development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building on our Disability Confident Leader accreditation to work across our corporate departments to understand how we ensure our HR, Estate, IT, communications, events and commercial practices are inclusive, accessible and welcoming to those with disabilities.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Accountability</h2>

<h3>Governance</h3>

<p>Equalities is embedded into the four governance boards in the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>: the Strategy Committee, the Delivery Committee, the Investment Committee and the People’s Committee. Collectively these boards will hold senior responsibility for the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s obligations on equality including implementation of this strategy. Oversight from senior leaders across <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> will provide strategic direction for our work on equalities in a way that is rooted in practical realities.</p>

<p>An External Disability Board of experts will provide advice and expertise on the implementation of the strategy. The board will meet twice a year, chaired by a senior <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr> official.</p>

<h3>Monitoring, evaluation and learning</h3>

<p>The strategy will be monitored using a framework based on the following.</p>

<p>The strategy will be underpinned by a delivery plan developed with meaningful participation from people with disabilities and their representative organisations. We will report progress to the External Disability Board and share practical learning and guidance on the implementation of the strategy across <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>. <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s commitments at successive Global Disability Summits will be monitored through established public accountability mechanisms led by the <abbr title="Global Disability Summit">GDS</abbr> Secretariat.</p>

<p>We know that much will change over the years to 2030. We will consult with OPDs to make sure we respond to their priorities. We will review the strategy and delivery plan periodically, starting after the end of the UK Government’s Spending Review period in 2025.</p>
