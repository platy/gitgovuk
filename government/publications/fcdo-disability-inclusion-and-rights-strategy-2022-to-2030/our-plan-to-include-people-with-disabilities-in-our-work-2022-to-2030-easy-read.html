<p>The plan will be from 2022 to 2030.</p>

<h2>About us</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151914/Parliament.png"></div></figure>

<p>We are part of the UK Government.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151904/FCDO_logo.png"></div></figure>

<p>We are called the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Or FCDO for short.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151906/Globe.png"></div></figure>

<p>We work with other countries to help solve big problems in the world.</p>

<h2>About this plan</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151922/Ppl_facing_forwards.png"></div></figure>

<p>This is our new plan to help us support people with disabilities in a better way.</p>

<p>It is called our Disability Inclusion and Rights Strategy.</p>

<p>The plan will help us to include people with disabilities in our work.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151920/Ppl_facing_each_other.png"></div></figure>

<p>The plan is about our work from 2022 to 2030.</p>

<p>We talked to people with disabilities all over the world before we made our plan.</p>

<p>We wanted to know what life was like for them and what would make it better.</p>

<p>That helped us to make our plan.</p>

<h2>Why we made the plan</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151921/Ppl_facing_forwards_on_grass.png"></div></figure>

<p>We want a fairer world for everyone.</p>

<p>That includes all people with disabilities.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151907/Gr_of_3_and_1.png"></div></figure>

<p>But people with disabilities are treated unfairly in many ways.</p>

<p>They are often left out.</p>

<p>They do not have the same chances as other people to do well.</p>

<p>We want to work with people with disabilities to change that.</p>

<p>We want the following 4 things to happen:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Making sure that all people with disabilities get their rights.</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151918/Person_with_tick_and_cross.png"></div></figure>

<p>Rights are things that we all have. Like the right to be safe and to be treated fairly.</p>

<p>People with disabilities have the same rights as everyone else.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Making sure that people with disabilities can take part in the community and have their say.</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151928/Wheelchair_user.png"></div></figure>

<p>That means people with disabilities can have a real say in what happens in their local areas and countries.</p>

<p>That includes women with disabilities.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151908/Graph.png"></div></figure>

<p>People with disabilities can be leaders and help to make big decisions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Making sure that people with disabilities can make their own choices about their lives.</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151917/Person_red_top.png"></div></figure>

<p>That means making sure they have the information and support to do that.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Making sure that there is better information about what people with disabilities need.</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151923/Sheets_with_pie_chart.png"></div></figure>

<p>That will help everyone to make plans that work well for people with disabilities.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151925/Stack_of_paper_with_ppl.png"></div></figure>

<p>There is an important document about the rights of all people with disabilities.</p>

<p>It is called the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>

<p>This plan is based on what the document says.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151913/Mtg_at_table_with_globe.png"></div></figure>

<p>Many countries have promised to do what the document says.</p>

<p>We will keep supporting everyone to do more on the document.</p>

<h2>The main things we will work on</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151927/Thinking.png"></div></figure>

<p>In the next 8 years, we will include people with disabilities in big areas of our work.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151816/Classroom.png"></div></figure>

<p>That will help to make the following things happen:</p>

<p>Making sure that people with disabilities can get a good education and learn new skills.</p>

<p>That includes girls with disabilities.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151818/Doctor.png"></div></figure>

<p>Making sure that people with disabilities have good healthcare.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151912/Money.png"></div></figure>

<p>Making sure that people with disabilities can afford the basic things they need.</p>

<p>They should be able to get money from the government to help them if they need it.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151819/Farmer.png"></div></figure>

<p>Making sure that people with disabilities can get a job and earn money.</p>

<p>That will help them to have a better life.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151909/House_flooding.png"></div></figure>

<p>Making sure that people with disabilities get the right support when there are big problems in the world.</p>

<p>Like war or floods.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151920/Ppl_facing_each_other.png"></div></figure>

<p>Making sure that people with disabilities can help to make plans about big problems that might happen in the world.</p>

<p>That is to make sure the plans work well for them.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151926/Storm.png"></div></figure>

<p>Making sure that people with disabilities get the right support with climate change.</p>

<p>Climate change is about the earth getting warmer.</p>

<p>That is causing big problems like bad storms, too much heat and not enough rain.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151910/Meeting_3_people_table.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will work to include people with disabilities in climate change plans.</p>

<h2>Other things we will do</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151905/Glasses___hearing_aid.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will support people with disabilities to get the equipment they need to make their lives easier.</p>

<p>Like wheelchairs, glasses or hearing aids.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151813/3_ppl_and_dog_facing_forwards.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will support groups of people with disabilities to take part in things and have their say.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151921/Ppl_facing_forwards_on_grass.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will work to make sure that all people with disabilities are treated fairly.</p>

<p>That includes people with disabilities who are often left out now.</p>

<p>Like women and girls with disabilities, older people, and people with mental health conditions.</p>

<h2>How we will do the work in this plan</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151810/2_people_thinking.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will think about the rights of people with disabilities in all of our work.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151911/Meeting_at_table.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will support other countries to change things more quickly for people with disabilities.</p>

<p>The UK is already a leader in that work.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151906/Globe.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will make sure that we include people with disabilities in our work in different countries.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151815/Boy_red_top_at_desk.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will make sure that our projects and plans work well for people with disabilities.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151809/2_people_talking.png"></div></figure>

<p>We want different groups of people with disabilities to have a real say in our work.</p>

<p>That means working with people with disabilities to make our plans and decisions.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151929/Women_with_picture_of_ppl.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will give our staff information and training about how to include people with disabilities and their rights.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151919/Ppl_and_round_table.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will work well with each other across our organisation.</p>

<p>We will share information about disability so that everyone knows what to do.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151912/Money.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will make sure that new things we buy work well for people with disabilities.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151811/2_ppl_1_in_wheelchair.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will work with other organisations that include people with disabilities.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151817/Do_not_touch.png"></div></figure>

<p>We want to make sure that people with disabilities feel safe when they are working with us.</p>

<p>We want to stop people with disabilities being hurt or treated badly.</p>

<p>That includes being hurt or treated badly in a sexual way.</p>

<p>If people with disabilities do not feel safe, we will make sure they can let us know.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151812/2_ppl_sitting_opposite.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will spend money to find out more about people with disabilities and their lives.</p>

<p>We will share what we learn with many other people.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151910/Meeting_3_people_table.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will support more people with disabilities to work for us and do well.</p>

<p>That includes making big decisions as managers.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151915/Person_on_phone.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will make sure that our organisation is good for people with disabilities to work for.</p>

<p>We will work with our staff with disabilities to do that.</p>

<h2>Making sure that we do what we say</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151916/Person_poster_and_ticks.png"></div></figure>

<p>We promised to do more to make life better for people with disabilities.</p>

<p>We promised that at some big meetings about disability. The meetings are called the Global Disability Summit.</p>

<p>We must keep our promises to people with disabilities.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151814/4_ppl_in_a_group.png"></div></figure>

<p>We will make another plan about how we will do the work in this plan.</p>

<p>The plan will be called the Delivery Plan.</p>

<p>We will work with people with disabilities to make it.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151919/Ppl_and_round_table.png"></div></figure>

<p>We have a new group of experts who will give us advice on how we are doing with this plan.</p>

<p>We will check this plan again in 2025 to see if anything needs to change.</p>
