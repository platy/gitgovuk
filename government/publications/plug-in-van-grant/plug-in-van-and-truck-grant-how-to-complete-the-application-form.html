<h2>Meeting the eligibility criteria</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Vehicle type</h3>

<p>The vehicle must be within the N1, N2 or N3 category as defined under EU Directive (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) 2007/46/<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>To show that the vehicle is designated as either an N1, N2 or N3 vehicle, provide a copy of one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>European Community  whole vehicle type approval (<abbr title="European Community whole vehicle type approval">ECWVTA</abbr>) certificate</li>

  <li>UK individual vehicle approval (<abbr title="individual vehicle approval">IVA</abbr>) certificate</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Multi-stage builds</h3>

<p>There are 2 methods for approving multi-stage vehicles to the grant scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>route 1: the final stage approved party applies for a completed vehicle to be eligible to receive the grant</li>
  <li>route 2: an approved party of an incomplete chassis applies to be eligible to receive the grant</li>
</ul>

<p>Both methods require extensive supporting information to be supplied, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#emissions">carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#zero">zero emissions range</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#max">maximum speed</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#warranty">warranty for the vehicle</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#degradation">battery or fuel cell degradation</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#crash">crash safety</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#electrical">electrical safety</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#hydrogen">hydrogen safety (FCEV only)</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Route 1: Approving a completed vehicle</h4>
<p>This method requires <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant">Form B: plug-in van and truck grants complete and completed vehicle application cover sheet</a> to be completed, along with submission of the supporting information.</p>

<p>Following approval, entitlement to receive the grant will only be given to that vehicle type and the manufacturer applying.</p>

<h4>Route 2: Approving an incomplete chassis</h4>
<p>Route 2 offers benefits that, once approved, the grant can be accessed by any final stage manufacturer whose vehicle type built upon the incomplete vehicle is shown to be within the tested envelope.</p>

<p>This method requires the submission of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant">Form C: plug-in van and truck grants incomplete vehicle application cover sheet</a></li>
  <li>sufficient evidence that the completed vehicle will meet all the eligibility criteria once the vehicle is completed</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant">Form D: final stage completed vehicle form for multi-stage build vans and truck</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Form C and the evidence must be submitted during the application process by the incomplete vehicle applicant</p>

<p>Form D can be submitted separately, but must be submitted before a grant request for the completed vehicle is uploaded to the portal. Grant payment will not be made until this form has been received and the completed vehicle verified as compliant.</p>

<p>The approved party of incomplete vehicles <a class="govuk-link" href="#emissions">must provide sufficient information on the relationship between frontal area and electric range</a> through industry standard emissions and range tests.</p>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> will use this information to assess whether completed vehicles will meet the minimum range criteria to be eligible for the grant.</p>

<p>The range declared on the final stage (completed) application should reflect the actual frontal area of the completed vehicle and its effects on the incomplete declared range.</p>

<p>Screenshots showing that the relationship between actual frontal area and range has been calculated using the incomplete manufacturer’s calculator are an example of acceptable evidence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> CO2&nbsp;emissions</h3>

<p>To qualify for the scheme N1 and N2 vehicles designated as light duty must have tailpipe carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of less than 50 grams per kilometre (50g/km).</p>

<p>N2 vehicles designated as heavy duty and N3 vehicles driven by hybrid, range extended, or novel powertrains must both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet or exceed Euro VI emissions regulations as defined by <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> 595/2009</li>
  <li>have CO2 emissions of at least 50% less than the equivalent conventional Euro VI vehicle that can carry the same capacity</li>
</ul>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>To verify the vehicle’s tailpipe CO2 emissions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for N1 vehicles and N2 vehicles designated as light duty provide an approval certificate and supporting report that shows compliance with Regulation (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) No 715/2007, showing CO2 emissions of less than 50g/km</li>
  <li>for N2 vehicles designated as heavy duty and N3 vehicles, provide a test report to show the vehicle produces at least 50% less greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) than an equivalent conventional Euro VI vehicle of the same load carrying capacity as measured by the Zemo Partnership <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> or Refuse Collection Vehicle (as appropriate) test procedure</li>
</ul>

<p>For multi-stage build or non-standardised vehicle approvals, the worst case example of a chassis-body pairing should be tested.</p>

<p>The application should define the range of acceptable chassis-body pairings, including vehicle height, width and gross weight.</p>

<p>Grant claims will only be accepted for vehicles that fall within the envelope determined by the vehicle that has been tested.</p>

<p>When each grant claim is received, we may require the relevant homologation certificate to be provided to ensure that this is the case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Zero emissions range</h3>

<p>To qualify for the scheme, the vehicle must have a zero-emission range of 60 miles (96km) or greater.</p>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>To verify the vehicle’s zero emission range, for N1 and N2 vehicles designated as light duty provide a type approval certificate (including addendum) issued by the authority approving the vehicle to Regulation (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) No 715/2007.</p>

<p>For N2 vehicles designated as heavy duty and N3 vehicles, provide a test report to show the vehicle meets the range requirements as measured by the Zemo Partnership <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> or Refuse Collection Vehicle (where applicable) test procedure</p>

<p>For multi-stage build or non-standardised vehicle approvals, the worst-case example of a chassis-body pairing should be tested.</p>

<p>The application should define the range of acceptable chassis-body pairings, including vehicle height, width and gross weight.</p>

<p>Grant claims will only be accepted for vehicles that fall within the envelope determined by the vehicle that has been tested. When each grant claim is received, we may require the relevant homologation certificate to ensure that this is the case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Maximum speed</h3>

<p>To allow safe use on trunk roads and motorways, vans and trucks must be able to travel at a speed of at least 50 <abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr> or 80 kilometres per hour (<abbr title="kilometres per hour">km/h</abbr>).</p>

<p>Refuse collection vehicles are required to be able to travel at a speed of at least 40 <abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr> (64 <abbr title="kilometres per hour">km/h</abbr>).</p>

<p>Different manufacturers use different processes for assessing maximum speed, which, alongside other environmental factors, introduces considerable variation in real-world performance.</p>

<p>If credible concerns arise over whether the required maximum speed can be achieved in service, the applicant will need to pay for the vehicle to be assessed in accordance with the technical requirements of <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> Regulation 68 or <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> Regulation 89.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for Transport reserves the right to impose this requirement on all applications throughout the lifetime of the scheme.</p>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>Provide a copy of one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whole vehicle type approval documents</li>
  <li>the publicly available specification of the vehicle stating that it meets the relevant maximum speed criteria</li>
  <li>a signed statement of vehicle maximum speed stating that this value will be made publicly available</li>
  <li>an approval certificate for <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> Regulation 68</li>
  <li>a test report from an appropriately equipped and qualified technical centre that shows the vehicle has been tested in accordance with the technical requirements of <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> Regulation 68</li>
  <li>an approval certificate for <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> Regulation 89</li>
  <li>a test report from an appropriately equipped and qualified technical centre that shows the vehicle has been tested in accordance with the technical requirements of <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> Regulation 89</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Warranty for the vehicle (and battery or fuel cell)</h3>

<p>Full details on meeting the warranty criterion is included on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant">Guidelines to meet the plug-in van and truck grants warranty criterion</a>.</p>

<h4>Light duty vehicles</h4>

<p>The vehicle (excluding the battery or fuel cell and electric drive train)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> must be covered by a warranty for a minimum period of 3 years or 60,000 miles (96,500 km), whichever comes sooner.</p>

<h4>Heavy duty vehicles</h4>

<p>The vehicle must meet one of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a minimum period of 3 years or 60,000 miles (96,500km), whichever comes sooner</li>
  <li>a warranty of 2 years with unlimited mileage</li>
</ul>

<h4>All vehicles</h4>

<p>In addition to the specific criteria for light and heavy duty vehicles, all vehicles must comply with the following.</p>

<p>The warranty must be in line with the guidance on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees given in EU Directive 1999/44/<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The battery or fuel cell and electric drive train must be covered by a warranty for a minimum period of 3 years, or 60,000 miles (96,500km), whichever comes sooner.</p>

<p>In addition, if the warranty is less than 5 years, the customer must be offered the option to extend the warranty by a minimum of 2 years. Applicants may choose to attach an additional cost to this warranty extension.</p>

<p>Where the battery or fuel cell and broader electric drive train is leased to the customer, the leasing agreement must offer a level of support to the customer that is at least equivalent to the above-mentioned warranty.</p>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>A copy of the warranty contract that will be supplied to the customer showing that the above requirements have been met.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Battery or fuel cell degradation</h3>

<p>The applicant must demonstrate that the battery or fuel cell used to drive the vehicle’s propulsion system has an acceptably low rate of degradation.</p>

<p>As a guide to applicants, pending the evidence presented in each case, an acceptable level of degradation is defined as:</p>

<p>For battery electric vehicles (including pure electric, plug in hybrid and range extender vehicles),  the battery must maintain one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 80% of its initial or rated charge capacity for the initial 3 years</li>
  <li>70% of initial or rated charge capacity for the initial 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>For fuel cell vehicles, the fuel stack must maintain at least 90% of its rated voltage output for the initial 5 years.</p>

<p>Given the newness of fuel cell vehicles, we are prepared to work with manufacturers who supply alternative evidence. This must provide a reasonable level of reassurance to the consumer, as assessed by  the panel judges.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span> Crash safety</h3>

<p>Vehicles must demonstrate that they meet the minimum safety requirements of the <abbr title="plug-in vehicle grant">PIVG</abbr> or <abbr title="plug-in truck grant">PITrG</abbr> scheme. These are:</p>

<p>For N1, N2 or N3 vehicles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>homologation to category N1, N2 or N3 through <a class="govuk-link" href="#evidence">accepted whole vehicle type approval routes</a> (not including small series or national approval routes)</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence that the vehicle satisfies the equivalent crash safety standards of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#evidence">accepted whole vehicle type approval routes</a> (as applicable)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>For all categories, the vehicle must meet the crash requirements for the <a class="govuk-link" href="#evidence">accepted whole vehicle type approval routes</a> that the vehicle has been homologated to.</p>

<p>Evidence must be supplied in the form of the relevant crash test certificate for the model of the van or truck that is being presented for approval to <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>In addition, if the vehicle has an individual vehicle approval, the relevant crash test reports must be submitted in the document pack.</p>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> reserves the right to request sight of the appropriate system type approval documents or test reports for these items.</p>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> will make the decision on what are comparable safety outcomes. It reserves the right to require the applicant to complete crash testing if it is considered that the data provided is insufficient or the results inconclusive.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9. </span> Electrical safety</h3>

<h4>Vehicle electrical safety</h4>

<p>Applicants should provide a copy of the approval certificate and full document pack to <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> Regulation 100.02.</p>

<p>If the applicant is not able to supply this, they must instead submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the approval documentation and certificates to <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> R100.01</li>
  <li>evidence to show that the additional technical requirements of the 02 series of amendments have been met</li>
</ul>

<p>There are <a class="govuk-link" href="#derogations">derogations in place for <abbr title="national small series type approval">NSSTA</abbr> and <abbr title="individual vehicle approval">IVA</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The requirements for the safety of the Rechargeable Energy Storage System (REESS), can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant">Preparing battery degradation evidence</a>.</p>

<p>For vehicles approved through the <abbr title="national small series type approval">NSSTA</abbr> or <abbr title="individual vehicle approval">IVA</abbr> routes, the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>) is temporarily allowing evidence of certification to <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> Reg 100.01 only.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>From July 2022, OZEV is likely to require evidence that the technical requirements of the 02 series of amendments have been met.</p>
</div>

<p>This will apply to vehicles already approved for the grant and new applicants.</p>

<h4>Further electrical safety</h4>

<p>The applicant must also provide evidence of action taken to mitigate electrical safety risks not covered by Regulation 100.</p>

<p>In particular, this must include a statement of what actions they will take to inform consumers about the safest way to charge and use their vehicle.</p>

<p>Issues to cover should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>voltage and amperage requirement to safely charge the electric vehicle (<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (<abbr title="plug-in hybrid electric vehicle">PHEV</abbr>) in domestic and commercial properties</li>
  <li>what electrical safety advice will be provided to the purchaser</li>
  <li>whether charging the <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> or <abbr title="plug-in hybrid electric vehicle">PHEV</abbr> in domestic and commercial properties will require the installation of additional safety equipment or separate circuits</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases where additional safety equipment or separate electrical circuits are required, a statement on the following will be needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the process by which you will ensure the necessary equipment has been provided and/or circuits safely installed by the time of delivery of the van or truck to the end user</li>
  <li>how the actions of the applicant will ensure compliance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/electrical-and-electronic-engineering-industries-eei/low-voltage-directive-lvd_en" rel="external">Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr></a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Commitment to consumer safety can also be demonstrated by submitting copies of the appropriate documentation that will be supplied with the vehicle. These must explain the safe operation and charging of the vehicle.</p>

<h4>Best practice for providing evidence</h4>

<p>Examples of best practice for providing evidence include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a one-page leaflet for new customers outlining electrical safety issues</li>
  <li>a comprehensive instruction manual with detailed instructions for owners on how to safely recharge and maintain their vehicle and risks to avoid</li>
  <li>requirement or recommendation that the consumer has a survey performed on their home or commercial wiring</li>
  <li>advice on how to install a dedicated home charging unit, with details of potential companies that can carry out the work</li>
  <li>evidence of dealership training to ensure dealers can correctly advise on electrical safety during the sales process</li>
  <li>if relevant, indication of training so that technicians and mechanics can safely service the vehicle</li>
  <li>blueprints or information to emergency services on how to correctly deal with an incident involving the relevant vehicle (where battery is located or which wires to cut, for example).</li>
</ul>

<p>Where it is felt that the applicant has taken insufficient measures, <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> reserves the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reject the application</li>
  <li>stipulate that the applicant undertake certain additional measures before the vehicle can be deemed eligible</li>
