<p>Government is going further and faster to decarbonise transport by phasing out the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030 and, from 2035, all new cars and vans must be zero emissions at the tailpipe.</p>

<p>Between 2030 and 2035, any new cars and vans sold that emit from the tailpipe must have significant zero emission capability.</p>

<p>The plug-in van grant (<abbr title="plug-in vehicle grant">PIVG</abbr>) was launched in 2012 to help bridge the price gap between the cost of ultra-low emission vans and diesel vans. It was extended to trucks, also referred to as heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) in 2016.</p>

<p>We regularly <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants">review grant levels and update the list</a> of eligible vehicles for the <abbr title="plug-in vehicle grant">PIVG</abbr> and plug-in truck grant (<abbr title="plug-in truck grant">PITrG</abbr>).</p>

<p>Both the level of grant and the criteria for each category is liable to change at the discretion of the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="plug-in vehicle grant">PIVG</abbr> and <abbr title="plug-in truck grant">PITrG</abbr> will continue until at least the financial year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note:  ‘approved party’ refers to the manufacturer or third party approved by the manufacturer to market the vehicle under a separate commercial trade or brand name.</p>
</div>

<h2>How the scheme operates</h2>

<p>Manufacturers or third parties approved by the manufacturer to market the vehicle under a separate commercial trade or brand name must apply to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> to have their vehicles included as part of the scheme.</p>

<p>The Vehicle Certification Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>) checks applications on behalf of <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<p>Following application, <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> will assess vehicles to ensure they meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant/plug-in-van-and-truck-grant-how-to-complete-the-application-form#meeting-the-eligibility-criteria">minimum technical criteria</a> for the scheme.</p>

<p>The grant is available to customers at the point of purchase directly from the dealer or manufacturer’s representative. Consumers do not have to go through a grant application process themselves.</p>

<p>The grant will only be payable by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> to the manufacturer or third party approved by the manufacturer to market the vehicle under a separate commercial trade or brand name. This is subject to a submission of a grant claim by an authorised portal user meeting with all the conditions of the scheme.</p>

<h2>Eligible vehicles</h2>

<p>To be eligible for the grant, the completed vans or trucks (chassis and bodywork) need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant/plug-in-van-and-truck-grant-how-to-complete-the-application-form#meeting-the-eligibility-criteria">meet the criteria</a>.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to alter these criteria if, for example, during the course of the grant scheme new safety requirements or European regulations or standards come into force.</p>

<p>New variants of a vehicle that is already eligible for the grant are not automatically eligible. A variant of a vehicle that requires new type approval documentation will need to be approved separately.</p>

<p>Manufacturers (or third party approved by the manufacturer to market the vehicle under a separate commercial trade or brand name) should apply for these new variants to be approved under the grant scheme.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether a new variant of a vehicle needs to be approved, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pluginapprovals@vca.gov.uk">pluginapprovals@vca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Claiming the grant</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="plug-in vehicle grant">PIVG</abbr> or <abbr title="plug-in truck grant">PITrG</abbr> can only be claimed for by new vans and trucks at first registration.</p>

<p>Pre-registration conversions are eligible to be submitted for the scheme. Post-registration conversions are not.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants/eligibility">Annual caps on total large and small truck grants and grants available</a> per end customer (not lease company) currently apply.</p>

<h2>Manufacturer agreement</h2>

<p>Details of the relationship between <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> and the manufacturer, is described in the <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> vehicle incentive scheme manufacturers agreement (the manufacturers agreement).</p>

<p>This document is only issued to the approved party once a vehicle has been approved by <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> on behalf of <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> as eligible under the scheme.</p>

<p>The grant is only payable once the approved party has agreed to the terms and the document is returned signed.</p>

<p>Details of the eligible vehicle will be published on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants/eligibility">eligible vehicles list</a>. This will occur once a vehicle has been formally approved on to the scheme and a signed copy of the manufacturers agreement has been received by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<p>The manufacturer and its selected dealerships will then be given access to an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-plug-in-vehicle-grant">online portal</a>, through which they can register claims for eligible vehicles.</p>

<p>Claims will be paid to the approved party on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Customers will receive the <abbr title="plug-in vehicle grant">PIVG</abbr> or <abbr title="plug-in truck grant">PITrG</abbr> deduction from the price of the vehicle at the point of sale by the dealership. There is no paperwork for customers to complete in order to benefit from the grant.</p>

<p>Both private consumers and businesses can benefit from the <abbr title="plug-in vehicle grant">PIVG</abbr> or <abbr title="plug-in truck grant">PITrG</abbr> when purchasing an eligible vehicle and registering it to a UK address<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Making a vehicle application</h2>

<p>Those wishing to apply for a vehicle to become eligible for the scheme should contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ozev.support@vca.gov.uk">ozev.support@vca.gov.uk</a> for a scheme number.</p>

<p>The detailed guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant/plug-in-van-and-truck-grant-how-to-complete-the-application-form">how to complete the application</a> form should be followed.</p>

<p><abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> will supply details of the document submission process. Supporting evidence should be in English.</p>

<p>Any questions regarding the application process should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pluginapprovals@vca.gov.uk">pluginapprovals@vca.gov.uk</a>or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:plugingrants@dft.gov.uk">plugingrants@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>The assessment process</h2>

<p>Applications will be processed as soon as possible after they are received, and aim to decide within 2 months from the time all documents are received.</p>

<p>This depends on the complexity of the application and whether further technical information is required.</p>

<p>We recommend applicants engage as early as possible with both <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> (for general enquiries) and <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> to allow time for the application to be processed, as follows:</p>

<p>1. Applicant emails completed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant">Form A: scheme number application</a> to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk">PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk</a>. <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> issues an application specific scheme number, which must be used in all communication regarding the application.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> sets up a manufacturer account on its file transfer system.</p>

<p>3. Applicant submits completed application form and supporting evidence to <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> via its file transfer system. Fill in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant">Form B for complete and completed vehicles</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant">Form C for incomplete vehicles</a>.</p>

<p>4. <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> confirms the application has been received and is complete or requests further documentation.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> assesses the validity of type approval certificates and warranty documentation presented as evidence and responds in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decides that the application has passed</li>
  <li>decides that the application has failed</li>
  <li>requests further information from the applicant</li>
  <li>requests advice from independent technical experts before coming to a decision. This is likely to be on evidence relating to completed vehicle range, battery or fuel cell degradation and/or crash safety but may be on another aspect of the application</li>
</ul>

<p>6. If the vehicle passes the assessment process, <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> will issue a report to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> who will then send an offer letter to the applicant setting out the terms of acceptance.</p>

<p>7. If the vehicle fails, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will send a letter to the applicant explaining the reasons why and recommending steps which the approved party might wish to take before resubmitting an application.</p>

<p>8. Once the vehicle is approved and a signed copy of the manufacturer’s agreement has been received, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will add the vehicle make and model to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants">official list of vehicles eligible for a grant</a>. At this point, the model is eligible under the grant scheme.</p>

<p>9. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will request that DVLA add the vehicle model to the portal where grant claims are placed and set up first-time applicants on the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) finance systems.</p>

<p>10. If the vehicle is approved for the grant as an incomplete vehicle, complete <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant">Form D: final stage completed vehicle form for multi-stage build vans and truck</a> and email it to  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pluginapprovals@vca.gov.uk">pluginapprovals@vca.gov.uk</a>. This confirms that the completed vehicle meets the requirements when the dealer adds registration details to the grant portal, allowing the grant to be paid.</p>

<p>You can email any questions on the process to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:plugingrants@dft.gov.uk">plugingrants@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>For queries on new applications and technical enquiries on open applications, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pluginapprovals@vca.gov.uk">pluginapprovals@vca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Application forms</h2>

<p>There are 4 application forms:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant">Form A: scheme number application</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>submitted by all manufacturers to prior to submitting an application</li>
  <li>email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk">PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk</a>
</li>
  <li>will receive a scheme number and log in details to the file transfer system</li>
</ul>

  <li>email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk">PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Costs</h2>

<p>Cases where independent technical expertise is needed to assess applications are likely to be rare. In such cases, however, there may be a cost to the applicant.</p>

<p>Independent technical advice is most likely to be required for the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed vehicle range</li>
  <li>battery or fuel cell degradation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Review of decision</h2>

<p>Applicants have a right to seek a review of the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> decision.</p>

<p>Further details would be provided to the applicant in the letter advising that the application had been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>If significant further work is required to validate the submitted evidence, the applicant may be asked to meet those costs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will let the applicant know if this applies to enable the applicant to decide whether they wish to meet the costs or to withdraw the application.</p>

<p>Applicants are encouraged to contact <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> with any specific questions.</p>

<h2>Testing guidance</h2>

<p>N2 vehicles designated as heavy duty and N3 vehicles, for which a Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 has been issued, will require testing to establish that the vehicle meets the range <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-van-grant/plug-in-van-and-truck-grant-how-to-complete-the-application-form#meeting-the-eligibility-criteria">eligibility criteria</a>.</p>

<p>To request a copy of the Zemo Partnership <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> or refuse collection vehicle (<abbr title="refuse collection vehicle">RCV</abbr>) test procedure, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:plugingrants@dft.gov.uk">plugingrants@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Incomplete vehicle types that may be used for both <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> and <abbr title="refuse collection vehicle">RCV</abbr> completed vehicles must submit test reports for both <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> and <abbr title="refuse collection vehicle">RCV</abbr> test procedures.</p>

<p>N1 vehicles and N2 vehicles designated as light duty, for which a Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 has been issued, may present this approval as their evidence.</p>

<p>N1, N2 and N3 categories and the light duty/heavy duty differentiation are defined under EU Directive (EC) 2007/46/EC.</p>
