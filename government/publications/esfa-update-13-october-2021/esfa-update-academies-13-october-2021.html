<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: Risk Protection Arrangement (RPA) - motor vehicle cover for schools’ consultation</h2>

<p>The Department for Education has launched a <a rel="external" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/schools-commercial-team/risk-protection-arrangement-rpa-proposed-motor-veh" class="govuk-link">public consultation</a> on a proposal to introduce motor cover as part of the RPA.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-risk-protection-arrangement-rpa-for-schools">RPA</a> provides cover for most risks that schools face, but members currently have to obtain motor cover elsewhere at commercial rates, because third party motor insurance is a legal requirement under the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the RPA cover is not insurance.</p>

<p>If the RPA were able to offer motor cover to its member schools, there would be potential to save schools’ money, delivering direct savings on the cost of cover and save schools’ time, as they currently have to provide detailed claims experience to obtain commercial cover.</p>

<p>We welcome the views of stakeholders across the school sector. The consultation closes on 30 November 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Action: Sustainability Day for schools hosted by DfE schools commercial team</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: the academies planning calendar has been updated.</h2>

<p>We have updated the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-planning-calendar?utm_source=13+october&amp;utm_medium=ESFA+Update&amp;utm_campaign=ESFA" class="govuk-link">academies planning calendar for the 2021 to 2022 academic year</a>.</p>

<p>The calendar provides a summary of key actions and dates about academy funding, finance, and trust compliance with their funding agreement. Funding information has been added relating to recovery premiums and tutoring grants.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: coronavirus (COVID-19) school-led tutoring allocations</h2>

<p>We’ve published the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant" class="govuk-link">school-led tutoring allocations</a> for maintained schools, academies and local authorities. We will also shortly publish a calculation tool which enables eligible schools and academy trusts to track information relating to their allocation during the academic year.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-grant" class="govuk-link">school-led tutoring</a> and the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/">National Tutoring Programme</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: Condition Data Collection 2 (CDC2) update</h2>

<p>From 2021 to 2026 the Department for Education is collecting data about the condition of school and FE college buildings. Surveying teams working on the CDC2 programme will be visiting every government funded school and FE college in England.</p>

<p>The next round of visits has been confirmed for the period from February 2022 to January 2023 (tranches 3 and 4). The list of schools to be visited in these tranches, and the full provisional list of schools to be visited in future tranches, is now available to view and download from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/condition-data-collection-2-cdc2-programme" class="govuk-link">CDC2 section of the GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities, dioceses and trusts will be invited by a surveying organisation to a preliminary virtual meeting with schools, which will gather general building information for the programme, prior to the site visit to collect building condition data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: get involved in Charity Fraud Awareness Week, 18 to 22 October 2021</h2>

<p>Now in its sixth year, Fraud Awareness Week 2021 will emphasise the all-important theme of prevention and will encourage charities, professional organisations and international partners to get involved and take practical steps to keep their charities safe from harm in the post-Covid era. With the sector facing unparalleled financial challenge, there’s never been a better time to boost fraud resilience and help protect your charity’s assets from harm.</p>

<p>During the week you’ll be able to access top tips and detailed advice via a range of campaign resources, from help sheets to webinars – on timely topics such as fighting grant or fundraising fraud to managing cyber attacks; all hosted on a handy new information portal <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://preventcharityfraud.org.uk/welcome-to-our-new-website/">preventcharityfraud.org.uk</a>. It’ll replace the Fraud Awareness Hub that supported Fraud Awareness Week in previous years and will be managed by sector partner, the Fraud Advisory Panel.</p>

<p>New for this year, charities are encouraged to <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://preventcharityfraud.org.uk/fraud-pledge/">sign up to a Stop Fraud Pledge</a> and make a public commitment to tackling fraud in their charities, via 6 essential steps. A whole host of charities have already taken the pledge – do consider joining them today.</p>
