<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: Risk Protection Arrangement (RPA) - motor vehicle cover for schools consultation</h2>

<p>The Department for Education has launched a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/schools-commercial-team/risk-protection-arrangement-rpa-proposed-motor-veh">public consultation</a> on a proposal to introduce motor cover as part of the RPA.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-risk-protection-arrangement-rpa-for-schools" class="govuk-link">RPA</a> provides cover for most risks that schools face, but members currently have to obtain motor cover elsewhere at commercial rates, because third party motor insurance is a legal requirement under the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the RPA cover is not insurance.</p>

<p>If the RPA were able to offer motor cover to its member schools, there would be potential to save schools’ money, delivering direct savings on the cost of cover and save schools’ time, as they currently have to provide detailed claims experience to obtain commercial cover.</p>

<p>We welcome the views of stakeholders across the school sector. The consultation closes on 30 November 2021.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span>Information: High needs funding: due diligence process for special post-16 providers</h2>

<p>We have published the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-due-diligence-process-for-new-special-post-16-providers" class="govuk-link">high needs funding: due diligence process for special post-16 providers</a> guidance.</p>

<p>This guidance explains the process for special post-16 institutions that may lead to a funding arrangement with the Education Skills and Funding Agency (ESFA) for the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>To be eligible to receive ESFA funding, special post-16 institutions (SPI) are required to be included within their provider LA high needs place change workbook (required by 12 November 2021) and must be named on at least 10 Education Health and Care plans. Subject to meeting this requirement, the ESFA will undertake due diligence to ensure themselves that the SPI is eligible to receive ESFA funding.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-due-diligence-process-for-new-special-post-16-providers">Further information</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span>Information: coronavirus (COVID-19) school-led tutoring allocations</h2>

<p>We’ve published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant">school-led tutoring allocations</a> for maintained schools, academies and local authorities.  We will also shortly publish a calculation tool which enables eligible schools and academy trusts to track information relating to their allocation during the academic year.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-grant">school-led tutoring</a> and the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/">National Tutoring Programme</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: professional development opportunities for leaders, governors, and governance professionals</h2>

<p>The Education and Training Foundation is funded by DfE to provide a range of training programmes, mentoring and coaching support for college <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/q7raCyoL2f3XZySZmMGo/">CEOs, CFOs, Middle Managers, Chairs</a> and <a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/OA6zCAN3Kh5641t9Puti/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Governance Professionals</a>.</p>

<p>Delivered by partners such as the Oxford Said Business School and the Institute of Directors, the programmes aim to develop skills and confidence in order to enhance the value which leaders, governors and governance professionals add to their institution and its long-term resilience. As signalled in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-for-jobs-lifelong-learning-for-opportunity-and-growth" class="govuk-link">Skills for jobs</a> white paper, we strongly encourage people in those roles to take advantage of training and support, so do have a look now at what’s on offer.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: Condition Data Collection 2 (CDC2) update</h2>

<p>From 2021 to 2026 the Department for Education is collecting data about the condition of school and FE college buildings. Surveying teams working on the CDC2 programme will be visiting every government funded school and FE college in England.</p>

<p>The next round of visits has been confirmed for the period from February 2022 to January 2023 (tranches 3 and 4). The list of schools to be visited in these tranches, and the full provisional list of schools to be visited in future tranches, is now available to view and download from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/condition-data-collection-2-cdc2-programme">CDC2 section of the GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities, dioceses and trusts will be invited by a surveying organisation to a preliminary virtual meeting with schools, which will gather general building information for the programme, prior to the site visit to collect building condition data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: extension of the incentive payment for hiring a new apprentice</h2>

<p>On 4 October 2021, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP, announced a £500m expansion of government action, to tackle unemployment and support job seekers following the end of furlough. This included the extension of the popular incentive payment for hiring a new apprentice until the end January 2022. As of 29 September 2021, 35,220 employers have created 101,460 new apprenticeship opportunities for apprentices using the employer incentive, which was originally introduced as part of the Government’s Plan For Jobs in July 2020.</p>

<p>Employers will be able to apply for a payment of £3,000 for new apprentices of any age, who have an employment start date between 1 October 2021 and 31 January 2022.  Operational details, including details of the application window, will follow shortly.</p>

<p>Claims for eligible apprentices, recruited between 1 April and 30 September 2021, remain unchanged; employers must submit their claim no later than 30 November 2021.</p>
