<h2>Questions asked at stakeholder engagement day in July</h2>

<h3>Lot 1: Research, evidence gathering for piped systems with respect to hydrogen for purging, tightness and material compatibility</h3>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>:<br>Does the purging project include what happens if you don’t purge correctly?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>The work within Lot 1 will include what the impacts are of an ignition within a pipework system (including consideration of dead legs) during purging.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong>:<br>Was the published Hy4Heat Steer Energy domestic purging work reviewed by <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>The Steer Energy Report was not reviewed by <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> as part of the Hy4Heat Programme.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3</strong>:<br>It is really important that ongoing purging work is tied up with previous work and is linked with <abbr title="Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers">IGEM</abbr> and <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> requirements going forward.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Work will be coordinated with <abbr title="Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers">IGEM</abbr> and <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> with reference to previous work carried out in this area.</p>

<p><strong>Question 4</strong>:<br>I would suggest that any tightness testing &amp; purging are covered in single lot they are all covered by <abbr title="Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers">IGEM</abbr>/UP/ series (I currently chair all these panels). In addition, any work that may have already been completed for ‘upstream’ systems with IGE/SR/22 may be relevant as the <abbr title="Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers">IGEM</abbr>/UP/1 &amp; SR/22 are based on the same original research.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Lots have been rearranged to join these pieces of work. A literature review will be undertaken as part of the work which will consider relevant work already completed in this area.</p>

<p><strong>Question 5</strong>:<br>How extensive will the physical testing beyond the lab be?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Physical testing is expected to involve representative pipework installations.</p>

<p><strong>Question 6</strong>:<br>Need to consider purge flow rates and the need for filtration.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Following literature search and assessment of existing evidence these considerations will be defined in the physical testing plan and method.</p>

<h3>Lot 2: Research and evidence gathering for material and component suitability - domestic and non-domestic for hydrogen</h3>

<p><strong>Question 7</strong><br>Who will conduct the physical testing?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>For the successful contractor to arrange and to outline within their tender response.</p>

<p><strong>Question 8</strong>:<br>Would the 15-month duration include life testing?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>There will be provision for life testing, however it is also desirable to test aged samples.</p>

<p><strong>Question 9</strong>:<br>Will the components that have been installed for many years be tested as part of the project?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Yes, alongside new materials, aged materials reclaimed for representative existing systems will need to be tested.</p>

<h3>Lot 3 – Research and evidence gathering for installation ventilation and flues</h3>

<p>No questions were received in relation to Lot 3.</p>

<h3>Lot 4: Pipe Sizing and Pressure Drop Criteria</h3>

<p><strong>Question 10</strong>:<br>If we are hoping to repurpose gas pipes in buildings (which most of us are hopeful about) then we should be designing for ~50% higher pressure drop. This needs to be aligned across standards.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Work completed under this contract will contribute to the development of standards for hydrogen and will be considered where appropriate elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Question 11</strong>:<br>Will [the effect of] velocity be included in any pipe sizing research?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Velocity is considered in the physical testing scope of Lot 2 which will inform pipe sizing recommendations in standards alongside the work undertaken in Lot 4.</p>

<h3>Lot 5: Research and evidence gathering for hydrogen: (i) meter, internal and external, ventilation study, (ii) installation and set point of excess flow valves (<abbr title="excess flow valves">EFV</abbr>)</h3>

<p><strong>Question 12</strong>:<br>Regarding Lot [5] (meter installations and ventilation) - when you talk about humidity how do you see this differing from natural gas meter installations, as there should be no combustion in the meter?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Humidity is not a consideration from combustion but environmental conditions which contribute to condensation in the meter cabinet need to be considered.</p>

<p><strong>Question 13</strong>:<br>Please can you confirm the anticipated location of the excess flow valve (<abbr title="excess flow valves">EFV</abbr>) in a domestic installation? Is it between the emergency control valve (ECV) and the regulator?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>The <abbr title="excess flow valves">EFV</abbr> is anticipated to be either in the supply pipe or immediately after the ECV.</p>

<p><strong>Question 14</strong>:<br>Also need to consider pressure losses if deemed part of the meter installations as there has been debate on the current <abbr title="Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers">IGEM</abbr>/G/1 review</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Yes this should be considered within the work of Lot 4.</p>

<p><strong>Question 15</strong>:<br>Have <abbr title="Gas Distribution Networks Operators">GDNOs</abbr> been engaged on this? I think pipe sizing to properties is currently conducted for design flow rates below the <abbr title="excess flow valves">EFV</abbr> set point range.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>As part of the market engagement activity undertaken in the preparation of the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> held a meeting with representatives of the <abbr title="Gas Distribution Networks Operators">GDNOs</abbr> to discuss relevant network evidence projects.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p><strong>Question 16</strong>:<br>To what extent should the project proposals submitted for all these ITTs include time/effort to discuss the approach/results with <abbr title="Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers">IGEM</abbr> and <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>? Or will any outputs be reviewed independently by those bodies in a separate process?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Contractors will be expected to present a progress update on the Interim Report, and the draft findings from the study before the Final Report to the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> project team and standards bodies involved in the Hydrogen Skills and Standards for Heat programme to enable independent scrutiny of outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Question 17</strong>:<br>What is the overall objective of all this work? How does it tie together? Does it inform policy decision and if so, how?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>This work will fill gaps in the existing hydrogen evidence base, to enable completion of the standards being developed under the Hydrogen Skills and Standards for Heat programme. The programme is necessary to deliver evidence for policy decisions. It will support work to codify changes needed to heating systems, on which basis an accurate assessment of costs/impacts and therefore the feasibility of converting end-users from natural gas to hydrogen can be made.</p>

<p><strong>Question 18</strong>:<br>Is there any consideration of training of engineers to <abbr title="Approved Code of Practice">ACoP</abbr>?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Energy and Utility Skills (<abbr title="Energy and Utility Skills">EUS</abbr>) will codify both the <abbr title="Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers">IGEM</abbr> domestic and non-domestic enabling standards into competency frameworks and training specifications to facilitate the training of a competent workforce for trials. They will produce Accredited Certification Scheme (<abbr title="Accredited Certification Scheme">ACS</abbr>) assessment criteria and Approved Code of Practice (<abbr title="Approved Code of Practice">ACoP</abbr>) assessment modules for both enabling standards, working with industry to ensure there is a clear path for existing competent installers to train for the installation of hydrogen.</p>

<p><strong>Question 19</strong>:<br>Is there going to be a list of reservations and concerns published so that any work can specifically address those reservations and concerns?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>The <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> includes direction on the gaps in each area.</p>

<p><strong>Question 20</strong>:<br>There appears little to no engagement with the industry on these proposals.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>As part of the market engagement activity undertaken in the preparation of the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> held a meeting with representatives of the <abbr title="Gas Distribution Networks Operators">GDNOs</abbr> to discuss relevant network evidence projects. The technical specifications for each Lot have also been reviewed by <abbr title="Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers">IGEM</abbr>, <abbr title="Energy and Utility Skills">EUS</abbr>, BSI and <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>. Additionally, the stakeholder day held on the 6th of July was an opportunity for a broad range of industry to provide feedback on the expected work. Questions can be asked until the 20th of August as detailed in the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>Question 21</strong>:<br>How are you intending to have the results from the research included in standards?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>A working group involving BSI, <abbr title="Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers">IGEM</abbr> and <abbr title="Energy and Utility Skills">EUS</abbr> will be coordinated by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, with contractors presenting results at Interim and Final Reporting stages, alongside ad hoc meetings when required. The working group will review draft outputs from research to enable to development of draft standards. Final versions of the standards will be updated to incorporate the final results and all supporting analysis and data from the research.</p>

<p><strong>Question 22</strong>:<br>Human factors needs to be considered as part of any work - by repurposing and making hydrogen and natural gas look the same could lead to complacency.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Recommendations as part of the final reports in each Lot are welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Question 23</strong>:<br>Wasn’t Hy4Heat looking at the repurpose of exiting network in the home?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Hy4Heat focused on evidence required for a limited trial to take place, gaps were identified for the repurposing of infrastructure which this programme seeks to close.</p>

<p><strong>Question 24</strong>:<br>Given the very different costs and timescales involved for desk based and lab/field based experimental studies, please could you clarify the expectations of the tender in terms of the expected balance between desk based and physical lab/field trials, and/or if the final tender call will specify what is required regarding both these elements or if the tenderer would be expected to make their own proposals regarding this.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>The <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> details the requirements for each Lot in terms of the scope for the literature review and physical testing.</p>

<h3>Procurement</h3>

<p><strong>Question 25</strong>:<br>Are there any significant changes in T&amp;Cs from Hy4Heat?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>The Department’s standard T&amp;Cs of Contract will apply to this contract, a copy of which will be published alongside the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr>. The standard T&amp;Cs will be amended under Clause 18(7) Indemnities and Insurance, and replaced with the following, “Except in relation to death or personal injury as referred to in Condition 18(1), and subject to Conditions 18(5) and 30(15) the amount of liability under this clause shall be limited to a sum of £1,000,000 or twice the contract value, whichever is the greater, or such other sum as may be agreed in writing between the Head of Procurement on behalf of the Authority and the Contractor.”</p>

<h2>Questions about the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> document</h2>

<h3>Privacy Notice</h3>

<p><strong>Question 26</strong>:<br>Please clarify, on pg. 4 of the tender it says under International Transfers “Your personal data will not be processed outside the European Union.” Should this now say, “outside of the UK”?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>The Privacy Notice within the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> has been updated and published as [Revision A] to reflect the current requirements. Under International Transfers this now reads, “As your personal data is stored on our IT infrastructure and shared with our data processors Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, it may be transferred and stored securely in the UK and European Economic Area. Where it is the case that your personal data is stored outside the UK and <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> it will be subject to equivalent legal protection through the use of Model Contract Clauses”.</p>

<p><strong>Question 27</strong>:<br>: There is a question in the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> declaration which refers to operating outside of the EU and the need for an appointed agent within the EU. Is this a requirement under the UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>If you are based in the UK and do not have a branch, office or other establishment in any other EU or European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) state, but you either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>offer goods or services to individuals in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>; or</li>
  <li>monitor the behaviour of individuals in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>,</li>
</ul>

<p>then you still need to comply with the EU <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> regarding this processing.</p>

<p>If you do not have a base inside the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>, the EU <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> requires you to appoint a representative in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>. This representative needs to be set up in an EU or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> state where some of the individuals whose personal data you are processing in this way are located. You need to authorise the representative, in writing, to act on your behalf regarding your EU <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> compliance, and to deal with any supervisory authorities or data subjects in this respect. 
Your representative may be an individual, or a company or organisation established in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>, and must be able to represent you regarding your obligations under the EU <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> (e.g. a law firm, consultancy or private company). In practice the easiest way to appoint a representative may be under a simple service contract.</p>

<p>You should give details of your representative to <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-based individuals whose personal data you are processing. This may be done by including them in your privacy notice or in the upfront information you give them when you collect their data. You must also make it easily accessible to supervisory authorities – for example by publishing it on your website. Your appointment of your representative must be in writing and should set out the terms of your relationship with them.</p>

<p>Having a representative does not affect your own responsibility or liability under the EU <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>.</p>

<p>You do not need to appoint a representative if either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are a public authority; or</li>
  <li>your processing is only occasional, of low risk to the data protection rights of individuals and does not involve the large-scale use of special category or criminal offence data</li>
</ul>

<p>The EDPB has published guidelines on territorial scope. These contain more guidance on appointing a representative.</p>

<h3>Section 1: Instructions and Information on Tendering</h3>

<p>No questions were submitted in relation to Section 1.</p>

<h3>Section 2: Introduction and Background Information</h3>

<p><strong>Question 28</strong>:<br><abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> Section 2 ‘Introduction and Background Information’ refers to Primary research requirements. However, under Lot 4 scope of work details it mentions literature search (which is essentially secondary research) and physical testing. Does ‘primary research’ in the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> introduction mean the physical testing part?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>For this tender ‘Primary Research’ in the introduction refers to the culmination of both the ‘Literature search and assessment of existing evidence’ and the physical testing.</p>

<h3>Section 3 – Specification of Requirements (all lots)</h3>

<p><strong>Question 29</strong>:<br>The equations and correlations governing natural gas pipeline/network sizing methodology (including flow rates, pressure drops, velocity considerations, noise and vibration calculations etc.) are well understood and widely used in the gas industry for decades. Hydrogen being a compressible gas operating well under critical conditions in gas transmission and distribution systems, is not expected to cause any fundamental change to these in any of the mixing ratios with natural gas. What is the intent of the testing scope within the Lot 4 work in that context?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>The testing scope in Lot 4 is to provide actual evidence to confirm the appropriate and accurate standardised method for determining pipe sizing and pressure drop with respect to hydrogen, has been selected. It is not sufficient for the hydrogen for heat policy decision to rely upon anecdotal evidence however widely used, the physical testing is to provide formal assurance.</p>

<p><strong>Question 30</strong>:<br>Section 1.2.2 refers to ‘the appointed testing house’. Has <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> already selected an organisation to undertake testing in collaboration with the winning bidders? If there is no nominated source for this, can <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> provide a list of testing authorities which meet <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> criteria for such a body.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>‘Appointed testing house’ refers to the supplier or supplier consortium themselves. As part of the proposal the supplier will demonstrate their access to suitable facilities and equipment, and experience in its use to deliver high quality outputs from experimental work. For evaluation of tenders 5% weighting has been given to this demonstration within the Methodology evaluation criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Question 31</strong>:<br>There appears to be some risk of overlap between the testing of materials compatibility in Lot 1 and testing of materials suitability in Lot 2. Please would you provide clarification of the distinction between the testing expected in each case, especially in Lot 1?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Lot 1 has been developed to focus on compatibility at a component and jointing level as could typically be found in existing and new downstream installations. Lot 2 is concerned with the general compatibility of the material and/or metallurgy itself, including its longevity in hydrogen service. There is the potential for some overlap.</p>

<p><strong>Question 32</strong>:<br>Lot 1, Section 2.2 states “The testing is to be carried out by suitably qualified and experienced materials testing house, either commercial or academic.” Please would you clarify what you mean by “suitably qualified and experienced materials testing house”, for example is accreditation for a particular test method expected?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>Accreditation for specific test methods is not required. Evidence the test house is suitably qualified and experienced should be demonstrated based on the skills and experience of the proposed team members and on the facilities and equipment the contractor will use to conduct the work. A description of the skills required to be demonstrated and how tender responses should evidence this is provided in Section 4 ‘Tender Requirements (All lots), Sub-Section 10 ‘Skills and Experience’.</p>

<p><strong>Question 33</strong>:<br>Lot 1, purge testing is specified at ambient temperature and a range of temperatures is specified (-30°C to +50°C). Please would you clarify the objective of this aspect of the testing?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br>The objective of this aspect of the testing is to determine whether different ambient temperatures (-30°C to +50°C) have any material effect on the key technical factors which ensure the efficacy (and particularly safety) of the purging process and to recommend appropriate mitigations.</p>

<p><strong>Question 34</strong>:<br>Robust literature review will require unrestricted access to the reports and possibly datasets produced by the projects noted in the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> (Hy4Heat, H100, H21, HyDeploy, etc.). Will the successful contractor be granted access to these as not all are publicly available?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will facilitate knowledge sharing between successful contractors and stakeholder groups (e.g. <abbr title="Gas Distribution Networks Operators">GDNOs</abbr>) running relevant hydrogen gas industry projects such as H100, H21 and HyDeploy. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> cannot however guarantee access to reports and datasets produced by projects and/or programmes for which it is not directly delivering or responsible for. It is anticipated that in the interests of furthering the field an open knowledge sharing approach will be adopted as it is in the interests of the industry to ensure the most up to date information is available for review.</p>

<h3>Section 4 – Tender Requirements (all lots)</h3>

<p><strong>Question 35</strong>:<br>The date of submission of literature review is stated as 14/01/21 in the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr> document pages 47/48. Would you please re-confirm the date of submission of literature review.</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> can confirm that the correct date is 14/01/22. This has been updated in revision A of the <abbr title="invitation to tender">ITT</abbr>.</p>
