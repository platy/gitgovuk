<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>ECB6.1 On what basis are fees charged?</h2>

<p>A fees order sets out functions for which fees may be set in regulations and includes maximum fee levels for applications routes and available services.</p>

<p>Fees regulations then detail the individual charges applicable to various application routes and available services. Details of exceptions and fee waivers are also included within the fees regulations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>ECB6.2 What are the entry clearance/visa fees?</h2>

<p>Information on visa fees is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/aboutus/fees" rel="external">visa fees</a> page on this website.</p>

<p>This includes information on the fee for dependents. Each applicant for an entry clearance visa pays a fee, even if a spouse and/or children are included in the main applicant’s passport. If making the same application type as the main applicant, dependants are generally charged the same fee as that paid by the main applicant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>ECB6.3 How are fees paid?</h2>

<p>Fees are usually paid online following the instructions provided. If online payments are not mandatory, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre">Visa Application Centre website</a> will advise what methods of payment can be used.</p>

<p>Fees for entry clearance and related services are set in UK legislation in UK pounds (GBP). Changes to the fees are approved by the UK Parliament. The exchange rate is determined by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643019/HO_ERP_Policy.pdf">Home Office Exchange Rate Policy</a> which may be subject to change.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>ECB6.4 Are there any other charges?</h2>

<p>Applicants for visas to the UK for more than 6 months will normally be subject to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application/overview">Immigration Health Surcharge</a>.</p>

<p>In some locations there is an additional fee to use the application centre (called ‘user pays’) or other facility which receives and/or processes visa applications.</p>

<p>Additional fees may be applicable in relation to premium and/or priority services on offer at select locations. These include appointments outside application centre opening hours, and passport passback, where the customer pays to retain their passport during the application process.</p>

<p>Information on which application centres are ‘user pays’ and the additional services on offer can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre">commercial partner country</a> websites.</p>

<p>For applications handled on behalf of certain Commonwealth / Overseas Territories, a charge may be made for preparing and forwarding documents to the Commonwealth Country / Overseas Territory in support of an application for a visa, residence permit, identity card or travel document. There is no such charge for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-cta/common-travel-area-cta">referrals</a> of applications for entry clearance for the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and Gibraltar.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>ECB6.5 Fee Exceptions</h2>

<p>No fee is payable by the applicant in relation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an application made in connection with the official duty of any official of Her Majesty’s government;</li>
  <li>dependants of refugees or persons granted humanitarian protection who are applying as the partner (spouse/civil partner/unmarried/same sex partner) or child of the refugee or person granted humanitarian protection;</li>
  <li>applications under the EC Association Agreement with Turkey.</li>
</ul>

<p>No fee is payable in respect of exempt vignettes to individuals described as exempt in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exempt-exm/exempt-exm">ECG Exempt (EXM5)</a>, or applications made under the  EEA Regulations (EEA family permits ECG European Nationals &amp; Schemes EUN (21)).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>ECB 6.6 Discretion to waive the fee</h2>

<p>The official determining the application may decide to waive the payment of the fee or reduce the amount of the fee in relation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>scholarships funded by Her Majesty’s government;</li>
  <li>applications where an official determines to waive the fee as a matter of international courtesy;</li>
  <li>visitors under a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Bilateral Programme where the applicant intends to visit the United Kingdom in connection with programmes operated by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to give funds directly to Embassies and Missions outside the United Kingdom to support activities directly connected to the United Kingdom’s international priorities;</li>
  <li>visitors under a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Strategic Programme where the applicant intends to visit the United Kingdom in connection with programmes of funding operated by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to promote action on global issues in areas of strategic importance to the United Kingdom;</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The guidance for the discretion to waive a fee in other cases is being revised and is not currently operational.</p>

<p>You can still apply for a fee waiver but your application will be put on hold pending the revised guidance.</p>
</div>

<p>Discretion to waive a fee in other cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the Secretary of State determines that the fee should be waived (the exercise of this discretion should be applied in exceptional circumstances only, such as civil war or natural disaster).</li>
</ul>

<p>Posts have no discretion to waive visa fees for any other reason other than those listed in the fees legislation, as quoted in above.</p>

<p>If an applicant requests that the fee should be waived for reasons other than those listed above they should be advised to email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FeeWaiversEntryClearance@homeoffice.gov.uk">FeeWaiversEntryClearance@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> with the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name(s) and family name</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>nationality</li>
  <li>country where they will make an application</li>
  <li>passport number</li>
  <li>application type they wish to have the fee waived for</li>
</ul>

<p>Detailed reasons must be included on why the applicant is requesting a fee waiver including any information about why third party funding is not available and any exceptional circumstances, for example, civil war, natural disaster.</p>

<p>Destitution alone will not be considered as valid grounds for waiving fees. When considering waiver of the fee it is usual practice to consider not only the applicant’s ability to pay but also to take into account the sponsor’s, or other wider family’s ability to pay the fee.</p>
