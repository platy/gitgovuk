<p>This guidance is for local authority inspectors in England. You should read it alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/4/made" rel="external">Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is covered by the regulations and needs a licence to operate, you should consider all of the following guidance.</p>

<p>All dog day care activities need a licence if they’re carried out as a commercial business.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is a business and will need a licence, consider if the operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes any sale or carries out the activity to make a profit</li>
  <li>earns any commission or fee from the activity</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim20205">HMRC’s 9 badges of trade</a>.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income below the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income#trade">HMRC trading income allowance</a>, they do not require a licence for their activities.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income above the HMRC trading income allowance, they do not automatically qualify as a business.</p>

<p>To be in scope, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide daytime housing for other people’s dogs, as part of, or as the only activity of, the business</li>
  <li>arrange housing for other people’s dogs, for example, businesses which connect pet owners with people willing to look after their animals for no fee, just minor expenses, they must meet conditions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/2/made" rel="external">schedules 2 and 4 of the regulations</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Every business must keep an up-to-date list of all their premises where they carry out activities covered by the LAIA 2018 regulations.</p>

<p>Activities that fulfil one or more of the following criteria do not require a licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vet’s practices where housing is part of the dog’s treatment</li>
  <li>businesses that look after dogs in their owner’s homes, such as, dog sitters and dog walkers</li>
  <li>a business that looks after dogs in a business owner’s own home - these companies are licensed under home boarding</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minimum standards</h2>

<p>It is expected that all businesses will meet and maintain minimum standards. If on a renewal inspection you identify minor failings that do not compromise welfare standards, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities?#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">risk-based approach to renewing a licence</a>.</p>

<p>To grant a new animal activities licence for day care for dogs, you must check that businesses meet all of the minimum standards in this guidance.</p>

<h2>Higher standards</h2>

<p>Businesses that want to achieve a 4 or 5 star rating in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-star-ratings-and-licence-conditions">Animals activity star rating system</a> must meet the higher standards in this guidance.</p>

<p>If a dog day care facility would like to qualify at the higher standards, the business must meet:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100% of the required higher standards</li>
  <li>50% (or more) of the optional higher standards</li>
</ul>

<p>If a business meets the higher standards, they qualify for a longer licence that’s valid for 2 or 3 years rather than for one year. They’ll also pay a lower licence fee.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">Animal activity licensing process guidance</a> on the star rating system and how it incorporates a risk assessment of the business.</p>

<h2>Part A – General conditions (Schedule 2 of the Regulations)</h2>

<p>Paragraph numbers relate to the conditions in the schedules of the regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.0 </span> Licence display</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.1 A copy of the licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence must be displayed in a public-facing area of the premises such as the entrance or reception area.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.2 The name of the licence holder followed by the number of the licence holder’s licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any website used in respect of the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.0 </span> Records</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.1 The licence holder must ensure that at any time all the records that the licence holder is required to keep as a condition of the licence are available for inspection by an inspector in a visible and legible form or, where any such records are stored in electronic form, in a form from which they can readily be produced in a visible and legible form.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.2 The licence holder must keep all such records for at least 3 years beginning with the date on which the record was created.</p>
</div>

<p>Electronic records must be backed up.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.0 </span> Use, number and type of animal</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.1 No animals or types of animal other than those animals and types of animal specified in the licence may be used in relation to the relevant licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>This licence applies only to providing day care for dogs. If you are concerned about the welfare of other animals then you should inform the relevant person in the local authority, the police or a relevant animal welfare organisation.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.2 The number of animals kept for the activity at any time must not exceed the maximum that is reasonable taking into account the facilities and staffing on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence must clearly state the maximum numbers of dogs that are allowed on the premises. If there are more dogs on the premises than stated on the licence, this is a breach of the licence, especially if not reflected in increased staffing levels.</p>

<p>You should take into account other dogs, such as, pets or retired dogs, when deciding on the appropriate number of animals for the licence. For instance, if an applicant has 3 pet dogs on site, they must be included in the figure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.0 </span> Staffing</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.1 Sufficient numbers of people who are competent for the purpose must be available to provide a level of care that ensures that the welfare needs of all the animals are met.</p>
</div>

<p>The business must have enough staff to meet all dogs’ individual welfare needs fully.</p>

<p>Each member of staff should have 10 dogs or less to care for.</p>

  <li>the breed, age, health status, and needs of the dogs</li>

  <li>other services offered by the facility and how these impact the staff’s time to look after the dogs</li>
  <li>part-time staff and volunteers</li>
  <li>the layout of the premises</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

</div>

<p>The training policy must be reviewed and updated annually, and must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an annual appraisal</li>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.6 The animals must be transported and handled in a manner (for example, in relation to housing, temperature, ventilation and frequency) that protects them from pain, suffering, injury and disease.</p>
</div>

<p>All animals must be transported according to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3260/contents/made" rel="external">regulations laid down in current legislation</a>.</p>

<p>The licence holder must demonstrate that a suitable vehicle is available to transport the dogs. It does not have to be owned by the licence holder.</p>
