<p>This guidance is for local authority inspectors in England. You should read it alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/4/made" rel="external">Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is covered by the regulations and needs a licence to operate, you should consider all of the following guidance.</p>

<p>All dog kennel boarding activities need a licence if they are carried out as a commercial business.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is a business and will need a licence, consider if the operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes any sale or carries out the activity to make a profit</li>
  <li>earns any commission or fee from the activity</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim20205">HMRC’s 9 badges of trade</a>.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income below the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income#trade">HMRC trading income allowance</a>, they do not require a licence for their activities.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income above the HMRC trading income allowance, they do not automatically qualify as a business.</p>

<p>To be in scope, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide housing for other people’s dogs, where the provision of that housing is part or solely the activity of the business</li>
  <li>arrange housing for other people’s dogs - for example, businesses which connect pet owners with people willing to look after their animals for no fee, just minor expenses - they must meet conditions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/2/made" rel="external">schedules 2 and 4 of the regulations</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Every business must keep an up-to-date list of all their premises where they carry out activities covered by the <abbr title="Licensing of Activities Involving Animals">LAIA</abbr> 2018 regulations.</p>

<p>Activities that fulfil one or more of the following criteria do not require a licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>veterinary practices where the housing provided is part of the veterinary treatment of the animal</li>
  <li>businesses that provide day care for dogs and do not keep them overnight - these are under the scope of dog day care facilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minimum standards</h2>

<p>It is expected that all businesses will meet and maintain minimum standards. If on a renewal inspection you identify minor failings that do not compromise welfare standards, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">risk-based approach to renewing a licence</a> .</p>

<p>To grant a new animal activities licence for kennel boarding dogs, you must check that businesses meet all of the minimum standards in this guidance.</p>

<h2>Higher standards</h2>

<p>Businesses that meet the higher standard will get a 4 or 5 star rating in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">animals activity star rating system</a>.</p>

<p>Higher standards are required or optional. To achieve a higher rating, businesses boarding dogs need to achieve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100% of the required higher standards</li>
  <li>at least 50% of the optional higher standards</li>
</ul>

<p>If a business meets the higher standards, it will qualify for a longer licence that’s valid for 2 or 3 years rather than one year. This lowers the cost of the licence.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">Animal activity licensing process: statutory guidance for local authorities</a> for an explanation of the animal activity star rating system and how it incorporates a risk assessment of the business.</p>

<h2>Part A – General conditions (Schedule 2 of the Regulations)</h2>

<p>Paragraph numbers relate to the conditions in the schedules of the regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.0 </span> Licence display</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.1 A copy of the licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licensed premises address must be displayed on the licence. It must be displayed in a public-facing area of the premises, such as the entrance.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.2 The name of the licence holder followed by the number of the licence holder’s licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any website used in respect of the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.0 </span> Records</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.1 The licence holder must ensure that at any time all the records that the licence holder is required to keep as a condition of the licence are available for inspection by an inspector in a visible and legible form or, where any such records are stored in electronic form, in a form from which they can readily be produced in a visible and legible form.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.2 The licence holder must keep all such records for at least 3 years beginning with the date on which the record was created.</p>
</div>

<p>Electronic records must be backed up.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.0 </span> Use, number and type of animal</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.1 No animals or types of animal other than those animals and types of animal specified in the licence may be used in relation to the relevant licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>This licence applies only to the boarding of dogs. However, if there are welfare concerns relating to other animals then the inspector should inform any or all of the following, as appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the relevant person in the local authority</li>
  <li>the police</li>
  <li>a suitable animal welfare organisation</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.2 The number of animals kept for the activity at any time must not exceed the maximum that is reasonable, taking into account the facilities and staffing on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence conditions must clearly state the numbers of dogs that are kept for the licensable activity permitted at the premises. Undeclared numbers would be a breach of the licence, especially if not reflected in increased staffing levels.</p>

<p>Consideration of what is reasonable should take into account where a licenced premises keeps other dogs that are outside of the licenced activity, but who are cared for by the same staff which might impact facilities and staffing (for example, pets and retired dogs).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.0 </span> Staffing</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.1	Sufficient numbers of people who are competent for the purpose must be available to provide a level of care that ensures that the welfare needs of all the animals are met.</p>
</div>

<p>Each member of staff should have 25 dogs or less to care for.</p>

<p>If there is evidence that the dog’s welfare needs are not being met, you should consider the staffing levels against:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the size of premises</li>
  <li>the layout of the premises (the number of dogs that are allowed in each separate area)</li>
  <li>the type of dog</li>
  <li>the qualifications and experience of staff</li>
  <li>additional services offered by the facility</li>
  <li>use of part-time staff or volunteers</li>
  <li>advice from the local authority’s veterinary officer</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.2 The licence holder or a designated manager and any staff employed to care for the animals must have competence to identify the normal behaviour of the species for which they are caring and to recognise signs of, and take appropriate measures to mitigate or prevent, pain, suffering, injury, disease or abnormal behaviour</p>
</div>

<p>You should look at training records as evidence of suitable induction training of staff in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>animal welfare, including recognising poor welfare</li>
  <li>animal handling</li>
  <li>animal behaviour</li>
  <li>cleanliness and hygiene</li>
  <li>feeding and food preparation</li>
  <li>disease prevention and control</li>
  <li>recognition and first aid treatment of sick or injured animals</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff who care for the dogs must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold a formal qualification, such as a Level 2 Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (<abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr>) regulated qualification appropriate for their role</li>
  <li>show they have relevant and sufficient knowledge and experience</li>
</ul>

<p>If no accredited training course exists that is appropriate to the activity, then other evidence of training must be provided, such as industry generated courses.</p>

<p>Individuals undertaking an <abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr> regulated qualification must have suitably progressed in 12 months and have completed the qualification within 2 years.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.3 The licence holder must provide and ensure the implementation of a written training policy for all staff.</p>
</div>

<p>The staff training policy must be reviewed and updated each year.</p>

<p>It must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an annual appraisal</li>
  <li>planned and continued professional development</li>
  <li>recognition of knowledge gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies to all staff including the licence holder.</p>

<p>Staff participation can be shown by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>records of the courses they are taking</li>
  <li>records of written or online learning</li>
  <li>keeping up to date with any research or developments for specific breeds</li>
  <li>annual appraisal documents</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of staff attendance or completion of the training must be provided.</p>

<h4>Required higher standard for staffing</h4>

<p>The licence holder needs to have at least one full-time member of staff for every 15 dogs kept.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for staffing</h4>

<p>There must be a member of permanent, full-time staff with an appropriate Level 3 <abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr> regulated qualification.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.0 </span> Suitable environment</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.1 All areas, equipment and appliances that animals can access must present minimal risks of injury, illness and escape. They must be constructed in materials that are robust, safe and durable, in a good state of repair and well maintained.</p>
</div>

<p>The interior and exterior of the buildings must be maintained in good repair. Outer paths, gardens, exercise areas and general surroundings must be kept in a good, clean, presentable condition.</p>

<p>There must not be any sharp edges, projections, rough edges or other hazards that could risk injuring a dog.</p>

<p>Timber, if used, must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>good quality</li>
  <li>well-kept</li>
  <li>sealed or over-clad if there are any damaged areas</li>
</ul>

<p>Exposed wood must be smooth and treated and properly maintained to render it waterproof. All structural exterior wood (for example, fence posts) must be properly treated against wood rot (for example, tanalised). Only non-toxic products may be used.</p>

<p>No standing water from cleaning or urine is acceptable. Drainage must be permanently unblocked, with liquids able to run off into drains immediately. Drainage channels should be provided so that urine is not allowed to pass over walk areas in corridors and communal access areas.</p>

<p>Any drain covers in areas where dogs have access must be secure and designed and located to prevent toes and claws from being caught.</p>

<p>All interior surfaces that dogs have access to must be cleaned regularly and maintained in good order and repair. Wherever possible, interior surfaces must be smooth, waterproof and able to be cleaned. Floors must be non-hazardous for dogs to walk on, in particular to avoid slipping.</p>

<p>Doors and windows to the outside must be escape proof, securable, strong enough to resist impact and scratching, and to prevent injury. External doors and gates must be lockable. Those involved in the care of the dogs must have easy access to keys and any key code in case of emergency.</p>

<p>There must be at least 2 secure physical barriers (for example, a door or gate) between a dog and any entrance or exit to the property to the outer curtilage to avoid escape.</p>

<p>All wire fencing must be strong and rigid, sufficient height and kept in good repair to prevent an escape and dig-proof structure. If dogs have access to mesh, the diameter of the wire must not be less than 2 millimetres (British Standard 14 gauge welded mesh).</p>

<p>Square mesh size must not exceed 50 millimetres by 50 millimetres and for chain link it must not exceed 75 millimetres by 50 millimetres. Gaps or apertures must be small enough to prevent a dog’s head passing through, or entrapment of any limb or body parts.</p>

<p>Any electrical sockets and appliances in the dog designated rooms and where the dogs have access to must be secure and protected against damage.</p>

<p>Unit doors should open inwards to protect the health and safety of attending staff. Where this is not feasible there must be a documented procedure in place to demonstrate the safety of staff. For kennels where there are facing dog units accessed by an indoor corridor, the corridor should be at least 1.2 metres wide. If this is not feasible, demonstrable measures must be in place to protect the safety of staff.</p>

<p>Door openings must be constructed so that the passage of water and waste is not slowed or allowed to gather due to inaccessibility.</p>

<p>Kennels and runs must open onto secure corridors or other secure areas so that dogs are not able to escape from the premises. These corridors and areas must not be used as an exercise area.</p>

<p>Each unit should have a minimum headroom height of 1.8 metres and be designed to allow staff to access dogs 
and clean all parts of the unit safely. Where this is not feasible there must be a documented procedure in place to demonstrate the safety of staff.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.2 Animals must be kept in an environment suitable to their species and condition (including health status and age) at all times, with respect to:</p>
</div>

<p>(a) their behavioural needs</p>

<p>(b) its situation, space, air quality, cleanliness and temperature</p>

<p>(c) the water quality (where relevant)</p>

<p>(d) noise levels</p>

<p>(e) light levels</p>

<p>(f) ventilation</p>

<p>Dogs must not be restricted to areas when climatic conditions may cause them distress. Insulation and temperature regulation in the kennels must aim to keep the temperature in some part of the sleeping area above an absolute minimum of 10°C and below a maximum of 26°C.</p>

<p>Dogs must be monitored to check if they are too hot or too cold. If an individual dog is showing signs of heat or cold intolerance, steps must be taken to ensure the welfare of the dog. A dog must be able to remove itself from a direct source of heat.</p>

<p>Adequate ventilation must be provided to all interior areas without the creation of excessive, localised draughts, and to avoid excess humidity.</p>

<p>Heaters and electrical equipment must not be placed in a manner or location where they present a risk of burning or electric shock to dogs or humans, or a risk of fire.</p>

<p>Dogs that may be adversely affected by the barking of other dogs should be located in the quietest part of the kennel facility. Excessive noise must be avoided.</p>

<p>Dogs must have exposure to natural light for at least parts of the day.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.3	Staff must ensure that the animals are kept clean and comfortable.</p>
</div>

<p>Each occupied kennel must be cleaned daily at a minimum.</p>

<p>Dogs must be removed from the area when it is being cleaned.</p>

<p>Dogs should benefit from adequate routine grooming and other health regimes as needed and agreed with the owner. For example, eye cleaning or preventing long fur from matting. This must include attention to coat, teeth, ears and nails and inspection for parasites.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.4	Where appropriate for the species, a toileting area and opportunities for toileting must be provided.</p>
</div>

<p>Dogs must have regular opportunities during the day for toileting, taking into account individual needs.</p>

<p>There must be direct and continuous access to a run for toileting or the dog must be removed from the kennel unit to toilet away from its bed at least 4 times a day.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.5 Procedures must be in place to make sure housing and any equipment within it is cleaned as often as necessary and good hygiene standards are maintained. The housing must be capable of being thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.</p>
</div>

<p>Kennel units must be inspected daily and kept in a clean condition, in accordance with the cleaning and disinfection procedure produced by the facility.</p>

<p>Kennels must be disinfected at least once a week and at occupancy change.</p>

<p>Faeces must be removed from all areas as often as necessary and in any case a minimum of twice a day.
Where a pest problem is identified, a control programme must be implemented.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.6	The animals must be transported and handled in a manner that protects them from pain, suffering, injury and disease. This includes considering housing, temperature, ventilation and frequency.</p>
</div>

<p>All animals must be transported according to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3260/contents/made" rel="external">regulations laid down in current legislation</a>.</p>

<p>The licence holder must demonstrate that a suitable vehicle is available to transport the dogs. It does not have to be owned by the licence holder.</p>

<p>During transport, dogs must be suitably restrained to prevent injury using any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dog crate</li>
  <li>transport harness</li>
  <li>dog guard</li>
</ul>

<p>Dog crates need to be of adequate size for the dog to stand, lie down and turn around freely. Crates must be designed to provide good ventilation and be firmly secured.</p>

<p>Vehicles must be cleaned and disinfected after each collection and delivery of any dogs.</p>

<p>Dogs must not be left in vehicles for unreasonable periods and must never be left unattended in a car or other vehicle where the temperature may pose a risk to the animal. Consideration must be given to whether it is necessary to transport animals when the temperature poses a risk.</p>

<p>Sufficient breaks must be offered for water, food where appropriate and the chance to go to the toilet.</p>

<p>Dogs must be transported to vet facilities in an appropriate manner for their condition, taking care that transport does not cause further suffering. Veterinary advice on the condition of the animal and suitability for transport should be sought before transport.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.7	All the animals must be easily accessible to staff and for inspection. There must be sufficient light for the staff to work effectively and observe the animals.</p>
</div>

<p>Where practicable this must be natural light, but artificial light must be available. Where artificial lighting is used, this must be within a range of 10 to 12 hours daily.</p>

<p>Lights must be turned off to provide a period of darkness overnight.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.8	All resources must be provided in a way (for example as regards frequency, location and access points) that minimises competitive behaviour or the dominance of individual animals.</p>
</div>

<p>There must be multiples of all resources equal or greater than the number of dogs in the unit.</p>

<p>Resources include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>food</li>
  <li>water</li>
  <li>enrichment items (such as toys)</li>
  <li>resting and sleeping areas</li>
</ul>

<p>Dogs must be carefully monitored, especially at feeding times.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.9	The animals must not be left unattended in any situation or for any period likely to cause them distress.</p>
</div>

<p>Trained and competent staff must observe dogs regularly throughout the day as necessary for the individual health, safety and welfare of each dog.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for providing a suitable environment for dogs</h4>

<p>Dogs must be provided with a design and layout that gives them choice.</p>

<p>All individual dogs must be checked at least once at an appropriate interval during the out of hours period (for example, between 6pm and 8am) by CCTV or in person. There must be documented records for checking.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standards for providing a suitable environment for dogs</h4>

<p>Ventilation must be a managed, fixed or portable air system to make sure appropriate temperatures are maintained in all weathers. This can be an air conditioning unit or removable fans safely installed away from animals.</p>

<p>A noise management plan to reduce noise to the dogs must be in place.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physical barriers</li>
  <li>sound-absorbing build structure</li>
  <li>positive reinforcement training to keep barking down</li>
  <li>kennel design to prevent noise generation with demonstration of effectiveness</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.0 </span> Suitable diet</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>6.1	The animals must be provided with a suitable diet in terms of quality, quantity and frequency. Any new feeds must be introduced gradually to allow the animals to adjust to them.</p>
</div>

<p>Adult dogs must be fed at least once per day and in accordance with the individual dog’s needs. Dogs must be fed a complete diet appropriate to their age, breed, activity level and stage in the breeding cycle.</p>

<p>The diet must be agreed with the dog’s owner. If there are concerns about an individual dog’s diet, staff must tell the owners and seek veterinary advice.</p>
