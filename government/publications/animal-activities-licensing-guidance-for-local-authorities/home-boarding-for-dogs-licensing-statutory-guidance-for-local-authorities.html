<p>This guidance is for local authority inspectors in England. You should read it alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/4/made" rel="external">Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is covered by the regulations and needs a licence to operate, you should consider all of the following guidance.</p>

<p>All dog home boarding activities need a licence if they’re carried out as a commercial business.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is a business and will need a licence, consider if the operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes any sale or carries out the activity to make a profit</li>
  <li>earns any commission or fee from the activity</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim20205">HMRC’s 9 badges of trade</a>.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income below the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income#trade">HMRC trading income allowance</a>, they do not require a licence for their activities.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income above the HMRC trading income allowance, they do not automatically qualify as a business.</p>

<p>To be in scope, they must provide housing for other people’s dogs at home for day and overnight stays (home boarding).</p>

<p>This must be inside a domestic home which is not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the usual home where the animals are kept</li>
  <li>in outdoor kennels</li>
</ul>

<p>It does not include keeping a dog under a condition of the Animal Health Act 1981.</p>

<p>Businesses which arrange for the provision of accommodation for other people’s dogs will also be in scope. This includes franchises and businesses which connect pet owners with people willing to look after their animals for no fee.</p>

<p>The accommodation provided in these circumstances must meet the conditions in Schedule 2 and 4. It is the responsibility of the business to ensure that this is the case. The local authority needs to be satisfied that the conditions are met in all of the accommodation provided.</p>

<p>Contact the Local Government Animal Welfare Group for non-statutory guidance on franchisee and arranger model licensing.</p>

<p>Every business must keep an up-to-date list of all their premises where they carry out activities covered by the <abbr title="Licensing of Activities Involving Animals">LAIA</abbr> 2018 regulations.</p>

<p>Activities that fulfil one or more of the following criteria do not require a licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>veterinary practices where the housing is part of the treatment of the animal</li>
  <li>businesses that provide day care for dogs outside a home environment (see licence of providing day care for dogs)</li>
  <li>businesses that look after the dog within its normal place of residence, such as a dog sitter</li>
  <li>people who home board dogs and have a trading income below the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income#trade">HMRC trading income allowance</a>
</li>
  <li>cats must be boarded under a cat boarding licence</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minimum standards</h2>

<p>It is expected that all businesses will meet and maintain minimum standards. If on a renewal inspection you identify minor failings that do not compromise welfare standards, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">risk-based approach to renewing a licence</a>.</p>

<p>To grant a new animal activities licence for home boarding dogs, you must check that businesses meet all of the minimum standards in this guidance.</p>

<h2>Higher standards</h2>

<p>Businesses that meet the higher standard will get a 4 or 5 star rating in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">animals activity star rating system</a>.</p>

<p>Higher standards are required or optional.</p>

<p>To qualify as meeting the higher standards, the business needs to achieve all of the required higher standards as well as a minimum of 50% of the optional higher standards.</p>

<p>If a business meets the higher standards, they will qualify for a longer licence that is valid for 2 or 3 years rather than one year. This lowers the cost of the licence.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">Animal activity licensing process: statutory guidance for local authorities</a> for an explanation of the animal activity star rating system and how it incorporates a risk assessment of the business.</p>

<h2>Part A - General conditions (Schedule 2 of the Regulations)</h2>

<p>Paragraph numbers relate to the conditions in the schedules of the regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.0 </span> Licence display</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.1 A copy of the licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence must be displayed in a public-facing area of the premises such as, the entrance or reception area.</p>

<p>The licence holder must provide a list of their associated premises.</p>

<p>Details of any changes to the list of associated premises must be reported to the local authority within 30 days of the change.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.2 The name of the licence holder followed by the number of the licence holder’s licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any website used in respect of the licensable activity.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.1 The licence holder must ensure that at any time all the records that the licence holder is required to keep as a condition of the licence are available for inspection by an inspector in a visible and legible form or, where any such records are stored in electronic form, in a form from which they can readily be produced in a visible and legible form.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.2 The licence holder must keep all such records for at least 3 years beginning with the date on which the record was created.</p>
</div>

<p>Electronic records must be backed up.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.0 </span> Use, number and type of animal</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.1 No animals or types of animal other than those animals and types of animal specified in the licence may be used in relation to the relevant licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>This licence applies only to providing home boarding for dogs. If you are concerned about the welfare of other animals then you should inform the relevant person in the local authority, the police or a relevant animal welfare organisation.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.2 The number of animals kept for the activity at any time must not exceed the maximum that is reasonable taking into account the facilities and staffing on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence must state the maximum number of dogs that can be home boarded at the premises. Undeclared numbers are a breach of the licence, especially if they’re not reflected in increased staffing levels.</p>

<p>Each dog from the same family unit must have access to a room where it can sleep, go to hide, and be kept separate from other dogs. This is especially important when the proprietor is absent. Rooms must be high enough for a human adult to stand in.</p>

<p>Dogs must not be home boarded in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a conservatory</li>
  <li>a bedroom in which the usual occupant is below the age of 16</li>

  <li>a loft (unless converted to a standard suitable for a human to live in)</li>
  <li>a balcony</li>
  <li>an outside building, structure or shed</li>
</ul>

<p>Hallways and bathrooms can be used as designated rooms as long as the other conditions in this guidance can be met, such as space requirements, temperature and ventilation.</p>

<p>If a barrier is used to divide a designated room, this can be used as multiple spaces as long as each space meets the conditions in this guidance.</p>

<p>Dividing barriers must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>firmly fixed to the walls</li>
  <li>at least 1.83 metres high</li>
  <li>use wire mesh no larger than 50 millimetres by 50 millimetres</li>
</ul>

<p>Each divided space must have a floor area of at least 6 square metres.</p>

<p>Other dogs in the household should be considered as part of the number of dogs that can be reasonably cared for under a home boarding licence.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for rooms</h4>

<p>Bathrooms, hallways and partitioned rooms are not used as designated rooms.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.0 </span> Staffing</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.1 Sufficient numbers of people who are competent for the purpose must be available to provide a level of care that ensures that the welfare needs of all the animals are met.</p>
</div>

<p>Staffing levels must ensure that each dog’s individual welfare needs can be fully met when home boarded. Animal welfare requirements must not be compromised by a lack of staff.</p>

<p>There must be at least one competent person to help with care and supervision if the licence holder is absent for an extended period.</p>

<p>Each member of staff should have 10 dogs or less to care for.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.4 Where appropriate for the species, a toileting area and opportunities for toileting must be provided.</p>
</div>

<p>Dogs must have regular opportunities during the day for toileting in an outside secure area or as part of its exercise. Each dog’s individual needs should be taken into account.</p>

<p>Faeces must be removed from all areas at least twice a day, but as often as necessary.</p>

<p>Where a pest problem is identified, a control programme must be implemented.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.6 The animals must be transported and handled in a manner (including for example in relation to housing, temperature, ventilation and frequency) that protects them from pain, suffering, injury and disease.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence holder must demonstrate that a suitable vehicle is available to transport the dogs. It does not have to be owned by the licence holder. Transport must comply with any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3260/made&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1636972611049000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0fLJ21JEeIC2SkpvCB69Sq" rel="external">existing legal requirements</a>.</p>

<p>During transport, dogs must be restrained using a dog crate, transport harness or dog guard. Dog crates need to be large enough so that the dog can stand, lie down and turn around freely inside. Crates must be well ventilated and firmly secured. Dogs should be out of direct sunlight and away from heating vents.</p>

<p>Vehicles must be regularly cleaned and disinfected.</p>

<p>Dogs must not be left in vehicles for unreasonable periods. They must never be left unattended in a car or other vehicle where the temperature may risk the comfort and safety of the dog. The driver must think about whether it is necessary to transport dogs when the temperature poses a risk to the health of the dog.</p>

<p>Journeys must include sufficient breaks for water, food and toileting.</p>

<p>If the business includes a collection and delivery service, dogs must be on a lead outside the vehicle to stop them escaping.</p>

<p>Dogs must be transported to vet facilities in an appropriate manner for their condition and without further suffering. Vet advice on the condition of the animal and suitability for transport should be sought before transport.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.7 All the animals must be easily accessible to staff and for inspection. There must be sufficient light for the staff to work effectively and observe the animals.</p>
</div>

<p>There must be good light in all areas of the facility where the dogs can go. Where practicable this must be natural light, but artificial light must be available. Where artificial lights are used, there must be 10 to 12 hours of it daily.</p>

<p>Lights must be turned off at night to provide a period of darkness.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.8 All resources must be provided in such a way (for example, as regards frequency, location, access points) that minimises competitive behaviour or the dominance of individual animals.</p>
</div>

<p>In a communal area, there must be multiple resources such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>food</li>
  <li>water</li>
  <li>enrichment items</li>
  <li>resting and sleeping areas</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of each item provided should be at least the same as the number of dogs in any communal area.</p>

<p>Dogs must be monitored carefully especially at feeding times.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.9 The animals must not be left unattended in any situation or for any period of time that is likely to cause them distress.</p>
</div>

<p>Dogs must have human company. They must not be routinely left alone for more than 3 hours in a 24 hour period, or shorter intervals as necessary for the individual health, safety and welfare of an individual dog. All dogs should be observed by trained and competent staff.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for providing a suitable environment for dogs</h4>

<p>Ventilation must be a managed, fixed or portable, air system to maintain temperatures in all weathers. This can be an air conditioning unit or removable fans installed safely away from animals.</p>

<p>There must be a designated other person or member of staff who can cover any emergency, so that the dogs are never left alone.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.0 </span> Suitable diet</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>6.1 The animals must be provided with a suitable diet in terms of quality, quantity and frequency. Any new feeds must be introduced gradually to allow the animals to adjust to them.</p>
</div>

<p>Adult dogs must be fed at least once per day according to the individual dog’s needs. Their diet must be discussed and agreed with the owner.</p>

<p>If there are concerns about a dog’s diet the owners must be informed and veterinary advice sought.</p>

<p>Dogs must be separated at feeding time unless the owner has allowed this by written consent.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>6.2 Feed and (where appropriate) water intake must be monitored, and any problems recorded and addressed.</p>
