<p>This guidance is for local authority inspectors in England. You should read it alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/4/made" rel="external">Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is covered by the regulations and needs a licence to operate, you should consider all of the following guidance.</p>

<p>All keeping or training animals for exhibition activities need a licence if they’re carried out as a commercial business.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is a business and will need a licence, consider if the operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes any sales or carries out the activity to make a profit</li>
  <li>earns any commission or fee from the activity</li>
  <li>often exhibits or trains animals for a fee, such as at dog shows like Crufts</li>
  <li>does not often exhibit or train animals for a fee, but the profit margin is high</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim20205">HMRC’s 9 badges of trade</a>.
If someone has a trading income below the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income#trade">HMRC trading income allowance</a>, they do not require a licence for their activities.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income above the HMRC trading income allowance, they do not automatically qualify as a business.</p>

<p>Businesses operating on a commercial basis will need a licence if they keep or train animals for exhibition for education or entertainment.</p>

<p>This can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to any audience in person</li>
  <li>by recording visual images of the animals to play it to people using any technology</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of businesses include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mobile animal exhibits that visit schools</li>
  <li>weddings</li>
  <li>private parties</li>
  <li>fairs</li>
  <li>any other events that have an audience</li>
</ul>

<p>It also includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pony parties where the ponies are not ridden</li>
  <li>exhibiting domestic animals in a circus</li>
  <li>businesses which keep animals for exhibition through electronic media, for example, animals used in films or TV</li>
  <li>businesses which train animals for exhibition, either to an audience or through electronic media</li>
</ul>

<p>If a business is based outside England and brings in an animal for exhibition, they must apply to either the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first authority where they will be performing</li>
  <li>authority where the animals will be kept for the duration of their stay</li>
</ul>

<p>The guide does not apply to agents who organise the exhibition of animals, but do not own or train them.</p>

<p>Agents must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have limited or no contact with the animals</li>
  <li>make sure all keepers and trainers are licensed and comply with the regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide also does not apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people who organise shows where animals are exhibited, such as Crufts and animal trade shows</li>
  <li>registered charities that exhibit animals as part of charitable work, unless it is doing it on a commercial basis</li>
  <li>training or exhibiting animals for military or police purposes, such as training police dogs or showing them at fairs</li>
  <li>training or exhibiting animals for sports, such as horse or greyhound racing</li>
  <li>licensed zoos</li>
</ul>

<p>There is separate guidance to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/zoo-licence">get a zoo licence</a>.</p>

<h2>Part A – General conditions (Schedule 2 of the Regulations)</h2>

<p>Paragraph numbers relate to the conditions in the schedules of the regulations.</p>

</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.0 </span> Records</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.1 The licence holder must ensure that at any time all the records that the licence holder is required to keep as a condition of the licence are available for inspection by an inspector in a visible and legible form or, where any such records are stored in electronic form, in a form from which they can readily be produced in a visible and legible form.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.2 The licence holder must keep all such records for at least 3 years beginning with the date on which the record was created.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.1 No animals or types of animal other than those animals and types of animal specified in the licence may be used in relation to the relevant licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence must clearly state the maximum numbers of each species or species group that can be used for the activity. This does not include fish.</p>

<p>The licence holder can have less than the maximum number of animals without informing the local authority. 
If the licence holder goes over the maximum number of animals for the licence they must inform the local authority.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.2 The number of animals kept for the activity at any time must not exceed the maximum that is reasonable taking into account the facilities and staffing on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>Any animals kept as pets are not included in the licence, they must not be exhibited.</p>

<p>If animals are in a shared housing enclosure, the licence holder must be able to show that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there are enough resources for each animal</li>
  <li>all animals can do similar activities at the same time, such as all birds perching or feeding</li>
  <li>animals can separate off from a social group</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.0 </span> Staffing</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.1 Sufficient numbers of people who are competent for the purpose must be available to provide a level of care that ensures that the welfare needs of all the animals are met.</p>
</div>

<p>No animal must be kept for exhibition or exhibited unless staff on duty are competent in their care and welfare.</p>

<p>Staff must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a recognisable qualification</li>
  <li>show they have relevant and sufficient knowledge and experience, for example, working on a film set or mobile animal exhibit</li>
</ul>

<p>Licence holders keeping venomous species that are dangerous to human health must make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enough staff are trained in that specific species management</li>
  <li>these staff are available at all times</li>
</ul>

<p>Written instructions must be given to staff to explain the provision of healthcare. These must include procedures to follow if there is an incident with any venomous animal and a member staff or the public.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.2 The licence holder or a designated manager and any staff employed to care for the animals must have competence to identify the normal behaviour of the species for which they are caring and to recognise signs of, and take appropriate measures to mitigate or prevent, pain, suffering, injury, disease or abnormal behaviour.</p>
</div>

<p>You should look at training records as evidence of suitable induction training of staff in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>animal welfare, including recognising poor welfare</li>
  <li>animal handling</li>
  <li>animal behaviour</li>
  <li>cleanliness and hygiene</li>
  <li>feeding and food preparation</li>

</div>

<p>The staff training policy must be reviewed and updated each year.</p>

<p>It must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an annual appraisal</li>
  <li>planned and continued professional development</li>
  <li>recognition of knowledge gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies to all staff including the licence holder.</p>

<p>Training can be demonstrated by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>knowledge of research and developments for specific species</li>
  <li>engagement with online courses</li>
  <li>annual appraisal documents</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of staff attendance or completion of the training must be provided.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.0 </span> Suitable environment</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.1 All areas, equipment and appliances that animals can access must present minimal risks of injury, illness and escape.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>They must be constructed in materials that are:</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>robust</li>
  <li>safe and durable</li>
  <li>in a good state of repair</li>
  <li>well-maintained</li>
</ul>

<p>Timber must be good quality and well kept. Any damaged areas must be sealed or over-clad. Wood must be smooth, treated, properly maintained and waterproof.</p>

<p>Interior surfaces, including floors, must be smooth and waterproof. Surfaces must be able to be disinfected, where appropriate. Floors must have a non-slip, solid surface. Junctions between sections must be covered or sealed.</p>

<p>There must not be any sharp edges, projections, rough edges or other hazards which could injure an animal.</p>

<p>Unprotected electrical cables must not be in reach of any animal.</p>

<p>All materials must be non-toxic.</p>

<p>Doors must be strong enough to resist impact, scratching and chewing, and must be capable of being effectively secured. Gaps or apertures must be small enough to prevent an animal’s head passing through, or entrapment of any limb or body parts.</p>

<p>Door openings must be constructed in a way that the passage of water or waste is not prevented. Water or waste must not be allowed to gather because of inaccessibility.</p>

<p>All wire mesh and fencing must be kept in good repair to stop animals from digging or escaping.</p>

<p>If any metal bars, mesh, or frames are used, they must be of suitable gauge with enough spacing to stop animals escaping or getting trapped.</p>

<p>Care must be taken if aviaries or cages are constructed with newly galvanised mesh to prevent heavy metal poisoning. This is particularly important for parrots, they will often chew the metal.</p>

<p>Any drainage must be effective to make sure there is no standing or pooling of liquids. Waste water must not run off into neighbouring pens or units. Drainage channels must be provided.</p>

<p>If appropriate, animal pens and cages must open onto secure corridors or secure areas so animals cannot escape from the premises. These corridors or areas must not be used as an exercise area.</p>

<p>Housing must be inspected often for damage and potential injury or escape points. Any damaged housing must be repaired or replaced immediately.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.2 Animals must be kept at all times in an environment suitable to their species and condition (including health status and age) with respect to:</p>
</div>

<p>(a) their behavioural needs</p>

<p>(b) its situation, space, air quality, cleanliness and temperature</p>

<p>(c) the water quality (where relevant)</p>

<p>(d) noise levels</p>

<p>(e) light levels</p>

<p>(f) ventilation</p>

<p>Animals must be given suitable housing and rest areas. These will depend on the species or species group.</p>

<p>All housing must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>secure (predator proof, escape proof and lockable)</li>
  <li>clean and free from parasites and vermin</li>
  <li>free from hazards, such as sharp projections and edges</li>
  <li>sheltered from extremes of weather</li>
  <li>at a temperature suitable to the species of animal</li>
  <li>ventilated or oxygenated for aquatic species</li>
</ul>

<p>Ventilation must be provided to all interior areas, as appropriate to the species. It must have no harmful effect on temperature or humidity.</p>

<p>If there is no shade, direct sunlight and other unintended heat sources must be avoided.</p>

<p>Light must be provided in suitable light and dark cycles for the species. If natural light is insufficient, suitable artificial lighting must be used.</p>

<p>The licence holder must be able to show the inspector that there is appropriate lighting for the species. For example, if specific waveforms of light, such as ultraviolet B (<abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr>), are integral to the life support of a species, this must be shown to the inspector.</p>

<p>Animals must be able to move away from direct lighting.</p>

<p>In tiered housing, water, food or waste products must not contaminate lower levels.</p>

<p>In housing where isolation is not practical (such as aquaria or mixed-species aviaries) waste must be managed properly to prevent contamination of food and water.</p>

<p>Water quality must be checked weekly if it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an integral part of life support for a species</li>
  <li>poor quality, so it becomes dangerous to the health of the animal</li>
</ul>

<p>Records must be kept of all water tests.</p>

<p>Noise disturbance must be reduced. The licence holder must be able to show what steps will be taken if noise becomes a problem.</p>

<p>Animals must not be exposed to draughts, when appropriate.</p>

<p>All housing must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a comfortable resting area that all housed animals can use at the same time</li>
  <li>enough clean bedding material that is suitable for the species and individual animals</li>
</ul>

<p>All housing must allow an animal to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lie stretched out fully</li>
  <li>rest comfortably</li>
  <li>stand in their natural posture</li>
  <li>be comfortable in their environment</li>
  <li>be kept in appropriate social groups</li>
  <li>to move around freely - examples include climbing, swimming or jumping</li>
  <li>have separate areas for sleeping, toileting and exercising</li>
  <li>have the ability to move away from the social group, where appropriate</li>
  <li>hide from human view or other animals in the enclosure, where appropriate</li>
  <li>hide from potentially frightening stimuli (anything that triggers a physical or behavioural change)</li>
</ul>

<p>The enclosure size must be suitable for the species. It must be adjusted according to its size as the animal grows. It must also be adjusted if a group of animals are kept together. Any changes to the group dynamics may need separation facilities or bigger enclosures.</p>

<p>Whilst being temporarily exhibited, enclosure sizes that are smaller than that considered best practice for long term husbandry can be used.</p>

<p>If animals are kept or displayed outdoors, they must always have suitable protection from adverse weather.</p>

<p>Fish must be able to swim freely and turn around in aquariums or ponds.</p>

<p>Birds must be able to stretch their wings freely.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.3 Staff must ensure that the animals are kept clean and comfortable.</p>
</div>

<p>Each occupied unit must be cleaned often. Waste materials must be removed as needed.</p>

<p>For species that are in poor health, or should not be disturbed during breeding seasons, cleaning should be reduced. Hygienic living conditions must be maintained.</p>

<p>If appropriate, all animals must benefit from a suitable grooming and health routine as needed. This could include cleaning the eyes or keeping long fur from matting. It would cover regular attention to coat, teeth, ears and nails and checking for parasites.</p>

<p>Any cleaning products used must be non-toxic to the animals. There must be appropriate timed separation between disinfection and re-introduction of livestock.</p>

<p>Soiled bedding must be removed in a timely manner and replaced immediately.</p>

<p>Empty cages must be cleaned, disinfected and allowed to dry before new stock arrives. Surface materials must be replaced as needed. Enclosure fixtures and fittings must be adequately sanitised.</p>

<p>Working fish systems must not be treated with routine chemical sterilisation. Fish must not experience rapid fluctuation in chemical composition of their water, unless this is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the controlled treatment of disease</li>
  <li>part of a controlled breeding programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Acceptable conditions may vary substantially according to the species of fish. If staff are in doubt, they must get expert advice.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.4 Where appropriate for the species, a toileting area and opportunities for toileting must be provided.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.5 Procedures must be in place to make sure housing and any equipment within it is cleaned as often as necessary and good hygiene standards are maintained. The housing must be capable of being thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.</p>
</div>

<p>To keep a clean environment, a cleaning procedure must be in place.</p>

<p>It must detail the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>routine cleaning programme</li>
  <li>procedure for cleaning between periods of occupation</li>
  <li>management procedures for any human disease risks</li>
</ul>

<p>If a pest problem is identified, a pest control programme must be put in place.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.6 The animals must be transported and handled in a manner (including for example, in relation to housing, temperature, ventilation and frequency) that protects them from pain, suffering, injury and disease.</p>
</div>

<p>If the licence holder collects or delivers any animals, they must be transported according to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3260/contents/made" rel="external">the regulations laid down in current legislation</a>.</p>

<p>The licence holder must demonstrate that a suitable vehicle is available to transport the animals. It does not have to be owned by the licence holder.</p>

<p>Predators and prey must not be kept within sight, sound or smell during transport.</p>

<p>Fully trained and hooded birds of prey can be safely transported on a cadge if they are under supervision. If not, birds of prey should be transported in specially constructed travelling boxes. These allow the birds to at least stand up and turn around.</p>

<p>Birds must have the opportunity to perch during transport, if appropriate.</p>

<p>All animals must be provided with an appropriate temperature for their species when in transit. Hot and cold weather procedures must be in place.</p>

<p>Animals must not be left in vehicles for unreasonable periods. They must never be left unattended in a car or other vehicle when the temperature may pose a risk to the animal. Consideration must be given to whether it is necessary to transport animals when the temperature poses a risk.</p>

<p>Animals must be deemed fit to travel. Animals must be transported to veterinary facilities in an appropriate manner for their condition.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.7 All the animals must be easily accessible to staff and for inspection. There must be sufficient light for the staff to work effectively and observe the animals.</p>
</div>

<p>Enclosures must allow for a visual inspection with minimal disturbance to the animal.</p>

<p>Lights must be turned off overnight to provide a period of darkness, unless the species requirements state otherwise. Consideration must be given to the specific requirements of nocturnal species.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.8 All resources must be provided in a way (for example, as regards frequency, location and access points) that minimises competitive behaviour or the dominance of individual animals.</p>
</div>

<p>Examples of resources include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>food</li>
  <li>water</li>
  <li>resting and sleeping areas</li>
  <li>enrichment items, such as toys</li>
</ul>

<p>There must be enough resources for each animal in any shared enclosure. This will minimise dominance. If dominance is identified, extra resources must be provided.</p>

<p>Animals that are kept together must be monitored carefully, especially at feeding times.</p>

<p>Staff must be trained to recognise signs of group disruption, for example, competition or aggression. Group disruption can negatively affect animal welfare.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.9 The animals must not be left unattended in any situation or for any period likely to cause them distress.</p>
</div>

<p>All animals must be visited as appropriate for the individual animal.</p>

<p>Staff must visit animals regularly, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>every 4 to 6 hours during the day</li>
  <li>as necessary for the health, safety and welfare of each animal (according to its species)</li>
</ul>

<p>There must be a documented system to record observations of illness, injury or behavioural problems. This documented system must be maintained.</p>

<p>Any handling or interaction with animals by the public must be supervised at all times.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.0 </span> Suitable diet</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>6.1 The animals must be provided with a suitable diet in terms of quality, quantity and frequency. Any new feeds must be introduced gradually to allow the animals to adjust to them.</p>
</div>

<p>Animals must be fed an adequate and balanced diet to meet their individual nutritional needs.</p>

<p>Animals must be fed a complete diet appropriate to their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>activity level</li>
  <li>breed</li>
  <li>species</li>
  <li>stage in the breeding cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff must have knowledge of the nutritional needs for each species they care for.</p>

<p>If there are concerns about an individual animal’s diet, staff must get appropriate nutritional and veterinary advice.
Food supplements, including vitamins and minerals, must be given if needed at the correct dosage for the individual species. The supplements must be in a form appropriate to the species, so that enough supplementation is given.</p>

<p>Fresh foods must be kept refrigerated where appropriate. Frozen foods must be stored in an appropriate deep freeze and defrosted thoroughly to room temperature before use.</p>

<p>Live food, such as crickets, must be housed in suitable escape proof containers. If the live food is uneaten in a short period, it must be removed if it poses a risk to the species that feeds on it. For example, crickets could bite reptiles.</p>

<p>Providing live vertebrate prey as food should only be done in exceptional circumstances. For example, when a snake is not eating any other food. This must be on an individual animal basis for specified animals only. A written justification must be completed.</p>

<p>This justification must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be available to inspectors</li>
  <li>be agreed by senior staff</li>
  <li>include veterinary advice (weighing up the welfare of the predator and prey)</li>
</ul>

<p>7.1 Active and effective environmental enrichment must be provided to the animals in inside and any outside environments.</p>
</div>

<p>Animals must be able to express natural behaviours in their living environment. They may need environmental enrichment such as objects and substrates. For example, giving bedding material or designing housing to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physical requirements, such as perches</li>
  <li>environmental requirements, such as humidity levels</li>
</ul>

<p>These should not have the potential to cause injury. They should be replaced if damaged.</p>

<p>As appropriate to the species, enrichment objects must be changed on a regular basis to introduce novelty and maintain interest. When adding new enrichment devices, staff must make sure the animal is closely monitored for signs of distress.</p>

<p>Accessories must be disinfected between animals or they must be disposable.</p>

Birds must not be tethered (tied up) permanently.</p>

<p>If animals are in a temporary enclosure and cannot move fully, for example, when being exhibited, they must be given the chance to move fully at least once a day. A record must be kept of this. Not being able to move fully means they cannot use their full range of movements, such as running or flying.</p>

<p>The behaviour of individual animals must be monitored each day. Any changes in behaviours that show stress, fear, pain and anxiety must be recorded and acted upon.</p>

<p>Staff that are responsible for the care of animals must be able to identify animals that are anxious or fearful about contact or handling. Animals must only be exhibited if they are suitable for the type of exhibition involved (including any handling, noise, lighting, special effects, or being around other animals). They must have their

<p>Solitary species must not be kept in social groups. Ideally they should not be kept within sight of each other. If this is not possible, enough distance and visual barriers must be provided to prevent stress.</p>

<p>Animals working together must be familiarised before they attend any events. Staff must avoid using predator and prey species at the same time.</p>

<p>A policy must be in place for monitoring the introduction of new animals to existing groups. It will aim to avoid stress to new or resident animals, and explain steps to take if problems happen.</p>

<p>All props, costumes and equipment must be inspected before and after they are used. The animals must be examined for signs of discomfort, rubbing or injury.</p>

<p>Props, animal costumes, make-up and any special effects must not pose a risk to the animal. They must not cause any unnecessary pain, suffering, distress or discomfort. They must be used for the shortest time possible.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (used to produce dry ice) and artificial smoke should be avoided - it can be harmful to many species and cause them distress. Carbon dioxide and artificial smoke must never be used around birds, reptiles or amphibians.</p>

<p>Animals must not be exposed to glare, heat, noises or other conditions unless specifically habituated to these conditions before the exhibition. For animals trained in this way, exposures must be reduced to the shortest possible time. If possible, the effect should be achieved by other methods, such as camera angles and techniques.

<p>7.1 A register must be kept of each animal exhibited or to be exhibited which must include:</p>
</div>

<p>(a) the full name of the supplier of the animal</p>

<p>(b) its date of birth</p>

<p>(c) the date of its arrival</p>

<p>(d) its name (if any), age, sex, neuter status, description and microchip or ring number (if applicable)</p>

<p>(e) the name and contact details of the animal’s normal vet and details of any insurance relating to it</p>

<p>(g) a record of the date or dates of the animal’s most recent vaccination, worming and flea treatments</p>

<p>(h) the distance to and times taken for it to travel to and from each exhibition event</p>

<p>The register must state if the animal does not need vaccinations, worming or flea treatment. If any of this information is unknown, the reason must be documented.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>7.2 A record of when the animals are exhibited must be kept and an animal rotation policy must be put in place to ensure that the animals have enough rest between and during exhibition events.</p>
</div>

<p>The log must include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date and time of the exhibit</li>
  <li>duration of the exhibit (arrival to departure time)</li>
  <li>type of exhibit</li>
  <li>animals used in the exhibit</li>
  <li>location of the exhibit</li>
  <li>distance and travel time to the exhibit from the licensed premises</li>
</ul>

<p>The time animals are used for exhibition events must be recorded. This must include the time spent working, resting and any other actions. It needs to record comments on behaviour, injury or any other problem.</p>

<p>Call sheets must be kept.</p>

<p>A record must be kept for each individual animal setting out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how often they are used in an exhibit</li>
  <li>how long they are used in an exhibit</li>
  <li>what rest periods they have in the home environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Animals must have clear breaks from exhibits that allow them to perform normal behaviour in their home environment. This includes sleeping, feeding and play, and must have sufficient breaks.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>7.3 All the animals used in exhibition events must be in good physical and mental health.</p>
</div>

<p>All animals used in exhibition events must be allowed to acclimatise when they arrive. This must be before the exhibition starts.</p>

<p>During exhibition breaks, animals must either be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>moved to a suitable, secure designated place</li>
  <li>exercised if suitable, unless it would damage their welfare more so than remaining in the exhibition area</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>7.4 The exhibited animals must be suitable for the specific conditions, type of enclosure and actions involved in the exhibition.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>7.5 Any equipment, chemicals and other materials used in the exhibition must not cause the animals pain, discomfort, fatigue or stress.</p>
</div>

<p>Toxic substances must not be used at the same time as the animals in any production. If hazardous or toxic substances are involved beforehand, there must be washing facilities. Emergency treatments for animals should be close to the site and Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (<abbr title="Control of Substances Hazardous to Health">COSHH</abbr>) data sheets need to be completed. These should be circulated as needed.</p>

<p>The data sheets must be given to the attending vet if an accident happens (for example, the animal touches, breathes in or eats such a substance).</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>7.6 The animals must be transported in suitable, secure and appropriately labelled carriers.</p>
</div>

<p>Carriers must be suitable for the species. They must be large enough to allow the animal to move around, but small enough to reduce any injury during transit. If movement must be restricted to avoid injury, the reasons must be stated in the written transport procedure.</p>

<p>If an animal needs external life support, this must be provided during transportation. For example, appropriate temperatures for reptiles and the correct water temperature for fish.</p>

<p>Animal carriers must be appropriately secured when they are in transit. This is to make sure there is no movement or escape of the animal.</p>

<p>Animals must not be mixed with different species and unfamiliar animals in carriers.</p>

<p>If a number of animals are mixed in the same carrier, it must be of an appropriate size to stop overcrowding.</p>

<p>Transport carriers must be kept in a clean and hygienic condition.</p>

<p>Each animal carrier must have a label securely attached to identify the contents. The label must state that it contains live animals.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>7.7 The licence holder or the licence holder’s staff must undertake a risk assessment before each exhibition event.</p>
</div>

<p>The welfare risk assessment must assess against each of the 5 welfare needs of the Animal Welfare Act 2006.</p>

<p>It must state the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mitigating measures taken to reduce risks</li>
  <li>people responsible for this</li>
</ul>

<p>The operator must familiarise themselves with the evacuation procedure for each venue in case of an emergency.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>7.8 The animals must not be handled by persons whose behaviour appears at the time to be influenced by the consumption of alcohol or by any psychoactive substance.</p>
