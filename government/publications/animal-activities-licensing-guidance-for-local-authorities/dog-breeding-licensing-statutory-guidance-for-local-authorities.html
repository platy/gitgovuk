<p>This guidance is for local authority inspectors in England. You should read it alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/4/made" rel="external">Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018</a> (<abbr title="Licensing of Activities Involving Animals">LAIA</abbr>).</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is covered by the regulations and needs a licence to operate, you should consider all of this guidance.</p>

<p>There’s a limit on the number of litters that dog breeders can have unless a breeder can prove that they will not sell any of the puppies from these litters as puppies or adults.</p>

<p>Businesses should tell their relevant licensing local authority by email or phone when each litter of puppies is whelped.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is a business and will need a licence, consider if the operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes any sale or carries out the activity to make a profit</li>
  <li>earns any commission or fee from the activity</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim20205">HMRC’s 9 badges of trade</a>.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income below the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income#trade">HMRC trading income allowance</a>, they do not require a licence for their activities.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income above the HMRC trading income allowance, they do not automatically qualify as a business.</p>

<p>They must have a licence, if they do either or both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>breeding 3 or more litters of puppies in any 12-month period - unless they can prove that none of the puppies have been sold as puppies or adults</li>
  <li>breeding dogs and advertising a business of selling dogs - as defined under the business test</li>
</ul>

<p>Businesses need a licence regardless of the number of litters produced . This is not restricted to registered businesses. Individuals can also be classed as a business depending on the extent of their activities.</p>

<p>You should consider these factors when determining whether someone is ‘advertising a business’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number, frequency or volume of sales - systematic and repeated transactions using the same means of advertising are likely to indicate a commercial activity</li>
  <li>high volumes of animals sold or advertised for sale could indicate a business</li>
  <li>low volumes of animals sold or advertised could indicate a business where high sales prices or large profit margins are involved</li>
  <li>high range and variability in the breeds traded - a wide variety of breeds being advertised could indicate the commercial nature of the activity</li>
  <li>high numbers of advertisements of puppies for sale, including on classified websites, could indicate commercial behaviour, even where there is no actual sale taking place through the internet  this could be high numbers of advertisements at any one time or over a short period of time</li>
  <li>advertising through a variety of sites, forums or media could indicate a commercial activity</li>
  <li>the sale of animals with non-UK documentation or microchip could indicate commercial activity</li>
</ul>

<p>Every business must keep an up-to-date list of all their premises where they carry out activities covered by the <abbr title="Licensing of Activities Involving Animals">LAIA</abbr> 2018 regulations.</p>

<p>Activities that fulfil one or more of the following criteria do not require a licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>organisations can provide documented evidence (if requested) that none of the puppies were sold or that they kept all of the puppies themselves as puppies or adults - documented evidence will need to include records of the new owners of all of the puppies and provide details on why there was no transaction involved (including in kind)</li>
  <li>registered charities that rehome puppies that are born to rescue dogs, unless such registered charities are in practice running this element of their operations as a commercial activity</li>
  <li>anyone breeding only assistance dogs as defined in the Equality Act 2010 (for example, Guide Dogs for the Blind)</li>
  <li>anyone keeping a dog under the Animal Health Act 1981</li>
  <li>organisations regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986</li>
</ul>

<h2>Appoint of a vet for inspection</h2>

<p>A vet must be appointed for the initial inspection for the licensed application for the breeding of dogs.</p>

<p>Where the vet is accompanied by a suitably qualified local inspector, they will be appointed under 4(5) of the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals)(England) Regulations 2018.</p>

<p>Where the vet is required by the local authority to carry out the inspection without being accompanied by a suitably qualified officer, they must be appointed under section 51 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 (the Act) to exercise the enforcement powers available under the Act. They must also be appointed under 4(5) of the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals)(England) Regulations 2018.</p>

<p>Where the vet is required by the local authority to carry out the inspection without being accompanied by a suitably qualified officer, the vet must be appointed in writing by the appropriate person with delegated powers within the local authority.</p>

<h2>Minimum standards</h2>

<p>It is expected that all businesses will meet and maintain minimum standards. If on a renewal inspection you identify minor failings that do not compromise welfare standards, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities?#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">risk-based approach to renewing a licence</a>.</p>

<p>To grant a new animal activities licence for breeding dogs, you must check that businesses meet all of the minimum standards in this guidance.</p>

<h2>Higher standards</h2>

<p>Businesses that meet the higher standard will get a 4 or 5 star rating in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">animals activity star rating system</a>.</p>

<p>To meet the higher standards, the breeding of dogs premises must achieve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the required higher standards</li>
  <li>a minimum of 50% of the optional higher standards</li>
</ul>

<p>If a business meets the higher standards, they qualify for a longer licence that’s valid for 2 or 3 years rather than for one year. They’ll also pay a lower licence fee.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">Animal activity licensing process: statutory guidance for local authorities</a> for an explanation of the animal activity star rating system and how it incorporates a risk assessment of the business.</p>

<h2>Part A – General conditions (schedule 2 of the regulations)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.0 </span> Licence display</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.1 A copy of the licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The address of the licensed premises must be displayed on the licence.</p>

<p>The licence must be displayed in a public-facing area of the premises such as the entrance or animal introduction area. In a home environment, the licence should be shown to any potential purchasers.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.2 The name of the licence holder followed by the number of the licence holder’s licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any website used in respect of the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.0 </span> Records</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.1 The licence holder must ensure that at any time all the records that the licence holder is required to keep as a condition of the licence are available for inspection by an inspector in a visible and legible form or, where any such records are stored in electronic form, in a form from which they can readily be produced in a visible and legible form.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.2 The licence holder must keep all such records for at least 3 years beginning with the date on which the record was created.</p>
</div>

<p>Electronic records must be backed up.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.0 </span> Use, number and type of animal</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.1 No animals or types of animal other than those animals and types of animal specified in the licence may be used in relation to the relevant licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>This licence only applies to breeding dogs. However, if there are welfare concerns relating to any other animals then the inspector should inform either the relevant person in the local authority, the police or suitable animal welfare organisation.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.2 The number of animals kept for the activity at any time must not exceed the maximum that is reasonable taking into account the facilities and staffing on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence must clearly state the total number of dogs on the premises that are kept for licensable breeding.</p>

<p>The total must include the number of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>breeding bitches</li>
  <li>stud dogs</li>
  <li>litters on site</li>
  <li>other dogs that are not in scope including pets, retired dogs and those that are under breeding age</li>
</ul>

<p>If businesses keep more dogs for licensable breeding than the total number stated on the licence, they’d be in breach of the licence especially if they have not increased the number of staff that can care for the dogs.</p>

<p>You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where a licensed premises keeps other dogs that are not used for breeding</li>
  <li>how many staff care for both dogs used and not used for breeding (for example, pets and retired dogs) that may impact facilities and staffing</li>
</ul>

<p>Details of individual dogs should not be placed on the licence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.0 </span> Staffing</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.1 Sufficient numbers of people who are competent for the purpose must be available to provide a level of care that ensures that the welfare needs of all the animals are met.</p>
</div>

<p>If there’s evidence that dogs’ welfare is at risk, you should consider if the staffing levels are appropriate.</p>

<p>You should take into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the size of the premises</li>
  <li>the layout of the premises (including how many dogs are allowed in each separate area)</li>
  <li>the type of dog (for example, breed, age, health status and needs)</li>
  <li>staff qualifications and experience</li>
  <li>advice from the local authority’s vet</li>
  <li>use of part-time or voluntary staff</li>
</ul>

<p>Each member of staff should have 20 dogs or less to care for.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.2 The licence holder or a designated manager and any staff employed to care for the animals must have competence to identify the normal behaviour of the species for which they are caring and to recognise signs of, and take appropriate measures to mitigate or prevent, pain, suffering, injury, disease or abnormal behaviour.</p>
</div>

<p>Businesses must train their staff, so they’re able to carry out the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>animal welfare (including recognising poor welfare)</li>
  <li>animal handling</li>
  <li>animal behaviour</li>
  <li>cleanliness and hygiene</li>
  <li>feeding and food preparation</li>
  <li>disease prevention and control</li>
  <li>recognition and first aid treatment of sick or injured animals</li>

<p>The licence holder must keep a record of their staff’s training.</p>

<p>Animals must be cared for by staff who possess the appropriate ability, knowledge and professional competence.</p>

<p>Staff must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold a formal qualification that’s appropriate for the role they take, such as a Level 2 Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (<abbr title="Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr>) regulated qualification</li>
  <li>show they have relevant experience which is sufficient for the role they take in the licensable activity</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is not an accredited training course for an activity, businesses must provide other evidence of training (such as industry generated courses).</p>

<p>Staff who have taken an <abbr title="Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr> regulated qualification must show that they have progressed with their study in a 12-month period. They must complete the qualification within 2 years.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.3 The licence holder must provide and ensure the implementation of a written training policy for all staff.</p>
</div>

<p>Businesses must review and update their training policy every year.</p>

<p>The review should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an annual appraisal</li>
  <li>planned continued professional development</li>
  <li>recognition of any knowledge gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies to all staff including the licence holder.</p>

<p>Staff participation can be shown by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>records of the courses they are taking</li>
  <li>records of written or online learning</li>
  <li>keeping up to date with any research or developments for specific breeds</li>
  <li>annual appraisal documents</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of staff attendance or completion of the training must be provided.</p>

<p>Businesses must appoint a qualified behaviour expert and record all discussions that are had.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.0 </span> Suitable environment</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.1 All areas, equipment and appliances that animals can access must present minimal risks of injury, illness and escape.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>They must be constructed in materials that are:</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>robust</li>
  <li>safe and durable</li>
  <li>in a good state of repair</li>
  <li>well maintained</li>
</ul>

<p>All outdoor fencing must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strong and rigid</li>
  <li>of a sufficient height to stop a dog jumping over</li>
  <li>kept in good repair</li>
  <li>designed in a way that prevents dogs from digging and escaping underneath it</li>
</ul>

<p>If businesses use wire mesh around the dogs, they must make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the diameter of the wire is not thinner than 2 millimetres (British Standard 14 gauge welded mesh)</li>
  <li>the square mesh size is not bigger than 50 millimetres by 50 millimetres</li>
  <li>the chain link is not bigger than 75 millimetres by 50 millimetres</li>
  <li>any holes, gaps or openings are small enough that a dog’s head will not pass through or trap their limbs or body parts</li>
</ul>

<h4>Home environment: guidance</h4>

<p>Businesses must maintain the inside and outside of their buildings to make sure they’re in good condition. They must keep outside paths, gardens, exercise areas and general surroundings clean and presentable.</p>

<p>They must also make sure there are no:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sharp edges</li>
  <li>projections</li>
  <li>rough edges</li>
  <li>other hazards which present risk of injury to a dog</li>
</ul>

<p>If businesses use wood, they need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check it is good quality and continue maintaining it</li>
  <li>seal or over-clad any damaged areas.</li>
  <li>make sure exposed wood is smooth, treated and properly maintained to seal it from dirt and moisture</li>
  <li>treat all structural wood that’s outside (such as, fence posts) against wood rot - businesses should only use non-toxic products</li>
</ul>

<p>Standing water from cleaning or urine is unacceptable. Drains must remain unblocked, so liquids can run into them immediately.</p>

<p>Drain covers in areas where dogs can go must remain safe and secure. They must be designed and located so that dogs do not get their toes or claws trapped.</p>

<p>They must check that electrical sockets and appliances in the areas that the dogs can access are secure and are not damaged, so dogs do not catch their toes or claws on them.</p>

<p>Businesses must make sure all inside surfaces that the dogs can access are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cleaned regularly</li>
  <li>kept in good order</li>
  <li>smooth (where possible)</li>
  <li>water and dirt proof (where possible)</li>
</ul>

<p>They must have safe floors for dogs to walk on that are not slippery.</p>

<p>Doors and windows leading outside must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>secure and prevent dogs from escaping</li>
  <li>strong enough to resist impact and scratching</li>
  <li>prevent injury (for example, from broken glass)</li>
  <li>lockable (staff must also be able to lock all gates)</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff who provide care for the dogs must have easy access to keys and any key codes in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>Businesses must make sure there are at least 2 secure physical barriers between a dog and any entrance or exit to avoid dogs escaping.</p>

<p>Each room used must have a securable, full height door for access and security. Internal doors must open inwards, so staff and dogs remain safe and reduce the risk of dogs escaping.</p>

<p>If this is not feasible, businesses must have a written procedure in place to keep staff safe. Doors to rooms must remain closed at night where appropriate. Each dog room must have a secure latch or other secure closing device.</p>

<h4>Kennel environment: guidance</h4>

<p>Dog unit doors must open inwards to protect the health and safety of staff who are looking after the dogs. If this is not feasible, businesses must have a written procedure in place that demonstrates how they make sure staff stay safe.</p>

<p>Door openings must allow water and waste to pass through freely.</p>

<p>Staff must not leave access doors open.</p>

<p>The corridor must be at least 1.2 metres wide for kennels where there are facing dog units that staff access by an indoor corridor. If this is not feasible, businesses must show how they make sure staff stay safe (for example, the routes staff can follow to remove dogs from kennel units and where they can put dogs in the premises).</p>

<p>Kennels and runs must open on to secure areas so dogs cannot escape from the premises. Businesses must not use these spaces as exercise areas.</p>

<p>Each unit must have a minimum headroom height of 2 metres. They must allow staff to access dogs and clean all parts of the unit safely. If this is not feasible, businesses must have a written procedure in place to keep staff safe.</p>

<p>New kennels must be built on a concrete base with a damp proof membrane.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.2 Animals must be kept at all times in an environment suitable to their species and condition (including health status and age) with respect to:</p>
</div>

<p>(a) their behavioural needs</p>

<p>(b) its situation, space, air quality, cleanliness and temperature</p>

<p>(c) the water quality (where relevant)</p>

<p>(d) noise levels</p>

<p>(e) light levels</p>

<p>(f) ventilation</p>

<p>Dogs must not be kept in areas where the temperature may cause them distress. The area where dogs sleep should be above an absolute minimum of 10°C and below a maximum of 26°C.</p>

<p>Businesses must provide additional local heating within the whelping enclosure for the first 10 days after birth.</p>

<p>Dogs must be checked to see if they are too hot or too cold. If an individual dog is showing signs of heat or cold intolerance steps must be taken for its welfare. A dog must be able to move away from a direct source of heat or light.</p>

<p>Inside areas must be well ventilated to avoid excess humidity, but without creating excessive localised draughts.</p>

<p>Heaters and electrical equipment must not be placed where they could burn, electrocute or give an electric shock to a dog or human. They must not be placed where they can start a fire. Open fires and wood burners must have protection or fire guards in place.</p>

<p>Dogs must not be exposed to excessive noise. Dogs that may be affected by other dogs barking should stay in the quietest part of the premises.</p>

<p>Dogs must have exposure to natural light for at least some parts of the day</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.3 Staff must make sure that the animals are kept clean and comfortable.</p>
</div>

<p>Each occupied kennel must be cleaned at least daily.</p>

<p>Dogs must be removed from the area while the kennels are cleaned.</p>

<p>Dogs should be adequately groomed and have other routine care as needed, such as being dried after being outside in wet conditions and inspected for parasites.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.4 Where appropriate for the species, a toileting area and opportunities for toileting must be provided.</p>
</div>

<p>Dogs must have regular opportunities during the day for toileting. Each dog’s individual needs should be taken into account.</p>

<p>Kennelled dogs must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have direct and continuous access to a run for toileting</li>
