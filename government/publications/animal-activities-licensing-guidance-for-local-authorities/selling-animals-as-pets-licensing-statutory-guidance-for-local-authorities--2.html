      <div class="govspeak">
<p>This guidance is for local authority inspectors in England. You should read it alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/4/made" rel="external">Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018.</a></p>

<p>To decide if an activity is covered by the regulations and needs a licence to operate, you should consider all of the following guidance.</p>

<p>All selling animals as pets activities need a licence if they’re carried out as a commercial business.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is a business and will need a licence, consider if the operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes any sale or carries out the activity to make a profit</li>
  <li>earns any commission or fee from the activity</li>
</ul>

<p>A commercial business will need a licence to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sell animals as pets (or to be later resold as pets)</li>
  <li>keep animals to be sold or resold</li>
</ul>

<p>This does not include businesses that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sell animals in the course of aquacultural production</li>
  <li>breed dogs</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim20205">HMRC’s 9 badges of trade.</a></p>

<p>If someone has a trading income below the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income#trade">HMRC trading income allowance</a>, they do not require a licence for their activities.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income above the HMRC trading income allowance, they do not automatically qualify as a business.</p>

<p>An operator is likely to be selling animals as pets as a commercial business and will need a licence if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>import, distribute and sell animals for a fixed fee</li>
  <li>buy animals with the express intent to sell them on</li>
  <li>buy animals and then re-advertise for sale or sell within a short period of time</li>
  <li>have systematic and repeated transactions using the same means of advertising</li>
  <li>sell or advertise high volumes of animals or high number of litters or progeny</li>
  <li>sell or advertise low volumes of animals - this could indicate high sales prices or large profit margins</li>
  <li>trade a wide range of animals</li>
  <li>advertise many animals for sale at any one time or over a short period of time, or regularly, including on classified websites, even where there is no actual sale taking place on the internet</li>
  <li>advertise through a variety of sites, forums or media</li>
</ul>

<p>Activities that fulfil one or more of the following criteria do not require a licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>selling a small number of surplus offspring or excess stock from animals bred as a hobby, for pleasure, exhibition for prize, or for education, study or scientific advancement and for low value species that may produce large numbers of excess stock, consider the value of the stock and the likelihood that the seller is making a profit</p>
  </li>
  <li>organised events where people meet to sell surplus animals they have bred, or animals that are surplus to their requirements, whether or not this is open to the public - sellers must not sell pet animals as a business from a market or stall</li>
  <li>aquacultural production authorised under regulation 5(1) of the Aquatic Animal Health (England and Wales) Regulations 2009, and that is inspected by the Fish Health Inspectorate</li>
  <li>non-commercial rehoming of animals</li>
</ul>

<p>An operator is not likely to be selling animals as pets as a commercial business and will not need a licence if they can demonstrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their transactions are irregular, with low numbers, frequency or volume of sales or adverts</li>
  <li>they sell animals as a hobby, for education or scientific advancement, and that they sell only surplus stock, not for profit - evidence could include reports or studies about the species published in scientific journals, pet trade or hobby media or self-published, contributions to conservation projects, competition entry forms, or membership of a relevant club or society</li>
  <li>that rehoming is not for profit, and does not meet the business tests</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minimum standards</h2>

<p>It is expected that all businesses will meet and maintain minimum standards. If on a renewal inspection you identify minor failings that do not compromise welfare standards, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">risk-based approach to renewing a licence</a>.</p>

<p>To grant a new animal activities licence to sell animals as pets, you must check that businesses meet all of the minimum standards in this guidance.</p>

<h2>Higher standards</h2>

<p>Businesses that meet the higher standard will get a 4 or 5 star rating in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">animals activity star rating system</a>.</p>

<p>Higher standards are required or optional. To achieve the higher rating, a business selling animals needs to achieve all of the required higher standards and at least 50% of the optional higher standards.</p>

<p>If a business meets the higher standards, they qualify for a longer licence that’s valid for 2 or 3 years rather than for one year. They’ll also pay a lower licence fee.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">Animal activity licensing process: statutory guidance for local authorities</a> for an explanation of the animal activity star rating system and how it incorporates a risk assessment of the business.</p>

<h2>General conditions and species-specific guidance</h2>

<p>Parts A and B of this guide cover general conditions that apply to all species.</p>

<p>Parts C to L cover species-specific guidance.</p>

<p>You should refer to Defra codes of practice on:</p>

<h2>Part A – General conditions (Schedule 2 of the regulations)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.0 </span> Licence display</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.1 A copy of the licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licensed premises’ address must be displayed on the licence.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.2 The name of the licence holder followed by the number of the licence holder’s licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any website used in respect of the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The name on the licence must be the individual licence holder’s name.</p>

<p>A duplicate licence can be issued for public display in the name of the business.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.0 </span> Records</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.1 The licence holder must ensure that at any time all the records that the licence holder is required to keep as a condition of the licence are available for inspection by an inspector in a visible and legible form or, where any such records are stored in electronic form, in a form from which they can readily be produced in a visible and legible form.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.2 The licence holder must keep all such records for at least 3 years beginning with the date on which the record was created.</p>
</div>

<p>Electronic records must be backed up.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.0 </span> Use, number and type of animal</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.1 No animals or types of animal other than those animals and types of animal specified in the licence may be used in relation to the relevant licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>Only animals specified in the licence can be stocked for selling.</p>

<p>For reptiles, amphibians, fish, and rodents, the named animals on the licence can be grouped by species (for example, tropical fish, snakes, newts, hamsters, gerbils).</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.2 The number of animals kept for the activity at any time must not exceed the maximum that is reasonable taking into account the facilities and staffing on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence conditions must clearly state the maximum number for each species that may be kept on the premises, with the exception of fish. Numbers of fish should not be specified as they are determined by the water quality in the aquarium as set out in part L.</p>

<p>If there are more of any species than stated on the licence, this would be a breach of the licence, especially if not reflected in increased staffing levels.</p>

<p>The operator must adhere to the stocking densities for each species in the relevant annexes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.0 </span> Staffing</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.1 Sufficient numbers of people who are competent for the purpose must be available to provide a level of care that ensures that the welfare needs of all the animals are met.</p>
</div>

<p>At least one member of staff on site during opening hours must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be familiar with the care and welfare of the animals</li>
  <li>have a recognised qualification or be able to demonstrate suitable experience or training</li>
</ul>

<p>If welfare needs of the animals are not being met, consider if there are enough staff onsite. Consider any site-specific and automated processes that may affect staff levels.</p>

<p>Licence holders keeping venomous species hazardous to human health must ensure that sufficient staff are trained or have experience in the species management.</p>

<p>Written health care instructions must be provided for staff in case of an incident involving any venomous animal and a visitor or staff member. These procedures must be followed.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.2 The licence holder or a designated manager and any staff employed to care for the animals must have competence to identify the normal behaviour of the species for which they are caring and to recognise signs of and take appropriate measures to mitigate or prevent, pain, suffering, injury, disease or abnormal behaviour.</p>
</div>

<p>Staff must be trained and be able to carry out the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>animal welfare, including recognising poor welfare</li>
  <li>animal handling</li>
  <li>animal behaviour</li>
  <li>cleanliness and hygiene</li>
  <li>feeding and preparing food</li>
  <li>preventing and controlling disease</li>
  <li>recognising sick or injured animals</li>
  <li>giving first aid</li>
</ul>

<p>There must be a record of all staff training</p>

<p>Animals must be handled and cared for by staff with the appropriate ability, knowledge and professional competence.</p>

<p>Staff must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold a formal qualification such as a Level 2 Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (<abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr>) regulated qualification appropriate for their role</li>
  <li>show they have relevant experience</li>
</ul>

<p>Where no accredited training course exists for an activity, other evidence of training, such as industry generated courses, must be provided.</p>

<p>Staff who have taken an <abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr> regulated qualification must show that they have progressed with their study in a 12 month period and must complete the qualification within 2 years.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.3 The licence holder must provide and ensure the implementation of a written training policy for all staff.</p>
</div>

<p>The training policy must be reviewed and updated annually, and must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an annual appraisal</li>
  <li>planned continued professional development</li>
  <li>recognition of any knowledge gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>If no staff are employed, the licence holder must demonstrate their own knowledge development.</p>

<p>The participation of the staff can be shown by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>records of courses they are taking</li>
  <li>records of written or online learning</li>
  <li>keeping up to date with any research or developments for animals sold as part of the business</li>
  <li>annual appraisal documents</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies to all staff including the licence holder.</p>

<p>Evidence of staff attendance or completion of the training must be provided.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for staffing</h4>

<p>There must be a member of permanent, full-time staff with an <abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr> regulated Level 3 qualification that is appropriate to the species kept.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.0 </span> Suitable environment</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.1 All areas, equipment and appliances that animals can access must present minimal risks of injury, illness and escape.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>They must be constructed in materials that are:</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>robust</li>
  <li>safe and durable</li>
  <li>in a good state of repair</li>
  <li>well-maintained</li>
</ul>

<p>Housing must be secure in order to prevent injuries and reduce risk of disease transmission. The housing must be secure and kept in good repair. It must be designed to ensure dry, and easily cleaned surfaces, including junctions where parts of the housing join. This does apply to non-aquatic species. Materials must be non-toxic and constructed of non-porous materials, or be appropriately treated.</p>

<p>Housing must be inspected regularly. Any part which is damaged, may cause injury, or offer an animal the opportunity to escape must be repaired or replaced immediately.</p>

<p>Hazards must be minimised. There must not be any sharp edges, projections, rough edges or other hazards which could injure an animal.</p>

<p>Electrical cables must be out of reach of any animal that could chew or damage them.</p>

<p>All licence holders must be able to show that they have considered both environmental and biosecurity (including zoonotic disease) risks in their choice of enclosure, and how they use it.</p>

<p>Drainage in enclosures, activity areas, passageways and preparation areas must be adequate to reduce the risk of pathogens in standing water.</p>

<p>Where a pest problem is identified a control programme must be implemented.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.2 Animals must be kept at all times in an environment suitable to their species and condition (including health status and age) with respect to:</p>
</div>

<p>(a) their behavioural needs</p>

<p>(b) its situation, space, air quality, cleanliness and temperature</p>

<p>(c) the water quality (where relevant)</p>

<p>(d) noise levels</p>

<p>(e) light levels</p>

<p>(f) ventilation</p>

<p>Animals must be able to climb, fly, swim, jump and move around freely where appropriate, and exhibit normal behaviour in their environment.</p>

<p>Housing must provide shelter from adverse weather and predators.</p>

<p>Enclosures must be appropriate to the size of the species. They must adjust in size as the animal grows. Animals kept communally may need to be separated or need larger enclosures if there is any change in group dynamics.</p>

<p>Whilst animals are offered for sale, the business is considered a short-term transitional holding facility. Because of this, it may be acceptable to have enclosures of smaller sizes than those intended for long term care. These sizes are outlined for each taxonomic group within the individual schedules and take into account specific stocking density.</p>

<p>The transitional period is to be no more than 3 months from the date of arrival. If an animal is kept for longer or permanently, the animal must be moved to an enclosure of a size that is of best practice for the individual species. The enclosure must be comparable with what you would expect the final purchaser to use. At a minimum this must be equivalent, or preferably larger, to those described in the higher standard minimum enclosure size for each species.</p>

<p>For businesses selling animals exclusively to other businesses, there are currently no agreed standards for cage sizes and stocking densities. Businesses must provide evidence to demonstrate that the animals’ welfare needs are being met, with reference to the guidance in the rest of this document. This does not apply to businesses selling dogs and cats. The size of housing for cats and dogs must meet the requirements in the guidance.</p>

<h4>a) Behavioural needs</h4>

<p>Where appropriate, animals must have separate areas for hiding, sleeping, toileting and exercising. Sleeping areas must be dry, draught-free, well ventilated and clean as well as large enough to allow all the animals housed to rest together fully outstretched where appropriate and turn around unimpeded. Any substrate used must be appropriate to the species concerned.</p>

<h4>b) Situation, space, air quality, cleanliness and temperature</h4>

<p>Licence holders must ensure that environmental conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, ventilation, lighting conditions are carefully controlled at all times. Conditions must be monitored and remain within the appropriate range for the species housed.</p>

<p>A record should be kept of any instances where conditions fall outside of the appropriate ranges, and what corrective actions were taken. Staff must be able to outline the remedial action taken.</p>

<p>Over-exposure to direct sunlight and other unintended heat sources must be avoided.</p>

<p>Animals held or displayed outdoors must always have access to suitable protection from adverse weather conditions. Animals must not be exposed to draughts.</p>

<h4>c) Water quality (where relevant)</h4>

<p>For species where water quality forms an integral part of life, or where poor water quality has welfare implications, water quality must be tested and recorded. The frequency of testing must be appropriate to the system, but must be at least weekly. Records must detail any action taken to restore the water to acceptable conditions.</p>

<h4>d) Noise levels</h4>

<p>Noise and vibration must be maintained at levels appropriate to species. Enclosures must be situated away from noise sources likely to cause stress or disturbance.</p>

<h4>e) Light levels</h4>

<p>Light must be provided in a suitable natural cycle for the species. If there is not enough natural light there must be suitable artificial lighting.</p>

<h4>f) Ventilation</h4>

<p>All inside areas must be well ventilated, but animals must not be exposed to draughts. The ventilation must not make areas too cold, hot or humid.</p>

<p>Humidity must be appropriate for the species.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.3 Staff must ensure that the animals are kept clean and comfortable</p>
</div>

<p>Where housing is on a tiered system, water, food or waste products must not be allowed to contaminate lower levels. In certain systems, such as aquaria or mixed-species aviaries, where separation of the animals is inappropriate, waste must be managed to prevent contamination of food and water.</p>

</div>

<p>Housing must be cleaned and disinfected with products effective against likely pathogens. At normal usage levels, disinfectants must be non-toxic to the species housed and used at an appropriate dilution and as per the manufacturer’s instructions. There must be the correct length of time between disinfection and introduction or reintroduction of livestock.</p>

<p>Soiled bedding must be removed promptly and immediately replaced.</p>

<p>Empty enclosures must be fully cleaned, disinfected and allowed to dry when vacated and before new stock arrives. Substrate must be replaced as appropriate, and enclosure fixtures and fittings must be adequately disinfected.</p>

<p>Predators and prey must not be able to see, hear or smell each other during transport.</p>

<p>The licence holder must demonstrate that a suitable vehicle is available to transport the animals. It does not have to be owned by the licence holder.</p>

<p>Vehicles must be cleaned and disinfected after each collection and delivery except where animals are transported in closed containers. The closed containers should be cleaned after each use.</p>

<p>Animals must be transported in suitable containers and must not be mixed with different species or unfamiliar animals. Where a number of animals are mixed in the same container, the container needs to be of an appropriate size to prevent overcrowding.</p>

<p>Animals must not be left in vehicles for unreasonable periods and must never be left unattended in a car or other vehicle when the temperature may pose a risk to the animal. Consideration must be given to whether it is necessary to transport animals when the climatic conditions pose a risk.</p>

<p>Injured, diseased or ill animals must not be transported unless being taken to a vet, quarantine or isolation facility. When transporting a diseased animal, there must be barriers between containers to reduce the transmission of disease. The vehicle and equipment must be appropriately disinfected following transportation.</p>

<p>6.1 The animals must be provided with a suitable diet in terms of quality, quantity and frequency. Any new feeds must be introduced gradually to allow the animals to adjust to them.</p>
</div>

<p>The quantity and type of food, frequency of feeding and how animals are fed must be appropriate for the species, the individual’s behavioural and nutritional needs.</p>

<p>Staff must know the requirements for all the species for which they are responsible. The person who buys the animal must be advised to continue feeding the diet given by the licence holder initially.</p>

<p>Food supplements, including vitamins and minerals, must be provided if necessary, at the correct dosage for the individual species. This needs to be in a form appropriate to ensure the animal gets adequate supplements.</p>

<p>Fresh foods must be kept refrigerated where necessary. Frozen foods intended for use must be stored in a deep freeze and defrosted thoroughly to room temperature before use.</p>

<p>Live food must be housed in suitable escape proof containers. If it is not eaten by the animal in a short period, it must be removed so that it cannot harm the species housed (for example, crickets biting reptiles).</p>

<p>Animals should only be fed live vertebrate prey in exceptional circumstances (for example, a snake that isn’t eating). A pet shop should only feed live vertebrate prey to the individual animals they have identified as needing it. A written justification must be:</p>

<p>Businesses must prevent the risk of injury, illness and escape.</p>

<h4>Home environment for businesses selling dogs</h4>

<p>The inside and outside of the buildings must be maintained in good repair. Outer paths, gardens, exercise areas and general surroundings must be kept in a good, clean presentable condition.</p>

<p>There must not be any sharp edges, projections, rough edges or other hazards which present risk of injury to a dog. If timber is used it must be of good quality, well-kept and any damaged areas sealed or over-clad. Exposed wood must be smooth, treated and properly maintained to render it waterproof. All structural exterior wood such as fence posts must be properly treated against wood rot. Only non-toxic products may be used.</p>

<p>Standing water from cleaning or urine is not acceptable. Drainage must be permanently unblocked, with liquids able to run off into drains immediately.</p>

<p>Any drain covers in areas where dogs have access must be secure and designed and located to prevent toes or claws from being caught.</p>

<p>All interior surfaces to which dogs have access must be cleaned regularly and maintained in good order and repair. Wherever possible, interior surfaces must be smooth, waterproof and able to be cleaned. Floors must be non-hazardous for dogs to walk on, in particular to avoid slipping.</p>

<p>Doors and windows to the outside must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>escape proof</li>
  <li>securable</li>
  <li>strong enough to resist impact and scratching, and to prevent injury</li>
</ul>

<p>External doors and gates must be lockable. Those involved in the care of the dogs must have easy access to keys or key codes in case of emergency.</p>

<p>There must be at least 2 secure physical barriers (for example, doors or gates) between a dog and any entrance or exit to the property to the outer curtilage to avoid escape.</p>

<p>All outdoor fencing must be strong and rigid. It must be of sufficient height and kept in good repair. It must prevent an animal escaping over, through or digging under the structure. Where dogs have access to mesh, the diameter of the wire must not be less than 2 millimetres (British Standard 14 gauge welded mesh). Square mesh size must not exceed 50 millimetres by 50 millimetres and for chain link it must not exceed 75 millimetres by 50 millimetres. Gaps or apertures must be small enough to prevent a dog’s head passing through, or entrapment of any limb or body parts.</p>

<p>Any electrical sockets and appliances in the dog designated rooms and where the dogs have access to must be secure and protected against damage.</p>

<h4>Kennel environment for businesses selling dogs</h4>

<p>Unit doors must open inwards to protect the health and safety of attending staff. Where this is not feasible there must be a documented procedure in place to demonstrate the safety of staff.</p>

<p>Door openings must be constructed so that the passage of water and waste is not impeded, or allowed to gather due to inaccessibility.</p>

<p>Access doors must not be propped open.</p>

<p>For kennels where there are facing dog units accessed by an indoor corridor, the corridor must be at least 1.2 metres wide. If this is not feasible, demonstrable measures must be in place to protect the safety of staff, such as routes taken to remove dogs from kennel units and where dogs are placed within the facility.</p>

<p>Kennels and runs must open onto secure corridors or other secure areas so that dogs are not able to escape from the premises. These corridors and areas must not be used as an exercise area.</p>

<p>Each unit must have a minimum headroom height of 2 metres and be designed to allow staff to access dogs and clean all parts of the unit safely. Where this is not feasible there must be a documented procedure in place to demonstrate the safety of staff.</p>

<h4>Environmental conditions for dogs (including enclosure sizes)</h4>

<p>Dogs must be monitored to check if they are too hot or too cold. If an individual dog is showing signs of heat or cold intolerance, steps must be taken to ensure the welfare of the dog.</p>

<p>A dog must be able to remove itself from a direct source of heat.</p>

<p>Dogs (particularly puppies) may be adversely affected by the sound of other barking dogs. Dogs under one year of age must be located in the quietest part of the facility.</p>

<p>The kennel area must be large enough to allow for separate sleeping and activity areas. The kennel must allow each dog to be able to walk, turn around and wag its tail without touching the sides of the kennel. The dogs must have sufficient room to play, stand on their hind limbs and to lie down without touching another individual. The kennel size required will increase in relation to the size and number of dogs housed at any one time. The length and width must be sufficient to allow all the dogs to lie outstretched without their noses or tails touching the walls or other individuals.</p>

<p>Dogs must have free access to the activity area at all times. In certain circumstances, it is permissible to have separate activity areas to sleeping areas but in such cases dogs must be given access to the activity area at regular intervals, at least 4 times a day. Any separate activity area must be fully cleaned and disinfected between use by different groups of dogs.</p>

<p>Where adult dogs are kept, an outdoor exercise area must be available for toileting and exercise. It must be secure and escape proof to allow off lead activity.</p>

<p>Puppies must be housed in litter groups but have the ability to move away from litter mates.</p>

<p>Dogs kept in a domestic premises must have free access in at least one room, providing the size of this room meets the minimum enclosure sizes for dogs.</p>

<p>The toileting area must be separate from the bedding area, and puppy pads or similar material must be provided with the quantity determined by the number of puppies.</p>

<p>Faeces must be removed from the kennel units as often as necessary and in any case a minimum of twice a day.</p>

<p>For kennelled dogs, there must be direct and continuous access to a run for toileting or the dog must be taken out of the kennel unit to toilet for example during exercise.</p>

<p>In a home environment dogs will have access to a secure outside area for toileting.</p>

<h4>Transporting and handling dogs</h4>

<p>All animals must be transported according to the regulations laid down in current legislation.</p>

<p>The licence holder must demonstrate that a suitable vehicle is available to transport the dogs. It does not have to be owned by the licence holder.</p>

<p>During transport, dogs must be suitably restrained to prevent injury using a dog crate, transport harness or dog guard. Dog crates need to be of adequate size to ensure that the dog can stand, lie down and turn around freely. Crates must be designed to provide good ventilation and firmly secured.</p>

<p>Vehicles must be cleaned and disinfected after each collection or delivery of any new dogs.</p>

<p>Dogs must not be left in vehicles for unreasonable periods and must never be left unattended in a car or other vehicle where the temperature may pose a risk to the animal. Consideration must be given to whether it is necessary to transport animals when the temperature poses a risk.</p>

<p>Sufficient breaks must be offered for water, food where appropriate and the chance to go to the toilet.</p>

<p>Dogs must be transported to vet facilities in an appropriate manner for their condition ensuring that transport does not cause further suffering. Veterinary advice on the condition of the animal and suitability for transport should be sought before transport.</p>

<p>Care should be taken with open top enclosures to ensure sufficient height to prevent escapes or access by predators. If platforms are provided in closed top cages, rabbits must be able to access these easily and be able to sit on them fully without touching the cage roof.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for toileting rabbits</h4>

<p>Litter trays must be provided that are impermeable, easy to clean and disinfect or be disposable. Litter trays must be deep cleaned at least weekly.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for transporting and handling rabbits</h4>

<p>Containers must open from the top to facilitate removal of the animal. Containers must be lined with newspaper or bedding to absorb urine.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.0 </span> Suitable diet for rabbits</h3>

<p>All rabbits must be fed a suitable diet primarily consisting of a constant supply of ad lib fresh hay or grass. Hay needs to be free from contamination.</p>

<p>A small portion of commercially available rabbit foods can be given to supplement the primary diet of hay or grass. A balanced and adequate nutrient intake should be ensured. Selective feeding should be considered and mitigated by staff. Food must be appropriate to the age and breed of the rabbit and manufacturer’s feeding guidelines must be followed.</p>

<p>If used, leafy greens and treat foods must be given in moderation and in small amounts as appropriate to the individual rabbit.</p>

<h4>Monitoring rabbits’ diet</h4>

<p>A vet must be consulted if there is no improvement where a rabbit has mild anorexia or reduced appetite within 12 hours of onset or the condition of the individual deteriorates.</p>

<p>A vet must be consulted if a rabbit shows signs of constipation or diarrhoea.</p>

<h4>Water for rabbits</h4>

<p>Water may be provided in a clean gravity fill drinking bottle (which must be of a suitable size for the individual), automatic drinkers, or in bowls. Bowls are not suitable if kittens are present.</p>

<p>Any changes to drinking receptacles must be made gradually and drinking monitored to ensure animals are drinking normally.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for rabbits’ diet</h4>

<p>Hay must be provided in a hay receptacle or feeder at an appropriate height, which keeps it off the floor and reduces the risk of contamination of the hay.</p>

<p>Foraged foods (that have been foraged in uncontaminated areas and correctly identified) must be fed to the rabbits. Commercially available dried forages including willow can also be used to supplement the diet and provide a low risk alternative to foraged foods.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standards for rabbits’ diet</h4>

<p>Rabbits must be provided with access to growing grass to graze on, which can be in planted grass trays. Alternatively, rabbits can be provided with 2 different types of hay.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standards for rabbits’ water</h4>

<p>Water must be provided for rabbits in multiple bottles or bowls. During hot weather, both a bottle and a bowl must be provided (unless kittens are present, in which case only bottles are suitable).</p>

<p>*Syrian hamsters under 12 weeks old are allowed to have the same enclosure size as dwarf hamsters. Once sexually mature, a Syrian hamster must be kept individually.</p>

<h4>Handling and transport of small domestic rodents</h4>

<p>Small rodents must be transported in suitable carriers and must not be mixed with unfamiliar animals (in the same carrier). They must be transported with their companion small rodents, where applicable, and the carrier is to be of an appropriate size so that it is not overcrowded.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for providing a suitable environment for small rodents</h4>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#enclosure-sizes-rodents-higher">minimum enclosure sizes</a> that must be followed.</p>

<p>Light-reducing shelters for rats, mice and hamsters (such as, but not limited to, a box or red tinted acrylic) must be provided. However, these must be monitored daily for signs of chewing and removed or replaced as necessary.</p>

<p>Small rodents must be provided with a choice of different nesting materials.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for cleaning small rodents’ environment</h4>

<p>After cleaning, some used unsoiled litter and nesting material must be transferred back to help keep scents familiar for the rodents.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standards for providing a suitable environment for small rodents</h4>

<p>Small rodents that are physically able to use platforms must be provided with access to a platform (singly housed) or multiple platforms. Animals must be able to access these easily and be able to sit (ideally stand) up on it fully without touching the cage roof.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for small rodents’ light</h4>

<p>When work is occurring near, or nocturnal animals are checked at night, dim red light or dim white light must be used to minimise disturbance. Light level must be sufficient enough for observing or undertaking required tasks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.0 </span> Suitable diet for small domestic rodents</h3>

<p>All small rodents must be fed a suitable diet that is available to them at all times.</p>

<p>Chinchillas and degus must have constant access to good quality dust-free hay.</p>

<p>All small rodents must be fully weaned on admission.</p>

<h4>Monitoring small rodents’ diet</h4>

<p>If there is no improvement in poor intake or not eating within 12 hours or the condition of the individual deteriorates, a vet must be consulted.</p>

<p>A vet must be consulted promptly if a small mammal shows signs of ill health.</p>

<h4>Water for small domestic rodents</h4>

<p>Water must be provided in a bottle or automatic water systems and located away from the sleeping area to help prevent this becoming damp or waterlogged if the bottle leaks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.0 </span> Monitoring small domestic rodents’ behaviour and training</h3>

<h4>Enrichment for small domestic rodents</h4>

<p>Suitable enrichment items include, but are not limited to, tunnels, paper bags filled with hay, willow sticks or balls and branches from non-toxic, untreated fruit trees (for example, apple). Opportunities for gnawing should always be available.</p>

<p>Chinchillas and Degus must be given the opportunity to use a sand bath by offering one on a regular basis, for example 10 minutes daily. This should not be permanently available.</p>

<p>Small mammals must not be given enrichment made of rubber, due to the risk of ingestion leading to intestinal blockages if chewed and swallowed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.0 </span> Animal handling and interactions with small domestic rodents</h3>

<p>Small rodents must not be picked up by the scruff of their necks, ears or unsupported by the tail, nor must they be placed on their backs in positions of tonic immobility. Picking small mammals up unsupported by the tail can result in their tail breaking or the skin sloughing off (degloving). Additionally, if chinchillas are handled roughly they may shed some of their fur.</p>

<h4>Interactions with small domestic rodents</h4>

<p>All small rodents must be housed in single sex groups unless a solitary species (or sold or used for breeding).</p>

<p>Small rodents must only be housed with other rodents of the same species.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for handling and interactions with small domestic rodents</h4>

<p>Where social species of small rodents have to be housed singly they must be provided with extra sources of enrichment. A plan must be in place for singly housed small rodents (only those of a social species).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.0 </span> Protecting small domestic rodents from pain, suffering, injury and disease</h3>

<p>The front teeth and nails of every small rodent must be checked monthly, unless inappropriate at the stage of the breeding cycle, to ensure they are not overgrown or misaligned - only a vet may correct overgrown or misaligned teeth. They should have a pre-mating check and then a check at weaning time.</p>

<h2>Part I – Other non-domestic species (mammals)</h2>

<p>Other non-domestic species (mammals) includes any other mammal that is offered for sale excluding those already listed in this document or is any mammal not normally domesticated in Great Britain.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.0 </span> Use, number and type of non-domestic mammal</h3>

<p>Staff must have demonstrable knowledge of the species or a closely related species.</p>

<p>Staff must comply with UK legislation with regard to the selling or procurement of invasive alien species.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.0 </span> Staffing to sell other non-domestic mammals</h3>

<p>Other non-domesticated species’ covers a wide range of species seen in general trade. When approaching a novel species, it must be ensured that the same welfare requirements are met as for other species.</p>

<p>Note that courses and qualifications relevant to pet vending may not cover the care of other non-domesticated species, particularly those that are less commonly traded.</p>

<p>Primary sources of information and guidance on appropriate standards of care include, where they are available, government-issued Codes of Practice, husbandry guidelines from the zoo industry, guidance notes for related Dangerous Wild Animals Act Schedule listed species or other peer reviewed, industry or competent non-governmental organisation produced guidance materials.</p>

<p>Inspectors unfamiliar with individual novel species are strongly advised to seek appropriate competent advice, for instance zoo licence inspectors, experienced private keepers or breeders or appropriately qualified individuals, including vets listed on the British Veterinary Zoological Society (BVZS) website.</p>

<p>Where specialist advice is required it is recommended that copies of training and husbandry documents are retained and secondary opinions sought.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.0 </span> Suitable environment for non-domestic mammals</h3>

<p>Licence holders must ensure that animals are maintained to a minimum standard as outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/secretary-of-state-s-standards-of-modern-zoo-practice">zoo standards</a>.</p>

<p>Where these do not exist, standards for similar or related species must be considered as to their appropriateness and standards extrapolated.</p>

<p>Licence holders must ensure that animals sold as part of a licenced activity are maintained to a minimum welfare standard. The zoo standards or non-statutory industry agreed welfare standards must be considered in the inspector’s judgement of the animal’s welfare. The inspector must always consider whether an animal is appropriate for sale to the public.</p>

<p>If welfare standards do not exist for an animal, standards for similar or related species must be considered. The licence holder must make sure that the welfare needs of the animal is being met as set out in the Animal Welfare Act 2006.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.0 </span> Monitoring non-domestic mammals’ behaviour and training</h3>

<p>In many cases, handling is not in the animal’s best interests and in such cases must be kept to a minimum.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for monitoring other non-domestic mammals</h4>

<p>A written programme must be available setting out a variety of appropriate enrichment provided.</p>

<h2>Part J – Birds</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.0 </span> Use, number and type of birds</h3>

<p>Staff must have demonstrable knowledge of the species or of a closely related species.</p>

<p>Any doubt or dispute regarding the husbandry of species not specifically detailed below must be referred to an individual with suitable experience of husbandry such as an exotics vet or related professional.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.0 </span> Suitable environment for birds</h3>

<p>Care must be taken where aviaries or cages are constructed of newly galvanised mesh to prevent heavy metal poisoning, particularly in psittacine birds which will often chew the metal. The licence holder must be able to demonstrate the steps taken to minimise or prevent any poisoning.</p>

<p>Cages or aviaries should be constructed from materials most suited for the species housed and that are easy to clean and disinfect.</p>

<h3>Environmental conditions for birds (including enclosure sizes)</h3>

<p>All immature arboreal birds, at the point of fledging and for several following weeks, require larger cage sizes to stimulate flight.</p>

<p>Where a bird uses a cage for sleeping, and the vast majority of the day is spent outside of the cage in a flight aviary where it is given the option to fly, then the cage must be a minimum of one and a half times the bird’s flying wingspan for each of the length, depth and height of the cage.</p>

<p>For birds housed singly that spend the majority of their time in a cage, the cage width must be a minimum of twice flying wingspan, and the depth and height a minimum of one and a half times the birds flying wingspan. A pair of birds must have enough space to fly past each other with the depth being increased to a minimum of 2x flying wingspan.</p>

<p>In multiple occupancy cages for every additional bird over 2 birds the cage dimensions must be increased by a set percentage per additional bird (either length or width or split between the 2 dimensions) of the individual’s flying wingspan for that species as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#avian-enclosure-size-increases">avian enclosure size increases for multiple occupancy</a> table. Larger sizes are preferred and recommended. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#enclosure-sizes-birds">minimum enclosure sizes</a> for birds for examples.</p>

<p>In the case where the flying wingspan is unknown a rough estimate of 2 to 3 times the length of the bird (bill-tip to tip of longest tail feather) can be used as a guide for flying wingspan.</p>

<p>Where non-flying birds are maintained, enclosure dimensions must reflect current best practice for the individual species.</p>

<p>Birds that are ordinarily confined to smaller enclosures for the specific purpose of egg-laying or rearing of chicks (particularly chickens and pigeons) are exempted from the cage size dimensions referenced. However, the time kept in these enclosures should be minimised and should not, in any case, exceed 5 months in any one 12 month cycle. Businesses must also provide outcome based evidence to demonstrate that the welfare of the birds is being met with reference to guidance in the rest of this document, and ensure that they are complying with the legal requirements laid down in other relevant legislation.</p>

<p>Where appropriate for the species outdoor aviaries must include sufficient sheltered and non-sheltered space. Shelter must be sufficient to allow all the birds to be undercover at the same time and preferably a third of a typical aviary should be covered with wind and rain-proof materials.</p>

<p>Where a separate flight aviary is available, the licence holder must be able to demonstrate the frequency with which the birds have access to this larger aviary to the inspector. This must be a demonstrable minimum of 6 hours in a 24 hour period on a daily basis.</p>

<p>The mesh hole size must be small enough that birds housed within cannot put their head or wing through it. The mesh gauge must be stout enough that the birds cannot break or bend it.</p>

<p>As appropriate to species, birds must be given access to water for bathing and preening to encourage feather health.</p>

<p>Birds must not be exposed to toxic or cooking fumes in the areas where they are maintained as these can be toxic to the birds (for example, Teflon poisoning). Aviaries or cages must not be located next to kitchens or bathrooms.</p>

<p>Aviaries should have a covered roof of netting with a mesh size small enough that birds housed within cannot put their head or wings through it or be of solid construction due to the presence of avian influenza in migratory waterfowl.</p>

<h4>Bedding and substrate for birds</h4>

<p>There must be adequate perching space for all birds at the same time. Perches must be positioned to encourage activity, preferably flight, and so that birds do not defecate on each other or into food receptacles.</p>

<p>Perching must be varied and non-abrasive to prevent bumblefoot.</p>

<p>Suitable substrate should be provided for ground dwelling birds that scratch and forage.</p>

<h4>Temperature for birds</h4>

<p>Ambient temperature must be appropriate for the species. Extremes of temperature must be avoided.</p>

<h4>Light for birds</h4>

<p>Lighting levels must approximate those of daylight with regard to intensity and colour.</p>

<p>Species requiring <abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr> (ultraviolet B) lighting must have appropriate <abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr> emitting lamps manufactured for use with birds. These must be replaced according to manufacturer’s recommendations, and effective provision must be monitored through the use of a <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> (ultraviolet) meter. Evidence to this effect must be demonstrable to inspectors.</p>

<p>Additional increase per number of birds over 2 birds. For example, 3 birds that weigh less than 50 grams equals a 5% increase, for every additional bird the increase will be an additional 5%.</p>

<h3>Cleaning birds</h3>

<p>Faeces and urates must be removed at least once a week, but more frequently as required. For species which are in poor health or should not be disturbed during breeding seasons, cleaning should be minimalized, provided that appropriately hygienic living conditions are maintained.</p>

<p>Containers for food and water should not be placed below perches, where they can be contaminated by birds’ droppings.</p>

<p>Flooring must be drop-through or easily cleaned, with consideration of selection of substrate type and minimal disturbance for ground dwelling birds.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for providing a suitable environment for birds</h4>

<p>The enclosure size must allow the bird to have variety and choice in its environment.</p>

<p>Birds must be displayed for sale in aviaries that are 4 times the bird’s flying wingspan or larger in size for length, depth and height for an individual bird and 20% increase for each successive bird for multiple occupancy.</p>

<p>A variety of substrates, including a variety of perches for arboreal birds must be provided. Perches of a variable thickness and materials must be provided.</p>

<p>Output of <abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr> bulbs must be monitored with a <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> meter and recorded. Species specific requirements must be documented and available for inspection.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for providing a suitable environment for birds</h4>

<p>All cages must have direct access to a flight aviary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.0 </span> Suitable diet for birds</h3>

<p>Birds that require it must have a constant ad lib supply of food.</p>

<p>Food supplements must be provided as appropriate to the species concerned.</p>

<p>Specialist feeding practices must be taken into consideration in aviary design, such as access for breeding aviaries or flycatcher manure piles. At times these may be in perceived conflict with expectations for hygiene and where in doubt specialist advice must be sought. Licence holders must be able to demonstrate the rationale behind any specialist feeding practices being utilised.</p>

<h4>Required higher standard for birds’ diet</h4>

<p>Specialist nutritional advice must be sought where appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.0 </span> Monitoring birds’ behaviour and training</h3>

<h4>Enrichment</h4>

<p>Enclosures must be designed, furnished and of a size which allows inhabitants to exhibit a range of natural behaviours, including flying, climbing and hiding.</p>

<p>Psittaciformes, and other species as appropriate, must be provided with suitable toys which encourage them to play and to ‘forage’ for foods.</p>

<p>Cages and aviaries must have at least one side (one of its horizontal dimensions) clad in an opaque material, so that the occupants are not vulnerable on all sides to viewing and disturbance.</p>

<p>Birds of prey subject to restraint by tethering for part of their lives must be flown at least 4 times a week unless tethered under veterinary advice for medical treatment. Licence holders must not permanently tether any bird. All birds must be given the opportunity to fly or move around freely during part of the year, for example in an aviary (free lofted) for rest periods from sale, demonstrations, breeding or moulting. The recommended period is a minimum of one month in a 12 month period but daily or overnight is preferred.</p>

<h4>Habituation of birds</h4>

<p>Handling must be kept to a minimum at all times except where the licence holder can demonstrate that it is for a reason that is in the best interest of the animal, for example to check the birds’ health checking, flying birds of prey.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for monitoring birds’ behaviour</h4>

<p>Birds must not be housed or sold with their wings clipped. Wings are kept complete and flight is actively encouraged.</p>

<p>All birds of prey, or other trained birds where appropriate, must have daily periods of flight; either in aviaries or flown outdoors by a competent person.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for monitoring birds’ behaviour</h4>

<p>Furniture must be changed on a regular basis to provide novelty and enclosures designed to provide choice for the animals within.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.0 </span> Handling and interactions with birds</h3>

<p>Social species must be kept in social groups suitable to the species. Where this is not possible, special attention must be paid to specific human interaction and they must be provided with extra enrichment. A plan must be in place for all singly housed birds.</p>

<p>Decisions to pair or group-house social bird species must be made by suitably trained and competent staff.</p>

<p>Compatible species-specific sex ratios and suitable group sizes must be observed bearing in mind potential for persistent aggression.</p>

<p>Only compatible species must be kept communally.</p>

<p>In particular, consideration for management of psittacine species, known to be sociable and live in flock situations, must be shown in the housing arrangements and stocking densities.</p>

<p>All immature birds must be housed with, or housed in close proximity to, others of their own or similar species, using adjacent cages or aviaries where they are in visual contact.</p>

<p>Where behavioural problems are likely to arise in ‘adult’ non-colonial birds, consideration must be given to managing them separately with the same species adjacent in visual contact. Examples of species that breed in a group include budgerigars and cockatiels, non-colonial breeders include African greys, Amazons and cockatoos. Once non-colonially nesting species approach breeding age, keeping 2 or more in a cage can be dangerous, as paired birds of breeding age can be aggressive to each other and their own mate.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for handing and interactions with birds</h4>

<p>Birds must not be removed from their parents (for ‘hand rearing’) until their eyes have been opened for more than one week to avoid risk of mal imprinting on humans as adult birds.</p>

<p>Adult non-colonial birds must be managed in large flights, to allow birds space to escape from each other if required to prevent behavioural problems. Sufficient staff to manage the population must be provided as needed.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for handing and interactions with birds</h4>

<p>The licence holder must have signage identifying potentially aggressive birds including clearly labelled aviaries and cages.</p>

<h4>Protecting reptiles and amphibians from injury, illness or escape</h4>

<p>Vivaria must allow for ease of cleaning and the maintenance of hygienic standards. This includes the use of waterproof materials for construction.</p>

<p>Venomous animals must be kept in appropriate, secure enclosures (with suitable means of escape-proof ventilation).</p>

<p>Service areas for venomous species must be secure. Service areas must be free of escape routes or places to hide, for example access into cavity walls.</p>

<p>Enclosures containing venomous species must be individually marked with warning signs identifying the species and number of animals.</p>

<p>Venomous animal enclosures must be kept locked and access available only by authorised persons.</p>

<h4>Environmental conditions (including enclosure sizes for reptiles and amphibians)</h4>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#enclosure-sizes-reptiles">minimum enclosure sizes</a> that must be followed.</p>

<p>The size of the vivarium must allow a demonstrable and species-appropriate thermogradient to be maintained.</p>

<p>All vivaria must be provided with hides or species appropriate areas of shelter.</p>

<p>The vivarium must be large enough to allow the animals separate types of activity including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>resting</li>
  <li>thermo-regulating</li>
  <li>feeding</li>
  <li>hiding</li>
  <li>swimming (if applicable)</li>
</ul>

<p>Only compatible species of similar size and from similar habitat and geographical areas must be kept communally.</p>

<p>Cannibalistic species should not be kept communally.</p>

<p>Predator and prey species should not be kept in sight of each other. Where possible, they should be in different areas to minimise stress due to smell or noise.</p>

<p>Aggressive individuals such as breeding males should be kept singly, or in conditions to suppress aggression.</p>

<p>Generally, mixing of species requiring different environmental conditions is not recommended. Although paludaria (vivaria with terrestrial and aquatic areas) which combine fish with small reptiles or amphibians of appropriate species are acceptable.</p>

<p>Reptiles and amphibians may be housed individually or in small groups of the same or compatible species.</p>

<p>Aquatic species must be able to swim (or submerge) adequately and should have a water depth suitable for the species and life stage.</p>

<p>To prevent trauma, materials with rough surfaces (such as metal mesh) must be used with caution in the construction of vivaria, unless there are species-specific requirements that indicate their use (for example, those requiring high ventilation rates). Where possible, plastic or other suitable alternative materials are preferred.</p>

<p>For reptile species or life stages where evidence suggests that smaller spaces are required for feeding or security, the animal must be maintained in the size-appropriate vivarium (as defined below). This is with the addition of a number of small hides, ensuring the animal has the choice to move out into the wider vivarium at any time and enable appropriate thermoregulation whilst ensuring the reptile feels secure. Where there are documented problems with feeding individual reptiles in larger spaces they may be maintained in smaller enclosures.</p>

<h4>Bedding and substrate for reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>Substrate may include, but not be limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paper towel</li>
  <li>bark chip</li>
  <li>wood chip</li>
  <li>terrarium humus</li>
  <li>moss</li>
  <li>gravel</li>
  <li>terrarium sand</li>
</ul>

<p>Suitable substrate must be chosen depending on the species.</p>

<p>Burrowing species must have an appropriate substrate to facilitate burrowing.</p>

<p>Measures must be taken to minimise ingestion of substrate.</p>

<p>A moisture gradient is recommended for many amphibians. In setups which are misted on a regular basis to keep humidity levels elevated, it is important that a drainage layer is provided in the enclosure to avoid the substrate from becoming waterlogged. Drainage must be considered in all setups where there is a risk of waterlogging.</p>

<h4>Temperature for reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>Licence holders must be able to demonstrate that enclosures provide an appropriate thermogradient (the temperature range from the cool end to the hot end of the vivaria) for each species.</p>

<p>Temperature must be monitored using a reliable and repeatable method. Licence holders must be able to demonstrate systems are in place to allow assessment of the range of temperatures an animal experiences over a 24 hour period, this can be done using a maximum and minimum thermometer, for example.</p>

<p>Temperature must be checked daily on initial setup of a vivarium. Once the temperatures are stable, where thermostatically controlled heat sources are used, assessment can be reduced to once per week. Alternatively, an automatic system can be used that monitors temperatures and warns if parameters are outside of an acceptable range.</p>

<p>Records should be kept of instances where parameters fall outside of the appropriate range and what corrective actions were taken. There is no requirement to record ongoing conditions that fall within the appropriate range.</p>

<p>Appropriate temperatures for each species that is in stock or commonly stocked by the licence holder must be documented in written procedures.</p>

<p>At a minimum, the written procedures must document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ambient day temperature range</li>
  <li>minimum ambient night temperature</li>
  <li>basking zone temperature (where appropriate)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> requirements (where appropriate)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where clearly defined ambient and basking temperatures are not available for a species, comparable species from a similar geographical habitat can be used to define the range. For such species where there are no known care guidelines and specialist husbandry is required, these species must only be sold to competent specialist keepers.</p>

<p>Any deviations from the expected temperature range must be recorded along with the action taken to ensure the appropriate temperature is provided for the animal.</p>

<p>Heating equipment must be controlled with the use of thermostats where compatible, and the vivaria sited so as to prevent overheating.</p>

<p>Where rack systems or other vivaria are utilised in thermally stable heated rooms, temperature monitoring of one tray per level is acceptable. It must be accompanied by spot checks that demonstrate that the recorded temperatures are representative of the other rack systems in the shared space, and that temperatures are maintained at the correct ranges for the species housed within. During inspection, licence holders must be able to demonstrate that this is the case.</p>

<p>Ambient and basking temperatures must be appropriate to the species concerned.</p>

<p>Licence holders and staff must have access to relevant credible reference material for normal environmental parameters.</p>

<p>Basking zones may be provided by radiant heat sources (such as a light bulb or heat mat), as appropriate to the species.</p>

<p>Heat sources for both terrestrial and aquatic species must be guarded or positioned, so no animal living in the enclosure can make direct contact with the heating element. This includes heat-emitting light sources but excludes heat mats and hot rocks or similar such heating devices.</p>

<p>Hides or shelters must be provided in different areas across the thermogradient.</p>

<h4>Water quality for reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>Aquatic amphibians must have water quality measurement similar to that for fish, with species specific requirements being met.</p>

<p>Water for aquatic species of amphibians must be dechlorinated. Methods include harvested rain water (where appropriate) or using commercial dechlorinating products.</p>

<p>Containers must be thoroughly washed between each use.</p>

<p>For semi-aquatic and aquatic reptilian species (such as terrapins, turtles, and crocodilians) and species where water features form a part of the enclosure design, water must be maintained in a clean hygienic state.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, terrapins must also have an adequate land basking area suitable for the species.</p>

<h4>Light for reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>Species requiring <abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr> lighting must have appropriate <abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr> emitting lamps manufactured for use with reptiles and amphibians. Replacement equipment, parts or bulbs must be fitted according to manufacturer’s recommendations. On installation of a new lamp, a <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> meter (preferably a UVI meter) must be used to ensure adequate and appropriate <abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr> levels are provided at the level the animal is located. Evidence of the frequency of lamp changes and assessment of <abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr> output on installation must be demonstrable to inspectors.</p>

<p><abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> light sources must not be screened by non-<abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> transmitting glass, mesh or plastic such that the animals do not receive the appropriate <abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr> levels. Animals must have areas of shade so that they can escape from the light if desired.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum enclosure sizes for reptiles and amphibians</strong></p>

<p>The snout-to-vent length (<abbr title="snout-to-vent length">SVL</abbr>) is the distance from the nose to the cloaca.</p>

<p>The snout-to-tail length (<abbr title="snout-to-tail length">STL</abbr>) is the distance from the nose to the tip of the tail.</p>

<p>The straight-carapace-length (<abbr title="straight-carapace-length">SCL</abbr>) is the straight length of the curved part of the shell of a tortoise. Carapace is the curved top part of the tortoise or terrapin shell, as opposed to the flat bottom part which is the plastron length (<abbr title="plastron length">PL</abbr>).</p>

<p>Height and width of the enclosure must be appropriate to the species. Arboreal species require more height than terrestrial species, and the recommendations stipulated below, must be adjusted accordingly. When considering vivarium size for arboreal species the licence holder must increase the height to the sizes outlined below for length and can reduce the length of the vivarium dimensions by one third.</p>

<p>The following vivarium size guidelines are for a single reptile or amphibian, up to a maximum of 4 animals for group managed species unless specifically stated. For 5 to 8 animals the enclosure sizes area must double and for 9 to 12 triple, and so on.</p>

<p>Most amphibians and reptiles are not social and may therefore be kept individually. Decisions to pair or group-house amphibian or reptile species must be made by suitably trained and competent staff. Compatible species-specific sex ratios and suitable group sizes must be observed bearing in mind potential for persistent aggression.</p>

<p>Arboreal species require more height than terrestrial species and sizes, and must be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>Vivarium height for arboreal species must increase to the length outlined above. The length of the vivarium can be reduced by one third.</p>

<h4>Cleaning for reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>Faeces and urates must be removed a minimum of once daily if present. An exception to this is a system involving a larger enclosure with small species that has a mature bioactive system of management.</p>

<p>There must be a programme of wastewater management and treatment for all amphibians to ensure no microorganisms are accidentally released. Those selling amphibians must treat wastewater to prevent the spread of chytridiomycosis (fungus) and other viral agents prior to disposal into the sewage. The treatment chosen must be effective against the potential pathogens concerned (for example, sodium hypochlorite, more than 1% for one minute). Evidence as to how this is achieved must be available to inspectors.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for providing a suitable environment for reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>The output of <abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr> lamps must be monitored with a <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> meter and recorded on a weekly basis. Species specific requirements must be documented and available for inspection.</p>

<p>Specific written protocols for the quarantine or prevention of release of chytridiomycosis and potentially other biological agents must be available for inspection where amphibians are maintained.</p>

<p>For thermostatically stable vivaria, temperature assessment must be increased to 3 times weekly to document maximum and minimum temperatures.</p>

<p>Where applicable, a minimum of 2 hides or sheltered areas must be provided and located in different areas of the thermogradient.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standards for providing a suitable environment for reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>Large established or permanent reptilian vivaria with water features must have water filtration systems to ensure hygiene is maintained.</p>

<p>For species that require brumation, designated facilities must be available and a related policy regarding temperature and other husbandry requirements available for inspection.</p>

<p>Suitable thermogradient, humidity and <abbr title="ultraviolet B">UVB</abbr> index (where applicable) for the species must be displayed on each vivarium.</p>

<p>Sizing of vivaria and associated environmental parameters must meet or exceed those outlined in the higher standards.</p>

<span class="number">6.0 </span> Suitable diet for reptiles and amphibians</h3>

<h4>Diet for reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>Live invertebrates must be gut loaded or dusted with a suitable vitamin or mineral mix used according to the manufacturer’s instructions and with regard to the specific needs of the animal.</p>

<h4>Feeding reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>Licence holders must maintain written records of feeding for all snakes, including hatchlings, which must be made available to buyers and inspectors.</p>

<p>In situations where a specific reptile species is known to prefer to have food left in for 24 hours, this practice is considered acceptable but must be reflected in the individual species’ care sheet.</p>

<h4>Water for reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>Fresh water must be available at all times with the exception of certain desert species, which must be offered water at a frequency suitable to the species.</p>

<p>As appropriate to species, amphibians and reptiles must be given access to water in a form that allows them to submerge or bathe within.</p>

<p>Certain species, such as chameleons and some amphibians, do not often drink from standing water and must be offered water appropriately using an appropriate method, such as a dripper system or sprayer.</p>

<h3>

<h4>Habituation of reptiles and amphibians</h4>

<p>Handling must be kept to a minimum at all times except where the licence holder can demonstrate that it is in the best interest of the animal, like to habituate the animal to handling for the purpose of health-checking. Beneficial and positive contact depends on species and can include feeding and training.</p>

<h3>

<h2>Part L – Fish</h2>

<p>‘Coldwater species’ refers to freshwater ornamental fish species which are kept in unheated aquaria, vats or ponds.</p>

<p>These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goldfish (all varieties)</li>
  <li>common carp (including Koi)</li>
  <li>tench</li>
  <li>orfe</li>
  <li>rudd</li>
  <li>sturgeon</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Tropical freshwater’ refers to all those freshwater ornamental fish species that must be kept in heated aquaria.</p>

<p>‘Tropical Marine’ refers to all those ornamental fish species that must be kept in sea water and heated aquaria.</p>

<p>‘Temperate’ refers to those species that are suitable for unheated aquaria kept in centrally heated rooms only.</p>

<p>‘Centralised systems’ refers to multiple aquaria or vats which are connected via pipework to a central sump tank and filter. Water is circulated through the system, so that no water travels directly from one aquaria or vat to another. It instead travels via a biological filter and (possibly) other devices such as <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> or ozone. Water quality in such systems is wholly dependent on the management of the whole system.</p>

<p>‘Standalone system’ refers to aquaria or vats which do not share water with others. Filtration (and heating) is provided individually to each aquarium or vat. Water quality in such systems is wholly dependent on the management of each individual aquarium or vat.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.0 </span> Use, number and type of fish</h3>

<p>There are more than 4,000 species of fish in trade whose welfare needs can be met based on a broad categorisation. It is not considered necessary nor feasible to individually identify all fish held within a facility.</p>

<p>It is acceptable for fish to be categorised in broad groupings of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cold water</li>
  <li>tropical marine</li>
  <li>tropical freshwater</li>
</ul>

<p>The maintenance of water quality standards is used to determine working stocking densities.</p>

<p>The water quality standards must not be met at the expense of a correct feeding regime.</p>

<p>Exceptions to these standards might occur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when aquatic organisms are diseased</li>
  <li>after transport</li>
  <li>after another form other stress</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in these cases appropriate remedial actions like treatment, acclimatisation or isolation must be undertaken.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.0 </span> Suitable environment for fish</h3>

<h4>Reducing the risk of fish getting injured, ill or escaping</h4>

<p>Fish must be able to move freely and turn around in aquariums or ponds.</p>

<p>Some facilities will be handling very high numbers of animals on a daily basis, and at such facilities some standing water may be expected. Where there is some standing water, all facilities must take precautions to prevent and control the spread of disease and infection.</p>

<h4>Temperature for fish</h4>

<p>Temperature must be maintained within the optimal range for the fish species housed and kept as stable as possible. Changes in temperature must take place gradually. Sudden fluctuations in temperature and water quality parameters must be avoided.</p>

<p>Suitable temperature ranges must be included in point of sale information provided to retail customers.</p>

<p>Temperatures must be monitored daily with any deviations from the expected range recorded and the remedial measures being undertaken outlined.</p>

<p>During periods of particularly hot or cold weather, the identified parameters may be exceeded for short periods, where this does not affect their welfare. Fish under quarantine or treatment may often be kept at slightly higher temperatures (1 to 3℃ higher than normal).</p>

<p>At high temperatures, it may be necessary to provide supplementary aeration or oxygenation of enclosure water.</p>

<p>The placement of aquaria in shop windows must be avoided so fish are not exposed to excessive heat or light.</p>

<p>For centralised systems, the water temperature must be appropriate to meet the husbandry requirements and temperature range for that fish category (coldwater, tropical or freshwater). It will usually be set at the mid-range between different species within a category.</p>

<p>Water temperature for temperate fish must never fall below 17°C. Temperate fish are defined as those sold as being suitable for unheated aquariums, kept in centrally heated rooms only. Consideration must be given to the few fish species to which this is considered to be suitable and purchasers must be advised accordingly as to appropriate conditions to meet the welfare needs of the fish. In the case of doubt, licence holders must adopt a cautious attitude unless the species is a recognised coldwater one. These species must be kept in heated aquaria, such as in an aquarium with a thermostatically controlled heater.</p>

<h4>Water quality for fish</h4>

<p>Ammonia and nitrite are toxic to fish and their accumulation must be avoided.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#water-quality-standards">water quality standards</a> that must be followed.</p>

<p>Water quality must be checked weekly and records kept of results for ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. Water testing must take place in stocked tanks.</p>

<p>Centralised systems must be tested weekly. 10% of individually filtered tanks or vats must be tested weekly. Testing may be via electronic means for relevant parameters. If a visual inspection of aquaria or vats indicates unusual behaviour or deaths, any necessary remedial action must be undertaken and recorded.</p>

<p>Fish must not be subject to sudden fluctuation in chemical composition of their water, other than for the controlled treatment of disease or as part of a controlled breeding programme. In case of doubt, expert advice must be sought.</p>

<h4>Light for fish</h4>

<p>Fish must be maintained on an appropriate photoperiod (day and night cycle) as far as possible.</p>

<p>For fish kept in outdoor ponds, vats and stock tanks shade from direct sunlight must be provided (for example, by the provision of plants or other shade).</p>

<h4>Cleaning fish</h4>

<p>All aquaria, vats and ponds must be kept free of accumulations of suspended waste products or uneaten feed. Excess accumulation may affect water quality and therefore damage fish health. Waste material must be removed as necessary. Cleaning regimes must be sensitive to species-specific needs, as certain fish species may benefit from controlled algal build-up to facilitate grazing behaviour. Care must be taken to minimise stress during cleaning.</p>

<h4>Accessibility to staff</h4>

<p>Racked systems must be accessible by use of a stepladder or other such means.</p>

<h4>Feed for fish</h4>

<p>Food must be added directly to the tank or pond.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for providing a suitable environment for fish</h4>

<p>Water quality must be assessed 3 times weekly and records kept of test results. In instances when water quality parameters are not met, the remedial action taken to restore acceptable parameters should be recorded.</p>

<p>There must be evidence that <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> systems are maintained regularly.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for providing a suitable environment for fish</h4>

<p>A suitable temperature range for the fish must be displayed on each standalone system and on each centralised system.</p>

<p>For premises with no natural light, there must be automated systems or procedures (or both) to ensure gradual change in light levels.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.0 </span> Suitable diet for fish</h3>

<p>Fish must be fed a diet suitable for that species at an appropriate feeding rate and frequency and so as to avoid competition. For example, feeding across the whole surface of the aquaria or pond and extending feeding times.</p>

<p>Licence holders selling to the general public must have an understanding of the nutritional requirements of the categories of fish they sell and must advise the owner of these requirements.</p>

<h4>Feeding fish</h4>

<p>Given the numbers of fish that might be held in any one facility, it is not feasible to monitor and record changes in eating habits of individual fish. The feeding behaviour of groups of fish must be recorded if such behaviour changes significantly and appropriate advice obtained from a competent specialist when appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.0 </span> Monitoring of behaviour and training of fish</h3>

<p>Any items that get in the way of the safe and easy capture of fish must not be used or must be removed from tanks prior to capture.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.0 </span> Fish handling and interactions</h3>

<p>Handling must be kept to a minimum at all times.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.0 </span> Protecting fish from pain, suffering, injury and disease</h3>

<p>Staff must take precautions to prevent cross-contamination between aquaria or vats. Equipment (for example, nets) must normally be cleaned and disinfected between uses or dedicated to a specific tank.</p>

<p>Aquaria and vats must be checked daily and cleaned as often as is necessary (as determined by water quality) to maintain good hygiene standards, consistent with the rate of stock turnover and consequent stocking densities.</p>

<p>For fish, in-line <abbr title="ultraviolet">UV</abbr> treatment or other sterilising devices effectively provide a means of isolating individual tanks in multiple tank systems and are a suitable alternative to self-contained isolation facilities. They must be of an appropriate size and maintained in accordance with manufacturers’ recommendations.</p>

<p>Newly introduced stocks must be given an appropriate acclimatisation period, as deemed necessary, as far as possible separate from existing stocks. New stocks must be closely monitored and any disease problem which arises must be treated promptly.</p>

<p>Fish waste, including cadavers, may be incinerated or disposed of through general waste in sealed double-bagged plastic bags.</p>

<p>Fish showing signs of illness or disease may be kept with other animals provided that all the fish in the same tank (or in connected systems without a sterilisation filter) are given appropriate treatment. In cases of doubt about appropriate treatments, expert advice must be sought from a vet, competent person or fish specialist.</p>

<p>Anyone responsible for euthanising fish must follow recommended practices, written procedures and have been suitably trained.</p>

<p>In the case of fish, it is sufficient to check daily and maintain records limited to observed signs of ill health and disease. Where problems are identified, remedial action must be taken.</p>

<p>In cold weather, ice may form on outdoor displays such as ponds. In such cases, it is important that a hole in the ice is made by floating a plastic ball which can be removed if the water freezes (for example).</p>

<h4>Required higher standard for protecting fish from pain, suffering, injury and disease</h4>

<p>The business must have in place reasonable measures to prevent the import, outbreak and spread of disease. This must be demonstrated by implementation of a biosecurity plan.</p>

<h3>Businesses consolidating imports of fish: guidance for inspectors</h3>

<p>‘Consolidators’ refers to businesses which import live ornamental fish for the sole purpose of supplying imports directly to wholesalers and retailers. Routinely opening boxes compromises the welfare of the fish.</p>

<p>Aquaculture Production Businesses (APB’s) that are authorised under regulation 5(1) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/463/regulation/3?view=extent" rel="external">Aquatic Animal Health (England and Wales) Regulations 2009</a>, and that are inspected by the Fish Health Inspectorate, are exempt from the requirement to have a licence.</p>

<p>In the case of APBs, if local authorities consider they need specialist advice they should consult the Fish Health Inspectorate who are experienced in the inspection of these businesses.</p>

<h4>Conditions for businesses consolidating imports of fish</h4>

<p>This section outlines the conditions that can be checked on inspection and the additional conditions that must be applied to such businesses.</p>

<p>When inspecting business, you should check the general conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1.0 (licence display)</li>
  <li>2.1 (type of animals to be specified)</li>
  <li>3.3 (written training policy) - at least one designated member of staff to be on site with an understanding of current import regulations</li>
  <li>4.10 (animals not left unattended) - fish boxes must be handed over into the care of a person competent to provide necessary care from that point. They must not be dropped off and left unattended</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also check the follow pet sales conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2.1 (register of animals) - purchase records maintained (see retailer)</li>
  <li>2.5 (advertisements) - as retailer</li>
</ul>

<p>Fish must be transported in accordance with International Air Transport Association (<abbr title="International Air Transport Association">IATA</abbr>) and current transport regulations. The licence holder must be able to demonstrate that they have undertaken appropriate due diligence in this regard. In particular that:</p>

<p>Fish will be packed and transported according to <abbr title="International Air Transport Association">IATA</abbr> standards.</p>

<p>Distributors will meet legal obligations under current welfare in transit regulations.</p>

<p>Anyone transporting fish has the appropriate animal transport authorisation.</p>

<p>They keep records of all imported and transported fish that enables traceability to source. This condition can be met by retaining invoices and receipts. Additional record keeping is not required.</p>

<p>They allow access by the relevant authority to these records.</p>

<p>Have a contingency plan in place that is available to inspecting authorities and includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provision for the care of fish in the event of an accident</li>
  <li>Provision for the care of fish in the event of failure to deliver (for example, delayed delivery)</li>
  <li>Emergency contact telephone numbers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Required higher standards for buying and selling fish</h4>

<p>Businesses must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>documented procedures that control and manage the buying and selling of fish</li>
  <li>internal controls in place to detect irregular transactions</li>
  <li>a well-maintained accounting system with a full audit trail</li>
</ul>
