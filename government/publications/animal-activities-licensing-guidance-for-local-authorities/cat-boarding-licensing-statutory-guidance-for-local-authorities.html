<p>This guidance is for local authority inspectors in England. You should read it alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/4/made" rel="external">Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is covered by the regulations and needs a licence to operate, you should consider all of the following guidance.</p>

<p>All cat boarding activities need a licence if they’re carried out as a commercial business.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is a business and will need a licence, consider if the operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes any sale or carries out the activity to make a profit</li>
  <li>earns any commission or fee from the activity</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim20205">HMRC’s 9 badges of trade</a>.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income below the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income#trade">HMRC trading income allowance</a>, they do not require a licence for their activities.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income above the HMRC trading income allowance, they do not automatically qualify as a business.</p>

<p>To be in scope, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide housing for other people’s cats, as part of, or as the only activity of, the business</li>
  <li>arrange housing for other people’s cats - for example, businesses which connect pet owners with people willing to look after their animals for no fee, just minor expenses - they must meet conditions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/2/made" rel="external">schedules 2 and 4 of the regulations</a>
</li>
  <li>provide overnight housing for cats in purpose built cattery units</li>
  <li>home board cats, when they are kept in cattery units</li>
</ul>

<p>Every business must keep an up-to-date list of all their premises where they carry out activities covered by the <abbr title="Licensing of Activities Involving Animals">LAIA</abbr> 2018 regulations.</p>

<p>Activities that fulfil one or more of the following criteria do not require a licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>veterinary practices where the housing provided is part of the cat’s treatment</li>
  <li>businesses that look after the cat within their owner’s home such as cat sitters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minimum standards</h2>

<p>It is expected that all businesses will meet and maintain minimum standards. If on a renewal inspection you identify minor failings that do not compromise welfare standards, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">risk-based approach to renewing a licence</a>.</p>

<p>To grant a new animal activities licence for cat boarding, you must check that businesses meet all of the minimum standards in this guidance.</p>

<h2>Higher standards</h2>

<p>Businesses that meet the higher standard will get a 4 or 5 star rating in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">animals activity star rating system</a>.</p>

<p>Higher standards are required or optional. To achieve a higher rating, businesses boarding cats need to achieve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100% of the required higher standards</li>
  <li>at least 50% of the optional higher standards</li>
</ul>

<p>If a business meets the higher standards, it will qualify for a longer licence that’s valid for 2 or 3 years rather than one year. This lowers the cost of the licence.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">Animal activity licensing process: statutory guidance for local authorities</a> for an explanation of the animal activity star rating system and how it incorporates a risk assessment of the business.</p>

<h2>Part A – General conditions (Schedule 2 of the Regulations)</h2>

<p>Paragraph numbers relate to the conditions in the schedules of the regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.0 </span> Licence display</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.1 A copy of the licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The licensed premises address must be displayed on the licence. It must be displayed in a public-facing area of the premises such as the entrance.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.2 The name of the licence holder followed by the number of the licence holder’s licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any website used in respect of the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.0 </span> Records</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.1 The licence holder must ensure that at any time all the records that the licence holder is required to keep as a condition of the licence are available for inspection by an inspector in a visible and legible form or, where any such records are stored in electronic form, in a form from which they can readily be produced in a visible and legible form.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.2 The licence holder must keep all such records for at least 3 years beginning with the date on which the record was created.</p>
</div>

<p>Electronic records must be backed up.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.0 </span> Use, number and type of animal</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.1 No animals or types of animal other than those animals and types of animal specified in the licence may be used in relation to the relevant licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence applies only to boarding cats. If you are concerned about the welfare of other animals, you should inform the relevant person in the local authority, the police or a suitable animal welfare organisation.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.2 The number of animals kept on any premises at any time must not exceed the maximum that is reasonable taking into account the facilities and staffing.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence must clearly state the maximum number of cats that are allowed on the premises. Undeclared numbers are a breach of the licence, especially if staffing levels are not increased.</p>

<p>You should take into account any other cats that are on the premises (such as pets) and the impact on facilities and staffing. If a cat is located in a different part of the facility, it wouldn’t necessarily need to be included in the figure for the licence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.0 </span> Staffing</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.1 Sufficient numbers of people who are competent for the purpose must be available to provide a level of care that ensures that the welfare needs of all the animals are met.</p>
</div>

<p>The business must have enough staff to fully meet the welfare needs of each cat.</p>

<p>Each member of staff should have 25 cats or less to care for.</p>

<p>If there is evidence that the cats’ welfare needs are not being met, you should consider the staffing levels against:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the size of premises</li>
  <li>the layout of the premises (the number of cats that are allowed in each separate area)</li>
  <li>the qualifications and experience of staff</li>
  <li>advice from the local authority’s veterinary officer</li>
  <li>use of part-time staff or volunteers</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.2 The licence holder or a designated manager and any staff employed to care for the animals must have competence to both:</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>identify the normal behaviour of the species for which they are caring</li>
  <li>recognise signs of and take appropriate measures to mitigate or prevent, pain, suffering, injury, disease or abnormal behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>You should look at training records as evidence of suitable induction training of staff in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>animal welfare, including recognising poor welfare</li>
  <li>animal handling</li>
  <li>animal behaviour</li>
  <li>cleanliness and hygiene</li>
  <li>feeding and food preparation</li>
  <li>disease prevention and control</li>
  <li>recognition and first aid treatment of sick or injured animals</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff who care for the cats must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold a formal qualification, such as a Level 2 Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (<abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr>) regulated qualification appropriate for their role</li>
  <li>show they have relevant and sufficient knowledge and experience</li>
</ul>

<p>If no accredited training course exists that is appropriate to the activity, then other evidence of training must be provided, such as industry generated courses.</p>

<p>Individuals undertaking an <abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr> regulated qualification must have suitably progressed in 12 months and have completed the qualification within 2 years.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.3 The licence holder must provide and ensure the implementation of a written training policy for all staff.</p>
</div>

<p>The staff training policy must be reviewed and updated each year. It must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an annual appraisal</li>
  <li>planned and continued professional development</li>
  <li>recognition of knowledge gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies to all staff including the licence holder.</p>

<p>Staff participation can be shown by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keeping records of the courses they are taking</li>
  <li>keeping records of written or online learning</li>
  <li>keeping up to date with any research or developments for specific breeds</li>
  <li>annual appraisal documents</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of staff attendance or completion of the training must be provided.</p>

<h4>Required higher standard for staffing</h4>

<p>There must be at least one full time member of staff for every 20 cats, or a higher number of qualified staff.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standard for staffing</h4>

<p>There must be at least one member of staff that has a relevant <abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr> regulated Level 3 qualification.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.0 </span> Suitable environment</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.1 All areas, equipment and appliances that animals can access must present minimal risks of injury, illness and escape.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>They must be constructed in materials that are robust, safe and durable, in a good state of repair and well-maintained</p>
</div>

<p>Timber must be good quality and well kept. Any damaged areas must be sealed or over-clad. Wood must be smooth, treated, properly maintained and waterproof.</p>

<p>Interior surfaces, including floors, must be smooth and waterproof. Surfaces must be able to be disinfected, where appropriate. Floors must have a non-slip, solid surface. Junctions between sections must be covered or sealed.</p>

<p>There must not be any sharp edges, projections, rough edges or other hazards which could injure a cat.</p>

<p>Windows and doors must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>escape proof</li>
  <li>strong enough to resist scratching</li>
  <li>capable of being secured properly</li>
</ul>

<p>Access doors must not be propped open.</p>

<p>All wire mesh or fencing must be strong and rigid. It must be kept in good repair to prevent escape.</p>

<p>External doors or gates must be lockable. Staff must have easy access to keys in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>Gaps or openings must be small enough to prevent a cat’s head passing through, or trapping any limb or body parts.</p>

<p>Unit doors should open inwards to protect the health and safety of staff. If this is not possible, there must be a documented procedure to demonstrate the safety of staff.</p>

<p>Door openings must be constructed in a way that the passage of water or waste is not prevented. Water or waste must not be allowed to gather because of inaccessibility.</p>

<p>If cats have access to mesh, the diameter of the wire must not be less than 1.6 millimetres (16 gauge welded mesh). Mesh size must not exceed 25 millimetres in one direction. It should be positioned on the inside of the framework of runs to prevent damage of uprights by cats scratching any woodwork.</p>

<p>Any drainage must be effective to make sure there is no standing or pooling of liquids. A minimum gradient of 1:80 is advised to allow water to run off. Waste or water must not run off into neighbouring pens or cat units.</p>

<p>Units must open onto secure corridors or other secure areas so that cats cannot escape from the premises.</p>

<p>Units should be designed so cats can exercise and be handled within the unit.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.2 Animals must be kept in an environment suitable to their species and condition (including health status and age) at all times, with respect to:</p>
</div>

<p>(a) their behavioural needs</p>

<p>(b) its situation, space, air quality, cleanliness and temperature</p>

<p>(c) the water quality (where relevant)</p>

<p>(d) noise levels</p>

<p>(e) light levels</p>

<p>(f) ventilation</p>

<p>Cats must not be restricted to areas that get too hot or too cold, causing them distress. The insulation and temperature must keep some part of the sleeping area between 15°C and 26°C. The temperature must never go below 10°C.</p>

<p>Additional heat may be provided by heated beds or pads, but they must not be the main source of heat for the cats. The cat must be able to remove itself from the source of heat.</p>

<p>Heaters must not be sited in a way or location where they present a risk of burning or electrocution to cats or humans, or risk a fire.</p>

<p>Cats must be monitored to check if they are too hot or too cold. If a cat is showing signs of heat or cold intolerance steps must be taken to protect the welfare of the cat.</p>

<p>Cats must not be exposed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>excessive or continuous noise - such as dogs barking</li>
  <li>draughts</li>
</ul>

<p>Ventilation must be provided in interior areas to avoid excess humidity.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.3 Staff must ensure that the animals are kept clean and comfortable.</p>
</div>

<p>Cats must benefit from routine health regimes, including grooming. If necessary this must include cleaning of the eyes, keeping long fur from matting and inspection for parasites.</p>

<p>Cats must not routinely be removed from their cattery unit whilst it is being cleaned unless it is causing stress for the cat and there is a safe alternative temporary unit.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.4 Where appropriate for the species, a toileting area and regular opportunities for toileting must be provided.</p>
</div>

<p>Cats must have a litter tray. Scented litter must not be used.</p>

<p>Bedding must be changed, cleaned and disinfected between cats or when soiled.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.5 Procedures must be in place to make sure housing and any equipment within it is cleaned as often as necessary and good hygiene standards are maintained. The housing must be capable of being thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.</p>
</div>

<p>Units must be inspected each day and kept in a clean condition. This must be done in line with the documented cleaning and disinfection procedure.</p>

<p>Each occupied unit must be cleaned at least once each day.</p>

<p>Units must be disinfected between new occupants and when necessary. Effective spot cleaning is allowed.</p>

<p>If a pest problem is identified, a pest control programme must be put in place.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.6 The animals must be transported and handled in a manner that protects them from pain, suffering, injury and disease. This includes considering housing, temperature, ventilation and frequency.</p>
</div>

<p>All animals must be transported according to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3260/contents/made" rel="external">regulations laid down in current legislation</a>.</p>

<p>The licence holder must demonstrate that a suitable vehicle is available to transport the cats. It does not have to be owned by the licence holder.</p>

<p>Cats must always be transported in a suitable, strong cat carrier.</p>

<p>This applies to travel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within the cattery</li>
  <li>in a vehicle</li>
  <li>to and from a vehicle</li>
</ul>

<p>Vehicles must be cleaned and disinfected after each collection or delivery of any new cats.</p>

<p>Cats must not be left in vehicles for unreasonable periods. They must never be left unattended in a car or other vehicle where the temperature may pose a risk to the cat. Consideration must be given to whether it is necessary to transport cats when the temperature poses a risk.</p>

<p>Enough breaks must be given for water and food where appropriate.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.7 All the animals must be easily accessible to staff and for inspection. There must be sufficient light for the staff to work effectively and observe the animals.</p>
</div>

<p>Where practicable this must be natural light, but artificial light must be available. If artificial lighting is used it must be within a range of 10 to 12 hours daily.</p>

<p>Lights must be turned off overnight to provide a period of darkness.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.8 All resources must be provided in a way (for example as regards frequency, location and access points) that minimises competitive behaviour or the dominance of individual animals.</p>
</div>

<p>If cats from the same household share a unit there must be multiples of all resources equal or greater than the number of cats.</p>

<p>Examples of resources include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>food</li>
  <li>water</li>
  <li>litter trays</li>
  <li>resting and sleeping areas</li>
  <li>enrichment items (such as toys)</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.9 The animals must not be left unattended in any situation or for any period likely to cause them distress.</p>
</div>

<p>All cats must be checked often throughout the day. The licence holder or responsible person must visit the cats at regular intervals no more than 3 hours apart (from 8am until 6pm). Cats must also be checked as often as needed for their individual health, safety and welfare.</p>

<h4>Required higher standards for providing a suitable environment for cats</h4>

<p>All cats must be checked at least once at an appropriate interval out of hours (between 6pm and 8am) by a person or CCTV.</p>

<p>Temperature in the sleeping area must be between 18°C and 26°C.</p>

<p>The environment must have a layout and design that gives the cats choice.</p>

<h4>Optional higher standards for providing a suitable environment cats</h4>

<p>Ventilation must be a managed, fixed or portable, air system to maintain appropriate temperatures in all weathers. This can be an air conditioning unit or removable fans - but these must be safely installed away from cats.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.0 </span> Suitable diet</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>6.1 The animals must be provided with a suitable diet in terms of quality, quantity and frequency. Any new feeds must be introduced gradually to allow the animals to adjust to them.</p>
</div>

<p>Adult cats must have at least 2 meals a day at least 8 hours apart, as appropriate to the cat’s needs.</p>

<p>Dietary requirements that are agreed with the owner must be followed. If there are concerns about an individual cat’s diet, veterinary advice must be sought.</p>

<p>One feeding bowl and one water bowl must be provided for each cat. These must be separate containers.</p>

<p>Food and water must be kept away from each other and away from the litter tray (at least 60 centimetres apart).</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>6.2 Feed and (where appropriate) water intake must be monitored, and any problems recorded and addressed.</p>
</div>

<p>If a cat has no appetite for longer than 48 hours, veterinary advice must be sought. Seek advice from a vet earlier if there are specific concerns or known health problems.</p>

<p>Water intake must be checked and veterinary advice sought if a cat is not drinking or is drinking too much.</p>

<p>The general condition of the cats must be observed. Cats displaying significant weight loss or gain must be checked by a vet and treated as needed.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>6.3 Feed and drinking water provided to the animals must be unspoilt and free from contamination.</p>
</div>

<p>Food bowls should be emptied and cleaned following feeding so that food, particularly wet food, is not left out until the next feeding time.</p>

<p>Fridges for feed storage must be provided.</p>

<p>Feed must be stored away from risk of vermin and in cool and dry places.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>6.4 Feed and drinking receptacles must be capable of being cleaned and disinfected, or disposable.</p>

<h4>Minimum sizes for penthouse sleeping accommodation</h4>

<p>Penthouse sleeping accommodation is an enclosed boxed sleeping area or pod raised off the ground. The pod needs to be high enough to be able to clean underneath, but not too high that would make cleaning inside the box difficult.</p>
