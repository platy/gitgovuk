<p>This guidance is for local authority inspectors in England. You should read it alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/486/schedule/4/made" rel="external">Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is covered by the regulations and needs a licence to operate, you should consider all of the following guidance.</p>

<p>All activities involving hiring out horses for riding, or instruction in riding, need to have a licence if they’re carried out as a commercial business.</p>

<p>To decide if an activity is a business and will need a licence, consider if the operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes any sale or carries out the activity to make a profit</li>
  <li>earns any commission or fee from the activity</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim20205">HMRC’s 9 badges of trade</a>.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income below the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income#trade">HMRC trading income allowance</a>, they do not require a licence for their activities.</p>

<p>If someone has a trading income above the HMRC trading income allowance, they do not automatically qualify as a business.</p>

<p>To be in scope, they must hire out horses for riding, or instruction in riding.</p>

<p>This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>riding schools</li>
  <li>loan horses</li>
  <li>hunter hirelings</li>
  <li>pony and donkey rides</li>
  <li>polo instruction</li>
  <li>pony parties where the ponies are ridden</li>
</ul>

<p>Activities that fulfil one or more of the following criteria do not require a licence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pony party businesses where none of the ponies are ever ridden (these should be licensed as animal exhibits)</li>
  <li>activities that are carried out solely for military or police purposes</li>
  <li>riding stables that are used solely for instructing university veterinary students with their studies</li>
  <li>people who occasionally lend a horse, even if a small fee is charged, where there is no profit made and no intent to make a profit</li>
  <li>people who hire out horses and have a trading income below the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income#trade">HMRC trading income allowance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Veterinary inspections</h2>

<p>For the hiring of horses, a listed vet must be appointed for the initial inspection, for a renewal inspection, and for the annual inspection for the hiring of horses.</p>

<p>A listed vet is required for any inspections for the activity of hiring out horses. A listed vet is a vet who is authorised to carry out an inspection on the list of vets held by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcvs.org.uk/setting-standards/riding-establishments/" rel="external">Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons Riding Establishments Inspectorate List</a>.</p>

<p>Where the listed vet is accompanied by a suitably qualified local inspector, they will be appointed under 4(4) of the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals)(England) Regulations 2018.</p>

<p>Where a listed vet is required by the local authority to carry out the inspection without being accompanied by a suitably qualified officer, they must be appointed under section 51 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 (the Act) to exercise the enforcement powers available under the Act. They must also be appointed under 4(4) of the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals)(England) Regulations 2018.</p>

<p>Where the listed vet is required by the local authority to carry out the inspection without being accompanied by a suitably qualified officer, the listed vet must be appointed in writing by the appropriate person with delegated powers within the local authority.</p>

<h4>Annual listed vet inspection</h4>

<p>Where there is a hiring of horses licence in place, the local authority must appoint a listed vet under section 8 of the Regulation to inspect the premise before the end of the first anniversary of the day on which the licence, as granted or renewed, came into force and before the end of each subsequent year in respect of which the licence remains in force.</p>

<h4>Mid-licence local authority unannounced visit</h4>

<p>As per the risk scoring matrix set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities?#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">procedural guidance</a>, the local authority is required to carry out one unannounced inspection during the term of the licence. This inspection does not have to be carried out at the same time as the annual listed vet inspection.</p>

<h2>Minimum standards</h2>

<p>It is expected that all businesses will meet and maintain minimum standards. If on a renewal inspection you identify minor failings that do not compromise welfare standards, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities?#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">risk-based approach to renewing a licence</a> .</p>

<p>To grant a new animal activities licence for hiring out horses, you must check that businesses meet all of the minimum standards in this guidance.</p>

<h2>Higher standards</h2>

<p>Businesses that meet the higher standard will get a 4 or 5 star rating in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">animals activity star rating system</a>.</p>

<p>Higher standards are required or optional. To achieve a higher rating, businesses hiring out horses need to achieve all of the required higher standards and at least 50% of the optional higher standards.</p>

<p>If a business meets the higher standards, it will qualify for a longer licence that’s valid for 2 or 3 years rather than one year. This lowers the cost of the licence.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-activities-licensing-guidance-for-local-authorities/animal-activity-licensing-process-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities#granting-or-renewing-a-licence-risk-based-approach">Animal activity licensing process: statutory guidance for local authorities</a> for an explanation of the animal activity star rating system and how it incorporates a risk assessment of the business.</p>

<h2>Part A – General conditions (Schedule 2 of the Regulations)</h2>

<p>Paragraph numbers relate to the conditions in the schedules of the regulations.</p>

<p>The licensed premises address must be displayed on the licence. It must be displayed in a public-facing area of the premises such as the entrance.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1.2 The name of the licence holder followed by the number of the licence holder’s licence must be clearly and prominently displayed on any website used in respect of the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.0 </span> Records</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.1 The licence holder must ensure that at any time all the records that the licence holder is required to keep as a condition of the licence are available for inspection by an inspector in a visible and legible form or, where any such records are stored in electronic form, in a form from which they can readily be produced in a visible and legible form.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>2.2 The licence holder must keep all such records for at least 3 years beginning with the date on which the record was created.</p>
</div>

<p>Electronic records must be backed up.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.0 </span> Use, number and type of animal</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.1 No animals or types of animal other than those animals and types of animal specified in the licence may be used in relation to the relevant licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>3.2 The number of animals kept for the activity at any time must not exceed the maximum that is reasonable taking into account the facilities and staffing on any premises used for the licensable activity.</p>
</div>

<p>The licence must clearly state the numbers of horses permitted at the premises used for the activity. Undeclared numbers would be a breach of the licence, especially if staffing levels are not increased.</p>

<p>For each horse used for the activity at the premises, the licensing authority must record its:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>unique equine life number</li>
  <li>microchip number</li>
</ul>

<p>Licence holders must inform their local authority of changes to the list of horses being used. They must also provide evidence that a vet has deemed new horses as fit for the purpose for which they will be used. The licence must then be varied by the local authority.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.0 </span> Staffing</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.1 Sufficient numbers of people who are competent for the purpose must be available to provide a level of care that ensures that the welfare needs of all the animals are met.</p>
</div>

<p>Staff with experience of working with horses must oversee daily horse care and ensure optimal welfare for all horses.</p>

<p>At least one member of staff must have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a recognised qualification such as, a relevant Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (<abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr>) regulated Level 3 qualification</li>
  <li>suitable experience and training, such as, running an equine facility before</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is evidence that the welfare needs of the animals are not being met, you should consider if the staffing levels are appropriate.</p>

<p>During the inspection, you should take into account the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>size of premises</li>
  <li>layout of the premises (for example, the number of horses that are kept in a stable or field)</li>
  <li>qualifications and experience of the staff</li>
  <li>use of part time staff or volunteers</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.2 The licence holder or a designated manager and any staff employed to care for the animals must have competence to identify the normal behaviour of the species for which they are caring and to recognise signs of, and take appropriate measures to mitigate or prevent, pain, suffering, injury, disease or abnormal behaviour.</p>
</div>

<p>You should look at training records as evidence of suitable induction training of staff in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>animal welfare, including recognising poor welfare</li>
  <li>animal handling</li>
  <li>animal behaviour</li>
  <li>cleanliness and hygiene</li>

  <li>show they have relevant and sufficient knowledge and experience</li>
</ul>

<p>If no accredited training course exists that is appropriate to the activity, then other evidence of training must be provided, such as, industry generated courses.</p>

<p>Individuals undertaking an <abbr title="Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr> regulated qualification must have suitably progressed in 12 months and have completed the qualification within 2 years.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>4.3 The licence holder must provide and ensure the implementation of a written training policy for all staff.</p>
</div>

<p>The staff training policy must be reviewed and updated each year.</p>

<p>It must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an annual appraisal</li>
  <li>planned and continued professional development</li>
  <li>recognition of knowledge gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies to all staff including the licence holder.</p>

<p>Training can be demonstrated by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>engagement with online courses</li>
  <li>annual appraisal documents</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of staff attendance or completion of the training must be provided.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.0 </span> Suitable environment</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.1 All areas, equipment and appliances that animals can access must present minimal risks of injury, illness and escape.</p>
</div>

<p>They must be constructed in materials that are robust, safe and durable, in a good state of repair and well-maintained.</p>

<p>In stables, each horse must have enough room to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lie down</li>
  <li>stand up</li>
  <li>turn around in comfort</li>
</ul>

<p>Roofs should be high enough to provide adequate ventilation, including good air circulation.</p>

<p>There should be a minimum clear space to the eaves above the ears of the horse in its normal standing position (60 to 90 centimetres or 2 to 3 feet).</p>

<p>All passageways should be wide enough for horses to be led safely past other horses.</p>

<p>Where stalls are used (individual compartments enclosed on 3 sides) the positioning and dimensions must allow room for the horse to lie down but not turn around. There must be enough space behind the stall for the horse to back out easily.</p>

<p>Stalls and stables must have adequate bedding and a non-slip floor.</p>

<p>Timber must be of good quality and well-kept. Any damaged areas must be sealed or over clad. Wood must be smooth, proofed and maintained to keep it waterproof.</p>

<p>Interior surfaces, including floors, should be even, waterproof and easy to clean. Floors must have a non-slip, solid surface.</p>

<p>There must not be any sharp or rough edges, projections, or other hazards that could injure a horse.</p>

<p>Doors must be strong enough to resist impact and close securely.</p>

<p>Doors should be a suitable width for horses. The height of the door must allow the horse to look out with the head comfortably over the door, unless there’s a valid reason not to have heads out. The horse and handler must be able to enter and exit the stable safely. Doors should open outwards or use a slide mechanism.</p>

<p>There should be a gap under the door so that waste and water can drain from the stable.</p>

<p>Any gaps or openings must be small enough to prevent a horse’s head or any limb getting trapped.</p>

<p>Windows should be fitted with safety glass or covered with mesh. Fittings should not protrude into the stable to prevent injury. They should also encourage air flow.</p>

<p>Drainage should be a minimum gradient of 1:80 to allow water to run off. There must be no standing water or pooling. Wastewater must not run into neighbouring stables.</p>

<p>Stables must open onto secure areas so that horses cannot escape from the premises.</p>

<p>Fields must be safe and securely fenced, ideally using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>post and rail that is at least 1.25 metres or 4 foot high</li>
  <li>plain taut wire that is visible to the horse</li>
  <li>well-maintained hedging or electric fencing with gates</li>
</ul>

<p>For facilities that carry out on-site riding instruction, there must be a safe riding area suitable for the activity, such as an arena or field.</p>

<p>That area must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have well-maintained and clear access and exits</li>
  <li>be secure to prevent horses escaping onto public land</li>
</ul>

<p>A safe suitable area must be provided to carry out rider assessments. The riding surface must be well maintained and have management systems in place to maintain the surface and control levels of dust.</p>

<p>Fields must be free from dangerous objects and poisonous plants and weeds. If this is not possible, horses must be fenced away. Annual pasture management plans must be in place for fields.</p>

<p>Housing must be regularly inspected for damage and potential injury or escape points. Inspection results must be recorded. Damaged housing must be repaired or replaced immediately.</p>

<p>Pony lines and tie-up areas must be well maintained.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.2 Animals must be kept at all times in an environment suitable to their species and condition (including health status and age) with respect to:</p>
</div>

<p>(a) their behavioural or needs</p>

<p>(b) its situation, space, air quality, cleanliness and temperature</p>

<p>(c) the water quality (where relevant)</p>

<p>(d) noise levels</p>

<p>(e) light levels</p>

<p>(f) ventilation</p>

<p>Horses must be monitored to check they are not too hot or too cold. The licence holder must be able to show the steps they take if a horse is showing signs of heat or cold intolerance. For example, if a horse is too cold they could provide rugs.</p>

<p>Horses must have access to shelter in the form of purpose-built or natural cover when kept in fields. The entrance of a purpose-built shelter must be wide enough to allow access and exit for at least 2 horses to minimise the risk of injury.</p>

<p>Where working horses are kept in individual stalls, they must spend a significant part of their day out of the stall. Horses kept in stalls must be fastened so they can access food, water and lie down comfortably.</p>

<p>Bedding materials should have minimal dust. They must be of sufficient depth to encourage horses to lie down.</p>

<p>Where rubber floor matting is used in stables it must be regularly cleaned and there must be a small amount of bedding material.</p>

<p>Sleeping areas need to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clean</li>
  <li>dry</li>
  <li>draught-free</li>
  <li>well-ventilated</li>
</ul>

<p>They also need to be large enough to allow all the animals housed to rest together fully outstretched, turn around unimpeded and move around comfortably.</p>

<p>Horses kept outdoors must have suitable protection from adverse weather conditions.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.3 Staff must ensure that the animals are kept clean and comfortable.</p>
</div>

<p>Stables must be cleaned on a regular basis. Faeces must be cleared daily.</p>

<p>All horses in work must be regularly groomed. They must be groomed before tacking up.</p>

<p>All horses must be checked daily to make sure they are clean and comfortable.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.4 Where appropriate for the species, a toileting area and opportunities for toileting must be provided.</p>
</div>

<p>Dung management must be a central part of pasture management. This helps to create an effective parasite control programme and improve grass recovery.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.5 Procedures must be in place to make sure housing and any equipment within it is cleaned as often as necessary and good hygiene standards are maintained. The housing must be capable of being thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.</p>
</div>

<p>Stables must be kept in a clean condition, there must be a documented procedure for this. It must detail the routine daily cleaning regime and the procedure for cleaning between periods of occupation.</p>

<p>Where there is a pest problem, a pest control programme must be put into place.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.6 The animals must be transported and handled in a manner (including for example in relation to housing, temperature, ventilation and frequency) that protects them from pain, suffering, injury and disease.</p>
</div>

<p>All animals must be transported according to the regulations laid down in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/3260/contents/made" rel="external">the current legislation</a>.</p>

<p>The licence holder must demonstrate that when a horse is transported, it is in a suitable vehicle. It does not have to be owned by the licence holder.</p>

<p>Horses must not be left unattended in a vehicle if it’s unsafe to do so. Time in a vehicle must be minimised.</p>

<p>Horses should not be transported in temperatures that could risk the horse’s health.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.7 All the animals must be easily accessible to staff and for inspection. There must be sufficient light for the staff to work effectively and observe the animals.</p>
</div>

<p>Natural light is ideal, but artificial light must be available. Artificial lights must be turned off overnight to provide a period of darkness.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.8 All resources must be provided in a way (for example, as regards frequency, location and access points) that minimises competitive behaviour or the dominance of individual animals.</p>
</div>

<p>Horses in stables or stalls must have access to their own water at all times.</p>

<p>If horses are being fed together, care must be taken to make sure that all horses are receiving enough food.</p>

<p>When horses are kept in a field attention must be paid to any taking over of resources, such as hay and water. All horses must have access to resources. There should be one feeding site per horse plus an extra one.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>5.9 The animals must not be left unattended in any situation or for any period likely to cause them distress.</p>
</div>

<p>Horses at grass must be inspected at least once a day, or as often as necessary for the individual health and welfare of each horse. Stabled or group-housed horses must be inspected at least twice a day.</p>

<p>The licence holder must have a system to record observations of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>illness</li>
  <li>injury</li>
