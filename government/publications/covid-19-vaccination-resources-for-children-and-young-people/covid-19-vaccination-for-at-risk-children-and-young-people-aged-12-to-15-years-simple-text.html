<h2>What is COVID-19 or coronavirus?</h2>

<p>COVID-19 is an illness sometimes called coronavirus.</p>

<p>Most children who get COVID-19 have no symptoms. Those that do, have mild symptoms like a bad cold.</p>

<p>A few children and young people will get very poorly and have to go to hospital.</p>

<h2>Who should have the COVID-19 vaccines</h2>

<p>The vaccine is most important for the small number of children and young people who are likely to get poorly with COVID-19.</p>

<p>They include those with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>severe neurodisabilities</li>
  <li>immunosuppression – those whose immune systems don’t work as well and also those who live with someone
who is immunosuppressed</li>
  <li>profound and multiple or severe learning disabilities</li>
  <li>being on the learning disability register</li>
  <li>those living with Down’s syndrome</li>
  <li>those living with long term serious conditions affecting your body. Your GP will know if you need to have the vaccine</li>
</ul>

<p>All these children and young people who are aged 12 to 15 years of age should have the COVID-19 vaccinations.</p>

<h2>About the vaccine</h2>

<p>The COVID-19 vaccine is an injection.</p>

<p>You may need 2 injections of the vaccine usually 8 to 12 weeks apart.</p>

<p>The vaccine has been tested to make sure it is as safe as possible.</p>

<h2>Knowing if you should get a vaccine</h2>

<p>Your GP (family doctor) should be able to check if you should get the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>Some people may receive a letter, or a phone call to invite them for their vaccination.</p>

<h2>Can you give COVID-19 to anyone after you have had the vaccine?</h2>

<p>Having the vaccine makes you less likely to get very ill from COVID-19.</p>

<p>It will help to stop you from catching and passing on the virus.</p>

<h2>Common side effects</h2>

<p>Common side effects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your arm feeling heavy or sore where you had the injection</li>
  <li>feeling achy or like you’ve got the flu</li>
  <li>feeling tired</li>
  <li>having a headache</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel feverish (like you’re very hot or very cold) you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rest</li>
  <li>take paracetamol</li>
</ul>

<p>You should feel better in less than a week.</p>

<h2>Rare but serious side effects</h2>

<p>Worldwide, there have been recent, rare cases of inflammation of the heart reported after COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>These cases have been seen within a few days of vaccination.</p>

<p>Most people felt better after a few days of simple treatment.</p>

<p>You should seek medical advice urgently if you experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chest pain</li>
  <li>shortness of breath</li>
  <li>feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel very poorly after vaccination, call 111 or go to the 111 website. Make sure you tell them about the vaccine, or show them your card.</p>

<p>If you think you have a serious side effect from the vaccine you can report them using the <a href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Yellow Card scheme</a>. The Coronavirus Yellow Card system is a website where you can report any side effects from the vaccine. You may need support to access this website.</p>

<h2>How to book your appointment</h2>
<p>If you receive an invitation letter, it will explain how to make your appointment.</p>

<p>Use the telephone to make your appointment. You or your parent can call 119.</p>

<p>You will get told where to go for your vaccine and when.</p>

<h2>What to do next</h2>

<p>When you’ve had the first injection, you should get a record card. This card should have your next appointment for 8 to 12 weeks time.</p>

<p>Although the first dose will give you good protection, you need the second dose to get longer-lasting protection.</p>

<p>Keep your card safe and make sure you go to get your second injection.</p>

<h2>How long the vaccine takes to work</h2>
<p>It can take a few weeks for the vaccine to protect you.</p>

<h2>Does the vaccine work for everyone?</h2>
<p>The vaccine doesn’t completely stop everyone getting COVID-19, but if you do, it should still stop you being very poorly.</p>

<h2>What to do if you are not well when it is your next appointment</h2>
<p>You should not attend a vaccine appointment if you are self-isolating, waiting for a COVID-19 test or unsure if you are fit and well.</p>

<h2>What you can do after you’ve had the vaccine</h2>

<p>After the vaccine, you should still:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wear a face mask in crowded indoor spaces</li>
  <li>meet outdoors or if indoors, let fresh air in</li>
  <li>wash your hands carefully and often</li>
  <li>follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">current guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Signs of COVID-19</h2>
<p>A new cough and you keep on coughing.</p>

<p>A high temperature.</p>

<p>Your smell or taste going away or changing.</p>

<p>If you have the symptoms above, stay at home and arrange to have a test.</p>

<p>Further information on symptoms is available on <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS.UK</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the NHS website, phone 111 free of charge.</p>
