<p>The UK government has responsibilities under international law and is committed to managing our fisheries in a sustainable way. Meeting our responsibilities will support vibrant, profitable, and sustainable fishing industries alongside a healthy and productive marine environment.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/22/crossheading/fisheries-objectives-fisheries-statements-and-fisheries-management-plans/enacted" rel="external">Fisheries Act 2020</a> provides the framework to manage our fisheries as an independent coastal state outside of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. The act requires the UK fisheries policy authorities (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, and the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) to publish fisheries management plans (<abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr>) to help deliver our ambition for sustainable fisheries.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.defra.gov.uk/sustainability-devolution-and-legislation-team/jfs/supporting_documents/Consultation%20draft%20of%20the%20Joint%20Fisheries%20Statement.pdf" rel="external">draft joint fisheries statement</a> listed 43 proposed <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr>. Some will be developed jointly by 2 or more fisheries policy authorities, whilst others will be developed by an authority for its own waters.</p>

<p>The Joint Fisheries Statement will set out the list of agreed plans when it is published in November 2022. This will include details of the stocks covered, the authorities involved and their timetable for preparation and publication.</p>

<h2>What the plans are</h2>

<p><abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr> will be evidence-based action plans, developed in collaboration with the fishing sector and other stakeholders. Their purpose is to deliver sustainable fisheries for current and future generations.</p>

<p>Each <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr> will specify the stocks, type of fishing and the geographic area covered, as well as the authority or authorities responsible and indicators to be used for monitoring the effectiveness of the plan.</p>

<p>Once published, <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr> will inform a wide range of relevant fisheries management actions. There will not be a ‘one size fits all’ approach to our <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr> – they will be designed according to the specific needs of their stocks, fisheries and location. Therefore, <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr> will vary in their content and format because our fisheries range from stocks whose management is well understood, to complex mixed fisheries with many stocks in whole sea areas.</p>

<h2>How the plans work</h2>

<p>Each&nbsp;<abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr>&nbsp;will set out goals and the actions needed for their achievement. The precise mechanisms needed will depend on the goals set out in the plan. <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> (and the other national fisheries authorities) must then take the actions set out in plan.</p>

<p><abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr> could draw upon existing tools, require new regulations or technical measures, or use non-statutory routes such as research plans, voluntary agreements and codes of conduct.</p>

<p>After publication, each plan will remain a live document that will be monitored, reviewed, and adapted as needed. Management actions must be adapted and updated when necessary to ensure the&nbsp;<abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr>&nbsp;meets its goals.</p>

<h3>Preparing the plans</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> is responsible for preparing plans, but will work collaboratively with delivery partners and the fishing sector to develop <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr>. We will also work with other marine industries, policy makers, scientists and environment groups when preparing <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>This approach represents a significant shift in our fisheries management towards greater participation and collaboration with stakeholders.</p>

<h3>Publishing the plans</h3>

<p>Once drafted, <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr> must go through a public consultation, giving all interested parties the opportunity to give their views.</p>

<p>Once finalised, for <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr> relevant to English waters, <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> will then seek approval from the Secretary of State to publish the <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr> (although for <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr> produced jointly with other fisheries policy authorities, <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> will act jointly with the other relevant authority to publish the document).</p>

<p>Planned publication dates will be set out in the Joint Fisheries Statement (to be published in November 2022).</p>

<h2>Frontrunner plans</h2>

<p>Whilst the final list of <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr> will be published in the Joint Fisheries Statement,  <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> is developing 6 ‘frontrunner’ <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr>, which are outlined in this document.</p>

<p>These frontrunners will pilot different ways of preparing plans in partnership with industry groups and other stakeholders. Lessons learnt from these projects will shape our future&nbsp;<abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr>&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>Each frontrunner&nbsp;<abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr>&nbsp;has a delivery partner who will work with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and stakeholders to draft plans that represent a wide range of views.</p>

<p>Stakeholders will have various opportunities to engage throughout the drafting process and then comment during the public consultation. Once published, <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plans">FMPs</abbr> will be monitored, reviewed and updated to ensure they are still fit for purpose. Stakeholders will also be part of this work.</p>

<h3>Crab and lobster</h3>

<p>The crab and lobster&nbsp;<abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr>&nbsp;will cover stocks in English waters only. The Sea Fish Industry Authority (Seafish) is working closely with the Crab and Lobster Management Group, an industry-led advisory group to draft the <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>King scallop</h3>

<p>The King Scallop&nbsp;<abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr>&nbsp;is a joint plan between <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and Welsh Government and will cover stocks in English and Welsh waters. The Scallop Industry Consultation Group (SICG) Working Group is working with Seafish to draft the king scallop <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr>. The SICG Working Group is a collaborative group comprised of UK industry representatives from the wider SICG and officials from all fisheries policy authorities.</p>

<h3>Bass</h3>

<p>The Bass&nbsp;<abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr>&nbsp;is a joint plan between <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and Welsh Government and will cover stocks in English and Welsh waters. Policy Lab is working closely with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and stakeholders in 2022 to help develop the Bass <abbr title="Fisheries Management Plan">FMP</abbr>.
