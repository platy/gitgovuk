<h2>Introduction and approach</h2>

<p>1. The Housing Benefit Assurance Process (<abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>) is the testing and reporting requirements to be followed by Reporting Accountants undertaking engagement work for a local authority’s (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) claim for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy from the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) on form MPF720A.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> is a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reporting framework instruction prepared in accordance with the International Standard on Related Services (<abbr title="International Standard on Related Services">ISRS</abbr>) 4400 Engagements to perform agreed-upon-procedures regarding financial information. This module of <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> specifies the testing strategy, error type definition, case testing results and reporting requirements sufficient for <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> reports on claims for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy. The scope of the Reporting Accountant’s work is limited to the contents and requirements of <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> when undertaking this work in respect of an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s claim for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on Form MPF720A. This document is available to both accountancy firms and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>3. This module is designed to be used in conjunction with Modules 1 to 5 to provide the detail on testing methodology. This module explains the steps required to complete the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report on form MPF720A.</p>

<h3>Timetable</h3>

<p>4. The Reporting Accountant must send the final <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report to the postal or email address supplied by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and attach the final claim Form MPF720A submitted by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> no later than 31 January 2023.</p>

<p>5. Reporting Accountants are required to complete all modules of <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> in time to ensure the Reporting Accountant’s <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report is issued to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> for comment on its factual accuracy prior to submission of the final <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report and final claim to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> by 31 January 2023.</p>

<p>6. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has comments on the findings of the Reporting Accountants report, they may submit a separate representation to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> including full details of their objections to the content.</p>

<p>7. <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1, 2, 3 and 6 are issued in February of each year to allow the work required to be spread over the period to the deadline of 31 January 2023. Module 5 is provided for each software supplier no later than the end of June 2022 as the final software position is confirmed.</p>

<p>8. Modules 1, 2 and 6 are available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/housing-benefit-assurance-process-hbap">GOV.UK</a> Module 3 workbooks will be maintained and supported by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and will be distributed directly to the Reporting Accountant and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. Module 5 will be issued by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> directly to Reporting Accountants.</p>

<h3>Advice and support</h3>

<p>9. Advice and support is available to Reporting Accountants and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. Interpretations of regulations and guidance will be provided by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Reporting Accountants can email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.hbassurance@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.hbassurance@dwp.gov.uk</a> and further guidance can be found at:</p>

</ul>

<p>10. Where the Reporting Accountant and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> are in dispute regarding the level of testing to be completed, the nature of errors found or the treatment of specific cases, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> should be contacted by email to  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.hbassurance@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.hbassurance@dwp.gov.uk</a> at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>11. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will then determine how the issue should be resolved for the purposes of <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> testing and provide a direction to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and Reporting Accountant.</p>

<h2>Year on year changes</h2>

<p>12. The following changes are brought to the attention of Reporting Accountants for subsidy for financial year ending (<abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr>) March 2022:</p>

<h3>COVID-19 specific impacts</h3>

<p>Throughout <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> March 2021, and to a lesser extent <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> March 2022 a number of temporary changes to the way <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> is administered had been made to assist <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> during the restrictions imposed on daily life during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the majority of these temporary changes have ceased a number still remain in place and need to be considered, alongside any residual impact within the <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> March 2022.</p>

<p>Guidance on the treatment of these changes was issued to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> throughout the year. Guidance to Reporting Accountants on the treatment of such cases for the purpose of <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> testing for the <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> March 2022 subsidy claims will be issued by the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Assurance team through a COVID-19 addendum.</p>

<p>Reporting Accountants must refer to this guidance when conducting <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> testing.</p>

<h3>Changes to the shared accommodation rate exemptions for care leavers and former residents of homeless hostels</h3>

<p>The shared accommodation rate of the Local Housing Allowance (<abbr title="Local Housing Allowance">LHA</abbr>) applies to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants under 35, living alone and renting privately and is based on the cost of renting a room in shared accommodation. There are a number of exemptions which allow a claimant to receive the higher, one-bedroom rate instead of the shared accommodation rate in certain circumstances. Two of these exemptions are for care leavers and for those who have spent at least 3 months in a homeless hostel.</p>

<p>The following changes will apply from 31 May 2021 and claimants will be expected to self-identify to claim an exemption:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Care leaver exemption - the upper age limit to qualify for the for care leavers’ exemption is extended from 22 up to 25</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Homeless hostel exemption - the lower age limit of 25 for the homeless hostel exemption is lowered to 16</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are no other changes to the qualifying criteria for these exemptions. The existing definitions for ‘care leaver’ and ‘hostel for homeless people’ apply.</p>

<h3>Changes to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> for claimants in receipt of Severe Disability Premium</h3>

<p>From 27 January 2021, regulations come into force to remove the Severe Disability Premium (<abbr title="Severe Disability Premium">SDP</abbr>) Gateway. From this date, no new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims may be taken for claimants in receipt of <abbr title="Severe Disability Premium">SDP</abbr>. These claimants will now be allowed to claim Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) and considered for the new Transitional Element.</p>

<p>Existing claimants who have remained on working age <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> because their award includes a <abbr title="Severe Disability Premium">SDP</abbr> and they can remain on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> until they have a change of circumstances which triggers a new claim to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>The Universal Credit (Persons who have attained state pension credit qualifying age)</h3>

<p>A basic condition of entitlement to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is that the claimant has not reached the qualifying age for Pension Credit. When a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> single claimant, or the younger member of a mixed-age couple, reaches Pension Credit qualifying age, the award of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is superseded and terminated on the grounds of a relevant change of circumstances.</p>

<p>From 25 November 2020, when a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award is superseded because the claimant reaches the qualifying age for Pension Credit, the effective date of the decision is the first day of the assessment period after the assessment period in which the change occurs. This applies whether or not the person makes a claim for Pension Credit.</p>

<p>This change means that <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> continues in payment for the whole assessment period during which the claimant or younger member of a mixed-age couple reaches Pension Credit qualifying age.</p>

<p>Normally a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimant is precluded from claiming <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>. However, there are exceptions to this. From 25 November 2020 the exceptions include a claim for State Pension age <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> by a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimant who reaches the Pension Credit qualifying age.</p>

<p>From 25 November 2020, <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is added to the list of benefits which can be disregarded. This means that the final payment of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is disregarded when a claim for State Pension age <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> is made during the final <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> assessment period.</p>

<h3>The Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit)</h3>

<p>The Housing Benefit (Person who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (SI 2021/188) were laid on 25 February 2021 and come into force on 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>SI 2021/188 makes amendments to the personal allowance rates for people who reach State Pension age on or after 1 April 2021. There are no changes to the personal allowance rates for people who reached State Pension age before 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>The personal allowance rates for people receiving pension age <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> are based on the Standard Minimum Guarantee (in Pension Credit) plus the maximum amount of Savings Credit. As Savings Credit is treated as income for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> purposes this prevents any Savings Credit received from reducing the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> award. The same personal allowance rates are used for all pension age claimants regardless of whether the claimant receives Savings Credit.</p>

<p>Savings Credit is not available to people who reach State Pension age from 6 April 2016 but a decision was made to keep the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> personal allowances with the Savings Credit uplift for the first 5 years of the of the new State Pension despite removing access to the Savings Credit.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> personal allowance rates for those reaching State Pension age from 1 April 2021 will no longer include the Savings Credit element, in other words, the rates will be the same as the Standard Minimum Guarantee.</p>

<p>Applicable rates will be published in Module 2 <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> March 2022.</p>

<h3>Sanctuary Scheme exception</h3>

<p>From 1 October 2021, there will be a sanctuary scheme exception from the Removal of the Spare Room Subsidy (<abbr title="Removal of the Spare Room Subsidy">RSRS</abbr>) so that those who qualify will not have a deduction applied to their claim if they under-occupy a social sector tenancy. A claimant will qualify providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>their property has had additional security installed under a sanctuary scheme as a result of domestic violence or abuse having been inflicted upon or threatened against the claimant or a member of their household</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the perpetrator of the abuse does not live at the property – except where they are a qualifying young person dependent of a member of the household</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the claimant provides written evidence from a person acting in an official capacity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The appropriate means for providing support for claimants with an <abbr title="Removal of the Spare Room Subsidy">RSRS</abbr> deduction in a property adapted under a sanctuary scheme prior to 1 October 2021 is <abbr title="Discretionary Housing Payment">DHP</abbr>. Therefore, when reassessing a claim to apply the exemption from <abbr title="Removal of the Spare Room Subsidy">RSRS</abbr> it is advisable to consider whether a <abbr title="Discretionary Housing Payment">DHP</abbr> award has already been made to support the claimant to remain in their adapted property. If there is a <abbr title="Discretionary Housing Payment">DHP</abbr> award in place this will have to be revised to account for the increased entitlement to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Temporary Absence of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants – inside and outside Great Britain</h3>

<p>A small number of claimants who travelled to Afghanistan from Great Britain, expecting to return within 4 weeks of leaving that are now unable to return home due to the collapse of the Afghan Government on 15 August 2021. Following discussions with HM Treasury, we have been given permission to continue to pay existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants who are currently temporarily absent in Afghanistan on an extra-statutory basis, in other words, for a reason outside of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> legislation.</p>

<p>Regulation 7 of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/213) and the Housing Benefit (persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) regulations 2006 (SI 2006/214) has not been amended. Therefore, the usual rules on not sub-letting and having an intention to return still apply.</p>

<p>This means that people whose absence in Afghanistan is permitted for up to 26 weeks, for example due to medical treatment, continue to be entitled to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> on a statutory basis. Where their absence in Afghanistan will exceed this period then they will also be covered by the extra-statutory payments.</p>

<p>For those <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants who were due to return within 4 weeks of leaving Great Britain but are currently unable to leave Afghanistan, payments of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> can continue on an extra-statutory basis until they return.</p>

<p>This exemption only applies to those stranded in Afghanistan in connection with the collapse of the Afghan Government on 15 August 2021 and, as such, we would expect individuals to have travelled to Afghanistan before 15 August 2021. The exemptions do not apply to individuals in other countries.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> requests to the Valuation Office Agency) – Rent Officer Referrals and Capital Valuation</h3>

<p>In respect of <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> March 2022 and future assurance periods, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have been advised to make all Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>-) Rent Officer Referrals and Capital Valuation requests using electronic methods.</p>

<h2>Detailed guidance</h2>

<h3>Step 1 - Preparation</h3>

<p>13. Guidance on preparation is based on the premise that a Reporting Accountant has been engaged by signed contract in which fees, Standardised Engagement Terms as per Module 1, variations have been agreed.</p>

<p>14. The Reporting Accountant and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should have a planning meeting in advance of the implementation of <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> to set up the detailed testing arrangement. This meeting should, as a minimum, cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a discussion that will agree the timetable for the work from the initial testing to the issue of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report, including a full explanation and evaluation by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> of any Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience (<abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr>) issues (see Step 3). When testing is going to be conducted (initial, <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr>, additional testing or 40+ testing and what testing will be done by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> or the Reporting Accountant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agreeing a timetable for re-performance testing by the Reporting Accountant for any initial testing completed by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr>, additional testing that will be completed by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>finding out what the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has done to address previous <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> and additional testing issues included in the previous <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report (obtained from the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> where there has been a change of firm between years). Any report made under Module X does not need to be provided, as Module X engagements are stand alone and are not intended to inform subsequent years testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the transfer of a copy of the previous year’s final MPF720A and information on what the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has done to address the errors that led to any amendments, exceptions, or observations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the confirmation of a key <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> contact to deal with and clear all queries in time to meet the published deadline</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>arranging to obtain audit trails from the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s systems and select samples, and to have access to the information derived from benefits system and the Customer Information System, including a demonstration of how to view the screens on both systems for testing purposes and an awareness of data protection and security issues. In undertaking <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> work, Reporting Accountants should observe their obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 and their data protection policies</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2 - Initial testing - Module 3 workbook testing</h3>

<p>15. The Reporting Accountant must select an initial random sample of 20 cases from the audit trail supporting the headline cell (cells 011, 055 and 094) of form MPF720A for each of the 3 benefit types (non-Housing Revenue Account rent rebate, rent rebate and rent allowance). A maximum total of 60 cases (20 cases for each of the 3 benefit types) are required where the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> awards all 3 benefit types. When the test population for a benefit type is less than 100, the Reporting Accountant will reduce the initial sample pro rata, for example a population of 49 would require a sample of 10.</p>

<p>16. If testing is started early using a source other than the final claim form, it is essential that the details tested are reconciled to the final claim form before the claim is reported upon. Any differences must be examined and the impact on the sample, test findings and the claim must be assessed before a <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report is issued (see Step 6).</p>

<p>17. Initial testing is required on both the headline cell entries and the analysis of expenditure in the detailed cell(s) that support the headline cell entry for each initial sample. The total of the detailed cell entries should equal the headline cell expenditure (excluding any prior year overpayments).</p>

<p>18. An initial case is defined by its case reference number. All benefit transactions in the year against the case reference number must be tested. If a claimant has more than one case reference number in the year; for example, where the claimant returns to benefit and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> uses a new claim reference number, only the expenditure against the single case reference number selected for testing needs to be examined.</p>

<p>19. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> changes <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> software or supplier which results in a change in reference number for the sample case within the subsidy year, the Reporting Accountant will need to test all sample case transactions from the legacy system and new system so that all benefit transactions in the year made to the claimant are tested.</p>

<p>20. The detailed testing required is set out in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module 3 workbooks. The testing must also comply with appendix 3 in <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module 1.  The workbooks require the Reporting Accountant or <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to evidence details of the sample cases and testing results, for example, the relevant dates, the claimant’s entitlement to benefit and the subsidy coding of the payments made. The specific evidence that the Reporting Accountant or the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> must verify is listed in the tests attached to the workbooks. The workbooks record whether each case passes or fails each test. The outcome of this testing and <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> (Step 3) must be evaluated in accordance with the guidance in Step 4.</p>

<p>21. Where the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> undertakes the initial testing, the Reporting Accountant will carry out re-performance testing on the <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> work. Reporting Accountants will re-perform all failed and a random 10% of the passes.</p>

<p>22. This will be carried out according to a timetable that allows the Reporting Accountant to review the work and findings completed by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, in time to enable any additional testing to be completed in order to meet the reporting deadline. If the re-performance testing identifies errors in the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s testing the Reporting Accountant will point out the incorrect conclusion reached by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is instructed to review all cases again in light of this issue.  The Reporting Accountant will then pick a further sample for re-performance testing including some with the characteristics of the incorrect conclusion.  If this second, <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> attempt is tested without error then the Reporting Accountant will rely on the results.  If there are further errors the Reporting Accountant will move to simply disclaim the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> testing and the Reporting Accountant will re-perform the full sample of 20.</p>

<h3>Step 3 - <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> from prior year Module 3</h3>

<p>23. Module 1 Appendix 2 requires the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to provide the Reporting Accountant with the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report (including any supplementary reports, but excluding any report produced under Module X) from the previous subsidy year where there has been a change of accountancy firm between the previous and current subsidy years. The Section 151 Officer is required to provide the Reporting Accountant with the prior year final tested subsidy claim form (MPF720A) with any amendments made to the form initialled by the Section 151 Officer.</p>

<p>24. The Reporting Accountant is required to refer to the prior year final tested subsidy claim form and <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report (including any supplementary reports, but excluding any report produced under Module X) to identify issues that were reported which resulted in exception, observation or amendment of the claim. The Reporting Accountant will ask the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to confirm what it has done to address previous <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> and additional testing issues included in the previous <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report.</p>

<p>25. <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> testing can be generated from an observation, amendments or exception from the previous year <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report in respect of the previous year’s subsidy claim.</p>

<p>26. The purpose of <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> is to establish whether these issues remain unresolved and test for continuing errors in the appropriate population. Where there are <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> issues from prior year Module 3 workbook testing, the Reporting Accountant will need to carry out additional testing (see page 15, step 4.2).</p>

<p>27. If the additional <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> testing identifies errors, the results must be used to complete an extrapolation for inclusion in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report.</p>

<p>28. If the additional <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> testing does not identify any errors and no errors were identified in the initial sample, the results must be reported in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report as an observation. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s position is that the absence of any error provides sufficient assurance that the issue has been resolved. In these circumstances, the issue need not be considered under the <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> arrangements in the following subsidy period.</p>

<h3>Step 4 - Evaluating the results of initial testing</h3>

<h4>(Completion of Modules 2, 3, and 5)</h4>

<p>29. Step 4 must be followed in all cases. Errors identified by testing cannot be corrected on the current form without addressing the likelihood of similar errors in the population; and an extrapolation cannot be avoided because an adjustment has been or will be made in the following year for the errors found.</p>

<p>30. The Reporting Accountant will complete Modules 1, 2 and 5 as well as the initial testing.  Errors discovered from modules will be evaluated in the same way as an error found in initial testing.</p>

<p>31. Where a Reporting Accountant identifies during testing that a claim had been incorrectly assessed by an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, but that the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s own quality assurance or checking procedures (including any ‘one off’ checks) has identified the error and corrective action has been undertaken by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> prior to the Reporting Accountant requesting case population lists from which to select the current year samples, the individual case should be treated as correct, except where errors are still present in the case when it is checked by the Reporting Accountant. In these circumstances, where the case is correct at the point the Reporting Accountant or <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> carry out a test under these procedures, the previous error does not need to be reported in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report, and no further action is required by the Reporting Accountant. Where errors are still present in the case, these should be reported in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report as per the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> procedures. This paragraph does not apply to errors identified following the Reporting Accountants request for the case population lists relevant to the current year samples in other words  corrected as part of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> process, where the relevant <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> procedures will continue to apply.</p>

<p>32. In every case, the Reporting Accountant must critically evaluate the reason for an error and the likelihood of similar errors in the population. If it cannot be established that an error is isolated see page 14 step 4.1, or that all errors have been corrected in the year under review, the error needs to be subjected to additional testing and the results extrapolated for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to consider the impact on subsidy.</p>

<p>33. The fact that an error identified by testing is corrected by an agreed amendment on the subsidy claim form only deals with the individual error, not the likelihood of similar errors in the rest of the caseload.</p>

<p>34. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is able to identify a whole population or sub-population relating to the error found and wishes to amend form MPF720A in relation to that error, the instructions in Step 5 of Module 6 must be followed.</p>

<p>35. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> wishes to test a sample larger than 40 cases but without testing the entire population or sub-population, this will be subject to a separate engagement, and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should approach <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to agree the level of testing and re-performance testing required, as per Module X.</p>

<p>36. Where the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has undertaken to amend all cases found to contain the error in the following subsidy year this will need to be reported in the current <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report.</p>

<p>37. Where initial testing identifies errors, the Reporting Accountant must examine the reasons for these errors to determine what action and additional testing is necessary to allow the Reporting Accountant to report as required by <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>.</p>

<p>38. The Reporting Accountant must conclude on the type of error (see page 19 Step 5.2) to assess whether they represent an error that will require additional or 40+ testing; is the error quantifiable; or an isolated error?</p>

<p>39. An example of this evaluation would be where the initial sample identified one claim where earned income had been incorrectly calculated resulting in the claimant being underpaid. Despite the error being an underpayment, this error could result in an overpayment. There is unlikely to be enough data in the results of initial testing to provide the Reporting Accountant with enough information. Therefore, the Reporting Accountant should conduct additional testing to evaluate the error.</p>

<p>40. Having found an error, additional testing will be required unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the additional testing approach is not required for errors which by their nature do not affect the amount of subsidy claimed. For example, the misclassification of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cases between cells of the same subsidy value, with the same method of entitlement calculation, which produce the same amount of qualifying expenditure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it relates to errors that would always result in underpaid benefit because such errors have no impact on the subsidy claimed (see error type 1). In this case the initial sample results only need be reported under the observations heading in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report.  However, all overpayments are excluded from this provision; this is because of their complexity. If errors in overpayments are identified they must be subjected to additional testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is this an isolated error? In most cases this is unlikely as most errors tend not to be so singular that they can be classified as isolated and could never happen again</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>41. It may be possible to conclude immediately that errors in the initial sample are representative of the population and to agree an amendment to the claim to be made by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. This will be possible, for example, where system parameters are wrong, and the records can be interrogated to quantify the impact on subsidy claimed.</p>

<p>42. It may be possible to conclude an error is an isolated error or, through drilling down, relates to a small population or sub-population. These outcomes are covered in later sections of this Module. If such classification is not possible additional testing will be required on the headline (011, 055, 094) or detailed cell contents to help determine the significance of errors found in the initial sample.</p>

<p>43. It is important that the timetable for initial testing allows any additional work to be completed and any amendments or report results concluded in time to meet the published deadline. Reporting Accountants are encouraged, where possible, to carry out initial work earlier and to focus on high-risk areas and known problems first. Reporting Accountants cannot rely on the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> obtaining an extension to the reporting deadline. Extensions to statutory deadlines are granted only in exceptional circumstances. It is not acceptable to issue a holding <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report because work is not complete.</p>

<h4>Step 4.1 - Isolated errors</h4>

<p>44. Given the nature of the populations in benefit claims, ‘isolated errors’ are extremely rare. The presumption should be that errors are not isolated and that without a clear compelling case they should not be treated as such. Additional testing will usually be required.</p>

<p>45. If the Reporting Accountant concludes that an isolated error has been identified, the Reporting Accountant can then apply the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> amendment procedure outlined in Step 5. If an amendment is agreed, Reporting Accountants also need to consider the effect of amending one cell on other cells: other cells may also need to be amended (see Step 5 below).</p>

<p>46. Where it cannot be shown that the error can only have happened in this one instance only then additional testing will be applied.</p>

<h4>Step 4.2 - Additional testing</h4>

<p>47. Having found errors from the initial testing, additional testing is then carried out in the following steps. The additional testing will focus on the particular characteristics of the error only. These particular characteristics may relate to an expenditure type for example earnings (In this case you would select from the appropriate headline cell for that expenditure type) or to a specific detailed cell.</p>

<p>48. For additional testing, the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module 3 workbooks should be used, however the testing and workbook completion should focus on the nature and characteristics of the error being tested. The workbooks record whether each case passes or fails each test.</p>

<p>49. A case for additional testing is defined by its case reference number. All benefit transactions relevant to the error in the year against the case reference number must be tested.</p>

<p>50. Where testing identifies errors unrelated to the original error being tested do not undertake any further additional testing in respect of this new error. This should be reported in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report as an observation.</p>

<h4>Step 4.2.1 - Small populations</h4>

<p>51. Small populations are defined by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as 100 cases. Where test findings show there are errors affecting cells with small populations and the Reporting Accountant does not have a sufficient understanding of the cell population to agree an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> amendment, or the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> does not agree an amendment, the whole population must be tested by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to allow an agreed amendment to be made.</p>

<p>52. When considering the level of <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> testing applicable in circumstances where the prior year <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> error falls in a sub population under 100 but over 40, the Reporting Accountant and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> can agree to test a minimum of 40 <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> tests, disregarding the current small population guidance. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> wishes to test the full population, then this should be agreed with the Reporting Accountant at the initial planning meeting.</p>

<p>53. Reporting Accountants should re-perform a random 10% of the population. This will be carried out according to a timetable that allows the Reporting Accountant to review the further work and findings completed by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, including an element of re-performance testing if the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has completed the work, in time to meet the reporting deadline.</p>

<p>54. Where the results of the re-performance testing do not identify any errors in the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s testing, an agreed amendment must be made. If the Reporting Accountant agrees an amendment the effect of amending one cell on other cells must also be considered: other cells may also need to be amended (see Step 5).</p>

<p>55. If the re-performance testing identifies errors in the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s testing the Reporting Accountant will point out the incorrect conclusion reached by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is instructed to review all cases again in light of this issue.  The Reporting Accountant will then pick a further sample for re-performance testing including some with the characteristics of the incorrect conclusion.  If this second, <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> attempt is tested without error then the Reporting Accountant will rely on the results. If there are further errors the Reporting Accountant will move to simply disclaim the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> testing and the Reporting Accountant will complete a test of 40 cases themselves and extrapolate from these results. An amendment must not be made and the issue and test findings with extrapolation must be included in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report, including any effect on other cells on the form.</p>

<h4>Step 4.2.2 - Drilling Down</h4>

<p>56. For a population larger than 100 cases, where initial test findings indicate errors relating to a defined sub-population, the Reporting Accountant will undertake drill down testing, identifying the characteristics of the error taking their sample from a sub-population that shares these characteristics and focusing additional testing on the sub-population in question. Where the sub-population is fewer than 100, then test as per small populations (Step 4.2.1).</p>

<p>57. Testing samples will be 40 cases. This should allow the Reporting Accountant to quantify the error in the sub-population and calculate the extrapolation, based on this sub-population.</p>

<p>58. The purpose of the drill down testing is to identify the extent or significance of initial testing results within the sub-population and should therefore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>concentrate only on the characteristics or nature of the error found. A number of tests may be applied to the initial sample, but further application is needed only of those tests which identified errors. An example of this could be where an application form is unsigned. The Reporting Accountant would not re-perform all the validity checks required by the workbook on a further sample, but instead would select an additional sample at random to see whether those forms were signed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be biased to identify the significance of the initial testing results, hence a biased sample from the total population will need to be taken. An example of a biased sample would be where errors have been made where a problem only occurs for a particular case type. Here the additional sample would be selected from cases containing the particular case type, in other words, the sub-population</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>59. Drilling down is a powerful way of determining the potential impact and extent of errors within a sub-population. In order to drill down, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> must be able to provide the Reporting Accountant with an audit trail that lists all cases and total values of the sub-population. Reporting Accountants must determine that only the defined sub-population detected in the initial sample contains that error and the rest of the total population does not contain that error. In these circumstances, Reporting Accountants must ensure that any initial sample cases which are not part of the defined sub-population are excluded from the sample value used to calculate an error rate and extrapolated cell adjustments (See page 22 step 5.4).</p>

<p>60. The Reporting Accountant should report the results of the drilled down testing.</p>

<p>61. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should carry out the work. Reporting Accountants will re-perform all failed and a random 10% of the passes. This will be carried out according to a timetable that allows the Reporting Accountant to review the further work and findings completed by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, in time to meet the reporting deadline. If the re-performance testing identifies errors in the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s testing the Reporting Accountant will point out the incorrect conclusion reached by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is instructed to review all cases again in light of this issue. The Reporting Accountant then pick a further sample for re-performance testing including some with the characteristics of the incorrect conclusion.  If this second, <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> attempt is tested without error then the Reporting Accountant will rely on the results.  If there are further errors the Reporting Accountant will move to simply disclaim the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> testing and the Reporting Accountant will re-perform the full sample of 40.</p>

<h4>Step 4.2.3 - 40+ approach</h4>

<p>62. Where the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is unable to isolate a sub-population or the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is unable to establish the total value of the subpopulation, the approach determined by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is to select and test an additional random sample of 40 cases from the headline cell. The Reporting Accountant should concentrate only on the characteristics or nature of the error found. The 40+ approach can be undertaken by the Reporting Accountant or the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, as agreed in their contract, preliminary meeting or at the point the need for 40+ testing is identified.</p>

<p>63. The sample will be a random selection of 40 cases from the headline cell.</p>

<p>64. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should carry out the work. Reporting Accountant will re-perform all failed and a random 10% of the passes. This will be carried out according to a timetable that allows the Reporting Accountant to review the further work and findings completed by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, in time to meet the reporting deadline. If the re-performance testing identifies errors in the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s testing the Reporting Accountant will point out the incorrect conclusion reached by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is instructed to review all cases again in light of this issue. The Reporting Accountant then pick a further sample for re-performance testing including some with the characteristics of the incorrect conclusion.  If this second, <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> attempt is tested without error then the Reporting Accountant will rely on the results.  If there are further errors the Reporting Accountant will move to simply disclaim the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> testing and the Reporting Accountant will re-perform the full sample of 40.</p>

<p>65. The Reporting Accountant should report the results of the testing.</p>

<p>66. Where the results of additional testing do not allow agreed amendments to be made, the results of both the initial sample and any additional or 40+ testing should be set out as an exception in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report, including any effect on other cells on the form (see page 35 Step 6). An example <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report to show how testing results should be reported will be made available to Reporting Accountants and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> through the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>/<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> interface system ‘Glasscubes’.</p>

<h3>Step 5 - Agreed amendments and extrapolations</h3>

<h4>Step 5.1 - General points on amendments and extrapolations</h4>

<p>67. The populations and the nature and values of the errors detected in <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> testing lead inevitably to a degree of uncertainty when it comes to extrapolating findings. The Reporting Accountant’s extrapolations are based on the value of any errors identified. Where the number and nature of errors are so complicated that the Reporting Accountant cannot determine an amendment or extrapolation, exceptions should be reported as identified, together with an explanatory statement (see page 35 Step 6).</p>

<p>68. In cases where testing results in an amendment to a cell or an extrapolated figure is included in a <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report, the effect on other cells on the form must be considered and corresponding amendments made, or extrapolations provided. If corresponding amendments or extrapolations cannot be identified, the report must explain why the effect on other cells cannot be determined. Note, amendments and reported extrapolations need to satisfy the in-year reconciliation check in each section of the form: amending or reporting one cell without dealing with the impact on other cells is likely to cause the in-year reconciliation to fail and this will result in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> returning the claim for corrective work to be done. All <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> March 2021 expenditure appears in the headline cell and in the detail cells, providing the analysis supporting it. Only prior year overpayments do not appear in either the headline cell or the in-year reconciliation cells.</p>

<p>69. Where testing identifies that benefit has been underpaid, it is important to note that there is no impact on subsidy because subsidy cannot be claimed on benefit that has not been awarded. Where underpaid benefit is subsequently awarded it can be included in a later subsidy claim, but in the meantime, it must be excluded from the calculation of cell amendments. Underpaid benefit should be referred to under the observations heading in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report, but its effect should be excluded from any cell amendments or extrapolations. Where the nature of the error could equally result in an overpayment, for example, an error calculating claimant income could result in an over or under payment, additional testing is required to try to establish if overpayments have been made. For <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Assurance purposes, circumstances could arise where both under and overpaid benefit has been identified, in these circumstances the overpayment element should not be netted off against any relevant underpayment.</p>

<p>70. Where testing identifies that expenditure has been correctly awarded but incorrectly classified and some errors have the effect of increasing the amount that should be included in a cell and others the effect of decreasing the amount in that cell, the sample error is the net figure, that is, the sum of the increases and decreases. Where testing identifies that benefit itself has been underpaid this should be treated in accordance with the error type 1, see below.</p>

<h4>Step 5.2 - Error types for subsidy purposes</h4>

<p>71. To calculate a cell amendment or an extrapolation for a <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report the Reporting Accountant needs first to determine the error type, as <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> requires the following treatment for subsidy:</p>

<h5>Error type 1 - underpaid benefit</h5>

<p>Where benefit has been underpaid, there is no impact on the amount of subsidy to be claimed because subsidy cannot be claimed on benefit that has not been awarded. Underpaid benefit must, therefore, be excluded from the calculation of a cell amendment or extrapolation in a <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report. The underpaid amount should be excluded from the sample error but the value of the case excluding the underpayment tested should be included in the sample value. The fact that there are cases where benefit has been underpaid should be included in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report in the observations section (see example report at Appendix 1).</p>

<p>Note: Error Type 1 applies where the error identified will always result in an underpayment of benefit: additional testing in this case is not required. Where the nature of the error could equally result in an overpayment (for example, an error calculating claimant income could result in an over or under payment), additional testing is required to try to establish if overpayments have been made. Where overpayments are identified, or additional testing does not confirm that the population is overpayment free, these should be detailed in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report (see example report at Appendix 1).</p>

<h5>Error type 2 - missing claim forms</h5>

<p>Subject to the application of a local risk based verification (<abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr>) policy, where the claim form (paper, document image or electronic format) to support the current claim is missing and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is unable to produce other evidence that a claim form was received, for example, letters or other records of communication from the claimant about changes in circumstances; copies of information supporting the levels of income, capital or rent; responses from the claimant to enquiries from the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>; copies of records of reviews of the claim; or information from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> where the benefit is passported (see bulletin <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/637339/g8-2015-rev.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> G8/2015</a>) the case must be excluded in its entirety from the subsidy claim form. The cell adjustment or extrapolation in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report must remove all expenditure on the case from the subsidy claim form, that is, from the headline cell and detail cell(s).</p>

<p>Note: The checks on the assessment of benefit entitlement are unaffected by the above. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> must hold supporting information to demonstrate that benefit was correctly awarded and calculated. If this information is missing or insufficient Error Type 3 (insufficient supporting information) applies. Local (<abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy: a local <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy may not require a claim form. In such cases Reporting Accountants need to confirm the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has complied with its <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy for the year in which the claim was determined. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has not complied with its <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy, see page 21 error type 6.</p>

<h5>Error type 3 – benefit overpaid or insufficient supporting information</h5>

<p>Subject to the application of a local <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr>), where benefit has been overpaid or supporting information for part of the claim is missing or insufficient, the headline cell is not adjusted but the cell adjustment or extrapolation in a report must remove the expenditure from the detail cell(s) in which the expenditure is reported and increase the appropriate overpayment cell(s) by a corresponding amount (for example, <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> error overpayments will need to be increased where these errors are caused by an act or an omission by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Note: Where a local <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy operates, Reporting Accountants need to confirm the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has complied with its <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy. Where the application of the <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy does not enable the accountant to establish the subsidy classification, the case is admitted for subsidy as long as the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has applied its approved <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy. The assurance engagement covers the application of the <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy, not its contents or adequacy. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has not complied with its <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy, see error type 6 on the next page.</p>

<h5>Error type 4 – expenditure misclassification</h5>

<p>Where benefit expenditure has been misclassified, for example, misclassifying <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> error overpayments as eligible overpayments, the headline cell is not adjusted but the cell adjustment or extrapolation in a <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report must remove the expenditure from the detail cell(s) in which the expenditure has been incorrectly reported and increase the cell(s) in which it should have been reported by a corresponding amount. Errors which by their nature do not affect the amount of subsidy claimed, for example, the misclassification of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cases between cells of the same subsidy value, with the same method of entitlement calculation, which produce the same amount of qualifying expenditure, do not require additional 40+ testing. The initial sample results only need to be reported under the observations heading in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report (see example report at Appendix 1). All overpayments are excluded from this 40+ exemption, because of the complicating factors of <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> error and administrative delay subsidy, and the subsidy entitlement conditions which apply to prior year overpayments.</p>

<h5>Error type 5 – impact cannot be determined</h5>

<p>Where the consequential impact of the error on other cells cannot be determined or the testing identifies a combination of one or more of the above error types and these cannot be separated to enable an amendment or extrapolation for the consequential effect on other cells to be reported, the error(s) should be reported against the cell in which it was identified. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report should state the reason why the corresponding entries could not be established.</p>

<h5>Error type 6 – failure to apply the <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy</h5>

<p>Where the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has not applied its <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy (failed to apply the specified check) or performed a check that does not meet the requirements of the <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy (for example, the policy states eligible rent will be verified in all cases but the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has simply agreed the rent to the direct debit on the claimant’s bank statement, this has not established the eligible rent: the rent paid could include ineligible service charges) or cannot evidence that the check was performed (there is no record or prime documents to demonstrate the <abbr title="risk based verification">RBV</abbr> policy check was performed), the headline cell is not adjusted but the cell adjustment or extrapolation in a <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report must remove the expenditure from the detail cell(s) in which the expenditure is reported and increase the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> error overpayment cell by a corresponding amount.</p>

<p>72. An example <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report (see Appendix 1) contains examples of the above error types and how these should be included.</p>

<h4>Step 5.3 - Amendments to Subsidy Claims</h4>

<p>73. The results of initial and any additional testing may allow an amendment to be made because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is an isolated error</li>
  <li>the whole population of the cell has been tested, or</li>
  <li>the whole sub-population affected has been tested</li>
</ul>

<p>74. Where the whole population or sub-population has been tested by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, and this does not fall under the criteria for dealing with small populations (100 cases or fewer), the Reporting Accountant should undertake re-performance testing. This will be carried out on a random sample of the population tested, and the sample size will be the greater of either 10 cases or 1% of the population or sub population.</p>

<p>75. Where the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> plans to carry out testing in order to calculate an amendment, they should notify the Reporting Accountant prior to commencing testing so that the Reporting Accountant can plan and adequately resource the re-performance testing.</p>

<p>76. If an amendment is made, consideration must also be given to the effects of amending one cell on other cells as these may also need to be amended. If the results do not allow an amendment to be made, the issue and test findings need to be included in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report, including any effect on other cells on the form.</p>

<p>77. All amendments must be made by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to a pdf version of the form (not in manuscript) because this will ensure the amendments are automatically reflected in calculations and amounts transferred between cells. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should make amendments to an electronic copy of the form, perform the validation check, and print a copy of the amended form. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should, where practically possible initial all input cells which have been amended, where a physical initial is not possible Reporting Accountants should ensure that full details are provided in the observation section of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>: it is not necessary to initial changes to cells that contain calculations or cells that contain amounts transferred from other cells (these are updated automatically by the form). The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should sign the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> certificate of the amended form. The Reporting Accountant should check that all amendments to input cells have been made and initialled by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and check that no other input cells have been amended.</p>

<p>78. Amendments made to the subsidy claim form must be listed in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report (observations section) for <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> agreement and <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> purposes in the following year. This will list the cell amended, the amount of change and a brief explanation of the reason for the amendment.</p>

<p>79. For example, because it does not allow a claim where zero materiality applies, the variation in errors is such that the sample may not be representative of the population, or because the order in which amendments are made might affect total subsidy, Reporting Accountants should report why amendment is not possible (see page 25 step 6).</p>

<h4>Step 5.4 - Extrapolations</h4>

<p>80. The Reporting Accountant should report the results of the testing.</p>

<p>81. Where the results of additional testing do not allow agreed amendments to be made, the results of both the initial sample and any additional testing should be set out as an exception in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report, including any effect on other cells on the form (see page 25 Step 6).</p>

<p>82. If additional testing is selected from a specific detail cell due to the nature of the error(s) identified in the initial sample, the Reporting Accountant must ensure that any initial sample cases which do not reflect characteristics of the error being tested are excluded from the sample value used to calculate an error rate and extrapolated cell adjustments.</p>

<p>83. An example <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report to show how testing results should be reported is provided to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and Reporting Accountants via the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>/<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> interface system ‘Glasscubes’.</p>

<p>84. Where an amendment cannot be agreed and additional testing has been completed the results will then be used in the following extrapolations.</p>

<p>85. A cell extrapolation in a report should be calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cell extrapolation CA = (<abbr title="cell total">CT</abbr> or <abbr title="sub-population total">SP</abbr>) x <abbr title="sample error">SE</abbr>/<abbr title="sample value">SV</abbr> where:
    <ul>
      <li>
<abbr title="cell total">CT</abbr> = Cell Total that is the value in £s of the cell from which the sample is drawn</li>
      <li>
<abbr title="sample error">SE</abbr> = Sample Error that is the value in £s of the errors found in the sample. Exclude cases where benefit has been underpaid (error type 1).</li>
      <li>
<abbr title="sub-population total">SP</abbr> = Sub-population total that is the value in £s of the sub-population from which the additional sample is drawn</li>
      <li>
<abbr title="sample value">SV</abbr> = Sample Value that is the value in £s of the sample tested (where benefit has been underpaid see page 19 step 5.2 and error type 1)</li>
      <li>
<abbr title="sample error">SE</abbr>/<abbr title="sample value">SV</abbr> is referred to in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report as the percentage error rate, which should be calculated to 2 decimal places. The Reporting Accountant should extend the number of decimal places if this results in a nil error rate and include the number of decimal places used in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <abbr title="sample value">SV</abbr> is the value of the transactions tested that is the whole year value of the case(s) tested.</p>

<div class="example">
<h5>Example</h5>

<p>In a sample where the transactions tested have a value of £1,000 (SV), you find errors whose net value is a reduction of £150 (SE) (£150 is overpaid expenditure).</p>

<p>The cell total (CT) is £500,000. The headline cell £10,000,000</p>

<p>The percentage error rate is 15% (£150 divided by £1,000 x 100)</p>

<p>The Cell Adjustment is £75,000 (£500,000 times 15% (£150/£1,000))</p>

<p>The amended cell total is £425,000 (£500,000 minus £75,000)</p>

<p>There is no impact on the headline cell. The LA error overpayment cell would increase by £75,000.</p>
</div>

<p>Note: Reporting Accountants must consider and set out the effects of amending or extrapolating one cell on the form on the other cells on the form. Further examples are provided in in the example copy of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report.</p>

<p>86. In principle, this calculation should be simple to apply. However, care needs to be taken where extending samples, in particular where drilling down into sub-populations. In such cases, the Reporting Accountant must only include cases that were drawn from the relevant sub-population and only apply the error rate to the sub-population (for example, any cases in the initial random sample which are not from the relevant sub-population should be excluded).</p>

<div class="example">
<h5>Example</h5>

<p>Taking the same example as above but where the errors relate to a sub-population of £300,000 in the cell total of £500,000:</p>

<p>The percentage error rate is 15% (£150/£1,000 x 100);</p>

<p>The cell adjustment is £45,000 (£300,000 times 15% (£150/£1,000)); 
The amended cell total is £455,000.</p>

<p>There is no impact on the headline cell. The LA error overpayment cell would increase by £45,000.</p>
</div>

<p>Note: Where a sub-population is identified, the extrapolation should use <abbr title="sub-population total">SP</abbr> the value of the sub-population within the cell, not <abbr title="cell total">CT</abbr>, the cell total that includes the sub-population.</p>

<p>87. Extrapolations for <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> reports should be determined by reference to the total benefit tested, in other words, the total benefit granted on the case(s) in the year. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>from the initial sample (the total value: £3,280) and the additional sample (the total value: £7,100), 1 error is identified</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a claimant is awarded benefit for 2 benefit periods in the year using the same case reference number</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the claimant is awarded £100 per week for the first 4 weeks of the year (£400) before their benefit entitlement ends</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the claimant subsequently returns to benefit and is awarded £125 per week for the last 2 weeks of the year (£250)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>testing identifies a <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> error overpayment of £55 per week for the last 2 weeks of the year (£110)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the sample value is £10,380 (£3280 + £7100) – this value includes the benefit of £650 granted to the claimant (£400+£250)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the sample error is £110</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the percentage error rate to be applied is 1.06% (£110/£10,380 * 100) for that particular claim</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The overpayment in this case does not affect the headline cell (because the headline cell includes current year overpayments)</li>
      <li>The percentage error rate is used to calculate a cell adjustment(s) for the detail cell(s) in which expenditure was included (a reduction) and therefore a corresponding amendment (an increase) to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> error overpayment cell</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>88. The results of testing on each case should be combined with the results for all other cases tested in the sample and presented in an extrapolation table with the extrapolated effects on other cells as appropriate - see example <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report at Appendix 1.</p>

<p>89. Where an error is discovered that if acted upon would create a prior year overpayment or amends an amount already reported as a prior year overpayment the extrapolation calculation should only include the error based on the current year <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> expenditure not expenditure which was included in previous subsidy claims.</p>

<h3>Step 6 - The Reporting Accountant’s <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report</h3>

<p>90. Before the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report is started Steps 4 and 5 must be completed. The results of both the initial sample and additional or 40+ testing should be set out in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report.</p>

<p>91. In cases where testing results in an extrapolated figure included in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report, the corresponding effect on other cells on the form needs to be included. If corresponding adjustments cannot be identified, the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report must explain why the effect on other cells cannot be determined. Note, extrapolations need to satisfy the in-year reconciliation check in each section of the form: qualifying one cell without dealing with the impact on other cells is likely to cause the in-year reconciliation to fail and this will result in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> returning the claim for further work to be done (all 2020-21 expenditure appears in the headline cell and in the detail cells providing the analysis supporting it. Only prior year overpayments do not appear in either the headline cell or the in-year reconciliation cells).</p>

<p>92. The standard <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> structure must be used for each <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report: an illustrative example with the prescribed content and manner of presentation is provided within the example <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report (available via ‘Glasscubes’ and also contained within the Module 3 help files). The <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report should leave <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in no doubt about the details of the exceptions identified and, to this end, findings should be presented clearly and unequivocally. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report needs to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>test findings</li>
  <li>information on the range of error values to demonstrate to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> why an adjustment could not be determined for amendment, subsidy implications</li>
  <li>any implications for the entries in other cells; and indicate whether similar issues have been included in a previous qualification letter</li>
</ul>

<p>93. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use this information to decide what further action is required. For example, it may decide to settle the claim based on the test findings or may need the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to do more work, particularly if the problem has continued for some years. The key point is that the initial, <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> and additional or 40+ testing provides a basis for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to make such decisions and achieve settlement of claims without further recourse to Reporting Accountants.</p>

<p>94. If the Reporting Accountant’s report is inconsistent with the requirements of <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>, for example, if a cell adjustment or extrapolation is calculated but consideration is not given to the impact on other cells on the form, or if a 40+ sample is drawn from a sub-population but non sub-population cases in the initial sample are used in the calculation of an error rate, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will require re-submission of the associated parts of the report in a form consistent with <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> requirements.</p>

<p>95. Where testing identifies that benefit has been underpaid, it is important to note that there is no impact on subsidy because subsidy cannot be claimed on benefit that has not been awarded. Where underpaid benefit is subsequently awarded it can be included in a later subsidy claim, but it must be excluded from the calculation of cell adjustments and extrapolations in <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> reports. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report should observe that cases have been identified where benefit has been underpaid but that these cases are not reflected in extrapolations because subsidy is only payable on benefit that has been awarded. Note, where the nature of error could equally result in an overpayment, for example, an error calculating claimant income could result in an over or under payment, additional testing is required to try to establish if overpayments have been made.</p>

<p>96. The detailed information in <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> reports should be tailored to the particular circumstances of test findings and must set out the effects of the exception on all affected cells in the form. Extrapolations for a <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report should be completed in accordance with paragraphs in Step 5.4. Reporting Accountants need to report the corresponding adjustments in the extrapolations. However, the requirement to set out the effects does not extend to cells containing calculations or where the form transfers amounts between sections of the form. It does not cover, for example, the effect on overall <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> error subsidy of an increase in <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> error overpayments in one section of the form.</p>

<h4>Respective responsibilities of the local authority and the Reporting Accountant</h4>

<p>We conducted our engagement in accordance with <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 and 6 [year] issued by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, which highlight the terms under which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has agreed to engage with Reporting Accountants.</p>

<p>As Section 151 Officer of the local authority, you have responsibilities under the Income-related Benefits (Subsidy to Authorities) Order 1998. You are also responsible for ensuring that the local authority maintains accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the local authority. It is also the Section 151 Officer’s responsibility to extract relevant financial information from the local authority’s accounting records, obtain relevant information held by any officer of the local authority and complete the attached form MPF720A in accordance with the relevant framework set out by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> [state titles and dates of relevant documents].</p>

<h4>Our approach</h4>

<p>For the purpose of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> engagement we have been provided with a signed copy of form MPF720A 2021-22 dated [insert date of initial final claim] by the Section 151 Officer. The Section 151 Officer remains solely responsible for the completion of the MPF720A and is the signatory on the local authority’s certificate on claim form MPF720A.</p>

<p>Our engagement was carried out in accordance with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reporting framework instruction which has been prepared in accordance with the International Standard on Related (<abbr title="International Standard on Related Services">ISRS</abbr>) 4400, Engagement to perform agreed-upon-procedures regarding financial information. The purpose of the engagement is to perform the specific test requirements determined by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on the defined sample basis as set out in <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> reporting framework instruction on the local authority’s form MPF720A dated [insert date of initial final claim], and to report the results of those procedures to the Local Authority and the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The results of these are reported on in [appendices a, b, c]</p>

<h4>Inherent limitations</h4>

<p>The procedures specified in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Reporting framework instruction does not constitute an examination made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which would be the expression of assurance on the contents of the Local Authority’s claim for Housing Benefit subsidy on form MPF720A. Accordingly, we do not express such assurance. Had we performed additional procedures or had we performed an audit or review of the Local Authority’s claim for Housing Benefit subsidy on form MPF720A in accordance with generally accepted auditing or review standards, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you. This report relates only to the Local Authority’s form MPF720A and does not extend to any financial statements of the Local Authority, taken as a whole.</p>

<p>[Add in following paragraph where the Reporting Accountant is also the Local Authority’s external auditor: This engagement will not be treated as having any effect on our separate duties and responsibilities as the external auditor of the Local Authority’s financial statements. Our audit work on the financial statements of the Local Authority is carried out in accordance with our statutory obligations and is subject to separate terms and conditions. Our audit report on the Local Authority’s financial statements is made solely to the Local Authority’s [members], as a body, in accordance with [Part 5 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014]. Our audit work was undertaken so that we might state to the Local Authority’s [members] those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Local Authority and the Local Authority’s [members], as a body, for our audit work, for our audit reports, or for the opinions we have formed in respect of that audit.]</p>
