<p>Reporting Accountants reporting deadline: 31 January 2023.</p>

<p>Queries on this <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reporting framework instruction should be emailed to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.hbassurance@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.hbassurance@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1. This reporting framework instruction sets out the Department for Work and Pensionsâ (DWPs) requirements for an engagement to be undertaken by a Reporting Accountant in accordance with the International Standard on Related Services (<abbr title="International Standard on Related Services">ISRS</abbr>) 4400 Engagements to perform agreed-upon-procedures regarding financial information. At the request of the local authority (<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>), the Reporting Accountant will provide a report of factual findings on the completion of the Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process (<abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>) Modules 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 based on principles of a tripartite arrangement in respect of Form MPF720A for the financial year ending 31 March 2022. The Reporting Accountantâs report must be delivered to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> no later than 31 January 2023.</p>

<h2>The role of the Department for Work and Pensions</h2>

<p>2. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is solely responsible for determining the sufficiency of its reporting framework instruction, including the Specific Test Requirements to meet its purposes.</p>

<p>3. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on behalf of the Secretary of State will settle claims and make decisions on the payment or recovery of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy including withholding a proportion or all of a payment of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy to an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>4. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will provide the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> modules and other guidance based on the current claim Form MPF720A, the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and the instructions made or having force thereunder, in particular the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 2006 and The Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations 2006 (as amended); and the Income-related Benefits (Subsidy to Authorities) Order 1998 (as amended), which is a Standing Order that is updated each year.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will also provide support, where required, to clarify the legislation and regulations. This service will be available to both the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant in order to ensure that the reporting deadline can be met.</p>

<p>6. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will put into place a quality assurance mechanism to monitor the quality of the Reporting Accountants work in accordance with an agreed framework with an appropriate body.</p>

<h2>Role of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>7. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is required to appoint a Reporting Accountant, by the 1 March prior to the commencement of the financial year for which this procedure will apply, to perform the Specific Test Requirements set out in the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWPâs</abbr> <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> modules in force for that year.</p>

<p>8. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> fails to appoint a Reporting Accountant by the deadline of 1 March, the Secretary of State may withhold part or all of subsequent payments of subsidy. The amount and scale of withholdings will be the decision of the Secretary of State. When the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> confirms the appointment of a Reporting Accountant the subsidy withheld can be released.</p>

<p>9. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is responsible for completing Form MPF720A, maintaining proper records, complying with the terms of any legislation and regulatory requirements, and providing relevant information to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant in accordance with the requirements of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Role of the Reporting Accountant</h2>

<p>10. The Reporting Accountant is required to perform the Specific Test Requirements in accordance with the scope of work set out in DWPs <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> reporting framework instruction. On completion of these Specific Test Requirements, Reporting Accountants should report their findings.</p>

<h2>The standardised engagement terms</h2>

<p>11. The standardised engagement terms of this <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reporting framework arrangement will form a tri-partite engagement between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant and are set out in Appendix 2.</p>

<p>12. It is for the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to appoint a Reporting Accountant to undertake this work and notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of the successful appointment. Instructions for notifying <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of a successful appointment are contained in Appendix 1. This notification must be issued to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> no later than 1 March prior to the commencement of the financial year for which this procedure will apply. Details on actions to be taken if the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> fails to appoint a Reporting Accountant are detailed in paragraphs 8 and 9.</p>

<p>13. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will not sign individual tri-partite engagement letters. However, its agreement to enter into a tri-partite engagement with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and Reporting Accountants on the basis of this revised <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> reporting framework instruction, is confirmed by virtue of its publication of the framework instruction on its website. Accountants should only enter into the tri-partite engagement terms if they are willing to enter into the engagement as published by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Deviations from the standardised engagement terms</h2>

<p>14. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should not ask the Reporting Accountant to deviate from the standardised engagement terms within <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be solely responsible for updating and publishing the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> standard engagement terms. If, by exception, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> agrees to any deviation from the standard terms, this will be confirmed in writing by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and a deviation statement must be included in the report. This does not preclude the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> from agreeing separate engagement terms with the accountant that supplement, but do not conflict with, these standardised engagement terms.</p>

<h2>Specific Test Requirements</h2>

<p>15. The Specific Test Requirements that the Reporting Accountant is required to undertake are set out in <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 2, 3, 5 and 6.</p>

<p>16. Reporting Accountants and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are required to complete all <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> testing, set out and contained within the modules of <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> and ensure there is enough time for the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to make comment on the factual accuracy of the report prior to submission of the final <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report and final claim to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> by the appointed deadline of 31 January 2023.</p>

<h2>Report and publication</h2>

<p>17. The required reporting format, which will be in the form of an Agreed-Upon-Procedures format, is set out as a separate example entitled <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report in Module 6.</p>

<p>18. If submitted by post, the letterhead, for the Reporting Accountantâs report, should consist of the original print of the Reporting Accountantâs corporate design; neither photocopies nor copies reproduced from a master are acceptable. The use of letter headed paper provides evidence to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> that a report has been completed by the Reporting Accountant.</p>

<p>19. If the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report is submitted electronically a copy of the report should, where practical consist of the original print of the Reporting Accountantâs corporate design as with the postal submission and received from a verifiable email address from within the Reporting Accountants firm.</p>

<p>20. The reporting accountant should send the final <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> report to the postal or email address supplied by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and will attach the final claim Form MPF720A submitted by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> no later than 31 January 2023.</p>

<p>21. If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> receive final claim forms without reports, or reports alone, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will reject them. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will return these to the Reporting Accountant for the required correct submission.</p>

<h2>Submission procedure</h2>

<p>22. The final claim Form MPF720A is prepared and completed by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. If forwarded by post an original signed form is to be sent to both the Reporting Accountant and to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on or before 30 April 2022. The appointed Reporting Accountant will then perform the Specific Test Requirements and report to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on this version of the claim. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> or the Reporting Accountant is unable to meet the deadline, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should communicate and discuss this with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>23. If the final claim form is submitted electronically an actual signature will not be mandated. However the electronic version of the claim form should be received from the Section 151(or authorised deputy) officers verifiable email address, if this is not possible <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will require confirmation that the Section151 officer (or authorised deputy) has reviewed and agreed the report.</p>

<p>24. Reporting Accountants will discuss their findings with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> (within a mutually agreed timescale) to allow the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> sufficient time to comment on the factual accuracy of the report before the deadline for submission of the final claim Form MPF720A and the report to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>25. Reporting Accountants will then send the final report and the final claim form MPF720A directly to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to arrive no later than the published reporting deadline each year; with a copy sent to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>26. If the final assured claim form is submitted electronically an actual signature will not be mandated, however the electronic version of the claim form should be received from the audit firmâs verifiable email address.</p>

<p>27. If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has comments on the findings of the Reporting Accountantsâ report, they may submit a separate representation to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> including full details of their objections to the content.</p>

<p>Unable to appoint a Reporting Accountant to conduct Specific Test Requirements on Form MPF720A under the standardised engagement terms in Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process for Subsidy year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Name of local authority (in full)</p>

<p>On behalf of the local authority, I formally notify the Department for Work and Pensions that we have been unable to appoint a Reporting Accountant to complete the Specific Test Requirements of Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process of Form MPF720A for the year ending 31 March 2023 by 01 March 2022.</p>

Below are the Specific Test Requirements <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> requires the Reporting Accountant to undertake for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reporting framework instruction <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> for financial year ending 2022.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> requires all tests to be applied. Materiality should not be applied.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>1) Does the authority certificate bear the original signature or been received from the Section 151 officers verifiable email address? <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will require confirmation that the Section 151 officer has reviewed and agreed the report.</p>

<p>2) Does the Form MPF720A include an entry in every cell (The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should enter zero in any cell that does not apply see test note para 6)?</p>

<p>3) Is all arithmetic on the claim correct (confirmed by using the pdf form)?</p>

<p>4) Does the entry in the âin-year reconciliationâ cell for each benefit type (non-Housing Revenue Account (HRA) rent rebates, rent rebates, rent allowances) agree with the corresponding total expenditure cell?</p>

<p>5) Do the benefit parameters and allowances in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> system correctly update to reflect the annual uprating?<br>
Complete all the entries in all tables in the Module 2 Appendix A checklist to provide confirmation. Confirmation that testing has been completed and no issues found should be included in the summary section of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report. If issues are found these should be reported in the appropriate <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report Appendix.</p>

<p>6) Complete the relevant Appendix to Module 5 depending on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> system supplier. Confirmation that testing has been completed and no issues found should be included in the summary section of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report. If issues are found these should be reported in the appropriate <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report Appendix.</p>

<p>7) Check that the entries in each section of the form (non-HRA rent rebates, rent rebates, rent allowances) agree to the final subsidy reports in accordance with <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module 5.</p>

<p>8) For the cases tested, has the testing confirmed that the expenditure has been included at the correct value and in the correct cells in the MPF720A form, using the Module 3 workbooks?</p>

<p>Cells 11 to 33, 38, 55 to 72, 78 and 79, 94 to 124 and cell 131 should all be tested in accordance with Module 3.</p>

<p>All cells with an S suffix contain calculations or are pre-filled. These cells are not covered by <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> 2020/21 and are outside the scope of this engagement. However, these cells should still be included in establishing whether the claim form contains an entry in every cell and that the form agrees to the subsidy system reports.</p>

<h4>Modified schemes subsidy (cells 212 to 216S,225)</h4>

<p>9) Does testing of prime documents provide evidence that expenditure on modified schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has been properly identified in cells 214 and 225; and</li>
  <li>has been excluded from other cells on the form?</li>
</ul>

<p>Whereas the tests applied to the initial samples of 20 cases cover the full calculation of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, the 20 Modified Scheme cases will be checked for compliance with the Modified Scheme and that the claims are eligible for a Modified Scheme.</p>

<p>Tests needed: A sample of 20 cases should be tested unless the population is less than 100 in which case the Reporting Accountant should apply a pro rata sample. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> requires the following tests to be carried out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>has the local discretionary scheme been agreed by full council? (In cases where prime documentation supporting full council agreement is not available, alternative evidence will suffice (refer to helpfiles))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reporting Accountants are not required to approve the content or format of any policy and should not do so</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do the prime documents demonstrate that the claimant receives a war pension(s)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have statutory disregards been correctly applied?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has the increased benefit paid as a result of the local scheme been separately identified and excluded from other cells on the claim form?
Errors identified in testing cell 214 should be treated in the same way as errors found in the initial sample from the headline cells. Any errors identified should be reported in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report in the appropriate section. If the error results in overpaid subsidy the impact on all relevant cells on the claim form should be reported along with any adjustments required</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any cases subject to a Modified Scheme that form part of the sample taken for initial, additional, or Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience testing should still be subjected to the full tests for which they were sampled.</p>

<h4>Agreed amendments</h4>

<p>10) Where agreed amendments are required have these been made in accordance with <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module 6 on a pdf copy of the form (not in manuscript); and been initialled by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>?</p>

<p>(Note: see test note paras 10 to 12 below)</p>

<h3>Information for testing</h3>

<h4>Approach</h4>

<p>3. To meet the requirements of DWPs reporting framework instruction <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module 1 the reporting accountant is required to complete all of the modules of <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Module 1: The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Reporting Framework instruction: sets out the standardised engagement terms Specific Test Requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Module 2: Uprating: provides a checklist to help the Reporting Accountant ensure the authorityâs system is using the correct benefit parameters to calculate benefit entitlement and to claim subsidy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Module 3: Workbooks: provides the detailed testing workbooks to be completed and includes step-by-step guidance and a test result summary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Module 5: Software diagnostic tool: provides a tool to help ensure the subsidy claim has been completed using the appropriate software and that benefit âgrantedâ has been reconciled to benefit âpaidâ in accordance with the IT software supplierâs instructions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Module 6: Testing Strategy and reporting requirements: guidance on testing, error types, amendments and the recording of errors in the report</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module 1 for <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> March 2022 and associated <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> modules are to be used in all cases regardless of the amount claimed. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> modules are available online on www.gov.uk with the exception of Module 5 which will be issued directly  to the Reporting Accountants to protect sensitive data and Module 3 which will be available through the Glasscubes portal directly to Reporting Accountants and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Completion of form MPF720A</h3>

<p>5. Final claim forms MPF720A are provided to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in a pdf format for completion. The pdf form is sent by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are required to provide a signed copy and the pdf form to their Reporting Accountant for testing under <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>.</p>

<p>6. The pdf MPF720A form includes a validation check that all cells have been completed. However, it is possible for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to complete, certify and submit the form without completing this validation check, so it is possible to submit a form with blank cells. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will perform checks at initial final claim stage to identify blank cells and will require resubmission. If re-submission is required, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should provide a new MPF720A and must provide an updated version to its Reporting Accountant. Reporting Accountants need to check that the Form MPF720A presented for reporting work includes an entry in every cell. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should enter zero in any cell that does not apply.</p>

<p>7. Cells 003, 004, 006, 007 and 009 contain calculations or are pre-filled: these cells are not covered by <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> 2020-21 and are outside the scope of this engagement.</p>

<p>8. Administration subsidy in cell 005 and Interim benefit subsidy in cell 008 are pre-filled by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and cannot be amended. The entry in cell 008 should not include amounts received after the initial final claim is certified by the Section 151 Officer: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>âs systems take automatic account of any later payments.</p>

<p>9. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant can agree an amendment to a cell in order that that the cell and the form are factually correct based on the guidance on amendments in Module 6.</p>

<p>10. Where <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> testing results in agreed amendments to cell entries these must be made by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> making amendments to a pdf version of the form (not in manuscript) because this will ensure the amendments are automatically reflected in calculations and amounts transferred between cells.</p>

<p>11. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should make amendments to an electronic copy of the form, perform the validation check and print a copy of the amended form. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should where possible initial all input cells which have been amended. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will accept non initialled cells on the proviso that all amendments are included as an observation : it is not necessary to initial changes to cells that contain calculations or cells that contain amounts transferred from other cells (these are updated automatically by the form). The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should certify the amended Form MPF720A.</p>

<p>12. The Reporting Accountant should check that all agreed amendments to input cells have been made and initialled or are included as an observation by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and check that no other input cells have been amended. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module 6 guidance on the impact of amendments and the effect of amending one cell on other cells on Form MPF720A, including the headline cells, detailed and in year reconciliation cells must be followed.</p>

<h3>In-year reconciliation cells (cells 037, 077, 130)</h3>

<p>13. Each section of the form contains an âin-year reconciliationâ cell which is calculated automatically by the pdf form in accordance with the cell instructions. Cells 037, 077 and 130 should agree with the entries in cells 011, 055 and 094 respectively. The âin-year reconciliationâ cells seek to confirm that the figure in each total expenditure cell is supported by the analysis of expenditure that follows it, but there is no validation check forcing the 2 figures to be equal before the authority can certify the form.</p>

<p>14. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will pursue any differences at initial final claim stage and require the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to undertake further work and provide the results of this work to its Reporting Accountant. Differences remaining or identified at the Reporting Accountantâs final claim stage should be referred to in the report. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may require the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to resolve these differences but a Reporting Accountant is not required to do so. Differences due to roundings between the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> system outturn reports and the entries made on Form MPF720A do not require reporting.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> error subsidy</h3>

<p>15. Cells 201 to 210S contain calculations or are pre-filled: these cells are not covered by <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> for <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> March 2022 and are outside the scope of this engagement.</p>

<h3>Modified schemes subsidy</h3>

<p>16. Cells 212, 213, 215 and 216S contain calculations or are pre-filled: these cells are not covered by <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> for <abbr title="financial year end">FYE</abbr> March 2022 and are outside the scope of this engagement.</p>

<p>17. Where the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> operates a discretionary local scheme to disregard some or all of any War Pension over and above the statutory disregards for War Pensions, supplementary pre-1973 War Widowâs Pensions, or where both pensions are in payment, the increased benefit paid as a result of the discretionary scheme does not count as qualifying expenditure and is to be excluded from the claim (in other words, excluded from cells 011, 055 and 094 and supporting cells). The applicable statutory disregards for the pensions listed above are contained within <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module 2 which is updated annually. However, from 1 April 2004, in recognition of the operation of these discretionary schemes, a <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> operating a discretionary scheme receives a 0.2% addition to subsidy, capped at 75% of the total benefit cost of the discretionary scheme to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. The total expenditure due to a discretionary scheme (referred to as voluntary on the form) should be entered in cell 214: this should be supported by control reports and totals which reconcile to the claim. Details of the individual cases making up these amounts should be produced by the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> system and should be tested to demonstrate that the scheme requirements have been applied correctly. The entry in cell 214 covers all rent rebate and rent allowance cases.</p>

<p>18. The entry in cell 214 is analysed by benefit type in the table leading to total <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and total at cell 225. The Reporting Accountant should agree this analysis to the control records provided to support cell 214. The entry in cell 214 and the total in cell 225 should be the same. The Reporting Accountant will use the workbook for the relevant benefit type to test the entry in cell 214. A sample of 20 cases should be tested unless the population is less than 100 when the reporting account must apply a pro rata sample.</p>

<h3>Actions on issues</h3>

<p>19. If the Reporting Accountant finds that the above tests result in errors, these will be treated in the same manner as errors found in the initial sample.</p>

<h3>Rent rebate subsidy limitation scheme</h3>

<p>This section of the form was not covered by <abbr title="Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> in previous years. Due to a change in the regulation of social rents effective from April 2020, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> have removed the calculation of Rent Rebate Subsidy Limitation from form MPF720A.</p>
