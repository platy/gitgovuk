<h2>Housing Benefit Subsidy</h2>

<p>Further Work relating to form MPF720A, which falls outside the scope of Housing Benefit Assurance Process (<abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>) Modules 1 to 6.</p>

<p>Reporting Accountants’ reporting deadline: as per individual agreements between the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>), local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) and Reporting Accountants.</p>

<p>Queries on this <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reporting framework instruction should be emailed to:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.hbassurance@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.hbassurance@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction to Further Work</h2>

<p>1.1.	Each year a number of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> make representations to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, requesting that Further Work is carried out on their final tested subsidy claim, prior to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> making a decision on the settlement of that claim. Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> agree to take the results of Further Work into account when settling the claim, further testing is carried out, and a Reporting Accountant will carry out a level of re-performance testing and report on this to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>1.2.	To facilitate any request for Further Work relating to the financial year ending March 2021 subsidy year, and all subsequent years, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has consulted on a standardised approach.</p>

<p>1.3.	Set out in this Module are the key principles for a Further Work engagement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>proforma letter from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> agreeing to Further Work and the conditions attached (Appendix 1)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>set of standard engagement terms (Appendix 2)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>template for the Reporting Accountant’s report to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (Appendix 3).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>1.4.	Further Work will often fall into (but is not limited to) one of the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>further testing of an entire population or sub-population in order to reach an agreed amendment to the final subsidy claim</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>further testing of an extended sample to arrive at a more representative extrapolation calculation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence that an outlier is present in the extrapolation calculated from <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> testing carried out under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 to 6.
 </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Key principles for a Further Work engagement</h2>

<p>2.1.	Further Work is defined as ‘any testing requested by an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> which can be used to authenticate its final tested claim and agreed to by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, including the associated level of re-performance testing specified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>; which is in addition to the specified tests under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 to 6. This testing and re-performance testing is therefore outside the scope of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> terms of engagement and requires a new tri-partite arrangement to be agreed between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and a Reporting Accountant.</p>

<p>2.2.	Further Work is not usually specified or mandated by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> but will be as a result of a request from an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. Further Work is defined as additional testing results on which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will make a decision on the settlement of that claim.</p>

<p>2.3.	An <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should make any request for Further Work to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Payments Team by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.paymentsandsubsidy@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.paymentsandsubsidy@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>2.4.	All requests for Further Work will be considered by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on their own merits. However, the use of Module X to carry out Further Work must not be used as a replacement for any of the testing specified in <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 to 6. All <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> testing must be carried out and reported on in full, whether or not <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> agree to a Further Work engagement, and regardless of the timing of that agreement.</p>

<p>2.5.	Further Work engagements are to be treated as a ‘one-off’ agreement. The agreement by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to take Further Work into account in a particular subsidy year should not be viewed as setting a precedent for subsequent years. The volume of additional tests carried out, or the results of that testing, as part of Further Work will not therefore form part of subsequent years Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience (<abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr>) testing, or impact upon the levels of testing to be carried out in subsequent years <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> engagements.</p>

<p>2.6.	Further Work must not commence prior to reaching agreement with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on the volume and nature of testing to be carried out, and the engagement of a Reporting Accountant to undertake any re-performance testing specified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.7.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> must demonstrate to the Reporting Accountant that the population being tested under Further Work can be reconciled to the equivalent population used for <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Initial and Additional / 40+ or <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> testing. In applying the results of Further Work, where a sample population has been tested by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, the cases tested under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> will be excluded to avoid double counting. Where the full population [of the cell] has been tested under the Further Work engagement, there is no requirement to re-test cases previously tested under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> but the results of those tests and sample values should be included in the Further Work results.</p>

<p>2.8.	Where Further Work requires a random sample to be taken from a larger population, the selection of the sample must be carried out by the appointed Reporting Accountant.</p>

<p>2.9.	Once Further Work has been agreed between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and a Reporting Accountant has been appointed, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is committed to completing the agreed testing and providing the results to the Reporting Accountant and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. At this point <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regard the Further Work as a specified part of the subsidy claim. Failure by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to complete the work could result in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> not taking this Further Work into account and settling the subsidy claim based on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report alone. This may also be taken into account when considering requests for Further Work in subsequent years.</p>

<p>2.10.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> will conduct the Further Work tests, and record these in a format agreed with the Reporting Accountant, to enable the Reporting Accountant to undertake the specified re-performance testing.</p>

<p>2.11.	The decision to apply the results of Further Work when considering the settlement of a subsidy claim is at the discretion of the Secretary of State for Work &amp; Pensions.</p>

<p>2.12.	Further Work will be carried out in the form of an Agreed Upon Procedure, with Reporting Accountants providing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with a report of factual findings. Once this report has been received by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, the engagement will be concluded.</p>

<p>2.13.	Indicative timescales for completion of Further Work (including the appointment of a Reporting Accountant) will be 12 weeks from the date that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> agree the volume of testing with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.14.	The Further Work engagement does not need to be carried out by the same accountancy firm as the appointed Reporting Accountant for the standard <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> testing. If the accountancy firms are different, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> will provide sufficient information to enable the Further Work engagement to be completed.</p>

<p>2.15.	A standard approach will be taken to the volume of re-performance testing which is required by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. However, within this standard approach, each Further Work engagement will be considered by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on its own merits, and as such can be varied at DWPs sole discretion. If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> intends to make a variation, this will be communicated to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> in advance of the formal notification.</p>

<p>2.16.	 The standard level of re-performance testing is as follows:</p>

<p>a)	For a sample population of 500 cases or fewer, a Reporting Accountant will re-perform a random sample of 10% of the testing carried out by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>b)	For a sample size greater than 500 cases, the following will apply:</p>

<p>i)	A sub-population of 500 cases will be taken and a Reporting Accountant will re-perform a random sample of 10% of that population. The 500 case sub-population will be the first 500 cases taken from a case list sorted in order of case reference number (low to high).</p>

<p>ii)	For all cases that fall outside that 500 case sub-population, a Reporting Accountant will re-perform a random sample of 1% of that population.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>400 cases tested by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> under Further Work would result in 40 cases being re-performed.
1500 cases tested by <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. Identify the first 500 cases from the list and re-perform 50. Then re-perform a further 10 cases from the remaining 1000.</p>

<h2>Appendix 1 Proforma - Engagement letter between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> relating to a request for Further Work</h2>

<p>[To be inserted into <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> letter head]</p>

<p>Dear</p>

<p>Following representations made by [Insert <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>] to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) agrees to the request for Further Work to be carried out in relation to the final subsidy claim for [Insert subsidy year]. This work is to be completed and the Reporting Accountant’s final report delivered to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> no later than 12 weeks from the date of this letter. If you become aware that this timescale is likely to be missed, you should inform <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<p>The specific tests and checks to be carried out are specified in Part 2 of Appendix 2 to Module X. The detail of the error being tested, the volume of cases to be tested by the Local Authority and the level of re-performance testing to be carried out by a Reporting Accountant are set out in the table below. Please note that you must appoint a Reporting Accountant and agree the format that testing will be recorded in, prior to commencing testing.</p>

<p>The principles for carrying out Further Work, the standard terms of engagement to be used when appointing a Reporting Accountant and the format of the report to be completed by the Reporting Accountant are contained within DWPs published document Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process Module X: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Reporting Framework Instruction for Further Work</p>

<h2>Appendix 2 Terms of engagement for Further Work</h2>

<p>This Appendix 2 to Module X is split into two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part 1 contains the standardised engagement terms to be used for the engagement of a Reporting Accountant by an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, to carry out testing relating to Further Work.</li>
  <li>Part 2 contains the specific terms and test requirements for a Further Work engagement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 1 - Standard terms of engagement for Further Work</h3>

<h4>1.	Introduction</h4>

<p>1.1.	The following are the pre-agreed terms of engagement on which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> requires the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to procure the services of a Reporting Accountant to perform additional work as agreed between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> through a separate engagement in accordance with this <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> - Further Work Module X in connection with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s claim for subsidy on form MPF720A for the relevant year ending [31 March].</p>

<p>1.2.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> agrees to enter into a tri-partite engagement as outlined in this <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>) - Further Work Module X in respect of form MPF720A for the relevant subsidy year. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> accepts that an agreement between the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, its Reporting Accountant and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on these terms is formed when the contract is agreed and signed between the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant to complete the engagement in accordance with the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> - Further Work Module X in respect of form MPF720A.</p>

<p>1.3.	The Reporting Accountants will submit to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> its agreed-upon-procedures report as set out in this Module X. These terms of engagement set out the basis on which the Reporting Accountants will sign the report.</p>

<h4>2.	Glossary of terms:</h4>

<p>‘Appendix 1 Letter’ is the letter from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> (in the form set out in Appendix 1 to Module X), in which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> formally agrees to the carrying out of Further Work under the terms of Module X, and in which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will set out the volume of cases to be subjected to testing by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, and the volume of re-performance to be carried out by a Reporting Accountant, along with any variation to the Specific Test Requirements contained in Part 2 Appendix 2 of Module X.</p>

<p>‘<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’ refers to the grant paying body providing the Housing Benefit subsidy and specifying the reporting framework.</p>

<p>‘Form MPF720A’ is the subsidy claim form annually completed by English <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to settle its final subsidy claim for the year ended 31 March.</p>

<p>‘Further Work’ is defined as any testing requested by an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and agreed to by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, and the associated level of re-performance testing specified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, which is in addition to the specified tests under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 to 6. This testing and re-performance testing is therefore outside the scope of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> terms of engagement and requires a new tri-partite arrangement to be agreed between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and a Reporting Accountant.</p>

<p>‘<abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work Report (the report)’ is the format in which the Reporting Accountants will provide their factual findings relating to further work to both <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. Module X explains how the results of the Specific Test Requirements should be stated. Example reports are contained within Module X Appendix 3.</p>

<p>‘<abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report’ refers to the report provided by a to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> by the statutory deadline of 30 November each year pursuant to <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 to 6</p>

<p>‘<abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>’ Housing Benefit (Subsidy) Assurance Process is the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reporting framework instruction designed by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> that is sufficient to meet its purposes.</p>

<p>‘Local Authority (<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>)’ refers to the organisation that is required to complete the Housing Benefit (Subsidy) claim form MPF720A and is the body to which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> pays <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy;</p>

<p>‘Reporting Accountant’ is an independent reporting accountancy firm appointed by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> who can carry out the audit of local government and health bodies under the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icaew.com/regulation/local-public-audit-in-england" rel="external">register of licensed local auditors</a> is maintained by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales (<abbr title="Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales">ICAEW</abbr>).</p>

<p>‘Specific Test Requirements’ are the tests within <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module X that the Reporting Accountant is required to conduct under this engagement (see Part 2 of this Appendix 2);</p>

<h4>3.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>’ responsibilities</h4>

<p>3.1.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is responsible for completing the Further Work in respect of form MPF720A under the requirements of Module X, maintaining proper records, complying with the terms of any legislation and regulatory requirements, and providing relevant information to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant in accordance with the requirements of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.2.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is responsible for ensuring it meets its requirements under the Social Security Administration Act 1992, the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and the instructions made or having force thereunder, in particular the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 2006 (as amended); and the Income-related Benefits (Subsidy to Authorities) Order 1998 (as amended), which is a Standing Order that is updated each year.</p>

<p>3.3.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is required to submit the Further Work in respect of completed form MPF720A to the Reporting Accountant in accordance with the timetable agreed between the parties. This should allow the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report to be completed and submitted to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> by the deadline specified in the DWPs Appendix 1 Letter to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. Failure to do so may result in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> not taking this Further Work into account and settling the subsidy claim based on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report alone.</p>

<p>3.4.	The Section 151 Officer of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> will make available to the Reporting Accountant all records, correspondence, information and explanations (including for partnerships or outsourcing of services exist for the administration, delivery and payment of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) that the Reporting Accountant considers necessary to enable the Reporting Accountant to perform the specific test requirements of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work Module X and to provide a factual findings report to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> will provide the Reporting Accountant with such information, explanations and documentation that the Reporting Accountant considers necessary to carry out their responsibilities under this engagement.</p>

<p>3.5.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> accept that the ability of the Reporting Accountant to re-perform the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s testing effectively depends upon the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> providing full and free access to financial, prime documents and other records; and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> shall obtain any such records held by a third party as are necessary for the purposes of the procedures described in DWPs <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work Module X and make them available to the Reporting Accountant.</p>

<p>3.6.	For the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work engagement, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> will provide the Reporting Accountant with the relevant <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report and the final or amended final claim MPF720A form for that year. If the accountant for the Further Work is different to the one carrying out the main engagement, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> may need to provide additional information over and above the form and the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report. Any such additional information will be agreed between the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant during the Further Work engagement.</p>

<p>3.7.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> shall make available information to the Reporting Accountant that it has obtained from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> via the Customer Information System (<abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr>) subject to the provisions of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard">HMG baseline personnel security standard</a> (guide for department contractors - Overview of the Standard). This Baseline Personnel Security Standard (<abbr title="Baseline Personnel Security Standard">BPSS</abbr>) does not require the Reporting Accountant to be <abbr title="Baseline Personnel Security Standard">BPSS</abbr> registered. The Reporting Accountant is not required to use <abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr> directly and does not need apply for user access or have <abbr title="Baseline Personnel Security Standard">BPSS</abbr> clearance.</p>

<p>3.8.	The failure by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to meet its obligations under this Further Work engagement may cause the Reporting Accountant to be unable to complete the additional work required under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work Module X as specified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. In these circumstances the Reporting Accountant must complete the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report as far as they are able, and include in the report, the details of where the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has failed to meet its obligations and the testing not carried out as a result. The Reporting Accountant accepts that, whether or not the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> meets its obligations, the Reporting Accountant remains under an obligation to perform the Specific Test Requirements with reasonable care.</p>

<p>3.9.	The Section 151 Officer is responsible for providing the relevant information for this additional work, (including the completed Final Claim Form MPF720A as amended following testing under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> in accordance with Module X and for ensuring that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the information is accurate</li>
  <li>as it applies to the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work engagement, the expenditure has been properly incurred in accordance with the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (as amended) and the instructions made or having force thereunder, in particular the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 2006 or The Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations 2006 (as amended)</li>
  <li>the information given under this Further Work engagement is in accordance with those Acts and the instruments made or having force thereunder, in particular the Income-related Benefits (Subsidy to Authorities) Order 1998 (as amended)</li>
</ul>

All information is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) 2018 and Reporting Accountants will observe all of their obligations under this Act and their data protection policies.</p>

<p>4.4.	Whilst the Reporting Accountant will perform their work with reasonable skill and care, the Reporting Accountant’s work should not be relied upon to disclose all misstatements, fraud or errors that may exist.</p>

<p>4.5.	Unless otherwise agreed, the Reporting Accountant will not visit third parties, including outsourced or contracted services, where partnership arrangements exist for the delivery of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>.

<h4>5.	Use of the Reporting Accountant’s report</h4>

<p>5.1.	The Reporting Accountant’s report is prepared solely for the confidential use of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. It is solely for the purpose of submission to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in connection with the requirements of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work engagement for the form MPF720A. It may not be relied upon by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for any other purpose other than in the consideration of a settlement of the relevant <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy claim.</p>

<p>5.2.	The drafts or the signed report shall not be copied, referred to or disclosed, in whole or in part (save as otherwise permitted by the standardised engagement terms), without the Reporting Accountant’s prior written consent.</p>

<p>5.3.	Without imposing on the Reporting Accountant and without the Reporting Accountant assuming (or perceived as assuming) any duty or responsibility and without imposing or accepting any liability to anyone except the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may disclose the report to others who demonstrate statutory rights of access to it. If there is a change in the Reporting Accountant from one year to the next the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> will release the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report from the previous year to the newly appointed Reporting Accountant.</p>

<p>5.4.	To the fullest extent permitted by law, except for the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, the firm of accountants, its partners and staff neither owe nor accept any duty to any person (including, without limitation, any person who may use or refer to any of DWPs publications) and shall not be liable for any loss, damage or expense of whatsoever nature which is caused by any person’s reliance on the Reporting Accountant’s work or reports.</p>

<p>5.5.	Neither the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, nor <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, nor others may rely on any oral or draft reports that the Reporting Accountant provides. The Reporting Accountant only accepts responsibility to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for the final signed report only for the purpose for which it was issued.</p>

<h4>6.	Form of the Reporting Accountant’s report</h4>

<p>6.1.	The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has provided a template for the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report in Appendix 3 to Module X.</p>

<p>6.2.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right, once it has received and reviewed the accountants report, to require the Reporting Accountant to provide clarification on any matter raised in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> feels there is not information to make a decision on the payment or overpayment of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy and, complete further testing where the report is not in accordance with <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work Module X; and provide a response to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.3.	Once the Reporting Accountant has provided a satisfactory response on any reported matters of query requested by the Secretary of State to enable the resolution of a <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report issue (including an issue consequent on the Reporting Accountant failing to fulfil the requirements of Module X) and has completed their report in accordance with the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work reporting framework instruction, the Reporting Accountant will have fulfilled their responsibilities under these standardised engagement terms.</p>

<p>6.4.	If there are any matters arising following the conclusion of this engagement, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will liaise with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> directly to determine the next steps.</p>

<h4>7.	Liability provisions</h4>

<p>7.1.	The Reporting Accountants (and any affiliated firm or sub-contractors) will perform the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work engagement with reasonable skill and care and accept responsibility to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for losses, damages, costs or expenses (‘losses’) caused by its breach of contract, negligence or wilful misconduct, subject to the following provisions.</p>

<p>7.1.1	The Reporting Accountant will not be responsible or liable if such losses are due to the provision of false, misleading or incomplete information or documentation or due to the acts or omissions of any person other than the Reporting Accountant, except where, it would have been reasonable for the Reporting Accountant to discover such defects in the course of performing the Specific Test Requirements.</p>

<p>7.1.2	The Reporting Accountant accepts liability without limit for the consequences of its own fraud and for any other liability which it is not permitted by law to limit or exclude.</p>

<p>7.1.3	Subject to paragraph 7.1.2 above, the aggregate liability of the Reporting Accountant whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, arising from or in connection with the work which is the subject of these standardised engagement terms, is capped at the amount agreed by the Reporting Accountant and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. Any claims, whether in contract, negligence or otherwise, must be formally commenced within 6 years after the party bringing the claim becomes aware (or ought reasonable to have become aware of the facts which give rise to the action and in any event no later than 6 years after the relevant report was issued (or, if no report was issued, when the Reporting Accountant accepted the engagement in writing). This expressly overrides any statutory provision which would otherwise apply.</p>

<p>7.2.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> agree that they will not bring any claims or proceedings against any individual partners, members, directors or employees of the Reporting Accountant, including individuals in any affiliated firm or sub-contractor used by the Reporting Accountant to provide their services. This clause is intended to benefit such partners, members, directors and employees who may enforce this clause pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (the Act).</p>

<p>7.3.	Notwithstanding any benefits or rights conferred by this agreement on any third party by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (the Act), the parties to the standardised engagement terms may agree to vary or rescind the terms without any third party’s consent. Other than as expressly provided in these terms, the Act is excluded.</p>

<p>7.4.	Where the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report is transferred to a newly appointed Reporting Accountant for the purposes of undertaking Further Work under this Module X, the liability for the contents of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report in relation to this Further Work Module X engagement, ceases for the original Reporting Accountant.</p>

<p>7.5.	Where applicable, this engagement is separate from and unrelated to the Reporting Accountant’s audit work on the financial statements of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> for the purposes of any applicable statutory or regulatory or other auditing framework and nothing herein creates obligations or liabilities regarding the Reporting Accountant’s audit work or audit reports which would not otherwise exist.</p>

<h4>8.	Fees</h4>

<p>8.1.	The Reporting Accountant’s fees, together with VAT and out-of-pocket expenses, will be agreed with and billed to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is not liable to pay any of the Reporting Accountant’s fees.</p>

<p>8.2.	Paragraph 8.1 will apply to any instance where, after the contract is formed but prior to testing commencing, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> chooses not to proceed with the Further Work engagement, for any fees and expenses occurred to that point (for example any preparatory work undertaken by the Reporting Accountant).</p>

<h4>9.	Quality of service</h4>

<p>9.1.	In the event that the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> wish to raise a complaint or dispute regarding the work or conduct of the Reporting Accountant, the process for complaints and dispute resolution will be set out in the contract between the Reporting Accountant and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. It is expected that the following steps will form part of that process as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stage 1 – <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>/<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to bring dispute or complaint to the attention of the Reporting Accountant and the parties to take reasonable steps to resolve the dispute or complaint.</li>
  <li>Stage 2 – escalation of the dispute or complaint by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>/<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to the Reporting Accountant’s engagement lead or supervising accountant or other suitable senior member of the organisation, named in the contract.</li>
  <li>Stage 3 – use of the audit firm’s formal complaints / dispute resolution process and procedures. If this stage is reached by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> must be informed by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> of the nature of the issue, and steps taken to date to resolve the dispute.</li>
  <li>Stage 4 – where all other attempts at mediation including stages 1 to 3 above have been exhausted, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> may take any complaint to the <abbr title="Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales">ICAEW</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> may obtain an explanation of the mechanisms that operate in respect of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icaew.com/regulation/complaints-process" rel="external">complaint to the <abbr title="Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales">ICAEW</abbr></a> or by writing to the <abbr title="Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales">ICAEW</abbr> at the <abbr title="Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales">ICAEW</abbr> Professional Standards Office, Metropolitan House, 321 Avebury Boulevard, Milton Keynes MK9 2FZ UK.</li>
</ul>

<p>9.2.	For the avoidance of doubt, use of the above process must not delay the submission of the completed <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report beyond the timetable set out in the Appendix 1 Letter from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<h4>10.	Providing Services to other parties</h4>

<p>10.1.	The Reporting Accountant will not be prevented or restricted by virtue of the Reporting Accountant’s relationship with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, including anything in these terms of engagement, from providing services to other clients. The Reporting Accountant’s standard internal procedures should be designed to ensure that confidential information communicated to the Reporting Accountant during the course of an assignment will be maintained confidentially.</p>

<h4>11.	Applicable law and jurisdiction</h4>

<p>11.1.	These standardised terms of engagement shall be governed by, and interpreted and construed in accordance with, English law.</p>

<p>11.2.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant irrevocably agree that the courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any contractual or non-contractual dispute (including claims for set-off and counterclaims) which may arise on any basis in connection with the validity, effect, interpretation or performance of, or the legal relationship established by this agreement or otherwise arising in connection with these standardised engagement terms.</p>

<h4>12.	Alteration to terms</h4>

<p>12.1.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should not ask the Reporting Accountant to deviate from the standardised engagement terms within Module X without written instruction from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the inclusion of a deviation statement in the report. This does not preclude the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> from agreeing separate engagement terms with the accountant that supplement, but do not conflict with, these standardised engagement terms.</p>

<p>12.2.	All additions, amendments and variations to these standardised engagement terms shall be binding only if in writing and signed by the duly authorised representatives of the parties. These terms supersede any previous agreements and representations (unless based on fraud) between the parties in respect of the scope of the Reporting Accountant’s work on form MPF720A and the Reporting Accountant’s report or the obligations of any of the parties relating thereto (whether oral or written) and save as set out in paragraphs below, represents the entire agreement and understanding between the parties, their affiliates or sub-contractors.</p>

<p>12.3.	These terms do not affect any separate agreement in writing between the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant.</p>

<h3>Part 2 – Testing requirements</h3>

<h4>1.	Introduction to testing requirements</h4>

<p>1.1.	This Further Work reporting framework instruction is prepared in order to set out the terms of engagement between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and Reporting Accountants under which a Reporting Accountant will carry out specified checks and re-performance testing relating to the Further Work testing carried out by an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> with the agreement of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, and provide a report of the findings to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>1.2.	The Specific Test Requirements in relation to Module X are set out in this Part 2 of Appendix 2 to Module X (Specific Test Requirements).</p>

<p>1.3.	The agreement of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, and the levels of testing and re-performance testing to be carried out will be communicated to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> in the form of a letter such as that included in Appendix 1 of Module X.</p>

<p>1.4.	This Further Work reporting framework instruction has been prepared in accordance with the International Standard on Related Services (<abbr title="International Standard on Related Services">ISRS</abbr>) 4400 Engagements to perform agreed-upon-procedures regarding financial information. It sets out DWPs requirements for an engagement to be undertaken by a Reporting Accountant for Further Work arising in a particular subsidy year, as may be requested by an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>1.5.	At the request of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, the Reporting Accountant will provide a report in the format contained in Module X, Appendix 3 on the completion of Further Work, as specified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<h4>2.	Role of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</h4>

<p>2.1.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is solely responsible for determining the sufficiency of its reporting framework instruction, including the process, sample size, methodology and timescales and any other Specific Test Requirements for Further Work from both the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant to meet its purposes.</p>

<p>2.2.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will provide the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work Module X and other guidance based on the current claim form MPF720A, the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and the instructions made or having force thereunder, in particular the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 2006 (as amended); and the Income-related Benefits (Subsidy to Authorities) Order 1998 (as amended), which is a Standing Order that is updated each year.</p>

<p>2.3.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will complete the proforma letter (Appendix 1) following discussions with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, and provide sufficient information for the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to carry out the specified testing and for the Reporting Accountant to carry out the specified re-performance testing.</p>

<p>2.4.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will also provide support, where required, to clarify the legislation and regulations. This service will be available to both the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant in order to ensure that the reporting deadline can be met.</p>

<p>2.5.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may put into place an external quality assurance mechanism to monitor the quality of the Reporting Accountant’s work in accordance with an agreed framework with an appropriate body.</p>

<h4>3.	Role of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>
</h4>

<p>3.1.	Any requests for Further Work will originate from an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. Any such request must be made in writing to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and provide sufficient information to enable <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to make a decision on whether to agree to the request.</p>

<p>3.2.	On receipt of an Appendix 1 Letter, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> must procure the services of a Reporting Accountant to undertake the specified sampling, checks and re-performance testing set out in this Further Work Module X, in order to meet the deadline for submission of a report on Further Work agreed between the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. This procurement must be completed before sampling and testing commences.</p>

<p>3.3.	If the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> fails to appoint a Reporting Accountant, or the agreed timescales for completion of Further Work are not achieved, the Secretary of State may direct that the results of Further Work will not be considered and move to settlement of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Subsidy Claim based on the findings from the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report issued pursuant to <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 to 6.</p>

<p>3.4.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is responsible for completing the testing required under this module, maintaining proper records, complying with the terms of any legislation and regulatory requirements, and providing relevant information to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant in accordance with the requirements of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. This should include provision of the relevant section of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report, the Final Subsidy Claim Form MPF720A (as amended during <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>).</p>

<p>3.5.	The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, by entering into this agreement with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, and a Reporting Accountant, undertakes to complete the agreed testing specified in this module, and provide all testing results to the Reporting Accountant in the agreed format, to enable the Reporting Accountant to complete the specified report.</p>

<p>3.6.	By undertaking Further Work, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> agrees to the results of such work being used to inform the Secretary of State’s decision on the settlement of the final subsidy claim, and acknowledges that the settlement of the final claim is at the Secretary of State’s discretion.</p>

<h4>4.	Role of the Reporting Accountant</h4>

<p>4.1.	The Reporting Accountant will agree with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> the format for the recording of testing carried out by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to ensure that testing and results are recorded in a way that allows the Reporting Accountant to complete the Further Work report.</p>

<p>4.2.	Where a random sample is required to identify cases for testing, the Reporting Accountant will select the sample cases to be tested by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.3.	The Reporting Accountant is required to perform the checks and re-performance testing specified in Module X and the specific letter to the relevant <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. On completion of these Specific Test Requirements, Reporting Accountants should report their findings to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in the format set out in Module X, Appendix 3 (Further Work Report).</p>

<p>4.4.	For the avoidance of doubt, this Further Work engagement under Module X is treated as a stand-alone engagement and report. The Reporting Accountant appointed for this Further Work engagement is not required to comment on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report pursuant to <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 to 6, whether they are the same or a different Reporting Accountant.</p>

<h4>5.	The standardised engagement terms</h4>

<p>5.1.	The standardised engagement terms of this <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reporting framework arrangement will form a tri-partite engagement between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the Reporting Accountant. It is for the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to appoint a Reporting Accountant to undertake this work.</p>

<p>5.2.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will not sign individual tri-partite engagement letters. DWPs agreement to enter into a tri-partite engagement with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and Reporting Accountants on the basis of Module X, is confirmed by virtue of its communication in writing to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> that Further Work can be undertaken and specifying the level of testing to be undertaken. Reporting Accountants should only enter into the tri-partite engagement terms if they are willing to enter into the engagement as published by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h4>6.	Specific Test Requirements</h4>

<p>6.1.	The Specific Test Requirements that the Reporting Accountant is required to undertake are set out below. For the avoidance of doubt, Further Work testing will be carried out by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and recorded in the format agreed with the Reporting Accountant.</p>

<p>6.2.	Prior to the commencement of Further Work Testing, the Reporting Accountant will carry out the following ‘Pre-Testing’ checks;</p>

<ul>
  <li>That the population (or sub-population) that was used for testing specified under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 to 6 is the same as the population to be used for the Further Work testing. This can be proven by confirming the case volumes and total value.</li>
  <li>That the list of cases from the population (or sub-population) that were used for testing specified under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 to 6 are included in the population, but are separately identified as having been tested previously (either as initial, additional or <abbr title="Cumulative Assurance Knowledge and Experience">CAKE</abbr> testing under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>6.3.	If the Reporting Accountant is unable to positively verify the above tests, they should inform the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> of the issue, and request that the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> rectifies the error and re-submits the information to allow the tests to be carried out.</p>

<p>6.4.	Further Work testing must not commence until the above tests have been passed.</p>

<p>6.5.	Where a sample is required from a larger population, the Reporting Accountant will select a random sample. The sample should exclude any cases that have previously been used for testing under <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Modules 1 to 6.</p>

<p>6.6.	The volume of cases to be tested (either the entire population or sample size) will be specified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in its Appendix 1 Letter to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.7.	Following completion of the Further Work testing by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, the Reporting Accountant will carry out the following tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a check that the population, and where appropriate the sample, contains all the cases identified at the pre-testing stage (and no additional cases).</li>
  <li>re-performance of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> tests on a random sample of cases. The level of re-performance testing will be specified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in its Appendix 1 Letter to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>6.8.	The Reporting Accountant will carry out the re-performance testing, and other tests specified above according to a timetable agreed with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, to enable the reporting deadline to be met.</p>

<p>6.9.	All Further Work carried out under this arrangement will be done in accordance with the testing requirements set out in this Module X and by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in the Appendix 1 Letter to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.10.	Errors found during Further Work which do not relate to the error being tested for under the limited scope of Module X should not be reported on.</p>

<h4>7.	Structure of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report</h4>

<p>7.1.	The required reporting format, which will be in the form of an Agreed-Upon-Procedures format, is set out in Appendix 3 in this Module X.</p>

<p>7.2.	The standard <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report structure must be used for each report.</p>

<p>7.3.	The <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report should leave <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in no doubt about the details of the findings, which should be presented clearly and unequivocally. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report needs to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>test findings (from work carried out by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>). This will include; the number of cases and value of the original population or subpopulation; the number of cases and value of the sample selected and tested by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>; the number of cases and value for any cases that the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> testing identified as being incorrect; the value of errors identified by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> testing.</li>
  <li>changes to the value of the cell as a result of <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> testing.</li>
  <li>values for any compensating cells, or impacts on other cells.</li>
  <li>details of any errors found by the Reporting Accountant during re-performance of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s testing, including the nature of the error, the value of the errors and the value of the sample (where applicable) and the value of the population or sub-population tested.</li>
  <li>confirmation that checks carried out in line with the ‘Specific Test Requirements’ section of Module X Appendix 2 have been carried out and the results of those checks.</li>
</ul>

<p>7.4.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use this information to decide what further action is required. For example, it may decide to settle the claim based on the original test findings from the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Report, or take into account the Further Work completed, in whole or in part.</p>

<p>7.5.	If the Reporting Accountant’s report is inconsistent with the requirements of <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module X, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will require re-submission of the associated parts of the report in a form consistent with <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Module X requirements.</p>

<h4>8.	Report submission</h4>

<p>8.1.	The deadline for completion of Further Work, including testing, re-performance testing and the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work Report, will be set by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in its Appendix 1 Letter to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. DWPs standard approach will be to set that deadline 12 weeks from the date of the letter agreeing to Further Work. Any variation to this approach will be agreed in writing by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, either in the Appendix 1 Letter to <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> or under separate cover.</p>

<p>8.2.	Reporting Accountants will discuss their findings with the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> (within a mutually agreed timescale) to allow the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> sufficient time to comment on the factual accuracy of the report before the deadline for submission of the report to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>8.3.	Reporting Accountants will then send the final report directly to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to arrive no later than the reporting deadline specified above, with a copy sent to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>8.4.	The <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report may be submitted as a protected PDF (or similar) document, using the letterhead of the Reporting Accountant’s corporate design.</p>

<p>8.5.	The Reporting Accountant should send the final <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report, along with a copy of the Appendix 1 Letter to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.lapaymentsandsubsidy@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.lapaymentsandsubsidy@dwp.gov.uk</a> or other address as may be specified on the Appendix 1 Letter to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>8.6.	Once the <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> Further Work report has been submitted to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, and the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is satisfied that it contains sufficient information for the Secretary of State to make a decision based on the report, the Reporting Accountant will have fulfilled their responsibilities under these standardised engagement terms.</p>
