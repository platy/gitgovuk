<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The âGuidance to CCAMLR Fisheriesâ has been prepared under the Antarctic Act 1994 to assist potential applicants who seek to operate fishing vessels legally registered in the UK, UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies in waters administered under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).</p>

<p>The purpose of the Guidance is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide background information to assist applicants in developing their proposals</li>
  <li>make the processes undertaken by the UK Government transparent and</li>
  <li>detail the standards that must be met in order for UK Government to support an application to CCAMLR</li>
</ul>

<p>The principal species which may be targeted in the Convention Area, are Patagonian toothfish (âDissostichus eleginoidesâ), Antarctic toothfish (âDissostichus mawsoniâ), mackerel icefish (âChampsocephalus gunnariâ) and krill (âEuphausia superbaâ). Demersal longlining is the primary fishing method used for toothfish, midwater trawls for icefish and krill.</p>

<p>CCAMLR fisheries are managed using the ecosystem-based and precautionary approach, and management objectives which deliver âconservationâ and provide for ârational useâ of marine living resources. CCAMLRâs regulatory framework recognises five types of fisheries (new, exploratory, established, closed and lapsed fisheries), that reflect the stage of development and the level of information available to make management decisions. Research fisheries to aid scientific evaluation is also permitted under CCAMLR, but this activity is regulated separately under the Antarctic Act 1994 and not covered within this guidance.</p>

<p>Fisheries within the Convention Area are required to operate in accordance with legally binding Conservation Measures. The complete set of Conservation Measures in force can be viewed on the CCAMLR <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ccamlr.org/en/organisation/home-page" rel="external">website</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> or purchased from the CCAMLR Secretariat in hard copy format.</p>

<p>Potential applicants should carefully read this guidance before submitting a proposal to fish in the Convention Area.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance is issued under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1251/introduction/made" rel="external">Antarctic Act 1994 (Convention for the Conservation of Marine Living Resources) Regulations 2020</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> (âthe CCAMLR Regulations 2020â) which should be read in conjunction with this guidance, in respect of any British registered vessel<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> wishing to access the Convention Area to fish for profit.</p>

<p>This guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provides information on New, Exploratory and Established fisheries within the waters covered by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (âthe Conventionâ)</li>
  <li>outlines the process for submitting proposals to fish in these fisheries</li>
  <li>outlines the Conservation Measures that are relevant to a British vessel which intends to fish for profit in the Convention Area and</li>
  <li>other criteria that the UK requires to be met before determining whether to grant authorisation to access the Convention Area</li>
</ul>

<p>Operators with British registered fishing vessels should contact the UK Single Issuing Authority (UKSIA)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> or relevant fisheries administration<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> to discuss CCAMLR fisheries and potential future access to these fisheries. Contact details for the UKSIA, British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies are in Section 11.</p>

<p>The Polar Regions Department of the Overseas Territories Directorate of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has the overall responsibility for coordinating the management of the UKâs policy as a Contracting Party to CCAMLR and engaging the international community on scientific and policy matters to protect marine life in the Southern Ocean.</p>

<p>The FCDO has prepared this guidance in consultation with the Department for the Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs, Devolved Administrations, British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Background</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources</h3>

<p>The Convention entered into force in 1982 and forms part of the Antarctic Treaty System. The Convention arose in response to concerns about the potential for the krill fishery to significantly affect the Antarctic ecosystem, which is largely dependent on krill, and a desire to avoid the overexploitation and other problems that had occurred in fisheries in other regions. The objective of the Convention is the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources, where conservation is defined to include rational use. The area of application of the Convention is the region south of the line which approximately follows the Antarctic Convergence, where colder polar waters meet more temperate waters to the north, forming a biological barrier to most Southern Ocean species.</p>

<p><strong>Map 1: Convention Area (CCAMLR. Map of Convention Area. Last updated August 2016).</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Map - CCAMLR Boundaries of the Statistical Reporting Areas in the Southern Ocean" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/118010/CCAMLR_Statistical_Areas.png"></div></figure>

<p>The Convention was the first international agreement to stipulate a precautionary and ecosystem-based management approach. The approach requires that management consider the effects of any harvesting on dependent and associated species, not just the target species, and that those ecological relationships are maintained.</p>

<p>The Convention applies to all marine living resources in the Convention Area, excluding seals and cetaceans, which are managed under the jurisdiction of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals and the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling respectively.</p>

<p>As illustrated in Map 1, the Convention Area is divided into three statistical areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Area 48 (Atlantic Ocean sector)</li>
  <li>Area 58 (Indian Ocean sector) and</li>
  <li>Area 88 (Pacific Ocean sector)</li>
</ul>

<p>These are further divided into Subareas, Divisions and Subdivisions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources</h3>

<p>The UK is one of 26 Members of the Commission<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>, each of whom pays an annual contribution and has voting rights. Eleven other States have ratified the Convention (known as acceding States) but are not Members of CCAMLR<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. Members and acceding States are collectively referred to as Contracting Parties to CCAMLR.</p>

<p>The Commission relies on a number of committees to provide it with advice on which to base its decisions. Decisions within CCAMLR are made by consensus. Committees include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Scientific Committee (SC), with five working groups: Acoustic Survey and Analysis Methods (WG-ASAM); Statistics, Assessments and Modelling (WG-SAM); Ecosystem Monitoring and Management (WG-EMM); Fish Stock Assessment (WG-FSA) and Incidental Mortality Associated with Fishing (WG-IMAF)</li>
  <li>the Standing Committee on Administration and Finance (SCAF) and</li>
  <li>the Standing Committee on Implementation and Compliance (SCIC)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission meets annually in October, with the working groups and committees meeting either prior to or concurrently with the Commission meeting. During these meetings Contracting Parties examine, among other priorities, the previous yearâs fishing activities within the Convention Area, data collected, scientific research and applications for new and exploratory fisheries. Members also review Conservation Measures, which, among other priorities, regulate fishing activities including setting the catch limits and any other requirements of operators in the fishery, based on the best available science.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Types of CCAMLR fisheries</h3>

<p>CCAMLRâs regulatory framework recognises five types of fisheries, which are described below. Any operator wishing to access fisheries in the Convention Area should consider which what type of fishery they wish to apply for, and read the relevant sections on notifications (if applicable), application process and relevant Conservation Measures.</p>

<h4>New fishery</h4>
<p>A new fishery, as defined under Conservation Measure 21-01 (2019), is a fishery on a species using a particular fishing method in a statistical Subarea or Division for which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information on the distribution, abundance, demography, potential yield and stock identity from comprehensive research/surveys or exploratory fishing have not been submitted to CCAMLR or</li>
  <li>catch and effort data have never been submitted to CCAMLR or</li>
  <li>catch and effort data from the two most recent seasons in which fishing occurred have not been submitted to CCAMLR</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exploratory fishery</h3>
<p>An exploratory fishery, as defined under Conservation Measure 21-02 (2019), is a fishery which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>was previously classified as a ânew fisheryâ (under Conservation Measure 21-01)</li>
  <li>continues to be classified as such until sufficient information is available to:
    <ul>
      <li>evaluate the distribution, abundance, and demography of the target species, leading to an estimate of the fisheryâs potential yield</li>
      <li>review the fisheryâs potential impacts on dependent and related species</li>
      <li>allow the Scientific Committee to formulate and provide advice to the Commission on appropriate harvest catch levels, as well as effort levels and fishing gear, where appropriate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Established fishery</h3>
<p>An established fishery (also known as directed fishery for a single species) is one where there is an appropriate time series of data, which enables a comprehensive stock assessment. Decision rules are applied to each established fishery separately to set catch limits.</p>

<p>Established toothfish and icefish fisheries are currently located only within areas of national jurisdiction, where different management approaches and regulations may apply. An established krill fishery is located in the Atlantic sector of the Convention Area.</p>

<h3>Closed fishery</h3>
<p>A closed fishery is one where directed fishing on a target species is prohibited. These fisheries are listed in Conservation Measure 32-02/A and are closed due to insufficient information for the stocks to be assessed, or due to concerns about the impacts from historical illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities.</p>

<p>A separate measure for the prohibition of directed fishing was established for Subarea 48.5 (Weddell Sea) (Conservation Measure 32-09).</p>

<h4>Lapsed fishery</h4>
<p>A lapsed fishery is one where fishing operations have ceased due to commercial considerations and assessments are no longer current. There are currently no fisheries classified as lapsed.</p>

<h3>Research fishing</h3>
<p>Research fishing is where a CCAMLR Contracting Party  plans to use any type of vessel or vessels to conduct fishing for research purposes, described in Conservation Measure 24-01, however this activity is regulated separately under the Antarctic Act 1994 (as amended), for which guidance is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visits-to-antarctica-how-to-apply-for-a-permit">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visits-to-antarctica-how-to-apply-for-a-permit</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Process for applying to fish in the Convention Area</h2>

<p>The UK is wholly committed to the conservation of fish stocks and other Antarctic marine living resources in line with the objective of the Convention set out in Article II. The UK recognises the principle of rational use, also set out in Article II of the Convention, and the potential benefits of maintaining a sustainable fishery in the Southern Ocean.</p>

<p>The UK will carefully consider applications from companies operating British registered vessels seeking to obtain access to CCAMLR fisheries, to ensure they would meet all relevant Conservation Measures and the rigorous environmental, safety and management standards required by the UK. These are set out in Sections 6 and 7.</p>

<p>The UK (through the FCDO authorisation system) reserves the right to limit British vessel capacity in CCAMLR fisheries.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> New and Exploratory fisheries</h3>

<p>CCAMLR has adopted the following Conservation Measures, which require Contracting Parties to notify the Commission of any intentions to participate in new and exploratory CCAMLR fisheries. The deadline for notifications to CCAMLR for intent to fish during the following season (2021/22) is set out in Table 1 below:</p>

<p><strong>Table 1 - Notification timetable for New and Exploratory Fisheries</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <td>Notification that Contracting Parties are considering participating in an exploratory fishery</td>
      <td>1 June 2022</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In order to meet these deadlines the FCDO must receive all relevant information set out in Sections 6 and 7 or confirmation from the UKSIA or relevant fisheries administration(s) that vessels will meet requirements set out in Sections 6 and 7 (Annex 2 checklist) by 12 May 2022 for consideration. Failure to meet this deadline may result in the FCDO withholding support for the vessel. CCAMLR will not consider any applications submitted after 1 June.</p>
</div>

<p>Each year CCAMLR considers notifications from nominated vessel(s) from Contracting Parties. If approved, vessel(s) flagged to Contracting Parties will have access to fish within the total allowable catch (TAC) set for a particular area. There are no individual vessel or Contracting Party catch limits, instead this competitive allowable catch (Olympic quota) is managed through Small Scale Research Units (SSRUs) and catch limits set for each SSRU. The CCAMLR Secretariat will close the fishery once the catch limit is taken or any bycatch limit for that area is reached.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the FCDO to submit notifications required under these Conservation Measures on behalf of fishing vessel operators registered anywhere in the UK, the British Overseas Territories, or Crown Dependencies. The FCDO will consider each operatorâs application on a case-by-case basis.  The FCDO will only notify CCAMLR of the vesselâs intended activities when it is satisfied the fishing vessel operator has met, or is able to meet, the relevant requirements in full. These are set out in Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 below.</p>

<p>Access to CCAMLR exploratory fisheries requires all vessels/operators to develop and implement research plans that will support the development of robust stock assessments for target species, and mitigation of the impacts of fishing on bycatch species, habitats or other components of the ecosystem. It is the responsibility of the operator, owner and/or charterer to develop these plans.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Established fisheries</h3>

<p>There are no requirements for Contracting Parties to notify the Commission of its intentions to participate in established finfish fisheries. All established toothfish fisheries are currently within areas of national jurisdiction within the Convention Area. These fisheries are managed by quota, meaning the catch of this fish by commercial fishers is restricted by weight.</p>

<p>For the established krill fisheries, notifications are required which is covered in Section 3.3 below.</p>

<p>The relevant fishing licence(s) should be sought from the UKSIA or relevant fisheries administration(s) and secure access to the area of national jurisdiction (via an addition licence) in which they intent to fish, before seeking to obtain written agreement of the FCDO prior to the start of fishing operations. The CCAMLR established fishing seasons are set out in Table 2 below.</p>

<p>The FCDO will only inform CCAMLR of the vessels licensed to participate in an established fishery once it is satisfied the fishing vessel operator has met, or is able to meet, the relevant requirements in full. The detailed application process can be found in Section 4 below.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In order to meet this deadline the FCDO must receive all relevant information set out in Sections 6 and 7 or confirmation from the UKSIA or relevant fisheries administrations that vessels will meet requirements set out in Sections 6 and 7 (Annex 2 checklist) by 12 May 2022 for consideration. Failure to meet this deadline may result in the FCDO withholding support for the vessel. CCAMLR will not consider any applications submitted after 1 June.</p>
</div>

<p>It is the responsibility of the FCDO to submit notifications required under this Conservation Measure on behalf of fishing vessel operators registered in the UK, the British Overseas Territories, or Crown Dependencies. The FCDO will consider each operatorâs application on a case-by-case basis.  The FCDO will only notify CCAMLR of the vesselâs intended activities when it is satisfied the fishing vessel operator has met, or is able to meet, the relevant requirements in full. These are set out in Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Timeline for submitting notifications to access CCAMLR fisheries</h2>

<p>Operators  of British registered vessels wanting to fish for profit in a CCAMLR fishery will first need to obtain (or have confirmation for future issue of) the appropriate licence(s) from the UKSIA or relevant fisheries administration to fish in the Convention Area and be able to demonstrate full compliance with the requirements set out in this document.</p>

<p>The UKSIA or relevant fisheries administration will then confirm in writing to the FCDO, that it is satisfied the operator has met, or is able to meet, the conditions in full as set out in this document, within the timeframe set out in Table 4.</p>

<p>Where notifications of intent to participate in a particular CCAMLR fishery are required to be submitted by the FCDO, the UKSIA or the relevant fisheries administration, must ensure the appropriate paperwork is submitted to the FCDO, in accordance with the deadlines set out in Table 4.</p>

<p>Where the UKSIA or relevant fisheries administration has submitted information on behalf of operators, the FCDO reserves the right to request copies of the documentation referred to in Sections 6 and 7 of this document.</p>

<p>Failure to submit the necessary information within the timeframes set out in this document and/or assurances to meeting CCAMLR requirements will result in the fisheries application being rejected by CCAMLR for that season. Failure to obtain written agreement from the FCDO to access CCAMLR resources before entering the Convention Area is an offence under Regulation 8 of the CCAMLR Regulations 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Table 4 - Applicable deadlines for the submission of documentation to the UKSIA or relevant fisheries administrations, their subsequent confirmation and the FCDO response for operators wishing to fish during the 2021/22 season or to notify to fish during the subsequent 2022/23 season</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Application format for new and exploratory fisheries</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Expression of Interest</h3>
<p>Throughout the year, expressions of interest in the new and exploratory fisheries can be registered with the UKSIA or relevant fisheries administrations. Expressions of interest should include a brief description of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the area of the proposed fishery</li>
  <li>an indication of the species to be targeted</li>
  <li>the proposed fishing method(s)</li>
  <li>fisheries operation plan including impacts on any vulnerable marine ecosystems</li>
  <li>vessel details and applicantâs details and</li>
  <li>fisheries experience including, but not limited to, type of fishing licence currently held and suitability of the vessel to operate in high latitudes</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Proposal</h3>

<p>Operators who have submitted an expression of interest for the forthcoming season and wishing to apply for access to the new and exploratory fisheries are required to submit full proposals to the UKSIA or relevant fisheries administration by 12 April 2022. Information required for proposals is covered in Sections 6 and 7.</p>

<p>The UKSIA or relevant fisheries administration will assess proposals and the likelihood of issuing a fishing licence for the proposed vessel wishing to access the Convention Area. If proposals meet the requirements, the UKSIA or fisheries administration will submit all relevant documentation to the FCDO by 12 May 2022, who will consider the application against CCAMLR and UK objectives and determine whether to proceed.</p>

<p>The FCDO will submit agreed notifications to the CCAMLR Secretariat in the required CCAMLR format no later than 1 June 2022 for consideration by the Working Groups. Operators will need to submit notification payments by 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>CCAMLR WG-SAM will meet during July to consider the new and exploratory fisheries proposals. If WG-SAM considers the proposal needs to be improved, the operator (via the FCDO) will be asked to provide further information.</p>

<p>In October CCAMLR WG-FSA and SC-CAMLR will meet to review new and exploratory fisheries proposals from CCAMLR Contracting Parties and to provide scientific advice to CCAMLR. WG-FSA and SC-CAMLR recommend to the Commission whether, and under what scientific conditions, fishing proposals should be allowed to proceed.</p>

<p>The Commission will consider this advice when taking its decisions and the development of Conservation Measures to govern these fisheries. All decisions are by consensus, therefore agreement to support a fishing notification by the UKSIA, relevant fisheries administrations and FCDO does not automatically guarantee access to CCAMLR fisheries.</p>

<p>The FCDO will write to the UKSIA, relevant fisheries authorities and/or operators in early November to advise them of CCAMLRâs consideration of the notifications and provide authorisation to operate in the Convention Area as appropriate.</p>

<p>The UKSIA or relevant fisheries administrations will need to provide the fishing licence and information necessary under Conservation Measure 10-02 (Annex 3) to the FCDO no later than 5 days from the licence being issued and before any fishing activity takes place.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Failure to provide the relevant information within the timeframes set out here will result in the proposal being rejected for that season.</p>

<span class="number">7.3 </span> Exceptions</h3>

<p>In the event that on the date on which the notification to access new or exploratory fisheries is submitted the vessel does not comply with any of conditions set out above, it shall be sufficient for the applicant, having identified which condition or conditions the vessel does not comply with, to give an undertaking in writing to the FDCO that the vessel will comply with that condition or those conditions by the time the vessel enters the Convention Area.</p>

<p>Vessels operating within the Convention Area are liable to inspection in accordance with the CCAMLR System of Inspection. The onus however is on the operator to provide sufficient evidence to the FCDO, prior to entering the Convention Area, that all conditions have been met. Failure to provide such evidence could potentially result in compliance action being undertaken and/or the FCDO withholding support for future notifications.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, there may be a good reason and justification why the operator or the vessel itself is unable to meet one of the conditions set out above. The FCDO is willing to consider the merits of these circumstances on a case-by-case basis subsequent to the reasons being set out in writing.</p>

<p>Agreement to specific arrangements will only be done on an exceptional basis, but will not include exemption from any provision which is mandatory within a Conservation Measure.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Reporting requirements in CCAMLR Fisheries</h2>

<p>Where a Conservation Measure requires a vessel to communicate or report information relating to the fishing activities being undertaken at the time to the CCAMLR Secretariat, every effort should be made to ensure the information is submitted accurately, precisely and without delay (this includes VMS positions, transhipment notifications and catch reporting).</p>

<p>Subject to the approval of the UKSIA or relevant fisheries administration, communications should be undertaken directly with the Secretariat and copied to them. The UKSIA or relevant fisheries administration will then decide whether any of the information submitted should be reported to the FCDO.</p>

<p>CCAMLR uses a catch documentation scheme (CDS) for toothfish species to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing</li>
  <li>ensure the sustainability of the toothfish fishery in the Convention Area</li>
  <li>ensure fishing vessels (flagged to CCAMLR Contracting Party) in the Convention Area comply with Conservation Measures</li>
</ul>

<p>This scheme allows CCAMLR to track catch, movement and trade of fish from the Convention Area and monitor the toothfish fishery. UK operators fishing within the Convention Area are required to provide electronic reports of toothfish catch and effort to the CCAMLR Secretariat, UKSIA or relevant fisheries administrations.</p>

<p>Failure to submit information in the relevant timeframes may lead to enforcement action and withdrawal of support to access CCAMLR fisheries in the following season.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Schedule of Fees</h2>

<p>CCAMLR has adopted a cost recovery scheme for exploratory fisheries. Fishery notifications are subject to a notification fee that applies on the basis of a single submission by an individual Contracting Party for a vessel in respect of a single season for a single species or species group that is subject to an individual Conservation Measure.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">2021/22 fishing season - notification fees payable by fishing operators</th>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Notification fee for each vessel in each exploratory âDissostichus sppâ fishery</td>
      <td>A$5,800</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Notification fee for each vessel participating in Area 48 âEuphausia superbaâ fishery</td>
      <td>A$22,240</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup></p>

<p>Failure by the operator to pay the fees in the required timeframe will result in the withdrawal of the vessel notification for that season. The FCDO, UKSIA or relevant fisheries administration will not have the ability to support fisheries notifications if CCAMLR deadlines are missed.</p>

<p>Should the fishery or vessel notification not be approved at the Commission meeting, then the notification fees are fully refunded.</p>

<p>Operators may also be liable for fees associated with licence applications and assessment or development of CCAMLR required documentation for example the Fisheries Operation Plan under Conservation Measure 21-02. The UKSIA or relevant fisheries authority should be contacted to verify licence cost recovery fees.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Proposal limitations</h2>

<p>Operators should note that the FCDO does not guarantee that a proposal will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be submitted by the UK to CCAMLR if the relevant information is not provided or if there is concern that operators/vessels will not meet CCAMLR or UK requirements</li>
  <li>result in a fishery being established or that it would be commercially viable</li>
  <li>mean that there would be access to CCAMLR resources in the long-term or</li>
  <li>mean that there will be sole access granted â access may also be granted to other UK operators and/or other Contracting Parties</li>
</ul>

<p>At any stage, an application can be rejected and no fishing permitted. This includes withdrawing a notification during the annual Commission meeting depending on matters raised during the course of that meeting.</p>

<p>If at any time during the Commission meeting Contracting Parties have to restrict effort within the Convention Area, the FCDO will support the applications/proposals that have rated highest under the CCAMLR and UK requirements.</p>
