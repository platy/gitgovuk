<p>The British Consulate-General in Madrid provides assistance to British nationals in the autonomous communities of Madrid, Galicia, Principado de Asturias, Cantabria, País Vasco, Navarra, Rioja, Castilla Leon, Castilla de la Mancha (not Albacete) and Extremadura.</p>

<p>If you’ve been sexually assaulted it’s important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>The following information is provided to help British nationals overseas make decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention</li>
  <li>report to local police</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number in Spain which is 112. There are English-speaking staff.</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one.</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-madrid">British Consulate-General in Madrid</a> on +34 91 714 64 03. Consular staff will be empathetic, non-judgemental and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell us will be treated in the strictest confidence. Consular staff can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police</h2>

<h3>Before reporting the incident</h3>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator and you contact the British Consulate-General in Madrid, we will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7.</p>

<p>You can approach the police directly either by the emergency telephone number 112, or in person at a police station. You can also ask the police to inform the British Consulate-General in Madrid (+34 91 714 6300), and we can give you consular support.</p>

<p>You do not have to report an assault to the Spanish police if you do not want to but it is usually better to report the crime whilst in Spain to make it easier for the Spanish police to act and for legal action to be taken against an alleged perpetrator.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence.</p>
</div>

<p>If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You should try to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</p>

<h3>Types of police in Spain</h3>

<p>In Spain, there are two different law enforcement forces that work at a national level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Spanish National Police (Cuerpo Nacional de Policía)</li>
  <li>the Civil Guard (Guardia Civil)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are also regional police forces such as the Ertzainta in the Basque Country and the Policía Foral in Navarre. Depending on where you are in Spain, you could be attended to by officers of anyone of these forces therefore in this information please take “police” to mean law enforcement officers or force in general unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>There is also the Policía Local (local police) and the Policía Municipal (municipal police) but they are not able to take police reports or investigate crimes. Therefore, if you try to report an incident with either of these police forces, you are likely to be referred to the nearest Policía Nacional or Guardia Civil police station.</p>

<p>The Spanish National Police have 173 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.policia.es/_es/idioma_en_policia.php" rel="external">UFAM Centres (Unidades de la Familia y la Mujer)</a> throughout Spain specialised in assisting rape and sexual assault victims.</p>

<p>The UFAM in the central Madrid area is located at:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Avenida Dr. Federico Rubio y Gali, No. 55, 
<br>28040 Madrid
<br>Tel. +34 91 322 35 55 and is contactable 24/7 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>If you go to another police station in central Madrid to make a report you will usually be taken to the Madrid UFAM centre. The Civil Guard also have specialised units called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.guardiacivil.es/documentos/pdfs/2017/Direcciones_EMUMEs.pdf" rel="external">EMUME (Equipo Mujer-Menor)</a> which provide assistance to female victims and minors.</p>

<h3>Making a statement</h3>

<p>If you do decide to report the incident, the police will interview you. You can request to speak to a female officer, if one is available. The police will find an interpreter for you if you do not speak Spanish - you may need to wait a while until one is available. The consulate does not offer interpreting or translation services but may be able to assist you in exceptional circumstances.If a consular officer is available, we can accompany you to the police station and help you to understand what is going on and what to expect next.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell the police if you think you have been drugged</li>
  <li>insist you get a police report, and ask the interpreter to translate it for you verbally before you sign</li>
</ul>

<p>Reporting the crime to the police doesn’t create any legal risks for you - extramarital sex, homosexuality or drinking alcohol are not considered criminal offences in Spain.</p>

<p>Some police stations may not have a quiet and/or private room. You may experience cultural and language differences when you report the incident. Spanish police officers will use technical language and it might seem that they lack empathy when taking your statement.</p>

<p>Initial questioning and investigations are carried out by the police but subsequent investigations are led by a judge at the local investigating court. Very few police officers speak English.</p>

<p>The types of questions that will be asked include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the identity of the alleged perpetrator</li>
  <li>a description, where and when the incident happened</li>
  <li>what happened and the circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
  <li>if there were any witnesses</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be asked to read your statement or the interpreter will read it to you to check the information is correct and then you will have to sign it.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>You will be given a copy of this police report (‘denuncia’ or ‘atestado’ in Spanish). Make sure you receive a copy.</p>
</div>

<p>Normally the report will be in Spanish. A copy of your statement will be sent immediately to the corresponding court on duty where a judge and prosecutor will examine the information you have provided.</p>

<p>You will also be provided with information on your rights as a victim of a violent and/or sexual crime (Victims of crime statute law 4/2015). This information and any forms should be available in English.</p>

<p>You do not have to surrender your passport whilst the investigation is carried out although you must keep your contact details up to date with the court so you can receive notifications.</p>

<p>You will not automatically be assigned a lawyer but you can appoint your own lawyer or apply for legal aid if you are eligible. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#Hiring-a-lawyer">Hiring a lawyer</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Legal-aid">Legal aid in Spain</a> for further details.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police</h2>

<p>The British Consulate-General in Madrid will still be able to help you. This includes helping you to contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.</p>

<p>You can find a list of:</p>

<ul>

</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spain-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">translators</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can also report the incident to them and ask them for assistance. If you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. If you wish, and depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime.  If you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated.</p>
</div>

<p>If you do not report the assault, you can still get medical attention.  However, hospitals have a legal obligation to report any suspected crime to the local authorities for investigation.  Depending on what you say or the nature of the injuries, the hospital may report the matter to the judicial authorities to investigate.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>The support available to you and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime.  In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country if you want it to be investigated and the police to obtain important evidence.</p>

<p>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police who should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened and offer you access to victim support in the UK. The process can take a long time and it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.The UK police should sent the information you provide to Spain. However, it is for the Spanish judicial authorities to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</p>

<p>UK police are less likely to have any forensic evidence or to be able to carry out a detailed investigation as evidence such as CCTV is normally only kept for a few weeks. If you file a report in the UK, by the time the report reaches Spain, the evidence may have been lost.</p>

<h2>Reporting the crime in the Madrid consular district: next steps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>insist you get a police report, and ask the interpreter to translate it for you verbally before you sign</li>
</ul>

<h3>Evidence</h3>

<p>The police will usually keep any clothes you were wearing and hand them to a forensic examiner to be used as evidence in court. You will not usually receive these back. They may also take you to the scene of the crime or where you think the alleged perpetrator may be located. You may also be asked to agree to have a mouth swab taken at the time you make your statement.</p>

<p>If you have not already received medical assistance and forensic tests before making your police statement, the police will usually take you to a public hospital which has the facilities to support rape and sexual assault victims.</p>

<p>You’ll be given medical assistance and a specialist forensic doctor will carry out forensic tests for use as evidence in court. This may involve a long wait at the hospital, especially if it is out of hours.</p>

<p>The police in Spain will not normally inform UK police or ask UK police to undertake police checks on the victim.</p>

<h3>The medical examination: what to expect</h3>

<p>You may receive medical assistance at other private/public hospitals/medical centres but if you wish to have forensic tests to be carried out and samples taken to be used as evidence in court, you will usually have to go to the designated public hospital.</p>

<p>Depending on where you are in Spain some public and private hospitals will not provide medical attention if they become aware that you are a victim of rape or sexual assault and they may ask you to go to the designated public hospital in the area instead.</p>

<p>Depending on what you say or the nature of the injuries, the hospital may report the matter to the police to investigate, regardless of your wishes.</p>

<p>The sooner the examination takes place, the more chance of collecting any important evidence that may be required. The examination will be carried out by a forensic doctor accompanied by the necessary medical staff including a gynaecologist for females and a urologist for males. It may include swabs, blood and urine tests. Consular staff can ask for a female doctor but can not guarantee that you will be seen by one. A report will be made listing any injuries. The police take the results and samples taken at your examination at the hospital plus the clothes you were wearing to the scientific police laboratory for forensic examination including establishing the DNA of the alleged perpetrator if possible.</p>

<p>Consular staff will accompany you to the hospital if possible, although the forensic doctor will decide if the consular officer is able to remain with you whilst the examination is taking place.</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>Hospital/medical staff can provide a prescription for Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (in Spanish La PEP: profilaxis posexposición) which is a treatment that can prevent HIV infection.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK.</p>
</div>

<p>If you intend to stay a while in Spain, the hospital will usually test you for HIV or sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<p>The results can take a while to come through and if you are staying in Spain, the hospital will arrange the appropriate follow up tests and treatment. Sometimes the results may be sent to an email address you provide.  If you are travelling straight back to the UK, you need to contact your GP straight away on your return.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception or “the morning after pill” (in Spanish la píldora postcoital) may be prescribed to you by the hospital. It can also be bought over the counter at a pharmacy without a prescription. In the latter case you will have to pay the full price for it. You may also be prescribed antibiotics.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</p>
</div>

<p>If the hospital prescribes you medication, you will not be able to collect this at the hospital, as they do not have their own pharmacies. You will have to go to your nearest pharmacy (farmacia) with your prescription (receta). There are 24-hour pharmacies in Spain and there should always be an emergency pharmacy open during the night and weekends on a rota system.  You’ll find the address of the nearest emergency pharmacist displayed in the windows of all pharmacies.</p>

<p>It is not possible to buy painkillers in supermarkets in Spain. You have to buy them from a pharmacy.</p>

<h3>Health cover in Spain</h3>

<p>If you are a visitor to Spain, treatment in a state/public hospital will be covered by your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/" rel="external">UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) or European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</a>. Contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-us/overseas-healthcare-services-contact-us" rel="external">NHS Business Service Authority</a> on +44 191 218 1999 if you don’t have your EHIC/GHIC card with you.</p>

<p>If you live in Spain, healthcare cover will be dependent on your social security cover (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-spain-including-the-balearic-and-canary-islands">Healthcare in Spain</a> for more information).</p>

<p>If you attend hospital accompanied by the police and undergo a forensic examination, you will not be charged for this, regardless of whether or not you have healthcare cover.</p>

<h3>Medication</h3>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication and your medical reports, so that you can let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h2>Police investigations: what to expect</h2>

<p>Once you have made a statement and undergone a medical examination, this information will be sent by the police to the investigating court on duty (Juzgado de Instrucción de Guardia).</p>

<p>You will then be asked to go to the court to reconfirm (ratify) your statement before a judge and prosecutor. At the time of ratifying your statement in court, you will again be provided with information on your rights and in particular the right to appoint a lawyer to represent you or to have a state-appointed lawyer (means tested)appointed for you instead. You will also be informed of the right to apply for financial aid to help cover costs such as treatment for psychological and physical injuries.</p>

<p>If you are leaving Spain in the next few days, you may be asked to go to court immediately (or the next morning) after making your statement to the police. Whilst at the court you can enquire whether it is possible to make a recording of your statement (in Spanish, prueba preconstituida). The recording could be used in any future court hearings instead of you returning to Spain to appear in person at the court. If you intend to stay in Spain, you may be asked to reconfirm your report at a later date. If you have appointed a lawyer, your lawyer can be present at this stage and can have access to the case notes.</p>

<p>You will be provided with an interpreter and given information on your rights according to the Victims of Crime Statute Law 4/2015 (Estatuto de la Víctima del Delito).</p>

<p>You will not be expected to meet, coincide or speak to the alleged perpetrator at the court or at the police station.  We can help to request a separate waiting area for you to try to ensure you don’t coincide or speak to the alleged perpetrator’s family or friends.</p>

<p>During the investigation, the court may ask you to return to Spain to attend an ID parade or provide a further statement.</p>

<p>If the police make an arrest, the alleged perpetrator has to be taken before the court within 72 hours of being arrested. At this stage the judge and the prosecutor will decide whether to commit him to prison pending further investigation, release him provisionally with or without bail pending further investigation, or release him without charges. During the investigation phase of the proceedings, and if the alleged perpetrator is not remanded to prison, certain provisional measures could be applied for such as a restraining order.</p>

<p>You will normally be allowed to leave the country during the initial investigation stage although the judge will try to arrange for you to ratify your statement before you leave. You will normally be asked to return to Spain for the trial although you can also request to do this by videolink.</p>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>The investigation stage is led by the judge at the investigating court (Juzgado de Instrucción). The police pass any information to the investigating court so all requests for updates have to be directed to the court.</p>

<p>If you wish a member of consular staff to accompany you to the court, we will do so although the judge would need to grant us permission to be present when you ratify your statement. A legal representative (private lawyer or legal aid lawyer) can accompany you throughout the case.</p>

<p>If you decide to drop the charges, the prosecutor may decide to continue with the case if it is in the Public Interest to do so. For example, if the alleged perpetrator is being prosecuted for a series of crimes against others, in addition to your case, it may be in the public interest for the person to be prosecuted.</p>

<p>Making a false statement is considered a criminal offence in Spain. If the police gather evidence to indicate that the allegations are false, the alleged perpetrator can press counter charges against the victim claiming false accusations.</p>

<p>The court can order the alleged perpetrator to pay you compensation.</p>

<h2>Trial</h2>

<p>Once you have made the initial police report, the court will inform you of any next steps you have to take, such as ratifying your statement or giving evidence in a trial. You do not have to file any additional report with the court unless you want to.</p>

<p>The investigating judge will decide if there is enough evidence for the case to be taken to trial. If you have a lawyer, your lawyer can also help you prepare a private case against the alleged perpetrator if you are not happy with the court investigation.</p>

<p>The sooner you report the assault, the easier it is for the police to gather vital evidence such as forensic evidence and CCTV footage.</p>

<p>Under Spanish law, crimes can no longer be prosecuted after a certain period of time has passed. This varies from five to twenty years from the date of the alleged offence, depending on its nature.</p>

<h3>Trial procedures</h3>

<p>Spanish judicial procedures can be lengthy especially if the alleged perpetrator is not immediately identifiable and/or arrested soon after the assault. At the end of the investigation phase when all necessary reports and statements have been completed the investigating judge and the state prosecutor will decide whether there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial. In which case, the case will be passed to a trial court and will be presided over by three judges and the state prosecutor. You will be notified by the Spanish authorities of the trial date and if you are in the UK, you may be notified via the UK authorities.</p>

<p>The trial will be conducted in Spanish and you will be provided with an interpreter when you are asked questions about your statement. Your private or state-appointed lawyer should accompany you. Please note that there is usually no simultaneous interpreting of the whole of the court proceedings.</p>

<p>Cases can take years to come to trial. If you haven’t heard anything from the court for some time, this does not necessarily mean that the case has been filed. The length of the trial itself can also vary depending on the complexity of the circumstances.</p>

<p>Once your case is in the trial court, the trial will usually take place in the presence of three judges who will have had access to all the information beforehand. This may mean that you are not questioned on every aspect of your statement. The length of the trial itself can also vary depending on the complexity of the circumstances but can be as little as a day or a few hours.</p>

<p>You will only have to be present when you give evidence. If you request it beforehand, most courts will be able to provide a screen for the alleged perpetrator to sit behind whilst you give your evidence. Consular staff consulate can help you to make this request.</p>

<p>You will not receive notification of the verdict straight away; you will be notified in writing at a later date.</p>

<p>If convicted, the perpetrator has the right to appeal against the length of the sentence which can take months to be resolved.</p>

<p>If you attend the trial in person, you can ask for the forms to apply for your travel costs to be reimbursed.  Therefore, you need to keep receipts of costs incurred. Feedback indicates that it can take many months for payment to come through and that not all costs are covered as there is a cap on certain costs such as accommodation.</p>

<h3>Hiring a lawyer</h3>

<p>As a victim, you do not need a legal representative but if your case is filed or no further action is taken by the court, you may wish to appoint a lawyer to argue your case. This can be done from the UK but you would need to instruct a local Spanish lawyer to act.</p>

<p>A private lawyer will represent your interests before the court and is able to present a private prosecution in parallel to the state prosecution. They will have access to the pre-trial information held by the court including the statements provided by the alleged perpetrator. If you instruct an English-speaking private lawyer, the lawyer will inform you in English about the progress of the investigation and court proceedings.</p>

<p>For a list of private English-speaking lawyers, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spain-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers-in-madrid">list of lawyers for Madrid Consular District</a> and look for those specialised in criminal law.</p>

<h3>Updates about your case</h3>

<p>By law you are entitled to be kept informed by the court on the progress of your case. However, it can sometimes be difficult to obtain information and in practice you may not always receive regular news about the progress of your case.</p>

<p>Most courts have a victim of crime support office (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Support-organisation">Support organisations in the Madrid consular district</a> for further information). If you contact this office before you leave Spain, they should be able to obtain updates on your behalf.  You can also authorise the British consulate to have access to information on your case so we can try to update you, although it can sometimes be very difficult to obtain information as we do not have access to case files. If you apply for a legal aid lawyer or appoint a private lawyer, this person will be able to obtain updates for you and provide you with more detailed information about the case.</p>

<p>When you attend court to ratify your statement, you will be asked whether you want to provide contact details in the UK or Spain including an email address.  It is essential that you keep the court informed of your up-to-date contact details if you decide to leave Spain.</p>

<h3>Legal aid</h3>

<p>Access to legal aid is means-tested in Spain and depends on your income. The exception to this is minors (in Spain this is anyone under 18 years old) who are automatically entitled to legal aid. Legal aid lawyers are not obliged to speak the language of the person they are representing. You can find further information on how to access free legal assistance from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mjusticia.gob.es/en/ciudadanos/tramites/asistencia-juridica-gratuita" rel="external">Ministry of Justice</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legal-aid-in-spain">Legal aid in Spain</a>.</p>

<p>You can also apply for a state-appointed lawyer via the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://web.icam.es/page/5/Atenci%C3%B3n_al_Ciudadano" rel="external">Madrid Law Society</a> or if you are not in Madrid via the Law Society in the City where you are, or by submitting a letter to the court. A commission will assess your application.</p>

<p>It is important to maintain your contact details up-to-date when applying for a state-appointed lawyer, as they will periodically contact you for you to provide them with certain documents in support of your application.  Some NGOs or local government funded organisations may provide free legal representation such as CIMASCAM in Madrid. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#Support-organisation">Support organisations in the Madrid consular district</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Sentencing</h3>

<p>Sex offences are generally punishable with a prison sentence and its duration will depend on the classification of the offence (sexual abuse, rape).</p>

<p>If the alleged perpetrator is found not guilty, there will be no criminal responsibility. However, during the investigation phase of the proceedings, and if the alleged perpetrator is not remanded to prison, certain provisional measures could be applied for such as a restraining order.</p>

<h3>Compensation</h3>

<p>The alleged perpetrator may be ordered to pay you compensation once he has been convicted and the sentence is irrevocable i.e. with no right of appeal. The amount will be published in the sentence. Compensation or an award for damages ordered by the court is separate from your right to apply for state-funded financial aid to cover costs as mentioned above. However, state-funded financial aid and amounts awarded as compensation or damages are offset between the Spanish authorities involved.</p>

<h2>When you return home to the UK</h2>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually-transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you. You should do this even if you have been tested in the country that the assault took place in.</p>
