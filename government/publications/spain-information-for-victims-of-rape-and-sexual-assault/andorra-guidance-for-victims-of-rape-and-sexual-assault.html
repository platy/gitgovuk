<p>The British Consulate in Barcelona provides assistance to British nationals in Andorra.</p>

<p>If you’ve been sexually assaulted it’s important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make informed decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention</li>
  <li>report to local police</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the emergency number in Andorra which is 112. If you contact the 112 number you can receive around the clock immediate assistance from any of the emergency services in Andorra and they have English-speaking staff</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-barcelona">British Consulate in Barcelona</a>. Consular staff will be empathetic, and non-judgemental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. Consular staff can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Andorra</h2>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator and you contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-barcelona">British Consulate in Barcelona</a> we will try to send a consular officer to support you.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence is not destroyed. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence.</p>
</div>

<p>If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You should try to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</p>

<p>You can approach the police directly either by the emergency telephone number 110, or in person at a police station, you can also ask them to inform the British Consulate in Barcelona (+34 933 666 200) which will enable us to provide you with consular support.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police</h2>

<p>The British consulate will still be able to help you. This includes helping you to make arrangements to contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.</p>

<p>You can find a list of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>English-speaking <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spain-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">medical facilities</a>

</li>

<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spain-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">translators</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can report the incident to your representative and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital/medical centre. Otherwise depending on your circumstances consular staff may be able to do so depending on availability.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police who should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened and offer you access to victim support in the UK. The process can take a long time and it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</p>

<p>Andorran police are less likely to have any forensic evidence or to be able to carry out a detailed investigation as evidence such as CCTV is normally only kept for a few weeks. We are also aware that the transfer of a crime report from the UK to Andorra can take a considerable length of time, which again can affect the Andorran police/court’s ability to take action. If you file a report in the UK, by the time the report reaches Andorra, the evidence may have been lost.</p>

<p>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK after rape or sexual assault abroad</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>The medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<p>If a member of consular staff is available, they will be able to accompany you to the hospital if you so wish. Some hospital staff may speak English, but the majority will speak only Catalan. We are able to help you understand what is going on if we are able to accompany you.</p>

<p>If you have not already received medical assistance and forensic tests prior to making your police report, the police will usually take you to the designated public hospital (there is only one hospital in Andorra – see below) in the area for rape and sexual assault victims for medical assistance and where forensic tests for use as evidence in court will be carried out. A forensic doctor will be called out to attend to you and this may involve a long wait at the hospital, especially if it is out of hours.</p>

<p>The sooner the examination takes place, the more chance of collecting any important evidence that may be required.  The examination will be carried out by a forensic doctor or a nurse and a gynaecologist and may include swabs, blood and urine tests. A report will be made listing any injuries. The results and samples taken at your examination at the hospital plus the clothes you were wearing are taken by the police to the scientific police laboratory for forensic examination including establishing the DNA of the assailant if possible.</p>

<p>The hospital will request you for your insurance details.</p>

<p>Hospital Nuestra Señora de Meritxell

</div>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>Hospital/medical staff do not always provide a prescription for Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (in Catalan La PEP: profilaxis posexposició) which is a treatment that can prevent HIV infection.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. If you are going back to the UK the NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28-day treatment on your return.</p>
</div>

<p>If you intend to stay a while in Andorra, the hospital will usually test you for HIV or sexually transmitted diseases.  The results can take a while to come through and if you are staying in Andorra, the hospital will arrange the appropriate follow up tests and treatment. If you are travelling straight back to the UK, you need to contact your GP straight away on your return.  The results may be sent to an email address you provide.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception or “the morning after pill” (in Catalan la píldora postcoital) may be prescribed to you by the hospital.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</p>
</div>

<p>You may also be prescribed antibiotics. If you are prescribed medication, you will not be able to collect this at the hospital as they do not have their own pharmacies.  You will have to go to your nearest pharmacy (“farmacia” in Catalan) with your prescription (“recepta” in Catalan).  Please note it is not possible to buy painkillers such as paracetamol in supermarkets in Andorra.  You have to buy them from the pharmacy but you do not need a prescription.</p>

<h3>Health cover in Andorra</h3>

<p>The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is not valid in Andorra. Check with your insurance whether they will cover the costs of medication and/or treatment.</p>

<h3>Medication</h3>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication and your medical reports, so that you can let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h2>Police investigation: what to expect</h2>

<p>Once you have made a statement and undergone a medical examination, this information will be sent by the police to the investigating court on duty (Jutjat d’  Instrucció). You will then probably be asked to go to the court to reconfirm or ratify your statement before a Judge and Prosecutor.  If you are leaving Andorra in the next few days you may be asked to go to court immediately (or the next morning) after making your report to the police. You will be provided with an interpreter.</p>

<p>During the investigation, you could be asked by the court to return to Andorra to attend an ID parade or provide a further statement.</p>

<p>If the police make an arrest, the suspect has to be taken before the court within 72 hours of being arrested.  At this stage the Judge and the Prosecutor will decide whether to commit the assailant to prison pending further investigation, release the assailant provisionally with or without bail pending further investigation, or release the assailant without charges. You may be asked to then ratify your statement and be provided with information on your rights and in particular the right to appoint a lawyer to represent you.</p>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>The investigation stage is led by the investigating court, the “Jutjat de Instrucció”.  The police pass any information to the investigating court and therefore, all requests for updates have to be directed to the court.</p>

<p>If you wish a member of consular staff to accompany you to the court, we will do so although we would only be able to be present when you ratify your statement if the judge allows it.  If you have requested a legal aid lawyer or have a private lawyer with you, this person would be allowed to accompany you at all times.</p>

<p>Sometimes the British Consulate is able to obtain updates for you, although we do not have access to case files.  If you appoint a private lawyer, this person will be able to obtain updates for you and provide you with more detailed information about the case. You are also entitled to be kept informed by the court on the progress of your case.  When you attend court to reconfirm your statement, you will be asked whether you want to provide contact details in the UK or Andorra including an email address. It is essential that you keep the court informed of your address in the UK if you decide to leave Andorra. You can also authorise the British consulate to have access to information on your case so we can try to update you but please note it can be sometimes very difficult to obtain information. If you apply for a state-appointed lawyer or appoint a private lawyer, this person will be able to obtain updates for you from the court.</p>

<p>If you decide to drop the charges, the prosecutor may decide to continue with the case if it is in the Public Interest to do so.  For example, if the suspect is being prosecuted for a series of crimes against others, in addition to your case, it may be in the public interest for the person to be prosecuted.</p>

<p>The alleged assailant can press counter charges claiming false accusations.</p>

<h3>Trial procedures</h3>

<p>Andorran judicial procedures can be lengthy, especially if your assailant is not immediately identifiable and/or arrested soon after the assault.</p>

<p>An investigating judge in charge of leading the investigation into the assault. At the end of the investigation phase when all necessary reports and statements have been completed the judge in charge of the investigation and the state prosecutor will decide whether there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial. In which case, the case will be passed to a trial court and will be presided over by three judges and the state prosecutor.</p>

<p>You will be notified by the Andorran authorities of the trial date and if you are in the UK, you will be notified via the UK authorities.  The trial will be conducted in Catalan and you will be provided with an interpreter when you are asked questions about your statement. You should also be accompanied by your lawyer, private or state-appointed. Please note that there is usually no simultaneous interpreting of the whole of the court proceedings.</p>

<p>Cases, on the basis of the judicial inquiry and the facts, can take years to come to trial -  the Andorran court system is very slow.  If you haven’t heard anything from the court for some time, this does not necessarily mean that the case has been filed.  The length of the trial itself can also vary depending on the complexity of the circumstances.</p>

<p>The trial is held in front of a three judges who have access to all the information beforehand. This may mean that you are not questioned on every aspect of your statement. The length of the trial depends on the complexity of the case but can be as little as a day or a few hours.</p>

<p>You will only have to be present when you give evidence. If you request it beforehand, most courts will be able to provide a screen for the assailant to sit behind whilst you give your evidence. The British Consulate can help you to make this request.</p>

<p>You will not receive notification of the verdict straight away; rather you will be notified in writing at a later date (normally two months after the end of the trial).</p>

<p>If convicted the assailant has right of appeal against the length of the sentence which can take months to be resolved.</p>

<p>The offender may be ordered to pay you compensation once he has been convicted and the sentence is irrevocable i.e. with no right of appeal. The amount will be stated in the sentence. Compensation or an award for damages ordered by the Court is separate from your right to apply for state-funded financial aid to cover costs as mentioned above.  However, state-funded financial aid and amounts awarded as compensation or damages are offset between the Andorran authorities involved.</p>

<p>If you attend a trial in person, you can ask for the forms to apply for your travel costs to be reimbursed.  Feedback indicates that it can take many months for payment to come through and that not all costs are covered as there is a cap on certain costs such as accommodation.</p>

<h3>Sentencing</h3>

<p>Sentences in Andorra are ruled by the principle of rehabilitation. Prisoners are encouraged to join voluntary rehabilitation programmes in prison which entail certain prisoner privileges.</p>

<p>Sex offences are generally punishable with a prison sentence and its duration will depend on the classification of the offence e.g. sexual abuse or rape.</p>

<p>If the alleged perpetrator is found not guilty, there will be no criminal responsibility. However, during the investigation phase of the proceedings, and if the alleged perpetrator is not remanded to prison, certain provisional measures could be applied for such as a restraining order.</p>

<h3>Hiring a lawyer</h3>

<p>A private lawyer will represent your interests before the court and is able to present a private prosecution in parallel to the state prosecution. A lawyer should be able to access the pre-trial information held by the court including the statements provided by the defendant.  If you instruct an English-speaking private lawyer, you will be informed in English about the progress of the investigation and court proceedings. For a list of private English-speaking lawyers please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spain-list-of-lawyers">List of lawyers for Catalonia, Aragon and Andorra</a> and look for those specialised in criminal law.</p>
