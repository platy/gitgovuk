<h3>Foreword</h3>

<p>This Technical Standard here after known as ‘the Standard’ is published by Defence Infrastructure Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>) in its role as infrastructural technical authority for Mandatory application across all areas of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. This standard is mandated for all contracts including <abbr title="United States Visiting Forces">USVF</abbr>, overseas and <abbr title="Private Finance Initiative">PFI</abbr> arrangements and those where <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is not the delivery agent.</p>

<h3>Document Synopsis</h3>

<p>The aim of this Technical Standard is to provide guidance and direction how to ensure fire safety requirements are consistently achieved where Defence agencies or personnel hold responsibility, or are involved in the required works, when changing <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> for use as <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> or Contact Housing.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Roles and Implementation</h2>

<p>1.1. <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> are the document owner and Technical Authority for this standard. Approval for any deviation or derogation from this standard are to be approved by the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Senior Fire Safety Manager prior to the commencement of any work or change of use.</p>

<p>1.2 The Fire and rescue service provider upon receipt of a request, are responsible for providing fire safety advice on the requirement for any <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> that is being considered for change of use to <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> or Contact Housing. The provision of a suitable and sufficient Fire Risk Assessments for the completed facility shall be arranged.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Application of the Technical Standard</h2>

<p>2.1 This Technical Standard applies to all conversion works where it is proposed to change <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> to use as <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> or Contact Housing on the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> estate. Dwellings with a simple layout of 2 floors only (Ground and First) and, where the stairs at ground floor level discharge into a hallway that leads directly to the final exit door, must incorporate the standard requirements detailed below.</p>

<p>2.2 Buildings in excess of 2-storey or where the staircase does not discharge into a hallway that leads directly to the final exit door must be approved by <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Accommodation and <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> <abbr title="Senior Fire Safety Manager">SFSM</abbr> before any changes take place as additional fire safety measures may need to be incorporated.</p>

<p>2.3 If additional works are proposed within the building these works may need to comply with the Building Regulations. For further assistance and guidance to ascertain if these work do require compliance please contact the Principal Building Surveyor, Building and Environmental Health Standards &lt;<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Ops North-PTSBLD@mod.gov.uk&gt;</p>

<p>2.4 These standards are necessary due to the additional risks encountered where there is no single head of household in a multiple occupancy building.</p>

<p>2.5 If it is directed that any <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> or Contact House is to be used as overspill for messing facilities the status of the premise has changed, and it is no longer classified as a Domestic Premise and therefore the Fire Standards contained in this <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Technical Standard shall be applied.</p>

<p>2.6 Where the proposed change of use cannot meet the Standard Requirements below, prior consultation must be carried out with the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Senior Fire Safety Manager and approved via the Fire Safety Determination process before implementation. <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DIO-TSFiresafety@mod.gov.uk"><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>-TSFiresafety@mod.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>2.7 It is imperative that units clearly stipulate and document the intended purpose and occupancy type of properties.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Standard Requirements</h2>

<p>3.1 When <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> is appropriated as <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> or Contact Housing, rooms that were not bedrooms as <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> will not be permitted to be changed to additional Bedrooms.</p>

<p>3.2 To avoid being subject to <abbr title="House of Multiple Occupation">HMO</abbr> legislative infrastructure adjustments any <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> to <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> change of use shall have a maximum occupancy of 2 persons.</p>

<p>3.3 Former bedrooms that are no longer to be used for sleeping may be used for other purposes excluding any form of cooking, if they are fitted with automatic fire detection in accordance with para 3.4 and doors are fitted with keep closed signage in accordance with BS 5499.</p>

<p>3.4 The building shall be provided with a minimum Grade F1 LD2 interlinked fire detection system in accordance with British Standard 5839 Part 6. This shall include detection in all rooms used for sleeping and within rooms on the same floor used for other purposes except bathrooms and toilets <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. These detectors will need to be periodically replaced in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions due to the integral main battery and a local detector replacement policy shall be agreed with the Maintenance Management Organisation <abbr title="Maintenance Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> in accordance with the manufacturers timelines.</p>

<p>3.5Where it is intended to accommodate personnel with any disability, a Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (<abbr title="Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan">PEEP</abbr>) shall be considered by the <abbr title="Head of Establishment">HOE</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.6 A suitable fire extinguisher for the assessed risks shall be provided close to the final exit from the hallway, but not in a position that blocks or reduces the width of the means of escape route. The type shall be determined and recorded by a competent fire risk assessor and the extinguisher shall be placed on the units register and maintained as required.</p>

<p>3.7 Any cooking facilities provided within the kitchen of an <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> shall be removed prior to occupation as <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>. Exceptionally the HoE may, following a suitable and sufficient risk assessment deem it appropriate for the cooker to be left in service. Where this is the case, the following additional requirements shall be put in place prior to occupation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>3.7.1 The kitchen shall be provided with a fire rated door set to FD30S standard where it leads onto the means of escape and circulation spaces and also fitted with a fire rated self-closing device and a <strong>fire door keep shut sign’</strong> on each face of the door.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.7.2 An appropriate heat detector shall be installed within the kitchen as part of the interlinked fire detection system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.7.3 The cooker and hob shall be wired into a timer that allows the cooker to run for a maximum of 6 minutes before needing to be reset (in line with <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> standards)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.7.4 A suitable fire blanket shall be fixed within the kitchen area, where easily accessible should a fire occur on the cooker or hob.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.7.5 A cooker hood shall be provided over the cooker that extracts direct to open air. The installation shall not include dampers or other elements that may cause a build-up of grease and/or fats that may increase the fire loading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.7.6 A <abbr title="Head of Establishment">HOE</abbr> policy notice shall be displayed within the property which states that the extraction system must be used when cooking takes place and a sign permanently affixed adjacent to the cooker stating that the extract system must be operational whenever the cooker or hob is in use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.7.7 A cleaning and inspection schedule shall be put in place to ensure that the system including ductwork is maintained in a clean and serviceable condition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.7.8 See sec 4 for contact house cooker requirements.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.8 All final exits shall be fitted with thumb turn locks, openable without the use of a key internally.</p>

<p>3.9 A suitable and sufficient risk assessment shall be undertaken and recorded assessing the need for Emergency Lighting for the building escape routes. In buildings of up to two storeys conventional lighting may be adequate. However, the emergency lighting risk assessment shall consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>3.9.1 The size of the building and length of escape routes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.9.2 The complexity of the internal layout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.9.3 The availability of natural or other lighting along escape routes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.9.4 The potential occupiers’ abilities, vulnerabilities or those posing specific risks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3.9.5 Further information on Emergency Lighting requirements is contained in Table C5 of the <abbr title="Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services">LACORS</abbr> document.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.10 All Electrical items supplied by <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> require routine Portable Appliance Testing (<abbr title="Portable Appliance Testing">PAT</abbr>) in accordance with local policy. All personal electrical items must be checked for serviceability and safety in accordance with JSP 375, Chapter 23, which requires a local policy <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> regarding testing and inspection by the authority to be in place. All electrical items, whether personal or Authority supplied shall be visually checked prior to and after each use by the user. Authority supplied equipment shall be checked after each occupation.</p>

<p>3.11 All furnishings shall meet current fire standards in accordance with Furniture and Furnishings (Fire) (Safety) Regulations 1988 and be appropriately labelled.</p>

<p>3.12 Carbon Monoxide detectors shall be installed in any rooms containing gas or solid fuel appliances.</p>

<p>3.13 Access to any basements or loft spaces shall be secured and locked with access restricted to authorised maintenance staff only.</p>

<p>3.14 Barbecues or other fuel burning appliances are not permitted on any balcony or flat roof areas.</p>

<p>3.15 No naked flames, i.e. candles, incense burners are to be used in the building.</p>

<p>3.16 Fire Action Posters shall be displayed at each entrance, exit into and out of the building.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Contact Housing</h2>

<p>4.1 Contact houses are scaled welfare facilities primarily to enable non-primary parents and unaccompanied Service personnel to spend time with their families at their duty station. They can also be used to provide emergency welfare accommodation for families. When a Contact House is used for its intended purpose it is deemed a Domestic Premise and as such a Fire Risk Assessment is not required. It is highly recommended that regular Community Fire Safety Visits are conducted to ensure Fire Safety measures are being met as occupants will be unfamiliar with the premises. Clear instructions on actions in the event of a fire must be provided by the unit as part of the works on a wall mounted fire action notice in the building.</p>

<p>4.2 It is acceptable to leave cooking facilities in Contact Housing, but suitable cleaning regimes and safety checks must be undertaken a person designated by a HoE to prevent any build-up of flammable fats and cooking waste after each use.</p>

<p>4.3 If Contact Housing is provided by means of flat accommodation that share common areas, the common areas are required to be covered by a Fire Risk Assessment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> System Maintenance</h2>

<p>5.1 Maintenance and cleaning programmes shall be put in place to ensure all systems provided remain fit for use in accordance with relevant British Standards and manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>5.2 All active fire safety systems are to be added to MMOs Facilities Management (<abbr title="Facilities Management">FM</abbr>) plan.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Fire Risk Assessment</h2>

<p>6.1 Once all works have been completed and prior to occupation of buildings that have changed use from <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> to <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>, a Fire Risk Assessment must be completed by the defence fire service provider for its <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> use and the requirements in this standard must be referenced to ensure compliance. The Fire Safety Inspection may be revisited by the fire risk assessor at any time during the buildings use as <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> to ensure on behalf of the HoE that the mandated safety requirements are being met. The HoE may also request a fire safety visit when deemed appropriate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Records and reviews</h2>

<p>7.1 All records and Reviews to be completed iaw <abbr title="Top Level Budget-holder">TLB</abbr> and units fire safety management system or equivalent.</p>

<p>7.2 The ongoing use of <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> as <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> or Contact House shall be subject to an annual review by the HoE, to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7.2.1 The requirements of this standard continue to be met.</li>
  <li>7.2.2 The risk assessments and other documented information supporting its continued use remain valid.</li>
  <li>7.2.3 The <abbr title="Head of Establishment">HOE</abbr> reaffirms their acceptance of the increased risks associated with retaining any cooking facilities in <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> to <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>7.3 A fire diary is to be held in the building and the weekly and annual inspection/tests of the alarm system are to be recorded in it by the occupier or <abbr title="Maintenance Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>.</p>
