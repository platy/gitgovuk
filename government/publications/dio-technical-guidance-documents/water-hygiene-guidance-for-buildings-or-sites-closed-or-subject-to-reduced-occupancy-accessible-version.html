<h2>Aim</h2>

<p>The aim of this bulletin is to highlight water hygiene considerations in buildings and on sites
where reduced occupancy has significantly decreased water consumption with the potential
to have a negative impact upon water hygiene (quality).</p>

<h2>Applicable to:</h2>

<p>All buildings and sites with reduced occupancy due to personnel working from home or
furloughed during the COVID-19 emergency measures. The following legislation, Standards
and ACoPs place a duty of care on the Employer to ensure a safe working environment for
employees and visitors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Health and Safety at Work etc Act</li>
  <li>Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations</li>
  <li>The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations</li>
  <li>Water Bylaws and Regulations</li>
  <li>Building Act 1984</li>
  <li>ACOP L8 The Control of Legionella Bacteria in Water Systems</li>
  <li>HSG 274 The Control of Legionella Bacteria in Hot and Cold-Water Systems.</li>
  <li>BS 8680 – 2020 - Water Quality – Water Safety plans – Code of Practice</li>
  <li>BS 8558 – 2015 – Guide to the design, installation, testing and maintenance of
services supplying water for domestic use within buildings and their curtilages –</li>
  <li>Complementary guidance to BS EN 806</li>
  <li>Legionella Control Association - A Code of Practice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Situation:</h2>

<p>Due to the COVID 19 situation some <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> buildings and sites have been closed and to
comply with Government guidance, the majority of staff have been requested to work from
home, leaving building use for essential attendance only; or as in the case of a number of
sites, empty.</p>

<p>Some Heads of Establishments (<abbr title="Head of Establishment">HoE</abbr>’s) may have directed staff to flush the partial and
unoccupied buildings / assets without adequate specification. While this activity is
constructive it may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk and may not have had the appropriate technical oversight from the Maintenance Management Organisation (<abbr title="Maintenance Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) and water
hygiene specialist as required by the references above. A structured process of flushing must
be instructed and agreed by the Maintenance Management Organisation Legionella
Responsible Person (<abbr title="Maintenance Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr>) prior to implementation.</p>

<p>Water service providers, including Aquatrine have a legal duty to provide our buildings with
potable water, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>/DIO have a duty of care to ensure all water delivered to occupants is
safe. Decreased or nil attendance reduces water consumption resulting in water in the piped
water system becoming more susceptible to bacterial growth which can cause illness. There
is therefore a need to evaluate the water hygiene implications of all changes of use or
occupation rates and to implement a management plan to minimise this risk.
Where conditions for Legionella bacteria growth exist such as partial occupation there is a
risk of proliferation and significantly elevated levels of Legionella bacteria have been detected
in a number of water systems on the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Estate already. There are a number of ways to
reduce the risk. For simple hot/cold water systems, these could be straightforward. The main
objectives should be to prevent stagnation and keep water temperatures outside of 20-50°C.
If possible, aim to ensure the turnover of any water stored in tanks every 24 hours and
movement of water through pipework and outlets at least once a week to prevent it from
becoming stagnant. If this cannot be achieved because the building is closed, or there is
significantly reduced use, the Legionella Responsible Person (<abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr>) must be notified. The
<abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> will have knowledge of the site and individual assets water systems, Legionella Risk
Assessments and Legionella Management Plans will be able to provide advice and guidance
on any additional steps beyond current control measures, which may include regular flushing
through to recommissioning and disinfection requiring the services of skilled professionals
under the direction of a Water Hygiene Specialist.</p>

<h2>Immediate action required by the Head of Establishment and DIO Service Manager</h2>

<p>Where buildings are under normal occupation and maintenance The <abbr title="Head of Establishment">HoE</abbr> and DIO Service
Manager should seek formal written assurance from the <abbr title="Maintenance Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> that under the Maintenance
Management Organisation (<abbr title="Maintenance Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) contract all these assets are fully maintained and safe for
continued occupation. Where there is reduced (less than 75%), or no occupancy, the normal
water hygiene maintenance regime may not be suitable and the <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> must be informed of the
reduced or no occupancy as required in the Legionella Management Plan and recommend
mitigation measures. The <abbr title="Head of Establishment">HoE</abbr> and DIO Service Manager should ensure that these remedial
measures are put in place and monitored to mitigate the risk. Where the <abbr title="Head of Establishment">HoE</abbr> decides due to
access or mitigation purposes to organise flushing then they have to flush in accordance to
the <abbr title="Maintenance Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr>’s scope and specification. For occupancy &gt;75% the occupants must be
requested to alternate their use of water fittings in common areas, so that some flow is
maintained in as many fittings as possible, until full occupancy is achieved.</p>

<p>Ideally, changes in Legionella risk will have been considered at an early point in planning
drawdown/closure arrangements, and early engagement with <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> will have assisted in
developing legionella risk mitigation plan. However, where the <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> was not notified and consulted prior to closure of a building they must be informed at the earliest opportunity in
order for the risk to be considered, particularly if it is foreseeable that buildings and water
systems may remain shut down or subject to low usage for several weeks. The earlier
intervention is commenced the less complex and resource intensive the mitigation and
legionella management is likely to be. To ensure an effective management plan is established
and maintained the <abbr title="Head of Establishment">HoE</abbr> (or nominated representative) is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify the <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> of temporary change of use or occupancy</li>
  <li>identify buildings that are occupied (including occupancy level) and those that are not</li>
  <li>agree an interim process of safeguarding whilst buildings are partially occupied</li>
  <li>agree options for safe occupancy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Immediate Action Required by the <abbr title="Maintenance Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> and Legionella Responsible Person:</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> will provide advice and guidence to <abbr title="Head of Establishment">HoE</abbr> on the approprate actions to be taken based
upon an number of factors including occupancy level, size and complexity of water systems
within the asset, findings of the Legionella Risk Assessment and the Legionella Management
Plan. It is likely that the <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> will advise that flushing will be required where there is reduced
occupancy or fluctuating occupancy throughout the week/month. Further recommended
actions will be determined by the factors detailed above, building water hygiene history and
will be categorised accordingly based upon risk.</p>

<p>The Legionella Control Association have provided guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legionellacontrol.org.uk/news/90/" rel="external">Safe Management of
Water Systems in Buildings During COVID-19 Outbreak</a> which should inform the advice and guidance provided by <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr>:</p>

<p>Hot and cold-water systems in buildings that are empty or with under occupancy must address the
issue of stagnation:</p>

<p>a. If the building is still partially in use take additional measures to keep the remaining occupants safe:   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. If possible, drop stored water levels in tanks to maintain less than 24 hours storage     <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Flush to simulate use – weekly flushing may not be sufficient    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Monitor temperature to ensure thermal gain in cold water is controlled   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. If fitted, consider temporarily increasing levels of potable water treatment dosing – consider other &gt;consequences of this such as corrosion and make the decision on balance of benefit    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. If controls are lost (temperature, biocide levels, etc.) the guidance in HSG274 is to sample for legionella weekly    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi. Consider other short term measures to keep remaining occupants safe such as point of use filters at designated locations with other areas shut off.</p>

<p>b. Buildings that are temporarily shut down (mothballed) should follow the guidance in HSG274 Part 2 paragraphs 2.50-2.52     <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Do not drain down pipework     <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. If possible, remove sources of heat and external thermal gain   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Lock off, place signage on doors and otherwise advise potential users that the system has been taken out of use     <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Have a plan in place for recommissioning the water system.</p>

<p>For all of the work above there should be a task risk assessment in place to ensure operatives are working safely.</p>

<p>Where a flushing regime is advised by <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> as appropriate, and due to the nature of the water
system it is deemed and agreed that flushing can be undertaken by personnel nominated by
<abbr title="Head of Establishment">HoE</abbr>, the <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> will identify the number, the location of outlets and duration of flushing
necessary to maintain water hygiene. The <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> is to demonstrate to <abbr title="Head of Establishment">HoE</abbr> personnel
nominated for this duty the correct techniques (minimise aerosol and spray/droplet
production) and provide guidance on <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements and records to be maintained (the
Form at Annex A would be suitable for this purpose or use the form provided by <abbr title="Maintenance Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>). The
<abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> should provide a schedule that details the specified duration for each outlet (typically 15
minutes for tank water and 5 minutes for mains water systems by default) checking that there
is no flooding, and provide instructions including but not limited to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The correct technique for percussion taps (hold down or push multi times)   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. How to activate sensor taps utilising the infra control to maintain activation   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. How to ensure urinal PIR activation achieves flush   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Guidance on water supplied assets within Mess/ welfare facilities and bars, rest areas, swimming pools etc – ensure all outlets are flushed     <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. That flushing is required to all water outlets including but not limited to: hose taps and hoses (not fire hoses), water boilers, drinking fountains, dental chairs, catering equipment, water fed drinks machines, workshop outlets etc.</p>

<p>It must be noted that any instruction that is not suitable or sufficient by any individual to flush
any building for the protection of the building could be culpable, due to lack of knowledge or lack
of understanding. If there is loss or harm due to the inadequacy of the instruction as a result,
then the instructor could be held culpable in a court of law for “Negligence” or Gross Negligence”
and could be held personally responsible.</p>

<p>Where it is deemed that the building water systems require specialist intervention the <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr>
should contact the Water Hygiene Specialist for guidance and arrange for any recommissioning
and disinfection that may be required.</p>

<h2>Action required: Building users</h2>

<p>If assigned responsibility for flushing of building water systems it is critical that the task is
undertaken dilligently to the standard specified by the <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr>; incomplete or partial flushing can
increase the risk of legionella proliferation and install a false scense of security through the belief
that the water system legionella risk has been mitigated. Note in the event of a legionella
outbreak the flushing programme and records of flushing may be subject to formal investigation.</p>

<p>All building users are instructed to:</p>

<h4>Not drink the water and notify the building custodian and <abbr title="Maintenance Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> if you identify</h4>

<ul>
  <li>any discolouration of water</li>
  <li>change in taste of water</li>
  <li>change in smell of water</li>
  <li>any Asellus or Chironmids (microscopic shrimps or fly larvae 1mm to 2mm long) in the water</li>
  <li>any sediment in the water.</li>
</ul>

<h4>If any of above issues are identified but it is essential to occupy the building due to operational need, post COVID lockdown social distancing adjustment purposes or similar, the following must be followed until water system has been flushed and disinfected and <abbr title="Legionella Responsible Person">LRP</abbr> confirmed that water is potable and safe for intended use.</h4>

<ul>
  <li>drink bottled water</li>
  <li>use bottled water to boil for hot drinks</li>
  <li>sanitise hands with hand sanitiser</li>
  <li>wipe down surfaces with antiseptic spray or wipes, adhering to contact times</li>
  <li>do not use the shower</li>
  <li>minimise atomisation from taps</li>
  <li>close the toilet lid prior to flushing.</li>
</ul>
