<p>The steering board review of <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> procedures (‘procedural review’) identifies procedural errors in the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> process in dealing with complaints brought under the <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</abbr> Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (‘the Guidelines’). This ensures the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> rules of procedures are kept.</p>

<p>As set out in the Guidelines, <abbr title="National Contact Points">NCPs</abbr> operate in accordance with core criteria of visibility, accessibility, transparency and accountability. The procedural review works in part to further this.
This guidance explains the procedural review in more detail, including the remit of different roles within the process as well as the outcomes of a review.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Overview</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1. </span> A procedural review</h3>
<p>1.1.1.	A procedural review is an opportunity for parties to ask the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> steering board whether they consider the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> to have followed the correct <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-contact-point-procedures-for-complaints-brought-under-the-oecd-guidelines-for-multinational-enterprises"><abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> published procedure</a>, in coming to a final decision, or failed to treat the parties with appropriate fairness.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2. </span>	Who can request a procedural review</h3>
<p>1.2.1.       A procedural review may only be requested by a party to the complaint.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3. </span>	When to request a review</h3>
<p>1.3.1.	A review can only be requested where one of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> has made a final decision to not accept a complaint following its initial assessment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> has concluded its consideration of the further examination and is ready to publish the final statement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4. </span>	Requesting a procedural review</h3>
<p>1.4.1.	When the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> sends its final draft of an initial assessment decision or final statement it will include information on how to request a procedural review.  The request must be in writing to the steering board secretariat and should be short and succinct. 
The request should say which initial assessment or final statement is involved and state why and how the submitter considers the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> has not followed its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-contact-point-procedures-for-complaints-brought-under-the-oecd-guidelines-for-multinational-enterprises"><abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> published procedure</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5. </span>	Scope of the procedural review</h3>
<p>1.5.1.	A procedural review can only deal with procedural errors and will not examine the substance of the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> decision.</p>

<p>1.5.2.	However, the steering board’s conclusions on their procedural review may relate to the substance of a complaint if the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> has failed to follow its own procedures in coming to a decision. For instance, if a party believes the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> did not take into consideration evidence which may mean the conclusion itself was incorrect.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6. </span>	Reasons for a procedural review</h3>
<p>1.6.1.	A party to the complaint might want the steering board to consider whether the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr>, in examining the complaint, has failed to comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-contact-point-procedures-for-complaints-brought-under-the-oecd-guidelines-for-multinational-enterprises"><abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> published procedure</a>. Examples of such failure might be, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>failure to issue a final statement in accordance with the timetable set out in the published procedure</li>
  <li>
    <p>failure by the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> to give either party an appropriate opportunity to be heard</p>
  </li>
  <li>failure to meet either parties’ reasonable requirements in relation to the treatment of confidential or sensitive information</li>
</ul>

<p>1.6.2	The steering board may consider whether the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> failed to treat either party to the complaint with appropriate fairness in the circumstances of the case. Appropriate fairness is intended to cover what is sometimes called ‘rules of natural justice’. In this context ‘rules of natural justice’ means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>judgement without bias: the decision is based on evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fair hearing: there is an opportunity to prepare and present evidence, and to respond to arguments presented by the opposing side</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	Roles, responsibilities, and remits</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1. </span>	The role of the steering board</h3>
<p>2.1.1.	The steering board acts as an oversight body for the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr>. More about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-contact-point-steering-board-terms-of-reference-and-role"><abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> steering board</a>.</p>

<p>2.1.2.	To process a procedural review, members of the steering board volunteer to form a temporary review committee.</p>

<p>2.1.3.	Each board member has a designated alternate. To maintain impartiality and timely processing of a procedural review, alternates may take part in a review committee.</p>

<p>2.1.4.	The steering board has responsibility for considering the decision which the temporary review committee comes to and its conclusions and recommendations will only be finalised subject to their agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2. </span>	The role of the review committee</h3>
<p>2.2.1.	The review committee is temporarily formed by 3 members of the steering board.</p>

<p>2.2.2.	The review committee’s role is to consider the procedural review request and make conclusions and recommendations to the steering board.</p>

<p>2.2.3.	The review committee should identify a lead writer of the final report which is submitted to the steering board.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3. </span>	Impartiality of the steering board and review committee</h3>
<p>2.3.1.	Board members involved in a procedural review must be impartial. They should fulfil their capacity in the review committee as an independent steering board member, detached from any departmental or third-party representation role they might have.</p>

<p>2.3.2.	Board members will notify the secretariat of any material interest in the complaint and declare any conflict of interest.</p>

<p>2.3.3.	Any board member who has a conflict of interest may choose to a) not participate in the review committee and/or b) withdraw from the procedural review process entirely. 
If the board member is aware of a material interest, but does not consider it to be a conflict of interest, they should ask the steering board secretariat to inform the parties to the complaint of the nature of that interest and ask if they have any objection to them taking part in the process. 
If any party objects, that member will not take part in the procedural review process. If the parties do not object, the conflict of interest can be reviewed by the chair of the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> steering board.</p>

<p>2.3.4.	A board member will not be considered to have a conflict of interest where they have been consulted by a party about the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> complaint process so long as this does not involve advice on the substance of the complaint or preparation of submissions</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4. </span>	The role of the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> secretariat</h3>
<p>2.4.1.	The secretariat notifies members of the likely timetable for a procedural review and finds out which members are available during that time.</p>

<p>2.4.2.	The secretariat facilitates meetings and correspondence between the members of the review committee.</p>

<p>2.4.3.	The secretariat circulates all relevant information received from and between the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr>, parties, and review committee.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5. </span>	The role of the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr>
</h3>
<p>2.5.1.	The steering board’s procedural review process is integral to the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr>’s commitment to continuous improvement. The <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> is committed to participating in the process in a transparent way and open to learning from the steering board’s conclusions and recommendations.</p>

<p>2.5.2.	The <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> will provide comment in writing on the review request and will provide any background information to assist the steering board in doing the review.</p>

<p>2.5.3.	The <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> comments may acknowledge that there have been errors in the procedure identified by the request for a procedural review and include recommendations for how that might be addressed.</p>

<p>2.5.4.	The <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> will play no other part in the procedural review until its conclusion.</p>

<p>2.5.5.	The <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> will act on the steering board’s recommendation and provide an update to the steering board on its actions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	Steering board procedural review action list</h2>

<p>Below is an outline of the actions which usually take place as part of the steering board procedural review process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1. </span>	Duration of the process</h3>
<p>3.1.1.	The steering board will aim to commence the process within 3 months from the time a procedural review request has been made to the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> secretariat. However, delays can arise in more complex cases or due to the availability of steering board members. There is a commitment throughout the procedural review to ensure transparency, which will include any updates to parties regarding timings.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>	Outcomes</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Procedural review outcomes</h3>
<p>4.1.1.	After considering the review request, the review committee will come to a decision on whether they think the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> has followed its procedures or not. This must be agreed by a simple majority of the review committee.</p>

<p>4.1.2.	If the review committee rules that the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> followed its procedures, it will make a statement to the steering board explaining why.</p>

<p>4.1.3.	If the review committee rules that the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> has not followed its published procedures, or where there is an opportunity for best practice and continuous improvement, the review committee will set out the reasons for its conclusions and make a recommendation to the steering board.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2. </span>	What a recommendation looks like</h3>
<p>4.2.1.	A recommendation to the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> comments on whether the reasons for the request are agreed and, if so, identifies the relevant failures to follow procedure.</p>

<p>4.2.2.	A recommendation could include suggestions for action that the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> should take in relation to the complaint, where these are not immediately apparent from the nature of the failure to follow procedure.</p>

<p>4.2.3.	Where the procedural review has identified that the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr>’s procedures are themselves unclear, the steering board may wish to recommend how they might be clarified.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3. </span>	How a recommendation is finalised</h3>
<p>4.3.1.	The recommendation will become final unless 2 or more members of the steering board who are not members of the review committee raise an objection.</p>

<p>4.3.2.	If an objection is raised, the conclusion of the procedural review will be delayed until the next full steering board meeting at which it is practicable to consider the request.</p>

<p>4.3.3.	If the steering board agrees to the recommendation, the board will send this to the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr>; and inform both parties to the complaint.</p>

<p>4.3.4.	The final recommendation approved by the steering board will normally be published promptly on the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> website, unless the steering board considers there is a good reason to withhold or delay publication or only publish a summary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4. </span>	How the <abbr title="UK National Contact Point">UK NCP</abbr> takes on board the outcome of the procedural review</h3>
<p>4.4.1.	The steering board will not replace the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> decision with its own appraisal. However, if the decision is sent to the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> for reconsideration, the <abbr title="National Contact Point">NCP</abbr> will re-open the complaint in accordance with the instructions of the steering board, correct the mistakes and, if necessary, reconsider its final statement.</p>

<p>4.4.2.	No further request for the review of that decision may be made.</p>
