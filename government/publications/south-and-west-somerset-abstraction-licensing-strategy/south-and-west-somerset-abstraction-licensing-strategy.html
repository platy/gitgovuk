<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>About the licensing strategy</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Overview</h3>
<p>This strategy sets out how we manage new and existing abstraction and impoundment within the South and West Somerset catchment of south-west England. The abstraction licensing strategy provides an overview of how water resources are sustainably managed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide water for abstraction</li>
  <li>protect the environment</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-water-abstraction">Managing water abstraction</a> describes the technical explanation, legal and policy requirements behind the abstraction licensing strategies (<abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/water-management-abstract-or-impound-water">abstraction pages on GOV.UK</a> advise on:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>How is the licensing strategy set out?</h3>

<p>This <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr> provides an overview of how water is sustainably managed in the South and West Somerset catchment to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide water for abstraction</li>
  <li>protect the environment</li>
</ul>

<p>The following is a summary of what each section covers:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Catchment-overview">Catchment overview</a> - sets out additional information about the catchments and the influences and pressures on water availability.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Availability">Water resource availability</a> - explains how much water is available for abstraction in the catchments.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Manage">How we manage water resource availability</a> - explains the local licensing approach for the catchments which are summarised in tables 7 to 9. This includes the potential water available for licensing and the restrictions that would be required.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Catchment">Managing the catchment together</a> - details the actions we are taking where abstraction is currently unsustainable in the catchment. Approaches to ensure sustainable water management in the future are outlined, including information on licence trading.</p>

</div>

<p>Note: whilst our assessment tools are continuously updated, we aim to update this document on a 3-year basis. Therefore, some details within this document, for example hands off flow (<abbr title="hands off flow">HoF</abbr>) values, may be outdated. Use this document as a guide to water availability, for up to date information <a class="govuk-link" href="#Contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Collaborative and sustainable water management</h3>

<p>Our long term goal is to manage catchments so that there is sufficient water for people and the environment in the face of climate change. To help address this we need a stronger collaborative focus for water resources. We are working with abstractors and catchment groups to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop local solutions to existing pressures</li>
  <li>prepare for the future</li>
</ul>

<p>The Brue catchment, which is part of the South and West Somerset <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr>, was selected as a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/water-resources/water-resources-priority-catchments/consult_view/" rel="external">priority catchment</a> in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/water-abstraction-plan-2017"><abbr title="Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs.">Defra</abbr> water abstraction plan</a>. This plan sets out how the government will reform the way we manage water abstraction, to protect the environment and improve access to water.</p>

<p>Further information on the priority catchment project is available in section 2, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Catchment-overview">catchment overview</a>. Further details and links on approaches trialled in this catchment are provided in section 5, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Catchment">managing the catchment together</a>.</p>

<p>This strategy is a tool to make informed decisions on the choices abstractors make about their use of water. We want this strategy to help abstractors to better understand the local water resource situation. This will help them to plan their water use and become more resilient in the face of climate change.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Applying for an abstraction licence</h3>

<p>If you are considering applying for an abstraction or impoundment licence, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/water-management-abstract-or-impound-water">abstraction pages</a> on GOV.UK provide further advice. The different types of water resource licences that can be applied for are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full licence – for most types of water abstraction over 20 cubic metres a day</li>
  <li>transfer licence – to move over 20 cubic metres of water a day from one source to another without intervening use</li>
  <li>temporary licence – to abstract more than 20 cubic metres of water a day over a period of less than 28 days</li>
  <li>impounding licence – to create or remove an impoundment structure such as a sluice, weir or dam</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications can also be made to vary the conditions on an existing abstraction licence. Many of the principles that apply to new applications will also apply to variations to existing licences.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Catchment overview</h2>

<p>The South and West Somerset catchment forms part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/OperationalCatchment/3053" rel="external">South West River Basin Management Plan</a>. It can be sub-divided into the following river catchments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Brue</li>
  <li>Parrett</li>
  <li>West Somerset Streams</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Landscape and land use</h3>

<p>The South and West Somerset catchment area covers an area of approximately 2,800km<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>The Brue and Parrett catchments are characterised by their flat, low-lying rural landscapes typified by the Somerset Levels and Moors. This is one of the largest wetlands remaining in England and home to numerous protected species.</p>

<p>The West Somerset streams are situated in or close to several protected sites including the Quantocks and the Exmoor Heath Special Areas of Conservation (<abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>). They are typically steep and fast flowing, draining from the highlands of Exmoor and Quantock Hills and flowing northwards to the sea.</p>

<p>All the river catchments within the South and West Somerset <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr> are dominated by a rural landscape with mixed agricultural use. The area also supports a significant proportion of designated sites and is home to numerous protected species and habitats.</p>

<p>The photograph shows the North Drain pumping station situated on the River Brue. One of many pumping stations within the Somerset Levels and Moors used to help control water levels.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/155160/2._North_Drain_960x640.jpg"></div></figure>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Water resources</h3>

<p>The South and West Somerset Catchment includes the Parrett catchment, which comprises of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>River Parrett</li>
  <li>River Tone</li>
  <li>River Isle</li>
  <li>River Cary</li>
  <li>River Yeo</li>
</ul>

<p>It drains from the Quantocks, Blackdown Hills and Mendips, flowing through the low-lying Somerset Levels and Moors to the Bristol Channel at Bridgwater Bay. The underlying rock has a major influence on the catchment’s response to rainfall. It results in high run-off from the impermeable uplands in the east and waterlogging of the lowlands.</p>

<p>The River Brue originates in the Greensands of the Wessex Vales, near Bruton. It then flows through the low-lying peaty Moors and clay Levels before discharging to the Bristol Channel at Highbridge.</p>

<p>The River Axe is hydrologically connected to the Brue and originates in the limestone Mendip Hills which provide significant public water supply.</p>

<p>The photograph shows Cheddar reservoir, which forms part of the Axe catchment and is managed by Bristol Water. It is also important locally for recreation activities and an important habitat for birds.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/155161/3._FINAL_Cheddar_Reservoir_3_960x640.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>The Somerset Levels and Moors of the Brue and Tone catchments are a managed wetland system covering an area of approximately 650km<sup>2</sup>. Most of the water in the Moors lies in a network of manmade channels (known locally as ‘rhynes’). These rhynes serve several roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>irrigating the Moors (for wet fences and supplying drinking water for livestock)</li>
  <li>draining the areas after periods of high rainfall</li>
  <li>flooding in certain areas for conservation purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>The water levels are artificially controlled by several structures including pumping stations, gates and sluices. The Internal Drainage Boards have an important role in managing the water levels in the rhynes within the low-lying levels and moors. The Environment Agency controls larger pumping stations and tidal gates. Throughout both the Brue and Parrett catchments, many of the water bodies are heavily modified due to the artificial nature of the landscape.</p>

<p>The West Somerset streams are located along the Somerset coastline from Minehead to Doniford and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hawkcombe Stream</li>
  <li>Horner Water</li>
  <li>River Avill</li>
  <li>River Pill</li>
  <li>Washford River</li>
  <li>Doniford Stream</li>
  <li>Kilve Stream</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike the Parrett and Brue catchments the rivers in the West Somerset catchment are not heavily modified, except for the Avill and Lower Washford. There is also an artificial water body, Nutscale Reservoir which is no longer used for public water supply. The catchment supports numerous protected habitats including the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exmoor National Park <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Quantocks Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)</li>
</ul>

<p>The main water resource pressure in the area comes from several public water supply abstractions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Climate change</h3>

<p>Climate change will likely impact on the quantity and seasonal availability of water resources within the catchment.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The projected climate change impacts on rainfall and river flow for the South West Region by the 2050s are for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rainfall to decrease by 45% in the summer but increase by 41% in the winter</li>
  <li>low flows to be 82% lower but peak river flows to be 40% higher</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Climate change projections are estimated using data from UKCP09, consistent with a 4ºC rise by 2100. Further details on the assumptions used can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/climate-impacts-tool">Environment Agency Climate impacts tool</a>.</p>

<p>Further information is provided in section 5, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Catchment">managing the catchment together</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Environment and sustainability</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>174 designated protected areas (SACs, SPAs, SSSIs, NNRs, and LNRs)</p>

<p>Water Framework Directive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100 water bodies</li>
  <li>7% water bodies at good status or higher</li>
  <li>11% water bodies where flow does not support good status</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The South and West Somerset Catchment includes a diverse range of protected areas from local to international significance. Many of these sites are dependent on surface waters to maintain their unique environments and therefore require additional protection. One such area is the Somerset Levels and Moors which are currently graded as unfavourable-declining habitat. It is our responsibility to ensure that we do not authorise abstraction that will have an adverse impact on these designated habitats and protected wildlife.</p>

<p>Many of the water bodies are heavily modified and under pressure from both urban and rural diffuse pollution. Pollution to rivers occurs from a number of sources including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sewage discharges</li>
  <li>agriculture</li>
  <li>misconnections</li>
  <li>industry</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Partnership working</h3>

<p>The Brue catchment was selected as a priority catchment in the <abbr title="Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs.">Defra</abbr> water abstraction plan. Since 2019, we have been working with water users and other partners exploring modern ways of managing water. We are working together across sectors including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>public water supply</li>
  <li>agriculture</li>
  <li>environment</li>
  <li>flood risk management</li>
  <li>navigation</li>
</ul>

<p>This will deliver multi-functional outcomes which are good for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the environment</li>
  <li>people and business</li>
</ul>

<p>This catchment was selected as a priority catchment for several reasons including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to utilise collaborative working to address water resource pressure within the catchment</li>
  <li>to engage with Somerset Catchment Partnership, which had selected the River Brue as a priority area</li>
  <li>to trial novel and innovative approaches to create more sustainable water supply to the designated habitat and other water users</li>
  <li>to protect the important habitat and species of the Somerset Levels and Moors</li>
</ul>

<p>The Somerset Catchment Partnership is active in this catchment and brings together stakeholders from a range of backgrounds to address issues in the catchment. In addition, there are also several water resources themed groups which feed into the Catchment Based Approach (CaBA) partnership.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Water resource availability in the South and West Somerset catchment</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Surface water availability</h3>

<p>The method for calculating the water resource availability is explained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-water-abstraction">Managing water abstraction</a>. Water availability is calculated at selected assessment points (<abbr title="assessment points">APs</abbr>). The maps show the water availability calculated at the <abbr title="assessment point">AP</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, the local water availability within an <abbr title="assessment point">AP</abbr> catchment may differ.</p>

<p>There are 8 <abbr title="assessment points">APs</abbr> in the Brue catchment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AP1 covers the River Brue, from Bruton to Lovington Gauging Station (<abbr title="gauging station">GS</abbr>), including the River Pitt and Alham</li>
  <li>AP2 covers the Whitelake, Redlake and Hartlake from Evercreech to Crannel Moor</li>
  <li>AP3 covers the River Sheppey from Doulting to Fenny Castle <abbr title="gauging station">GS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>AP4 covers the River Brue from Lovington <abbr title="gauging station">GS</abbr> to Basin Bridge <abbr title="gauging station">GS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>AP5 covers the River Axe from Clewer to Loxton including the Cheddar Yeo</li>
  <li>AP6 covers the River Axe from Cheddar Yeo to Brean Cross, including the Mark Yeo</li>
  <li>AP7 covers the River Axe headwater at Wookey Hole <abbr title="gauging station">GS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>AP8 covers the Cheddar Yeo from Cheddar to upstream of Helliers Stream</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 19 <abbr title="assessment points">APs</abbr> in the Parrett Catchment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AP1 covers the River Cary from Castle Cary to Somerton <abbr title="gauging station">GS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>AP2 covers the River Cam and Blackford Stream from Blackford to Yeovilton</li>
  <li>AP3 covers the Upper River Yeo and Sherbourne Lake from Charlton Horethorne to Bradford Abbas</li>
  <li>AP4 covers the River Wriggle and Beer Hackett Stream from Batcombe to Blackford Abbas</li>
  <li>AP5 covers Sutton Bingham Stream and Closworth Stream from Corscombe and Lewcombe to Potter’s Leaze Plantation</li>
  <li>AP6 covers the River Yeo from Yeovil to Long Sutton</li>
  <li>AP7 covers the Upper River Parrett to from Chedington to Gawbridge Bow including Goulds Brook and Chinnock Brook</li>
  <li>AP8 covers the River Isle and Shudrick Stream from Chard to North Ilminster</li>
  <li>AP9 covers the Fivehead River from Blackdown Hills to the River Isle</li>
  <li>AP10 covers the Cannington Brook from Hawkridge Reservoir to Cannington</li>
  <li>AP11 covers the Upper River Tone from Sedgeborough Common to Greenham <abbr title="gauging station">GS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>AP12 covers the Hele Brook from Lowton to River Tone</li>
  <li>AP13 covers the Hillfarance Brook from Stone Wood to River Tone</li>
  <li>AP14 covers the River Tone from Hillfarance River to Bishops Hull <abbr title="gauging station">GS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>AP15 covers Halsewater from Rooks Nest to Norton Fitzwarren</li>
  <li>AP16 covers the River Tone from Firepool to Taunton Market</li>
  <li>AP17 covers the River Tone from Bishops Hull <abbr title="gauging station">GS</abbr> to Firepool</li>
  <li>AP18 covers the King Sedgemoor Drain Crandon Bridge <abbr title="gauging station">GS</abbr> to River Parrett at Westover Pumping Station, including the River Sowy and Eighteen Feet Rhyne and River Cary from Somerton to Henley</li>
  <li>AP19 covers the River Parrett Yeo from Gawbridge Bow to Westover Bridge, including the lower River Isle</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 6 <abbr title="assessment points">APs</abbr> in the West Somerset Streams Catchment (due to the small size of these rivers some cover multiple streams):</p>

<ul>
  <li>AP1 covers the River Aller and Horner Water</li>
  <li>AP2 covers the River Avill and Wootton Courtenay Stream</li>
  <li>AP3 covers the Washford River and Traphole Stream</li>
  <li>AP4 covers the Doniford and Monksilver streams</li>
  <li>AP5 covers the River Pill</li>
  <li>AP6 covers the Kilve Stream</li>
</ul>

<h4>Water resource availability colours and implications for licensing</h4>

<p>We use colours to represent different surface water availability at a range of flows:</p>

<p><strong>Water available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Green</p>
</div>

<p>There is more water than required to meet the needs of the environment. New licences can be considered depending on local and downstream impacts.</p>

<p><strong>Restricted water available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Yellow</p>
</div>

<p>Full licensed flows fall below the environmental flow indicator.</p>

<p>If all licensed water is abstracted there will not be enough water left for the needs of the environment. No new consumptive licences would be granted. It is likely we’ll be taking action to reduce full licensed risks. Water may be available if you can ‘buy’ (known as licence trading) the entitlement to abstract water from an existing licence holder.</p>

<p><strong>Water not available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Red</p>
</div>

<p>Recent actual flows are below the environmental flow indicator.</p>

<p>This scenario highlights water bodies where flows are below the indicative flow requirement to help support a healthy ecology in our rivers. We call this ‘Good Ecological Status’ (<abbr title="good ecological status">GES</abbr>) or ‘Good Ecological Potential’ (<abbr title="good ecological potential">GEP</abbr>) where a water body is heavily modified for reasons other than water resources.</p>

<p>Note: we are currently taking action in water bodies that are not supporting <abbr title="good ecological status">GES</abbr> or <abbr title="good ecological potential">GEP</abbr>. We will not grant further licences. Water may be available if you can buy (known as licence trading) the amount equivalent to recently abstracted from an existing licence holder.</p>

<p>The water resource availability is calculated, and the colour assigned at 4 different flows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q30 – the flow of a river which is exceeded on average for 30% of the time, therefore you would expect the river flow to be lower than Q30 on 256 days in an average year, that is, a higher flow</li>
  <li>Q50 – the flow of a river which is exceeded on average 50% of the time, therefore you would expect the river flow to be lower than Q50 on 183 days in an average year</li>
  <li>Q70 – the flow of a river which is exceeded on average for 70% of the time, therefore you would expect the river flow to be lower than Q70 on 110 days in an average year</li>
  <li>Q95 – the flow of a river which is exceeded on average for 95% of the time, therefore you would expect the river flow to be lower than Q95 on 18 days in an average year, that is, a low flow</li>
</ul>

<h4>Water availability maps</h4>

<p>The water availability colours for the South and West Somerset catchment are presented in maps 2 to 5.</p>

<p>Tables 1 to 3 provide a summary of maps 2 to 5, showing the water availability at each assessment point by flow category.</p>

<p>Water availability status given in the tables is at <abbr title="assessment point">AP</abbr> level, water availability may be different at a local level. In some instances, a hands off level (<abbr title="hands off level">HoL</abbr>) may be more appropriate than a hands off flow (<abbr title="hands off flow">HoF</abbr>) restriction. For example, in areas associated with the Somerset levels and moors.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Groundwater resource availability</h3>

<p>Abstracting groundwater can impact on overlying surface water bodies. This impact is measured at the surface water <abbr title="assessment point">AP</abbr>. We cannot grant new groundwater licences where abstraction is reducing flows to below the indicative flow requirement to help support a healthy ecology. This is based on Q95 flows.</p>

<p>We must also account for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the available resource in the aquifer</li>
  <li>the impact of abstraction on protected sites</li>
  <li>the risk of saline intrusion</li>
</ul>

<h4>Groundwater resource availability colours and implications for licensing</h4>

<p>We use colours to represent different groundwater availability:</p>

<p><strong>Water available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Green</p>
</div>

<p>Groundwater unit balance shows groundwater available for licensing. New licences can be considered depending on impacts on other abstractors, designated ecological sites and on surface water.</p>

<p><strong>Restricted water available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Yellow</p>
</div>

<p>Groundwater unit balance shows more water is licensed than the amount available. But the actual situation is sustainable because either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>recent actual abstractions are lower than the amount available</li>
  <li>management options are in place to deal with the known impacts</li>
</ul>

<p>In restricted groundwater units no new consumptive licences will be granted. We may also investigate the possibilities for reducing fully licensed risks. Water may be available if you can ‘buy’ (known as licence trading) the entitlement to abstract water from an existing licence holder.</p>

<p>In other units there may be restrictions in some areas, for example in relation to saline intrusion.</p>

<p><strong>Water not available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Red</p>
</div>

<p>Groundwater unit balance shows more water has been abstracted based on recent amounts than the amount available.</p>

<p>We will not grant further licences.</p>

<h4>Groundwater availability map</h4>

<p>Map 6 shows that there is restricted groundwater available across the South and West Somerset catchment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Resource reliability</h3>

<p>If you want to apply for a licence, it’s worth considering the reliability of your abstraction.</p>

<p>By assessing the quantity of water available at different flows it’s possible to see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when there is a surplus or deficit of water</li>
  <li>the associated reliability of an abstraction</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an indication only. Actual reliability of a licence will be discussed when you apply.</p>

<p>Tables 4 to 6 provide a summary of map 7 - resource availability for consumptive abstraction in the South and West Somerset catchment expressed as a percentage of time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Other considerations for resource availability and reliability</h3>

<p>We will add constraints to licences such as <abbr title="hands off flow">HoF</abbr> and <abbr title="hands off level">HoL</abbr> conditions to protect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the environment</li>
  <li>the rights of other abstractors</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, when we grant a licence, it doesn’t mean that we guarantee a supply of water. These conditions specify that if the flow in the river drops below what’s needed to protect the environment, abstraction must reduce or stop. In dry years, restrictions are likely to apply more often. This will affect the reliability of supply.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that we will grant licences even where water is available for abstraction. This is because we have to determine each application on its own merits. Local factors may mean we’re either unable to grant a licence as applied for, or even at all.</p>

<p>New licences within a catchment are usually given a common end date (<abbr title="common end date">CED</abbr>), which allows them to be reviewed at the same time.</p>

<p>Common end dates for South and West Somerset <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr>:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Impoundments</h3>

<p>Applications for impoundments will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. More information may be found on our <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/water-management-abstract-or-impound-water">water management web pages</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>How we manage water availability in the South and West Somerset <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Surface water</h3>

<p>We assess surface water flows at assessment points (<abbr title="assessment points">APs</abbr>). These are significant points on a river, often where 2 major rivers join or at a gauging station. <abbr title="assessment points">APs</abbr> cover multiple surface water bodies.</p>

<p>Where groundwater abstractions directly impact on surface water flows, the impact is measured at the surface water <abbr title="assessment point">AP</abbr>. This is the case for all rivers within this <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr>. For further details on groundwater please see section 4.2, groundwater.</p>

<p>Tables 7 to 9 give an indication of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how much water is available for further abstraction</li>
  <li>the associated restrictions we may have to apply to new and varied abstraction licences from the main river</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the nature of the catchment, tributaries to the main river may be subject to different restrictions and quantities. This may be assessed locally on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Each <abbr title="hands off flow">HoF</abbr> or <abbr title="hands off level">HoL</abbr> is linked to an <abbr title="assessment point">AP</abbr> and is dependent on the resource availability at that <abbr title="assessment point">AP</abbr>. In some cases additional restrictions may apply to licences where there is a more critical <abbr title="assessment point">AP</abbr> resource availability downstream. This protects the ecological requirements of the river and other water users. This is detailed in the last column of tables 7 to 9 if applicable.</p>

<p>All abstraction licence applications are subject to an assessment. This takes account of any local and downstream issues. It may be subject to further restrictions.</p>

<p>Reading from top to bottom in tables 7 to 9 are the <abbr title="assessment points">APs</abbr> in the South and West Somerset <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr> area. Reading across the columns you can see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the potential <abbr title="hands off flow">HoF</abbr>/<abbr title="hands off level">HoL</abbr> that may be applied to a licence</li>
  <li>the number of days water may be available under this restriction</li>
  <li>the approximate volume of water in <abbr title="megalitres per day">Ml/d</abbr> that may be available</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases where there is water available at all flows, we may apply a minimum residual flow (<abbr title="minimum residual flow">MRF</abbr>) to protect very low flows. We’ll decide this on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Groundwater</h3>

<p>For major aquifers we may divide the area into groundwater management units (<abbr title="groundwater management units">GWMU</abbr>), which are sub-divisions of the groundwater bodies. In these cases, we use the information and assessments on these units to determine water availability and licence restrictions.</p>

<p>Where groundwater abstractions directly impact on surface water flows the impact is measured at the surface water <abbr title="assessment point">AP</abbr>. This includes where the impact reduces baseflow. In these cases, restrictions may be applied to licences, such as <abbr title="hands off level">HoL</abbr> conditions. The <abbr title="hands off level">HoL</abbr> is a groundwater level below which an abstractor is required to reduce or stop abstraction.</p>

<p>Other restrictions may apply where availability is limited or to protect the environment, for example to prevent saline intrusion.</p>

<h4>Eastern and Northern groundwater management unit</h4>

<p>This <abbr title="groundwater management units">GWMU</abbr> has restricted water available for licensing.</p>

<p>This unit supports baseflows for both the Brue and Parrett catchments. The eastern area of the groundwater unit predominantly comprises of the Jurassic sandstone and limestone aquifers. These are separated by less permeable mudstone and siltstone units. The highly productive Inferior Oolite and Bridport Sand formations support the headwaters of local watercourses flowing east. These are often used for strategic water supply.</p>

<p>The northern area is dominated by the Carboniferous limestones of the Mendips, a karstic aquifer capable of transmitting and supporting large abstractions. A local assessment is required for any new applications to determine whether there is resource available.</p>

<p>The Eastern and Northern <abbr title="groundwater management units">GWMU</abbr> is separated from the Western <abbr title="groundwater management units">GWMU</abbr> by a swathe of the Lias Group. The geological units of the Lias may support small local abstractions. However, any impacts are likely to be localised and they are generally considered to be less productive.</p>

<h4>Western groundwater management unit</h4>

<p>This <abbr title="groundwater management units">GWMU</abbr> has restricted water available for licensing.</p>

<p>The western groundwater catchment covers the West Somerset Streams and part of the Parrett catchments. It comprises various heavily metamorphosed sediments, with aquifer properties dominated by fissures and fractures. The area comprises of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>older Devonian bedrock which supports local abstractions and small streams such as those on Exmoor</li>
  <li>a small area of productive Carboniferous limestone to the south-west of the catchment</li>
  <li>Permo-Triassic sandstones with interbedded conglomerates and mudstones which provide significant aquifers for larger abstractions</li>
  <li>Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group which acts as less permeable cover for the underlying sandstone aquifers but may also be a productive aquifer where conglomerates or substantial fissure networks are encountered</li>
</ul>

<p>A local assessment will be required for any new applications to determine whether there is resource available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Level dependent environments</h3>

<p>The South and West Somerset <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr> contains a significant area of level dependent environments (<abbr title="level dependent environments">LDEs</abbr>). Flow constraints may not apply in <abbr title="level dependent environments">LDEs</abbr>. Local constraints based on levels not flow may be required on a site-specific basis to protect the watercourses.</p>

<p>For these catchments water level management plans have been set up. These have been agreed by the bodies or authorities interested in the water level management in an area. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://somersetdrainageboards.gov.uk/" rel="external">Somerset Drainage Board Consortium</a> maintain most of these plans, although the Environment Agency also operate a number.</p>

<p><abbr title="level dependent environments">LDEs</abbr> are characterised by a network of river channels flowing above the level of the surrounding land. The low-lying land has a network of drainage ditches. These remove water from the low-lying land into the main river channels during the winter/high flows. They provide an irrigation resource during the summer/low flows.</p>

<p>Map 8 gives an indication of where areas may be level dependent rather than flow dependent. The area highlighted covers the internal drainage board (<abbr title="internal drainage board">IDB</abbr>) areas within the South and West Somerset <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr> area.</p>

<p><strong>Map 8: Axe, Brue, Parrett, North Somerset Levels Internal Drainage Board Boundary</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/155169/11._FINAL_IDB_Map_960x640.png"></div></figure>

<p>© <a class="govuk-link" href="#Copyright">Environment Agency copyright</a></p>

<p>We will consult the relevant <abbr title="internal drainage board">IDB</abbr> for any licence that is considered in an <abbr title="internal drainage board">IDB</abbr> area.</p>

<p>In most cases licences for abstraction within an <abbr title="internal drainage board">IDB</abbr> area will require a <abbr title="hands off level">HoL</abbr> condition relevant to the local level management plan.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Coasts and estuaries</h3>

<p>The Parrett and Brue catchments both flow into the Severn Estuary, which has multiple environmental designations to protect important geology and wildlife. Special consideration needs to be given to impacts on the Severn Estuary when granting new licences within this <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr> area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Heavily modified water bodies</h3>

<p>A heavily modified water body (<abbr title="heavily modified water body">HMWB</abbr>) is a watercourse that has been significantly altered to suit a specific purpose. <abbr title="heavily modified water bodies">HMWBs</abbr> can be classified for many reasons. For water resources purposes it means that the flow regime has been altered by flow regulation/ augmentation.</p>

<p>Both the <abbr title="heavily modified water bodies">HMWBs</abbr> and the artificial water bodies are designated for reasons including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>flood protection</li>
  <li>land drainage</li>
  <li>water regulation</li>
  <li>drinking water supply</li>
  <li>recreation</li>
  <li>urbanisation</li>
  <li>wider environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the South and West Somerset <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr> there are several water bodies that are designated as <abbr title="heavily modified water body">HMWB</abbr>. These can include the LDE areas, rivers affected by reservoirs and reservoirs themselves.</p>

<p>There are also several lakes and drain water bodies which are designated artificial. These systems provide flows to support ‘protected areas’ within these catchments.</p>

<p>If the water body is a <abbr title="heavily modified water body">HMWB</abbr> then this may impact on the availability of water. A local assessment is required for any applications for new water to determine whether there is resource available. Conditions including <abbr title="hands off flow">HoF</abbr> or <abbr title="hands off level">HoL</abbr> restrictions may be applied to your licence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Protected sites</h3>

<p>The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (Habitats Regulations) provides a very high level of protection to 2 types of designated sites due to their special environment. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Special Areas of Conservation (<abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>), which contribute to biodiversity by maintaining and restoring habitats and species</li>
  <li>Special Protection Areas (<abbr title="Special Protection Areas">SPAs</abbr>), which provide protection to birds and their nests, eggs and habitats</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of designated sites within the South and West Somerset catchment. Additional restrictions may be applied to abstractions near or within these areas based on local assessment of impact on these sites. This includes multiple designations of the level dependent Somerset Levels and Moors.</p>

<p>Natural England has also recently designated the Somerset Wetlands as a National Nature Reserve. There is an ambition to transform this into a 15,000 acre ‘super’ <abbr title="National Nature Reserve">NNR</abbr>. This will protect the level dependent saltmarsh, heath and wetland habitats of the Somerset landscape.</p>

<p>Government policy treats Ramsar sites (internationally important wetland sites) in the same way as SACs and <abbr title="Special Protection Areas">SPAs</abbr>. Ramsars, SACs and <abbr title="Special Protection Areas">SPAs</abbr> are referred to collectively as European sites. Sites of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>) also carry a high level of environmental importance.</p>

<p>Conservation objectives are the main objectives for European and <abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> protected sites to maintain at, or to reach, favourable condition. These are set by Natural England. The process for setting targets is described through the Joint nature conservation committee approved ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-2199" rel="external">Common Standards Monitoring Guidance’</a>. Natural England uses these targets to assess the condition of European and <abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> protected sites. These quantitative targets are considered by Natural England as a prerequisite for achieving the conservation objectives for European or <abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> designated sites. We have a duty to have regard to Natural England’s advice when determining licence applications that may impact on a designated site.</p>

<p>We may need more detailed supporting information when a licence application could impact on a designated conservation site. This will allow us to complete the required statutory assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Action on unsustainable abstraction</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-water-abstraction">Managing water abstraction</a> gives details on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what an unsustainable abstraction is</li>
  <li>the measures available to resolve environmental issues caused by abstraction</li>
</ul>

<p>We will take the following action to reduce unsustainable abstraction in the South and West Somerset catchment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue working with the Internal Drainage Boards to ensure that water can be provided without harm to the environment, including reviewing water level management plans</li>
  <li>continue to work with wildlife organisations, Natural England and others to protect designated sites now and into the future</li>
  <li>continue working with industrial abstractors within the catchment to improve efficiency of water reuse</li>
  <li>improve our flow monitoring within the Brue catchment to better understand the issues and opportunities to improve water resources</li>
  <li>continue working with partners to implement nature based solutions (<abbr title="nature based solutions">NBS</abbr>) to improve the catchment’s resilience to drought and flood events</li>
  <li>continue working with the water companies to support the Water Industry National Environment Programme (<abbr title="Water Industry National Environment Plan">WINEP</abbr>) to address unsustainable abstraction</li>
  <li>continue to bring unregulated abstractions into the permitting regime through new authorisations</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Approaches to sustainable water management</h3>

<p>We have undertaken a range of catchment focused initiatives within the Brue priority catchment. This section outlines options initiated in this catchment for future approaches to water management. This includes collaboration and sharing which may be of interest to both new and existing abstractors.</p>

<h4>Working with natural processes in the catchment</h4>

<p>Natural processes help to store water in the ground and slow down the rate at which it enters river systems. Evidence shows that taking action to restore natural processes can help make some catchments more resilient to drought and flood events. We have completed a new study to provide evidence for the benefits of working with natural processes.</p>

<p>We have been focusing on the upper catchment of the River Brue, including the River Pitt and Alham. We have been working with our partners in the area, led by Farming Wildlife Advisory Group South West (<abbr title="Farming Wildlife Advisory Group South West">FWAG SW</abbr>), to implement nature based solutions (<abbr title="nature based solutions">NBS</abbr>). These could improve the catchments resilience and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>slowing and attenuating surface water flows</li>
  <li>reconnecting rivers with floodplains</li>
  <li>soil management improvement</li>
  <li>planting in low permeability soils</li>
</ul>

<p>Outputs from the project include tools to help with identifying and assessing potential effectiveness of <abbr title="nature based solutions">NBS</abbr> at different locations. Further information on the map and matrix tool can be found in the Working with natural processes study on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/water-resources/water-resources-priority-catchments/consult_view/" rel="external">Water resources priority catchments</a> site.</p>

<h4>Farm walkover events and steering group</h4>

<p>We provided several events to engage with the agricultural community in the Brue catchment to share best practice and opportunities for farming more sustainably. This was focused on improving water availability and reducing pollution, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>impacts of climate change on the Brue Catchment</li>
  <li>improving soil resilience, including a look at the use of herbal leys to improve water infiltration</li>
  <li>the Farming Rules for Water</li>
  <li>funding opportunities and grant schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>The events were led by the Somerset Catchment Partners and included several partner organisations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><abbr title="Farming Wildlife Advisory Group South West">FWAG SW</abbr></li>
  <li>National Farmers Union</li>
  <li>Catchment Sensitive Farming</li>
  <li>Environment Agency</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the success of the events, there are plans to create a ‘Farmer Steering Group’. This will establish a discussion forum to enable conversation on key catchment issues between farmers and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>Further engagement events are also planned to look at post-harvest soil management, which will include trial sites.</p>

<h4>Citizen science initiatives</h4>

<p>Targeted stakeholder engagement was undertaken to increase the uptake of citizen science. Initiatives were developed to monitor water quantity and quality within the catchment through partners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Westcountry Rivers Trust – targeted stakeholder engagement for Citizen Science expansion</li>
  <li>Somerset Wildlife Trust - Water Guardians Project</li>
  <li>South Somerset District Council - Environment Champions volunteers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Future management of water resources in this catchment</h4>

<p>Future work will focus on working with partners in the lower Brue catchment, and the opportunities for improving water availability and quality.</p>

<p>We are developing projects focused on improving soil condition through trials and knowledge sharing engagement events. This will have multiple environmental benefits including improving water availability and reducing pollution.</p>

<p>The catchment will potentially have significant reductions in flows and increasing demands for water due to climate change. We are therefore working with partners to understand the impacts and develop mitigation plans. These will improve resilience and protect the environment now and into the future.</p>

<h4>Water rights trading</h4>

<p>A water rights trade is where a person sells all or part of their water right, as defined by their abstraction licence(s), to another person on a permanent or temporary basis. In the majority of cases a trade will involve a change in abstraction location and/or use. We will need to approve through the issue or variation of abstraction licences.</p>

<p>In licensing trades, as with new abstraction licences, we need to make sure that we do not cause any deterioration in water body status. This is both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within the water body / bodies where the trade will take place</li>
  <li>to downstream water bodies</li>
</ul>

<p>This section provides a guide to the potential for trading in water bodies of a particular <abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr> water resource availability colour.</p>

<p><strong>Guide to potential trading based on water resource availability</strong></p>

<p><strong>Water available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Green</p>
</div>

<p>There may be opportunities to allow trades of recent actual abstraction and licensed abstraction. But little demand for trading expected within water body as water available for new abstractions.</p>

<p><strong>Restricted water available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Yellow</p>
</div>

<p>There may be opportunities for licence holders to trade up to their full licensed quantities. But the quantities of water available to trade may be restricted once levels of actual abstraction reach sustainable limits. We will not permit licence trades in water bodies where we are taking action to prevent deterioration unless the trade is consistent with achieving water body objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Water not available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Red</p>
</div>

<p>We will only trade recent actual abstraction but no increase in recent actual abstraction is permitted in water body. Licensed abstraction will be recovered for the environment.</p>

<p>Consumptive abstraction - abstraction where a significant proportion of the water is not returned either directly or indirectly to the source of supply after use. For example for the use of spray irrigation.</p>

<p>Discharge - the release of substances (for example, water, treated sewage effluent) into surface waters.</p>

<p>Environmental flow indicator - flow indicator to prevent environmental deterioration of rivers, set in line with new UK standards set by the UK Technical Advisory Group.</p>

<p>Groundwater- water that is contained in underground rocks.</p>

<p>Hands off flow - a condition attached to an abstraction licence which states that if flow (in the river) falls below the value specified on the licence, the abstractor will be required to reduce or stop the abstraction.</p>

<p>Hands off level - a condition attached to an abstraction licence which states that if the level (in the river or groundwater aquifer) falls below the value specified on the licence, the abstractor will be required to reduce or stop the abstraction.</p>

<p>Impoundment - a structure that obstructs or impedes the flow of inland water, such as a dam, weir or other constructed works.</p>

<p>Surface water - this is a general term used to describe all water features such as rivers, streams, springs, ponds and lakes.</p>

<p>Water body - units of either surface water or groundwater which we use to assess water availability.</p>
