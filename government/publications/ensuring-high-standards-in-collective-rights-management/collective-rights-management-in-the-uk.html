<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Collective Management of Copyright (EU Directive) Regulations 2016 set minimum standards for the governance, transparency, and behaviour of collective management organisations (<abbr title="Collective Management Organisation">CMOs</abbr>) established in the UK, as well as certain requirements for independent management entities (<abbr title="Independent Management Entities">IMEs</abbr>), right holders and users. The Regulations also place specific obligations on <abbr title="Collective Management Organisation">CMOs</abbr> that license the online use of musical works on a multi-territorial basis.</p>

<p>The Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>) is the National Competent Authority (<abbr title="National Competent Authority">NCA</abbr>) responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Regulations on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-collective-rights-management-directive">guidance</a> on its interpretation of the Regulations and on its approach to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-the-ipo-will-carry-out-investigation-and-enforcement-activities">investigation and enforcement</a>. The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> produces an annual report detailing its activity as the <abbr title="National Competent Authority">NCA</abbr>. This is the sixth of these reports, covering the period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Approach to regulation</strong></p>

<p>The main objective of the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> as the <abbr title="National Competent Authority">NCA</abbr> is to ensure compliance with the Regulations. The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> takes a proportionate approach in dealing with possible breaches. For example, a minor breach, or alleged breach, could be dealt with by giving the CMO the opportunity to take immediate remedial action, such as updating its procedures to prevent repetition. If there are greater concerns, then it is more likely that that the <abbr title="National Competent Authority">NCA</abbr> will deploy its powers to determine the nature and seriousness of any breach and whether enforcement action should follow. Where appropriate, sanctions can take the form of a formal compliance notice, and/or financial penalties up to £50,000.</p>

<h2>Overview of collective rights management in the UK</h2>

<p>The collective rights management landscape in the UK is well-developed and covers various sectors of the creative industries, including music, literature, art and film. During this financial year, 14 <abbr title="Collective Management Organisation">CMOs</abbr> in the UK collectively managed the rights of around 600,000 right holders and distributed almost £1bn of royalties to them. The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> has published information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/licensing-bodies-and-collective-management-organisations">licensing bodies</a> operating in the UK.</p>

<h2>Post Implementation Review</h2>

<p>In April 2021, the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> completed a post-implementation review of the Collective Management of Copyright (EU Directive) Regulations 2016, which implemented Directive 2014/26/EU on the collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use in the internal market. These reviews are a standard feature of UK legislation, usually undertaken within 5 years of coming into force.</p>

<p>The impact of the Regulations had originally been assessed as low, which meant that proportionality guidelines did not require the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> to hold a full public consultation. Instead, it conducted a series of roundtable meetings with licensing bodies, users, and bodies representing right holders and called for written evidence. The information gathered through the review pointed to a broad consensus that the aims of the Regulations remained relevant. Stakeholders supported their retention and found it beneficial to have a clear set of standards for <abbr title="Collective Management Organisation">CMOs</abbr> and <abbr title="Independent Management Entities">IMEs</abbr> to adhere to. As such, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/221/resources" rel="external">report</a> of the review concluded that the Government would retain these Regulations.</p>

<h2>Monitoring compliance and enforcement</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>’s role of monitoring compliance by regulated parties, carried out on behalf of the Secretary of State, can be divided into three main strands of activity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Reactive</h3>

<p>This section relates to the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>’s role in responding to information about possible non-compliance with the Regulations.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> has not initiated any investigations in the period covered by this report. This is because although it has had a number of approaches about possible non-compliance, no further evidence has been forthcoming when sought.</p>

<h4>Other correspondence</h4>

<p>Alongside the complaints about possible breaches of the Regulations, the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> also received around 40 complaints or queries about licensing bodies. These fell outside the scope of the Regulations and included correspondence to Government Ministers, the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>’s Information Centre, and direct complaints to the mailbox.</p>

<p>Predominantly, this correspondence concerned licensing tariffs and came from users of copyright material who typically questioned the need for a licence or wished to complain about licensing practices. Whilst these types of complaint did not engage the Regulations, they have been included here to give a broader picture of the landscape.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Proactive</h3>

<p>This section reports on the proactive monitoring of regulated parties by the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> to ensure that <abbr title="Collective Management Organisation">CMOs</abbr> are fulfilling their regulatory obligations.</p>

<p><strong>Annual General Meetings (AGMs)</strong> - <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> aims to attend all annual general meetings of <abbr title="Collective Management Organisation">CMOs</abbr> as an observer. This allows it to monitor the involvement of the <abbr title="Collective Management Organisation">CMOs</abbr>’ members in their decision-making processes, and to check that matters reserved for the <abbr title="Annual General Meetings">AGM</abbr> are dealt with there.</p>

<p><strong>Scrutiny of Annual Transparency Reports (<abbr title="Annual Transparency Reports">ATRs</abbr>)</strong> - The Regulations require each CMO to produce an Annual Transparency Report (ATR), with detailed information about its activities in the previous financial year.  The ATR allows right holders to monitor the performance of a CMO over the reporting period and the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> has provided <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/658513/Guidance_on_the_Collective_Management_of_Copyright__EU_Directive_.pdf" rel="external">guidance</a> to <abbr title="Collective Management Organisation">CMOs</abbr> on completing <abbr title="Annual Transparency Reports">ATRs</abbr>. The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> analyses <abbr title="Annual Transparency Reports">ATRs</abbr> against Regulation 21 and provides feedback and guidance to individual <abbr title="Collective Management Organisation">CMOs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Collaborative</h3>

<p>This area describes the work the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> undertakes in conjunction with regulated parties to help achieve compliance with the Regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Working groups:</strong> The <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> engages with regulated parties by offering to host working-level meetings that discuss the application of the Regulations, update attendees on any current developments, and provide a forum to raise regulatory and related issues of common interest. There are specific working groups for <abbr title="Collective Management Organisation">CMOs</abbr>, and <abbr title="Independent Management Entities">IMEs</abbr> and <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> may also meet with individual regulated entities bilaterally.</p>

<h2>Getting in touch</h2>

<p>If you wish to provide us with information about potential non-compliance with the Regulations, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:collectiverights@ipo.gov.uk">collectiverights@ipo.gov.uk.</a></p>

<p>If you wish to complain about the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> as the <abbr title="National Competent Authority">NCA</abbr>, then there is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office/about/complaints-procedure">complaints procedure</a>, that includes information about escalation to the Parliamentary Ombudsman.</p>
