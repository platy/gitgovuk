<p>The UK has around 30 million buildings and includes some of the oldest building stock in Europe.&nbsp; In total, buildings are responsible for around 30% of our national emissions.</p>

<h2>Why are we legislating?</h2>

<p>Following the UK’s departure from the EU, it is necessary that new primary powers are created to permit changes to be made to the Energy Performance of Buildings (EPB) Regulations 2012 in the Energy Security Bill, replacing powers lost with the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972 and its section 2(2).</p>

<p>The current regime derived from EU law and is reflected in the EPB Regulations 2012.</p>

<p>The EPB framework will need to play an increasingly important role if the UK is to achieve the goal of achieving the UK’s target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Energy Certificates including Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) provide consumers, building owners and occupiers and third parties with information on the performance of the building stock and support effective decisions on improving the energy efficiency of buildings.</p>

<h2>How the Bill will achieve this</h2>

<p>The Bill includes new clauses which will give the Secretary of State the power to make changes to the EPB Regulations 2012 to ensure that they are fit for purpose and reflects the UK’s ambitions on climate change. These changes relate to the assessment, certification and publication of energy certificates including new buildings and the restriction of the disposal of a building where no such assessment exists. The power also includes the power to impose new civil penalties when certificates are not provided when required by the legislation.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Will you be consulting?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the plan is to consult later this year in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Will the regulations made under the new primary powers apply to England and Wales?</strong></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In 2018 DLUHC and BEIS launched a Call for Evidence which aimed to gather evidence on the effectiveness of EPCs to gather information on the suitability of the current system of EPCs for both their current and emerging uses and to obtain feedback on suggestions for improvement. In September 2020 the EPC Action Plan was published; this listed a number of priority areas that will be taken forward to ensure that EPCs are fit for the future. Some of these actions will be implemented as part of the changes made to the EPB Regulations 2012.</p>

<p>We plan to consult on several of the proposed changes to the EPB regime and existing regulations in due course. We anticipate introducing the changes resulting from the consultation once new primary powers to amend the EPB Regulations 2012 have been introduced via the Energy Security Bill.</p>
