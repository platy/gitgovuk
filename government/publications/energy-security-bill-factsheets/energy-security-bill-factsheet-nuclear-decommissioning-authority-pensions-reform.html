<h2>Why are we legislating?</h2>

<p>These measures will bring Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (<abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>) pensions into line with wider public sector pensions in moving from a final salary scheme to a career average scheme. The new scheme was agreed with unions, and includes provision for retirement on full pension before state pension age. <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> will work with their workers, unions and pensions trustees to implement the changes.</p>

<p>This measure will ensure better equity across the Public Sector. It will also deliver savings to the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> budget which will be recycled to support the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> mission of decommissioning the UKs Nuclear Legacy.</p>

<h2>How the Bill will achieve this</h2>

<p>The Bill and subsequent secondary legislation will provide the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> with the ability to work with the trustees of relevant pension schemes in order to reform those schemes. The primary and secondary legislation will also provide for various pieces of legislation to be amended or disapplied so that the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> is able to implement the necessary reforms.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

<p><strong>How much are contributions are going up by?</strong></p>

<p>Contributions will go up by an average of 3.05% phased over 3 years.</p>

<p><strong>Will members lose pension?</strong></p>

<p>No. All contributions made are protected. These changes will only affect future pension contributions.</p>

<p><strong>Why such a delay between union agreement and implementation of legislation?</strong></p>

<p>A lack of Parliamentary time has meant this is the first opportunity to make the change.</p>

<p><strong>Is this still a good pension?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. This is still a very good pension. It allows full pension awards at 60 for the majority of members, whereas most public sector pensions are linked to state retirement age.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Government policy, led by HM Treasury, is to reform public sector pension schemes by implementing the recommendations from Lord Hutton’s review conducted in 2011. This resulted in the Public Service Pensions Act 2013, which reformed the majority of pension schemes within the public service. Over four million public sector workers have already moved to new pension arrangements and government policy is for final salary pension schemes in the public sector to be reformed to a Career Average Revalued Earnings (<abbr title="Career Average Revalued Earnings">CARE</abbr>) based scheme, in line with the Public Service Pensions Act 2013.</p>

<p>There are two final salary public sector schemes (with a total of approximately 10,160 scheme members) within the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority’s (<abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>) group that are therefore within scope for reform, with estimated savings currently expected to total in the region of £200 million subject to the date of implementation.</p>

<p>Recognising the vital work that the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> and its workforce delivers, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> worked with national trade unions in 2017 to develop an agreed pension scheme that was tailored to the characteristics of the affected <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> employees. This resulted in a proposed bespoke <abbr title="Career Average Revalued Earnings">CARE</abbr> scheme which is in line with the key principles of reforms already implemented in respect of other public sector pension schemes. The bespoke <abbr title="Career Average Revalued Earnings">CARE</abbr> scheme design was formally accepted by the national trade unions following statutory consultation with affected <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> employees and a ballot of union members.</p>

<p>Following this a public consultation was undertaken which resulted in this policy being confirmed.</p>
