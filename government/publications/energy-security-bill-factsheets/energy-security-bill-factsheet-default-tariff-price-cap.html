<p>The Default Tariff Price Cap currently protects around 22 million households.</p>

<h2>Why are we legislating?</h2>

<p>The Default Tariff Price Cap limits the amount energy suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, as well as the maximum standing charge consumers pay for access to the grids. It applies to consumers on standard variable and default tariffs.</p>

<p>It is the best safety net available to protect consumers and ensure they pay a fair price that reflects the cost of energy as we tackle the underlying factors that led to a loyalty penalty, where consumers on default tariffs were excessively charged for their energy.</p>

<p>We are legislating to enable the existing energy Price Cap to be extended beyond 2023, if the relevant conditions for extension are met. If the conditions are met and the Price Cap is extended, this will protect around 22 million households (including 4 million on prepayment meters) who are currently on default tariffs.</p>

<p>The Price Cap remains a temporary measure until competition in the market improves. If the Price Cap were to be removed without effective competition in the domestic market, there is a risk that we may see a return of the loyalty penalty, resulting in millions of households being excessively charged for their energy. Analysis by BEIS in 2021 found that if the Price Cap was to expire in 2023 in the absence of effective competition, this would be expected to have negative consequences for large numbers of customers (likely millions of households), including many in vulnerable situations.</p>

<p>We are committed to the introduction of long-term policies which enable the most competitive suppliers, who offer fair prices and good customer service, to thrive.</p>

<h2>How the Bill will achieve this</h2>

<p>We are legislating to enable the Price Cap to be extended beyond 2023 if the relevant conditions for extension are met, to ensure protection for domestic supply consumers is not removed prematurely.</p>

<p>The Price Cap will not be automatically extended. Where the Secretary of State concludes that the conditions for effective competition have not been met for domestic supply contracts, the Secretary of State must lay an affirmative statutory instrument to extend the tariff cap conditions for two years at a time. Exceptionally, the Secretary of State will also have the option to extend the cap for a single year, if they believe there is a significant prospect of the conditions for effective competition being present in the market before the end of that year.</p>

<p>There is no specified longstop date in the Bill, reflecting the need to remain flexible and keep the Price Cap in place until the conditions for effective competition for domestic supply contracts are in place.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>What else is being done to protect consumers?</strong></p>

<p>Vulnerable consumers will be protected through the extension of the Warm Home Discount Scheme, which will provide around 3 million households with a £150 rebate off their energy bills. Additionally, this government will be providing a £400 rebate for households delivered via their energy bill this autumn, which will not have to be repaid.</p>

<p>The discount is only one part of a wider package of measures to support households in 2022/23 – including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A £150 non-repayable reduction in Council Tax bills for all households in Bands A-D in England.</li>
  <li>£144 million of discretionary funding for Local Authorities to support households who need support but are not eligible for the Council Tax reduction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, on the 26 May, the Chancellor announced that we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Send over eight million pensioner households who receive the Winter Fuel Payment – an extra, one-off Pensioner Cost of Living Payment of £300.</li>
  <li>Provide a one-off Cost of Living Payment of £650 to the eight million households in receipt of means-tested benefits.</li>
  <li>Provide the 6 million people who receive non-means tested disability benefits with a one-off Disability Cost of Living Payment, worth £150.</li>
  <li>Extend the Household Support Fund, delivered by Local Authorities, by £500m from October.</li>
</ul>

<p>Improving the energy efficiency of homes is the most effective way of permanently reducing the energy bills by reducing the amount of energy required to heat the home. It can also tackle fuel poverty in the long term. This is why we have supported low income and vulnerable households with upgrading 2.2 million homes and delivering over 2.7 million energy efficiency measures via the Energy Company Obligation. We are also expanding the Energy Company Obligation to £1.0 billion per annum which will ensure energy suppliers help 133,000 low-income households a year to permanently lower their bills by an average of £290 per annum via insulation and new heating.</p>

<p><strong>What is the exit strategy for the Price Cap?</strong></p>

<p>We will publish a refresh of the retail strategy when the market has stabilised, and we are able to better assess the future of competition in the market.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The Default Tariff (Price) Cap was introduced in 2019 in response to a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) two-year investigation into the energy market, which concluded in 2016 that customers on default tariffs were being overcharged (a ‘loyalty penalty’) by £1.4 billion per year. It currently protects around 22 million, including 4 million Prepayment meter (PPM), households by limiting the unit rate energy suppliers can charge customers on default tariffs.</p>

<p>The level of the Cap is updated at least every 6 months by Ofgem and is set to represent a fair price for energy, based on the actual costs associated with generating and delivering the energy to consumers’ homes to ensure that an efficient supplier can fund its activities. Ofgem has robustly developed and widely consulted on their methodology for determining the cap level. As part of this process, Ofgem considers several factors, including the need to ensure that energy suppliers who operate efficiently are able to finance their activities.</p>

<p>Determining efficient costs is inherently challenging, but this is the product of Ofgem’s wide-ranging and in-depth benchmarking exercise. The Government has confidence in Ofgem, as the independent regulator of the Great British gas and electricity markets, to appropriately exercise its expert judgement in this regard.</p>

<p>Beyond enabling the Price Cap to be extended post 2023 if the relevant conditions for extension are met, this Bill will not change how the Cap functions or is calculated. Ofgem retains the powers and responsibilities for setting the Tariff Cap and determining the Tariff Cap conditions in the supplier licences.</p>
