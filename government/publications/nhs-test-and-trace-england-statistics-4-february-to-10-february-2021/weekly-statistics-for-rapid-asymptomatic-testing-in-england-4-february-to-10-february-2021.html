<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This statistical publication aims to provide information on rapid testing for people without COVID-19 symptoms in England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in England by test result</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in England by region</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This publication focuses on rapid testing using lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests, however polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests are included where appropriate for comparison. All data used in the report can be found in the ‘Tests conducted’ data tables on the weekly collection page.</p>

<p>This includes information on both <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests at lower tier local authority level and reports on the number of tests conducted and not the number of people tested. Individuals can be tested more than once, for more information please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dhsc-testing-and-tracing-statistics-information-for-users/dhsc-testing-and-tracing-statistics-information-for-users" class="govuk-link">information for users</a>.</p>

<p>The figures in this report include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests which were registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure. They do not currently include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted where the tests were not registered via this route. <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests for the majority of secondary care NHS staff and some testing within the private sector testing are therefore not included. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#about-this-data">About this data</a> section below for more information.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Types of tests</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests check for the genetic material of the coronavirus in the sample, which is taken using a swab and is processed in a lab via a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>). This type of test is predominantly used for anyone who has symptoms, or to confirm a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result in certain use cases, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>self-reporting LFDs<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cross channel hauliers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Lateral flow device tests</h4>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, often referred to as rapid tests, test for the presence of proteins called ‘antigens’ which are produced by the virus. They are swab tests that give results in 30 minutes or less, without the need for processing in a laboratory. These tests are primarily used for those who do not have symptoms.</p>

<p>From 21 October 2020, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were made available in limited capacity except where rapid testing pilots were conducted. Since then, their availability has expanded to a broader range of settings.</p>

<h3>Rapid testing for people without symptoms</h3>

<p>Rapid testing using <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests is currently being offered to people who do not have symptoms, in a range of different settings.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is carried out at asymptomatic test sites, which are deployed in a range of community settings such as universities, schools, care homes and workplaces. They are also set up by local authorities as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-testing-explainer/community-testing-a-guide-for-local-delivery#how-the-community-testing-programme-works">community testing program</a>. Testing at these sites is assisted: a person will take a swab test under the supervision of a trained operator who then processes the test then reads and records the result.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is carried out entirely by individuals themselves (that is an individual takes their own test, unassisted, and reports their own result), however in these specific situations (see the <a href="#types-of-test" class="govuk-link">Types of tests</a> section above) if a positive test result is returned the individual is required to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-lateral-flow-antigen-testing-for-people-without-symptoms">understanding lateral flow tests for people without symptoms</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted, England<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup>
</h2>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted has been increasing overall since their introduction in October 2020. In the latest week (4 February to 10 February), 2,400,724 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted, which is 18 times higher than mid-December.</p>

<p>In comparison, in the latest week 1,295,051 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests were conducted. This is the second successive week for which more <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted than <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. Previously the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted had always been higher than <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. This reflects the increasing use of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, as well as a decrease in symptomatic people taking a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test due to decreasing COVID-19 prevalence.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests have different uses and are therefore applied in different situations (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-test">Types of tests</a> section above for more information). The primary purpose of rapid <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is to identify people with COVID-19 who do not have symptoms. As the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted increases, more asymptomatic positive cases are identified earlier and therefore they are less likely to transmit the virus to their contacts.</p>

<p>Of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in the latest week, 7,548 tests returned a positive result and 2,389,986 tests returned a negative result. Since <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were introduced, 81,342 positive results and 10,389,473 negative results have been reported.</p>

<p>This data can be found in the ‘table_1’ and ‘table_2’ tabs of the ‘Tests conducted: 28 May 2020 to 10 February 2021 data tables’ on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-england-statistics-4-february-to-10-february-2021" class="govuk-link">weekly collection page</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by region, England</h3>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted has been increasing overall across all regions between late December 2020 and the beginning of February, however some regions have decreased slightly in the latest week. Between 4 February and 10 February 2021, the most <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted in South East followed by North West, similar to previous weeks.</p>

<h2>About this data</h2>

<p>Lateral flow device tests were first made available from 21 October 2020 in England. This data contains <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported through the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and does not include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted where the tests were not registered via this route that is used to collect data for this report.</p>

<p>The following use cases for <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are not currently reporting results digitally into Test and Trace systems, and therefore are excluded from this report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>testing for the majority of NHS secondary care staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>testing for some staff in private sector industries</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, test results should be reported directly into Public Health England. In future, all <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests will be reported via the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and will be included.</p>

<p>A full explanation of the data sources and methods used to produce these statistics can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>Data quality</h3>

<p>Given the importance of this service and the commitment of NHS Test and Trace to be open and transparent with the public it serves, this data is being released at the earliest possible opportunity. However, this data should be treated with caution whilst the understanding of the data and its quality improves.</p>

<p>The requirement for care home staff to register negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results was suspended between 31 December 2020 and 15 January 2021 inclusive, following a change in guidance issued on 23 December 2020 to increase testing in care home staff. As a result, a proportion of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted on care home staff will not be included for these dates.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test produces a result on the device almost immediately, without it being automatically recorded, therefore some results might not be captured. For settings where self-reporting <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing procedures<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link">[footnote 4]</a></sup> are in place, it is likely that the number of tests conducted are underreported. It is however their statutory duty to do so, and easier reporting tools are being rolled out to support these individuals to report their tests as quickly and efficiently as possible. It is possible that tests with a negative result are more likely to be affected, therefore it is not advisable to calculate a positivity rate with the data.</p>

<p>More information on data limitations and how the figures in this publication can and can’t be used is outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>Future developments</h3>

<p>We continue to explore the feasibility of adding new breakdowns to the publication on rapid testing to support user needs. Over the coming months, we intend to make data available on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>rapid testing for asymptomatic NHS staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rapid testing in schools, higher education and universities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rapid testing in public and private industries</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>community testing programme</p>
  </li>
</ul>
