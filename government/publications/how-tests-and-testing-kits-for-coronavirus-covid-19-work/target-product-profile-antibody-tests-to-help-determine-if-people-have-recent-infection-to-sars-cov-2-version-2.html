<h2>Target Product Profile</h2>

<h3>Antibody tests to help determine if people have immunity to SARS-CoV-2</h3>

<p>Issued by <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></p>

<h3>Version Control</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1.0 Initial document</li>
  <li>2.0 Changes to specifications, changes to introduction</li>
</ul>

<h3>The purpose of a Target Product Profile “<abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr>”</h3>

<p>Target product profiles (<abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr>) outline the desired ‘profile’ or characteristics of a target product that is aimed at a particular disease or diseases. <abbr title="Target product profiles">TPPs</abbr> state intended use, target populations and other desired attributes of products, including safety and performance-related characteristics. They provide a common foundation for the development of tests that contains sufficient detail to allow device developers and key stakeholders to understand the characteristics a test must have to be successful for the particular intended use. Included is a description of</p>

<p>(1) the preferred and</p>

<p>(2) the minimally acceptable profiles based on the intended use, setting of use, and intended user, with respect to the performance and operational characteristics expected of the target products.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Target product profiles">TPPs</abbr> for COVID-19</h3>

<p>These product profiles have been developed to assist manufacturers to design and deliver tests that might be useful in support of Pillar 3 of the UK testing strategy. How closely a product matches the <abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr> will be helpful in procurement and regulatory decision making. Any deviation from existing standards must be fully justified. Production lead time will also factor into decision making.</p>

<p>Implementation of Pillar 3 of the testing strategy relies on availability of simple antibody tests that could tell people whether they have had the virus and are now immune. Such tests require taking a small blood sample and looking for the presence of the neutralising antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. When available these tests would be used in community settings and eventually in the home. They should thus be simple, robust and have a rapid time to test result.</p>

<p>Antibody tests for other purposes are not part of this profile and might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to determine if a symptomatic individual has a reasonable likelihood of a current infection</li>
  <li>to determine if an at-risk individual with or without symptoms in an endemic setting has a reasonable likelihood of a current infection</li>
  <li>to aid in the diagnosis of a symptomatic individual with a SARS CoV-2 infection</li>
  <li>to monitor a local or sentinel population in order to obtain early indications of a COVID-19 outbreak.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that for each of these intended use scenarios, a different <abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr> could apply. As such the contents of the <abbr title="Target product profiles">TPPs</abbr> in this document are restricted to those supporting use for Pillar 3. These <abbr title="Target product profiles">TPPs</abbr> are profiles based on our best information, but the science is rapidly evolving.</p>

<h3>Clinical performance requirements</h3>

<p>This is a specification of the clinically acceptable specifications for point of care and self-tests to be made and used in the UK during the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. It sets out the clinical requirements based on the consensus of what is ‘minimally acceptable’ in the opinion of UK IVD industry, healthcare professionals and medical device regulators given the emergency situation. A test kit with other specifications than this may not be suitable to support Pillar 3 of the UK testing strategy.</p>

<p>The intended use of assays that match these profiles (or one that does not yet meet the specifications but looks promising) is to determine if an individual has previously been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (and not other coronaviruses circulating in the population), and ultimately, if they are immune. As such, the test should detect <abbr>IgG</abbr> antibodies, specific to the virus and that are neutralising in their function. As these tests are intended to be used in a community or home setting, they need to be simple and thus a lateral flow is likely to provide this solution.</p>

<p>The criteria for clinical specificity is set deliberately high in a test intended to detect immunity where the result may be given in the absence of a confirmatory test or without a known past <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (Polymerase chain reaction) positive result. In a test with low specificity, there is an unacceptable risk that a person is incorrectly told that they are immune. They may consequently be exposed to infection and be at risk of illness and may also pass that infection on to others that they come in contact with. This is particularly a concern in people from a high-risk group, or a group which is directly exposed to vulnerable persons.</p>

<p>These specification criteria are based on similar Target Product Profiles published by the World Health Organisation, <abbr title="Performance Asssessment Tool for Quality Improvement in Hospitals">PATH</abbr>, and <abbr title="Foundation for Innovative new Diagnostics">FIND</abbr> for IVDs to other diseases. Each of these organisations has extensive experience with establishing <abbr title="Target product profiles">TPPs</abbr> for simple, rapid diagnostic tests.</p>

<h3>Future developments</h3>

<p>These profiles are subject to review and change, as we gain a greater knowledge of the virus, the disease and our needs for an effective response. They may need to be updated at short notice. For instance, if it is proven that immunity is temporary and the antibody clears after a few months, it might be necessary to measure and monitor the antibody level and therefore the feature of a qualitative test may change to that for a quantitative or semi-quantitative test.</p>

<p>Antibody tests may be more useful in specific populations depending on the prevalence of antibodies. More work is needed before we can include targets for predictive values based on seroprevalence.</p>

<p>As our knowledge and understanding of the disease changes and the UK clinical needs change, so will the specifications. A test that meets this version of the <abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr> may not meet future versions.</p>

<h3>Other solutions</h3>
<p>Ideally, products should be designed to achieve as many of the optimal characteristics as are feasible, while still satisfying the minimal criteria for all defined features. However, a test that does not yet meet all these profiles may still have a role in supporting the UK testing strategy.</p>

<h3>Key</h3>

<p>Acceptable:defines the minimum acceptable feature</p>

<p>Desired:highly desirable features of considerable benefit. As time is of the essence if omitting one of these features significantly accelerates development and production it should be considered.</p>

<p>Point of care test:an in vitro diagnostic medical device intended to be used by a healthcare professional outside of a laboratory in primary or secondary care environments</p>

<p>Near patient test:an in vitro diagnostic medical device that is not intended for self-testing but is intended to be used outside of a laboratory environment</p>

<p>Self-test:an in vitro diagnostic medical device intended to be used by a layperson</p>

<h2>Annex: Assay validation</h2>

<h3>Establishing performance characteristics</h3>

<p>The following aspects should be considered when designing and validating the assay:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When available, reference material should be used to establish performance, including seroconversion panels, quality control materials and proficiency testing materials</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no currently agreed reference standard for establishing specimen immunity status. In the absence of such agreed position, it is recommended that a reference standard used for establishing truth is a composite standard, comprised of the following: “Appropriately timed specimens collected from symptomatic patients diagnosed in a laboratory with validated assays.” Technical documentation should include your rationale for your specimen characterisation and also any discrepant result analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When establishing analytical specificity, the following should be considered:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>prepandemic samples</li>
  <li>other coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2</li>
  <li>hCOV 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63 epitopes</li>
  <li>Adenovirus (e.g. C1 Ad. 71)</li>
  <li>Human metapneumovirus (hMPV)</li>
  <li>Parainfluenza virus 1 – 4</li>
  <li>Influenza A &amp; B</li>
  <li>Enterovirus (e.g. EV68)</li>
  <li>Respiratory syncytial virus</li>
  <li>Rhinovirus</li>
  <li>Chlamydia pneumoniae</li>
  <li>Haemonphilus infuenzae</li>
  <li>Legionella pneumophila</li>
  <li>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</li>
  <li>Streptococcus pneumoniae</li>
  <li>Streptococcus pyogenes</li>
  <li>Bordetella pertussis</li>
  <li>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</li>
  <li>Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP)</li>
</ul>
