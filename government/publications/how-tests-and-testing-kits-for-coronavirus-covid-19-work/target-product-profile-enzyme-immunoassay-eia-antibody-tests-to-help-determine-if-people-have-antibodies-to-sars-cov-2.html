<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) Antibody tests to help determine if people have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2</h3>

<p>Issued by <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Version Control</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1.0 Initial document</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>The purpose of a Target Product Profile “<abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr>”</h3>

<p>Target product profiles (<abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr>) outline the desired ‘profile’ or characteristics of a target product that is aimed at a particular disease or diseases. <abbr title="Target product profiles">TPPs</abbr> state intended use, target populations and other desired attributes of products, including safety and performance-related characteristics. They help guide industry development towards
desired characteristics. A <abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr> provides a common foundation for the development of tests that contains sufficient detail to allow device developers and key stakeholders to understand the characteristics a test must have to be successful for the particular intended use. Included is a description of</p>

<p>(1) the preferred and</p>

<p>(2) the minimally acceptable profiles based on the intended use, setting of use, and intended user, with respect to the performance and operational characteristics expected of the target products.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>
<abbr title="Target product profiles">TPPs</abbr> for COVID-19</h3>

<p>These product profiles have been developed to assist manufacturers to design and deliver tests that might be useful in support of Pillar 3 of the UK testing strategy. The <abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr> assists the UK government in making decisions regarding central procurement of antibody tests and might also be used in local procurement decisions. Any
deviation from existing standards must be fully justified. Production lead time will also factor into decision making.</p>

<p>Implementation of Pillar 3 of the testing strategy relies on availability of antibody tests that could tell people whether they have had the virus. Such tests usually require taking a blood sample and looking for the presence of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.</p>

<p>A positive result from this test does not guarantee immunity to COVID-19 infection and may not indicate the infectious status of the person. A negative test does not guarantee no prior COVID-19 infection. Some people may not develop an antibody response.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Clinical performance requirements</h3>

<p>This is a specification of the clinically acceptable specifications for a laboratory Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) test to be made and used in the UK during the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. It sets out the clinical requirements based on the consensus of what is ‘minimally acceptable’ in the opinion of UK IVD industry, healthcare professionals and medical device regulators given the emergency situation. A test kit with other specifications than this may not be suitable to support Pillar 3 of the UK testing strategy.</p>

<p>The intended use of assays that match these profiles (or one that does not yet meet the specifications but looks promising) is to determine if an individual has previously been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (and not other coronaviruses circulating in the population).</p>

<p>The criteria for clinical specificity is set deliberately high in a test intended to detect an antibody response where the result may be given in the absence of a known past <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (Polymerase chain reaction) positive result. In a test with low specificity, there is an unacceptable risk that a person is incorrectly told that they have made an antibody response. They may consequently be exposed to infection and be at risk of illness and may also pass that infection on to others that they come in contact with. This is particularly a concern in people from a high-risk group, or a group which isdirectly exposed to vulnerable persons.</p>

<p>Manufacturers claiming to have an assay intended to show clinical immunity, or that correlates with potential immune protection, must have scientific evidence to support the claim. They should also have made a risk assessment in line with ISO14971 for medical devices to address the intentional and unintentional use of the results of an antibody test.</p>

<p>It should be noted that a different <abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr> may be required for different case uses. Other future use cases may need to consider, for example, use of home collection of samples such as capillary blood or saliva with appropriate validation of performance and usability; or samples from hospitalised convalescent patients.</p>

<p>As such the contents of the <abbr title="Target product profiles">TPPs</abbr> in this document are restricted to those supporting use for Pillar 3. Failure to meet the criteria set out in the <abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr> does not necessarily mean that a test doesn’t have wider applications for use in the UK*. These <abbr title="Target product profiles">TPPs</abbr> are profiles based on our best information, but the science is rapidly evolving. The <abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr> is subject to review and may need to be updated at short notice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>Key</h3>

<p>Acceptable: defines the minimum acceptable feature</p>

<p>Desired: highly desirable features of considerable benefit. As time is of the essence if omitting one of these features significantly accelerates development and production it should be considered.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>
<abbr title="Target product profile">TPP</abbr> COVID-19 serology (antibody) Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) test</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Scope</h3>

<h4>Intended use</h4>

<p>To determine if an individual has made an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>Evidence for each intended use must include that which supports the specificity of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (acceptable feature) and if claim is of immunity (desired feature), that the antibodies detected are protective.</p>

<p>Each intended use must have evidence for scientific validity and include that which supports the specificity of the immune response to SARSCoV-2 Assays intended to show an immune response that correlates with potential immune protection must either explicitly measure neutralising antibodies or measure binding antibodies that have a proven correlation with neutralising titre.</p>

<h4>Target population</h4>

<p>Desired: to determine possible immune protection against SARS-CoV-2</p>

<p>Acceptable: people who may have recovered from suspected or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection or may have previously developed an asymptomatic infection</p>

<h4>Target user</h4>

</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
  <li>a kit containing all lot specific material required for testing.

<span class="number">3. </span>Annex: Assay validation</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Establishing performance characteristics</h3>

<p>The following aspects should be considered when designing and validating the assay:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When available, reference material should be used to establish performance, including seroconversion panels, quality control materials and proficiency testing materials</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no currently agreed reference standard for establishing specimen immunity status. In the absence of such agreed position, it is recommended that a reference standard used for establishing truth is a composite standard, comprised of the following: “Appropriately timed specimens collected from symptomatic patients diagnosed in a laboratory with validated assays.” Technical documentation should include your rationale for your specimen characterisation and also any discrepant result analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When establishing analytical specificity, the following should be considered:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>prepandemic samples (specimens collected at least 6 months before the known appearance of the SARSCoV-2 virus)</li>
  <li>other coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2</li>
  <li>hCOV 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63 epitopes</li>
  <li>Adenovirus (e.g. C1 Ad. 71)</li>
  <li>Human metapneumovirus (hMPV)</li>
  <li>Parainfluenza virus 1 – 4</li>

  <li>Streptococcus pyogenes</li>
  <li>Bordetella pertussis</li>
  <li>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</li>
  <li>Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP)</li>
</ul>

<p>Potential interferents may originate from the following endogenous and exogenous
sources:</p>

<p>Endogenous substances</p>

<ul>
  <li>Haemoglobin</li>
  <li>Bilirubin</li>
  <li>Protein</li>
  <li>Triglycerides</li>
