<h2>Target Product Profile: Point of Care SARS-CoV-2 Detection Tests</h2>

<h3>Version control</h3>

<h4>Version</h4>
<p>1.0</p>

<h4>Date issued</h4>
<p>15th June 2020</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Initial document</p>

<h3>The purpose of a Target Product Profile (<abbr title="target product profiles">TPP</abbr>)</h3>
<p>Target product profiles (<abbr title="target product profiles">TPP</abbr>) outline the desired ‘profile’ or characteristics of a target product that is aimed at a particular disease or diseases. TPPs state intended use, target populations and other desired attributes of products, including safety and performance-related characteristics. They help guide industry development towards desired characteristics. A <abbr title="target product profiles">TPP</abbr> provides a common foundation for the development of tests and contains sufficient detail to allow device developers and key stakeholders to understand the characteristics a test must have to be successful for the particular intended use. Included is a description of (1) the preferred and (2) the minimally acceptable profiles based on the intended use, setting of use, and intended user, with respect to the performance and operational characteristics expected of the target products. As new scientific evidence is generated, this <abbr title="target product profiles">TPP</abbr> may require further review and revision.</p>

<h3>TPPs for COVID-19</h3>
<p>These product profiles have been developed to assist manufacturers to design and deliver tests that might be useful in support of the UK COIVD-19 testing strategy. How closely a product matches the profile may inform procurement and regulatory decision making. Any deviation from existing standards must be fully justified. Production lead time may also factor into decision making. Implementation of the testing strategy will be enhanced by parallel testing capability offered through the availability of point of care tests (POCT) that can quickly detect the SARs-CoV-2 virus in a near patient setting, allowing health and care professionals to efficiently triage patients depending on their likelihood of being infected.</p>

<p>Such tests require taking a small sample of bodily fluid and looking for the presence of viral nucleic acids or antigens specific to SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. When available these tests could be used across the broad spectrum of health and care settings and eventually in non-healthcare contexts, such as schools, airports and prisons. They should thus be safe, simple, robust and have a rapid time to test result.</p>

<p>Point of Care SARS-CoV-2 tests for other purposes are not part of this profile and
might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to provide a confirmatory diagnosis of patient’s current SARS-CoV-2 infection status</li>
  <li>to prognose a patient’s likely outcome, including disease severity or survival</li>
  <li>to predict or monitor a patient’s likely response to treatment</li>
  <li>to differentially diagnose SARs-CoV-2 from other common febrile or influenzalike disease pathogens, through the use of a multiplex assays</li>
  <li>rapid laboratory tests to augment clinical laboratory capacity and turn around time</li>
  <li>self-tests to be performed by a lay individual</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that for each of these intended use scenarios, a different <abbr title="target product profiles">TPP</abbr> could apply. As such the contents of the TPPs in this document are restricted. These TPPs are profiles based on our best information, but the science and use requirements are rapidly evolving. Manufacturers should ensure they are working to the most recent <abbr title="target product profiles">TPP</abbr> and the most recent science</p>

<h3>Clinical performance requirements</h3>
<p>This is a specification of the clinically acceptable performance requirements for point of care SARS-CoV-2 viral detection tests. It sets out the clinical requirements based on the consensus of what is ‘minimally acceptable’ in the opinion of UK IVD industry, healthcare professionals and medical device regulators given the emergency situation. A test kit with other specifications than this may not be suitable to support the UK testing strategy.</p>

<p>The intended use of assays that match these profiles (or one that does not yet meet the specifications but looks promising) is to aid in the triage of patients with a current SARS-CoV-2 infection by detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids or antigens in human samples.</p>

<p>The acceptable criteria for clinical sensitivity and specificity are an initial estimate of minimally acceptable performance based on current expert opinion in a potentially limited number of use cases. <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/dx-use-cases/">Examples of potential use cases of such devices from FIND</a>.</p>

<p>To ensure ongoing public safety and value for money, procurement and deployment of tests should take into account consideration of the specific clinical decision and pathway changes the test is being used to make, the current and future prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 within the intended test population, as well as the potential consequences of false positives and false negatives. For example, the acceptable clinical sensitivity and specificity may need to be higher for some uses of the tests. For example, in populations with a low prevalence of COVID-19 even higher specificity may be needed to prevent the probability that a positive test result is a true positive (positive predictive value) from being unacceptably low.</p>

<p>Annex 2 provides tables which may be useful in supporting decision making, by demonstrating the impact of changing sensitivity, specificity and prevalence on the numbers of false positives and negatives. For example, tests with a low sensitivity may have limited utility in ruling-out SARS-CoV-2 in patients, especially if rule-out may expose others to infection. Similarly, tests with a low specificity may have limited utility in ruling-in SARS-CoV-2 in patients, especially if this may expose uninfected patients to infection, for example by being transferred to a COVID ward.</p>

<p>When used for triage, it may be possible to reduce the potentially harmful consequences of an insensitive or unspecific test, by confirming negative or positive <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> results using a more accurate, but slower diagnostic test, such as conventional lab based methods. The advantage of the <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> test here could be that at least a proportion of people with, or without, COVID-19 can be managed faster than relying on conventional lab based testing alone.</p>

<p>These specification criteria are based on similar Target Product Profiles published by the World Health Organisation, PATH, and FIND for IVDs to other diseases. Each of these organisations has extensive experience with establishing TPPs for simple, rapid diagnostic tests.</p>

<h3>Future developments</h3>

<p>These profiles are subject to review and change, as we gain a greater knowledge of the virus, the disease and our needs for an effective response. They may need to be updated at short notice.</p>

<p>As our knowledge and understanding of the disease changes and the UK clinical needs change, so will the specifications. A test that meets this version of the <abbr title="target product profiles">TPP</abbr> may not meet future versions. When assessing options of available test refer to the latest version of <abbr title="target product profiles">TPP</abbr> published.</p>

<p>As the market matures, it is expected that test formats will adapt – for example, SARS-CoV-2 may be included in respiratory panels or the target user may include people other than healthcare professionals or tests requiring less maintenance may become available.</p>

<p>It is also expected that as more well curated and well characterised samples become available, then test performance can be established on higher numbers of samples.</p>

<h3>Other solutions</h3>
<p>Ideally, products should be designed to achieve as many of the optimal characteristics as are feasible, while still satisfying the minimal criteria for all defined features. However, a test that does not yet meet all these profiles may still have a role in supporting the UK testing strategy.</p>

<p>Access to a UK-wide, sufficiently constituted panel of samples (saliva, urine, blood) would be helpful in delivering evaluations.</p>

<p>This could mean either
1. sufficient samples to assess analytical performance – including highly characterised SARS-CoV-2 calibration and control materials and samples containing likely interferent or cross-reactants.
2. a standard set of samples to validate the clinical performance of a test, selected to represent a UK population that the test will be used in.</p>

<h2>Annex 1: Assay validation</h2>

<h3>Establishing performance characteristics</h3>
<p>It is recommended that the following aspects are considered when designing and validating the assay.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reference material should be used to establish performance, including standard validation panels, quality control materials and proficiency testing materials</li>
  <li>When establishing analytical specificity, the following should be considered:
    <ul>
      <li>Prepandemic samples,</li>
      <li>other coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1,</li>
      <li>hCoV 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63 epitopes</li>
      <li>Adenovirus (e.g. C1 Ad. 71)</li>
      <li>Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV)</li>
      <li>Parainfluenza virus 1-4</li>
      <li>Influenza A &amp; B</li>
      <li>Enterovirus (e.g. EV68)</li>
      <li>Respiratory syncytial virus</li>
      <li>Rhinovirus</li>
      <li>Chlamydia pneumoniae</li>
      <li>Haemophilus influenzae</li>
      <li>Legionella pneumophila</li>
      <li>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</li>
      <li>Streptococcus pneumoniae</li>
      <li>Streptococcus pyogenes</li>
      <li>Bordetella pertussis</li>
      <li>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</li>
      <li>Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Potential interferents may originate from the following endogenous and exogenous sources and may be more relevant to ligand-binding based antigen tests than conventional PCR based assays.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Endogenous substances</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Hemoglobin</li>
  <li>Bilirubin</li>
  <li>Protein</li>
  <li>Triglycerides</li>
  <li>Hematocrit</li>
  <li>Rheumatoid Factor</li>
  <li>Antibodies developed against protein expression system used to generate recombinant antigens</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exogenous substances</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Medications most often prescribed in the patient population for which the test is ordered</li>
  <li>Recommended anticoagulants e.g. EDTA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annex 2: Diagnostic accuracy considerations</h2>

<p>When considering procurement and deployment of devices for any given clinical usecase, it is recommended to consider the maximum number of false positives and false negatives that would be acceptable for the new test based on the possible consequences of these misdiagnoses.</p>

<p>The table below presents the numbers of false positves and negatives in a cohort of fixed size (10,000) with varying prevalence of COVID-19 (NPV/PPV rounded to nearest whole number). Therefore, for a test with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 95%:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">COVID-19 prevalence</th>
      <th scope="col" style="text-align: right">False positives</th>
      <th scope="col">Positive predictive value (proportion of people with positive results who have COVID-19)</th>
      <th scope="col">False negatives</th>
      <th scope="col">Negative predictive value (proportion of people with negative results that don’t have COVID-19)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1%</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">495</td>
      <td>14%</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>100%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5%</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">475</td>
      <td>46%</td>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>99%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10%</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">450</td>

      <td>98%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>94%</td>
      <td>1000</td>
      <td>83%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It should also be noted that sensitivity and specificity values estimated in a particular population (i.e. intensive care patients) may not be generalisable to other populations (i.e. general practice) with a different prevalence of COVID-19, if these populations are made up of people with less or more severe COVID-19. For example, accuracy estimates generated in a population of people with early symptoms of COVID-19 may be higher, due to viral load, than a test would achieve in a population of people with no symptoms of the condition.</p>
