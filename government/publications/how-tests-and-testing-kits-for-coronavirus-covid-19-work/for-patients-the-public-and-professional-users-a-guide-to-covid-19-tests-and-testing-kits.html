<h2>Types of test</h2>

<h3>Virus test</h3>
<p>These tests (sometimes called ‘swab’ or ‘antigen’ tests) check to see if you are currently infected with the virus.</p>

<p>The swab sample is taken from your nose and throat.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a saliva sample might be used.</p>

<p>This sample is then tested to see if you have the virus.</p>

<h4>Lateral flow antigen test or rapid antigen test</h4>
<p>Lateral flow antigen tests are rapid turnaround virus tests that can process COVID-19 samples on site without the need for laboratory equipment, with most generating easy-to-understand results in under half an hour. Because of this, they can be performed in a laboratory or a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work/target-product-profile-point-of-care-sars-cov-2-detection-tests">point of care</a> setting.</p>

<p>Public Health England (PHE) and the University of Oxford have recently carried out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oxford-university-and-phe-confirm-high-sensitivity-of-lateral-flow-tests">extensive clinical evaluation studies</a> on lateral flow tests.</p>

<p>In the UK, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-issues-exceptional-use-authorisation-for-nhs-test-and-trace-covid-19-self-test-device">the MHRA has granted NHS Test &amp; Trace an exceptional use authorisation</a> to use certain lateral flow devices as self-tests to detect infection in asymptomatic individuals who otherwise would not be tested. For more information, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#self-testing">section on self-testing</a>.</p>

<h3>Antibody tests</h3>
<p>These tests check for antibodies to see if you have had an infection with the virus in the past. This test requires a blood sample.</p>

<p>This sample is then tested to see if you have had the virus in the past.</p>

<p>Antibody tests are currently only offered to NHS and care staff, as well as some hospital patients and care home residents. They can also be bought privately, but it’s important to be aware of their limitations.</p>

<p>These tests are not used for diagnosis but rather to give us a better understanding of the prevalence of the virus in different places.</p>

<h2>Sample collection kits</h2>
<p>A sample collection ‘kit’ is the name given to the different parts of a COVID-19 test that help obtain a ‘sample’. This kit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking">must have a valid CE, CE UKNI or UKCA mark</a> to show that the manufacturer has met the minimum safety and performance requirements for the product.</p>

<p>The sample you have to provide, and whether or not you can collect that sample yourself, will depend on what type of test you are having.</p>

<p>Please note that not all sample types have been proven to be effective in COVID-19 testing.</p>

<h3>Virus test samples</h3>
<p>This type of test usually involves collecting a ‘swab’ sample from the nose, mouth, and/or throat. A swab is a small piece of soft, absorbent material on a plastic stick.</p>

<p>Some virus tests use saliva samples, collected into a small container, to check for the virus. However, this type of sampling is not yet done routinely in the UK.</p>

<p>You may collect swab and saliva samples at home yourself (this can also be referred to as ‘self-sampling’), or you can get a healthcare professional to do it. The sample is then sent to a laboratory to check for genetic material from the virus.</p>

<p>Swab self-sampling kits are currently being rolled out at scale by the government to anyone with symptoms. You can access self-sampling kits through the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/" class="govuk-link">NHS test and trace programme</a>.</p>

<p>If you are using a virus self-test, for example a lateral flow antigen self-test, you would not send the sample to a laboratory because the test can generate the results for you. For more information, please see the <a href="#self-testing" class="govuk-link">section on self-testing</a>.</p>

<h3>Antibody test samples</h3>
<p>This type of test uses a blood sample, which can be collected in several ways.</p>

<p>Some antibody test kits require a venous (from the vein) blood sample, which can only be collected by a healthcare professional or qualified person.</p>

<p>Other antibody test kits require a smaller amount of blood to be taken. This type of sample is taken from a capillary via a finger prick blood sample. In certain cases, you may be required to then put this sample on special paper to dry – this is known as a dried blood spot (DBS). When only a small amount of blood is required, you may collect the blood sample at home yourself, or you can get a healthcare professional to do it.</p>

<p>Both capillary and venous blood samples are sent to a laboratory to check for antibodies.</p>

<h3>Concerns about the use of sample collection kits</h3>
<p>Anyone using a sample collection kit to test for COVID-19 must read the instruction leaflet carefully. It is very important that you have a clear understanding of the process because if the sample is not collected properly, the result may not be accurate.</p>

<p>If you have any concerns with the sample collection kit or any of its parts, please contact the kit provider for advice. If there are any components missing, the provider should be able to send you a replacement to ensure you are able to use the kit safely.</p>

<p>If something in the kit is difficult to use or breaks when you use it, please report the problem immediately via our <a href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Coronavirus Yellow Card website</a>.</p>

<p>If you are unsure what a test result means, or what you should or should not do once you have received your test result, speak to your doctor or a healthcare professional.</p>

<h2>Self-testing</h2>
<p>A self-test kit is one in which you take a sample, test it yourself, and then read and interpret the results yourself as well. This is different from self-sampling where the sample is taken at home but then sent to a laboratory for testing.</p>

<h3>Lateral flow antigen self-tests</h3>

<p>In the UK, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-issues-exceptional-use-authorisation-for-nhs-test-and-trace-covid-19-self-test-device" class="govuk-link">MHRA has granted NHS Test &amp; Trace an exceptional use authorisation</a> to use certain lateral flow devices as self-tests to detect infection in people who do not have any COVID-19 symptoms and who may not otherwise have been tested.</p>

<p>This means that the tests can be used by a member of the public with no previous experience of testing, in their own home or another community setting such as a place of work.</p>

<p>If you get a positive result from these self-tests, it is extremely likely you are currently infected with COVID-19 and risk infecting others. It is very important that you follow the information in the instructions for use provided with the kit. You must report your result to the NHS through one of the methods detailed in the instructions for use. When you report your result, you will be provided with further information on the next steps to take.</p>

<p>If you get a negative result from these self-tests, it may mean that you are infectious but the test has not been able to detect it. Therefore, if you test negative you must continue to follow national and local rules and guidelines including regular handwashing, social distancing and wearing face coverings, where required.</p>

<p>These tests can only be distributed by the NHS Test and Trace programme, from a government authorised process. To make sure that you perform the test correctly and get an accurate result from this test, you must read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use that come with the testing kit. You should only take the self-test if you are sure you understand the instructions. If you don’t follow the instructions from the manufacturer, it could mean that the test doesn’t work properly, and the results are not valid.</p>

<h3>Concerns about the use of ethylene oxide in sterilising test swabs</h3>

<p>The MHRA is aware of concerns about the safety of using ethylene oxide (EO) to sterilise the swabs used in coronavirus testing kits (including lateral flow tests).</p>

<p>Ethylene oxide is a gas that is commonly used to sterilise many different types of medical devices, including swabs used in test kits.</p>

<p>The sterilisation process consists of a number of highly controlled and monitored stages, including removing ethylene oxide after treating the swabs. The amount of residual EO that is allowed has been set (by the international standard ISO 10993-7:2008) according to contact time of the medical device with the person. Contact time is divided into 3 categories: limited, prolonged, and permanent duration.</p>

<p>The swabs used in lateral flow test kits fall under the category of limited contact time. These limits are not further divided by body weight and therefore the limits set are also applicable for children.</p>

<p>These allowable limits were selected to ensure that any residual levels present on the medical device after sterilisation pose minimal risk.</p>

<p>The average time of contact for a single test (around 20 seconds) and the current testing regime (twice a week), means that each person is exposed to any residue on the swab for around 40 seconds per week. Calculating from the allowed residues, a person would need to be tested twice a week for over 40 years for the total contact time to be in a higher contact category. Therefore, the manufacturer’s original calculations that these swabs are in the ‘limited’ contact category are still valid for the current testing regime.</p>

<p>In the highly unlikely event that a swab does contain a residual amount above the allowable limit, the risk to the user is still considered to be very low.</p>

<p>As part of the sterilisation process the manufacturer must confirm, and document, that the residual EO level on a medical device is below the specified allowable limit before the device is packaged ready for use. The whole process is overseen by an independent third-party organisations before a CE/CE UKNI/UKCA mark can be placed on the medical device. The identifying number of the third party can be found next to the CE/UKCA mark symbol on the packaging of the swab.</p>

<h2>Limitations of COVID-19 tests</h2>
<p>No test is 100% reliable, even those who meet regulatory standards for performance and safety. The results are also only relevant to that sample at that point in time.</p>

<p>If you are unsure what a test result means, or what you should or should not do once you have received your test result, you should first contact the provider of the test and if you remain unsure then speak to your GP or a healthcare professional.</p>

<p>It’s important to understand the limitations of COVID-19 tests, because an incorrect or misinterpreted result can lead to a false sense of reassurance. For example, if you are infected with the virus but the test you use produces a false negative result (it says you do not have the virus even though you do), you may unknowingly spread the virus to other people or not seek the treatment you may need.</p>

<p>Antibody testing in particular has limitations, largely because there is a lot we don’t yet know about immunity to COVID-19. For example, we don’t yet know whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>antibodies protect you from getting COVID-19 in the future</li>
  <li>antibodies stop you from passing the virus on to others</li>
  <li>having a negative antibody test means you have never been infected</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the reliability (sometimes referred to as ‘sensitivity’) of the test in the label or instructions provided with the testing kit.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 testing services</h2>
<p>Virus tests are available via the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/get-a-test-to-check-if-you-have-coronavirus/">NHS Test and Trace programme</a>. They may also be provided by some UK employers, occupational health and other private healthcare providers.</p>

<p>More information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-and-procurement-of-coronavirus-covid-19-tests/coronavirus-covid-19-serology-and-viral-detection-testing-uk-procurement-overview" class="govuk-link">private testing</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing">private providers</a> is also available.</p>

<p>Antibody tests are currently only offered to NHS and care staff, as well as some hospital patients and care home residents. They can also be bought privately. However, it’s important to be aware that the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/news/gphc-position-covid-19-rapid-antibody-tests" rel="external">General Pharmaceutical Council have advised pharmacies not to offer rapid antibody testing</a>.</p>

<h3>Testing for international travel</h3>
<p>Individuals wishing to travel abroad or return to the UK are required to undertake a private coronavirus test.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing#general-testing" class="govuk-link">More information about ‘fit-to-fly’ tests and Test to Release</a>.</p>

<p>PCR tests and/or lateral flow antigen self-tests may be offered by testing providers for this purpose.</p>

<p>The MHRA is aware that non-compliant lateral flow antigen tests might be offered by some of the providers. If a lateral flow antigen test is marketed for self-testing, but does not have a 4-digit identifier number next to the CE, CE UKNI or UKCA mark symbol on the packaging, it is not compliant with the regulations required for self-testing. It may be a professional use test.</p>

<p>The MHRA has issued <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work/for-industry-and-manufactures-covid-19-tests-and-testing-kits#common-terms-related-to-covid-19-testing">guidance</a> explaining that ‘professional use’ tests should not be used by members of the public even if they are supervised via a video link.</p>

<p>When choosing a self-test to purchase, members of the public are advised to consider the information about the test offered by the testing service provider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is there a CE, CE UKNI or UKCA mark and a 4-digit identifier number for the Approved Body on the packaging?</li>
  <li>Are the instructions provided on how to take the test clear?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask for further information about the test from the provider if you are unsure.</p>

<p>If you suspect a professional test is being sold or has been sold to you for self-testing, you can report this via <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">the Coronavirus Yellow card reporting site</a> - see <a href="#report" class="govuk-link">section on how to report below</a>.</p>

<h2>How COVID-19 testing is regulated</h2>

<p>Sample collection kits and the COVID-19 tests are medical devices. For a medical device to be safe to use, it must have a valid CE, CE UKNI or UKCA mark. These marks are a declaration by the manufacturer that the test meets the required standards of safety and performance.</p>

<p>These regulatory requirements aim to ensure that the products do not compromise the safety of patients and users and are designed and manufactured to achieve the performance specified by the manufacturer for the stated purpose.</p>

<p>CE, CE UKNI and UKCA marks are not issued by the MHRA. They are placed on the product by the manufacturer. Before the product can sold in the UK the manufacturer or their UK Responsible Person (UKRP) must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-medical-devices-to-place-on-the-market" class="govuk-link">register</a> it with the MHRA.</p>

<p>Tests specifically used for self-testing will need to have been deemed acceptable for CE/CE UKNI/UKCA marking by an Approved or Notified Body or have been granted an Exceptional Use Authorisation by the MHRA. This is indicated by a CE, CE UKNI or UKCA mark and a 4-digit identifier number next to the CE mark symbol on the packaging. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-devices-given-exceptional-use-authorisations-during-the-covid-19-pandemic">Tests which have been granted an Exceptional Use Authorisation</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of lateral flow antigen self-tests which have now received CE certification from an EU notified body.</p>

<p>The MHRA administers and enforces the law on medical devices in the UK and has a range of investigatory and enforcement powers to ensure the safety and performance of medical devices in the UK.</p>

<p>For more information, please read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/in-vitro-diagnostic-medical-devices-guidance-on-legislation" class="govuk-link">guidance on how In Vitro medical devices such as these are regulated</a>.</p>
