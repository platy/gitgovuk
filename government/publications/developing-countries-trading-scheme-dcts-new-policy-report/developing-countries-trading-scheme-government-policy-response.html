<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p><strong>Foreword from Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Secretary of State for the Department for International Trade.</strong></p>

<p>We are launching the Developing Countries Trading Scheme to harness the power of trade to help developing countries grow and prosper.  The new scheme offers developing countries one of the most generous sets of trading preferences of any country in the world. The scheme demonstrates the UK’s commitment to building long term, mutually beneficial relationships with emerging economies that are home to more than 3.3 billion people.</p>

<p>The Developing Countries Trading Scheme is a major milestone in growing free and fair trade with developing nations. The Developing Countries Trading Scheme applies to 65 countries, offering lower tariffs and simpler rules of origin requirements for exporting to the UK. The scheme helps countries to diversify their exports and grow their economies, while British households and businesses benefit from lower prices and more choice.</p>

<p>The public has helped to shape the Developing Countries Trading Scheme, with 300 consultation responses from individuals, businesses and developing countries. The consultation demonstrated the UK’s resolve to improve on our market access offer to developing countries. We are using our status as an independent trading nation to go beyond what is offered by the European Union (EU).</p>

<p>The Developing Countries Trading Scheme cuts administrative costs for businesses by reducing more tariffs and bringing more countries in scope of the most generous tariff reductions. It also cuts red tape for developing countries, for example by simplifying rules of origin requirements for the least developed nations. This helps the world’s poorest countries to export to the UK and play a more active part in fast growing global supply chains.</p>

<p>It also helps lower costs for UK businesses, leading to lower prices for consumers across a range of everyday products, by reducing tariffs on imports from low income and lower-middle income countries. Increasing trade and decreasing tariffs is another way the government is supporting businesses and individuals with cost-of-living increases.</p>

<p>I would like to thank all those who took the time to contribute to the creation of the Developing Countries Trading Scheme.</p>

<p>The government is committed to an inclusive and transparent tariff policy, so today, I am publishing our response to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/designing-the-uk-trade-preferences-scheme-for-developing-nations">Developing Countries Trading Scheme consultation</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The government is introducing the Developing Countries Trading Scheme (<abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>) to improve access to the UK market for developing countries. The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> will come into effect in early 2023. In line with the government’s new International Development Strategy, the scheme contributes to developing countries’ integration into the global economy, creating stronger trade and investment partners for the future, and strengthening supply chains. It grows free and fair trade with developing countries, boosting the economy and supporting jobs in those countries, as well as in ours.</p>

<p>The objectives guiding the design of the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> include making the new scheme simpler for partner countries and businesses to understand and use. The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> aims to support sustainable growth in developing countries through a more generous unilateral offer. The new scheme also aims to demonstrate the UK’s leadership in the use of trade for development. This has led to provisions in the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> which reduce tariffs, liberalise rules of origin requirements and simplify the conditions attached to the scheme.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> applies to countries that currently benefit under the UK’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences (<abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>), (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-one">Annex 1</a> for further information). The <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> includes 47 countries in the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Least Developed Country (<abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr>) Framework and 18 additional countries or territories classified by the World Bank as low income (LIC) and lower-middle income (LMIC). It does not apply to countries classified by the World Bank as upper-middle income for 3 consecutive years, or to <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr> with a free trade agreement (<abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr>) with the UK.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> has been developed in consultation with businesses, civil society, partner nations and the general public. As part of its inclusive and transparent trade policy, the government conducted a public consultation from 19 July until 12 September 2021. In total, the government received 300 individual submissions, including 280 GOV.UK questionnaire responses and 20 email submissions. Respondents were categorised into 5 groups: individuals, businesses, business associations, non-governmental organisations and public sector bodies.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> consultation questionnaire had 4 sections, covering rules of origin, tariffs, goods graduation and conditions. The use of a digital tool allowed respondents to comment on individual commodity codes and specify whether the current <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> tariff rate should be retained, reduced or removed.</p>

<p>The consultation received domestic and international interest and expertise from a wide range of individuals and organisations. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/designing-the-uk-trade-preferences-scheme-for-developing-nations">Statement of Direction</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/designing-the-uk-trade-preferences-scheme-for-developing-nations">information pack</a> that accompanied the consultation provided respondents with information on the government’s proposals and wider details on the preference scheme. The full analysis of the responses to the consultation is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/designing-the-uk-trade-preferences-scheme-for-developing-nations">UK trade preferences scheme for developing countries: summary of responses</a>.</p>

<p>This document sets out the government’s policy response and is organised in 4 sections, covering rules of origin, tariffs, goods graduation and conditions. Each section describes how the consultation findings helped inform government policy.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Consultation summary</h2>

<p>Overall, respondents to the consultation were supportive of the government’s proposals for the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> as set out in the Statement of Direction. The full analysis of the responses to the consultation is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/designing-the-uk-trade-preferences-scheme-for-developing-nations">UK trade preferences scheme for developing countries: summary of responses</a>. The main findings are summarised here and referenced in each section of this policy response.</p>

<p>The main consultation findings are as follows:</p>

<h3>Rules of origin</h3>

<p>Most respondents favoured increasing the permitted levels of non-originating content and expanding the provisions for cumulation for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>, in line with the policy direction indicated in the Statement of Direction. Opinions were more closely balanced between those favouring or opposing liberalisation of existing product specific rules (<abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Tariffs</h3>

<p>Most respondents supported reducing tariffs for goods from <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr> in line with the Statement of Direction and the UK’s broader policy goals of trade liberalisation. <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> already benefit from tariff reductions on everything but arms and ammunition. Some concerns were voiced about new tariff reductions eroding the existing preferential margins that <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> benefit from and, in some instances, <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr> that receive enhanced preferences.</p>

<h3>Goods graduation</h3>

<p>Many respondents supported proposed goods graduation measures which protect preference margins for less competitive goods from other developing countries.</p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>

<p>Of those who responded on the conditionality elements of <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>, the majority thought the impact of these conditions was negative for exports and business. With regard to the conditions which enable eligible countries to benefit from the more generous preferences in the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework, a clear majority of those who opted to respond were in favour of simpler requirements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> summary</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> is one of the most generous preferences schemes in the world. It provides duty-free, quota-free trade to <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> on everything but arms and duty-free, quota-free trade on 85% of eligible goods to most <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr>. The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> will replace the UK’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences (<abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>) in early 2023.</p>

<p>The government is introducing a new list of more liberal <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> designed solely for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>. The scheme has tailored rules and avoids using overly restrictive requirements so that <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> are easier for businesses to understand and use. The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> also expands cumulation for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> to allow extended cumulation with other <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> countries and countries with Economic Partnership Agreements (<abbr title="economic partnership agreements">EPAs</abbr>) with the UK.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> This makes it easier for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> to participate in regional and global supply chains serving the UK.</p>

<p>The government is making more goods eligible for tariff reductions and tariff removals for <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr> and simplifying the tariff schedule to get rid of nuisance tariffs and some seasonal tariffs. Goods that are being brought in scope of the scheme include tomatoes, olive oil, animal feed and pet food ingredients.</p>

<p>The government is applying a narrower basis for goods graduation, ensuring that only goods which are genuinely competitive are graduated out of the scheme. The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> reduces and simplifies the threshold of when products graduate and bases goods graduation decisions on UK import data. The interests of <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and our <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> partners are also protected.</p>

<p>The government is granting access to enhanced preferences based purely on the economic vulnerability of <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr>. This approach is more generous, with 8 countries (Algeria, Congo, Cook Islands, Micronesia, Nigeria, Niue, Syria, Tajikistan) becoming immediately eligible for enhanced preferences. The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> retains powers to suspend a country on the grounds of human rights and labour rights violations and broadens these powers to include violations in relation to anti-corruption, climate change and environment conventions.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Finally, the government is renaming the tiers of preferences within the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> Framework is the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Comprehensive Preferences. The <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework is the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences. The <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework is the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Standard Preferences. This is intended to reflect the UK’s offer in each tier and the progression of most countries as their economies grow from <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Comprehensive Preferences to <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences and then <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Standard Preferences.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Rules of origin</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Rules of origin (RoOs) are used to determine where goods are ‘from’, for example, where they have been produced or had substantial work done to them. This is used in determining appropriate tariff rates, access to preferential trade arrangements or application of trade sanctions.</p>

<p>Rules of origin provide the criteria for testing whether a good can be considered to have been produced in a particular country. They determine whether a good qualifies for any reduction in tariffs.</p>
</div>

<p>The government is committed to supporting <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> by providing one of the most generous preferential schemes in the world through both low tariffs and simpler <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> already receive duty-free, quota-free access for all products other than arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>Therefore, improvements for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> in the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> are being made through the simplification of <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr> by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>simplifying and liberalising <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>extending cumulation</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> make up around 13% of the world’s population but only account for around 1% of global trade in goods. Addressing barriers to trade such as <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr> can be an effective way to support <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> entering global value chains. Simpler <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr> can increase trade with the UK, increase the manufacturing capacity of <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and encourage economic development. The UK also benefits from supporting <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> in this way which strengthens supply chains, making them more resilient to economic shocks. <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> integration can support greater consumer choice and lower consumer prices in the UK. Addressing barriers to trade makes it easier for UK and overseas partners to bring goods into the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Product specific rules (<abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr>)</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>PSRs are the list of processing rules a product needs to meet to be considered as originating from the country that claims preferential tariff rates. The set of rules changes depending on the type of product.</p>
</div>

<h4>Current position</h4>

<p>Most of the existing <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> apply to both <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and other <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries, except for some products in the chemical, textile, apparel and machinery sectors which have <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> specific rules.</p>

<p>In the public consultation, the majority of respondents were in favour of liberalising and relaxing <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr>. Of those who expressed views, the majority would prefer higher non-originating content rules. Of those who did not agree with this proposal, half disagreed on the basis that it could provide an unfair advantage to <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and undermine the preferences of <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework and <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework countries. Some respondents also highlighted the difficulty of calculating the value of non-originating content due to the nature of the product concerned or complexity of the rules for doing so.</p>

<p>To design the new scheme, a review was undertaken of the <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> in existing UK <abbr title="free trade agreements">FTAs</abbr> and <abbr title="economic partnership agreements">EPAs</abbr> along with a review of <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> trade volumes with the UK. Where a more generous precedent <abbr title="product specific rule">PSR</abbr> was identified, this has largely been implemented in the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>. For sensitive UK products, an exception has been made and the current <abbr title="product specific rule">PSR</abbr> has been maintained.</p>

<p>The government shares respondents’ views on the need to protect <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> preferences and is therefore not revising the <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> for other <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> beneficiaries. The government also shares respondents’ view on the complexity of calculating non-originating content and is therefore introducing simpler alternatives to the value-added rule.</p>

<h4>New policy</h4>

<p>The government is introducing a new list of more liberal <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> just for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>. Developing tailored rules provides the UK with an opportunity to avoid overly restrictive requirements and to make <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> easier for business to understand and use.</p>

<p>The new <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> schedule has been influenced by the Nairobi Decision principles<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> and responds directly to the requests of <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> countries.</p>

<p>Full details of the <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/developing-countries-trading-scheme-dcts-new-policy-report">Product Specific Rules schedule for least developed countries</a> and highlights include:</p>

<p>1) 48 chapters (half of all chapters) allow 75% non-originating content in the <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> at the highest HS2 level<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. This new threshold responds directly to the requests of <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and recognises the limitations faced by <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> when participating in global value chains – low labour and other costs can make it hard for <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> products to meet higher non-originating thresholds.</p>

<p>2) Almost all <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> allow for alternative ’or’ rules. This can help businesses to meet UK requirements if one of the rules is difficult to meet or measure, for example:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Chapter</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
      <th scope="col">Previous PSR</th>

      <td>Change of tariff sub-heading (CTSH) or maximum non-originating content of 75% (EXW).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>3) Most (80) chapters have a single set of rules that apply to the whole chapter. This means that there are fewer exceptions, rules and variations depending on the type of product. This helps businesses to meet the <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr> required to qualify for preferential tariffs. For example, Chapter 38, which includes chemical products such as oils and dyeing chemicals, had 7 goods classified at the heading and sub-heading level (HS4 and HS6) with different rules. Under the new schedule it has been simplified to a single chapter rule as shown below:</p>

<table>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>4) 16 chapters have some rules at the more detailed tariff heading level (HS4 rather than the HS2 chapter level) where the chapter rule is not suitable for all goods in the chapter or where a degree of protection is needed for these goods.</p>

<p>The government considered removing all processing rules, replacing them with change of tariff classification and value-added rules, as endorsed by <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>. However, feedback from UK businesses highlighted some processing rules, particularly for textiles, that are helpful where value-added content is difficult to calculate. Furthermore, certain supply chains are already established to meet these processing rules. The government has decided to keep both the processing and the value-added rule, with the intention to meet the Nairobi Decision principles and avoid disruption for existing supply chains.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Cumulation</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Cumulation allows a material from another country to be considered as ‘originating’ when used in the production of a product, as long as that final product has been processed beyond minimal levels. Cumulation can make it easier for countries to comply with the non-originating content limits in some PSRs.</p>
</div>

<h4>Current position</h4>

<p><abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> beneficiaries can currently cumulate with the UK<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> and British Overseas Territories<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>, the EU and partially cumulate with Norway and Switzerland.</p>

<p>Certain Asian countries are permitted to cumulate with each other within 2 regional groups as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam along with <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>: Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar</li>
  <li>India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka along with <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>: Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal</li>
</ul>

<p>This means in <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>, only 6 out of 47 <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> can automatically take advantage of regional cumulation. Individual applications for extended cumulation can be made to request cumulation with specific countries.</p>

<p>The majority of consultation respondents were in favour of extending cumulation for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>, frequently highlighting the benefit of regional integration, particularly for African countries. Some respondents highlighted that extended cumulation was essential for countries in existing regional cumulation groupings.</p>

<p>A small number of respondents did not support extended cumulation, on the basis that it would provide an unfair advantage to <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and affect the preferences of <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr>. Other areas highlighted in the consultation responses included the difficulty in finding out the required rules for each product and associated guidance and a general lack of clarity on the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Analysis to inform the government’s position included assessing <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>’ imports from other <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>, <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> countries, <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> countries, UK <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr> partners and countries trading on UK Most Favoured Nation (<abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr>) terms. This analysis highlighted that cumulation with UK <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr> and UK <abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr> countries could substantially increase the proportion of eligible imports to the UK that would receive preferential treatment. Analysis on the impact of cumulation was challenging as the data available on international supply chains is limited, particularly for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>. The government also relied on qualitative data gathered through business engagement both in the UK and overseas to inform this policy position.</p>

<p>The government shares respondents’ overall views on extending cumulation for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>. The government also recognises the difficulty of accessing up to date <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr> information and will update and improve the current guidance and information available online.</p>

<h4>New policy</h4>

<p>The government is allowing extended cumulation for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> with <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> countries and <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> countries, on materials that are duty-free and quota-free when traded between the cumulating partner and the UK. The new cumulation provisions are in addition to the existing cumulation provisions which permit cumulation with the EU, Norway and Switzerland and regional groupings to ensure business continuity.</p>

<p>This means that <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> are able to participate in value chains involving materials from 95 countries and still export their final products to the UK duty-free, provided they meet the condition described above and the relevant <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr>. For example, an Ethiopian exporter to the UK will be able to use materials from Kenya (an <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> country) and treat those materials as originating in Ethiopia provided that they are duty-free in the <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> between the UK and Kenya and meet the <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Expanding cumulation for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> in this way brings particular benefits for African <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> which did not previously benefit from extended cumulation. The change should support regional integration in Africa, encourage exports and allow more goods to qualify for preferential tariffs. As most countries in Africa trade largely on duty-free, quota-free terms with the UK, the proportion of materials that can be used for cumulation purposes is very high.</p>

<p>Allowing cumulation of materials from <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> and <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> partners also benefits Asian <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>. It substantially increases the number of countries from which materials can be deemed as originating.</p>

<p><abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> wishing to take advantage of the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> extended cumulation provisions need to have the necessary administrative arrangements in place to meet customs cooperation requirements and verification of proof of origin. Measures that allow cumulation to be restricted in cases of abuse or circumvention are included in the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>. Cumulation may also be restricted where products have bilateral safeguards in place.</p>

<p>The government also considered 2 alternative options.</p>

<p>One option would allow <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> to cumulate all materials from <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> only. Another option would allow <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> to cumulate duty-free goods with <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> countries, <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> partners, UK <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr> partners and countries trading on UK <abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr> terms. The <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> only option was not selected as it would have very limited impact given the low level of trade between <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The second, more generous, option including UK <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr> and UK <abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr> countries reflects existing <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> trading practices. It was not selected because it was considered to increase the risk of circumvention, particularly in relation to goods from UK <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr> and UK <abbr title="Most Favoured Nation">MFN</abbr> countries.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Tariffs</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Tariffs are taxes applied to imports and are also referred to as ‘import duties’ or ‘customs duties’. Importers are responsible for paying tariffs and the costs of these may be passed on to consumers. Importers pay <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tariffs-on-goods-imported-into-the-uk">UK Global Tariff</a> rates when they import goods into the UK, unless the UK applies preferential tariff rates, for example through a bilateral free trade agreement or the GSP which DCTS replaces.</p>
</div>

<p>As an independent trading nation, the UK is in a position unilaterally to offer better preferential tariff rates to developing countries with a view to increasing trade with the UK which supports growth and poverty reduction. Reducing tariffs has many benefits, including lowering the cost of trade and increasing product competitiveness. UK consumers can also benefit from greater choice and reduced prices. Tariffs can be applied in a number of ways, some of which are complex and difficult to administer. Administrative burdens, particularly on small and medium businesses, can be a deterrent to exporting and importing internationally and prohibit UK businesses from establishing new supply chains.</p>

<h3>Current position</h3>

<p>Countries can only benefit from unilateral preferential treatment for developing countries if they are classified by the World Bank as <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> or <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr>. This continues to be the case under the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> that are <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> enjoy 0% tariffs on everything but arms and ammunition. Other <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr> (that do not have an <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr> in place) are either in the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework or the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework and enjoy partial or full removal of customs duties on over 80% of tariff lines.</p>

<p>There was clear support from the consultation for offering greater tariff reductions on eligible&nbsp;goods as well as making more goods from <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr> eligible for tariff reductions. A number of respondents opposed making preferential tariffs for <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework countries more generous on the basis that <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework countries should be prioritised. There was strong support for simplifying tariffs such as nuisance tariffs and seasonal tariffs where this did not erode the preferences of the least developed and most economically vulnerable countries.</p>

<p>Analysis to inform the government’s position considered trade flows from relevant countries that could further benefit from the scheme. The government also took into account trade from <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> countries and assessed goods from these countries which would be vulnerable to increased competition.</p>

<p>The government shares the view of consultation respondents that there is scope to simplify and liberalise tariffs in the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>. The government supports the view that least developed economies should get the most generous market access in the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>. The government agrees that economically vulnerable <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr> in the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework should enjoy greater market access benefits than the economically stronger countries in the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework.</p>

<h3>New policy</h3>

<p>The government is taking action in 5 areas:</p>

<h4>Liberalising additional tariffs for economically vulnerable <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Consultation respondents supported offering greater tariff reductions to <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr>. Under the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>, more than 80% of eligible lines benefit from zero tariffs in the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework.</p>

<p>Analysis has been undertaken to identify additional tariffs which could be lowered or removed in <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences. <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework tariff lines were not considered as other changes described in the next section mean that only India and Indonesia remain in <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Standard Preferences. <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>’ and <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> countries’  interests are protected by excluding products where interests from these countries exist. Products with domestic interests or sensitivities are also excluded, based on consultation across government.</p>

<p>Products for which tariff reductions could provide the greatest benefit to <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences countries were identified by analysing exports from these countries to the UK and the world. Goods with global exports from these countries of over $1 million have been prioritised for reduction.</p>

<p>The government is lowering or removing tariffs on an additional 156 products in <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences. New tariff lines include tomatoes, olive oil and pet food (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/developing-countries-trading-scheme-dcts-new-policy-report">UK Developing Country Trading Scheme (<abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>) tariff changes</a>).</p>

<p>The result of this change is that more than 85% of eligible lines now benefit from zero tariffs in <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences, covering trade worth around £2 billion.</p>

<h4>Allowing all economically vulnerable countries to access <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences</h4>

<p>The government is allowing all economically vulnerable <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr> to access <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences, by removing the requirement for countries to ratify and effectively implement certain international conventions. This results in 8<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> countries moving to the more generous tier. Further detail on the rationale for this change is provided in the Conditions section of this report.</p>

<p>The impact is that £23 million of additional trade benefits from zero tariffs immediately. Up to £2.6 billion of trade could benefit in this way by 2030 as a further 6 <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> are expected to graduate from <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> status and move directly to enhanced preference tariffs.</p>

<h4>Simplifying seasonal tariffs</h4>

<p>Seasonal tariffs have different tariff rates applicable according to the time of year. The public consultation found strong support for removing seasonal tariffs, although some concerns were expressed regarding preference erosion for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> countries.</p>

<p>The public consultation identified 15 seasonal tariffs for potential simplification. These lines relate mainly to citrus fruits like satsumas, mandarins as well as grapes, peaches, strawberries, artichoke, and cucumbers.&nbsp;Almost all these lines have significant interests from <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> countries for whom the UK is an important market. This includes the SACUM-UK <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> members, particularly South Africa and Namibia, as well as Zimbabwe, as big exporters of some of these products to the UK.</p>

<p>Due to these <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> and <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> sensitivities the government is maintaining all but 4 of the seasonal tariffs. For <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Standard Preferences, the seasonal tariff on cucumbers (0707005), globe artichokes (07099100), wilkings (08052900) and strawberries (08101000) are set to 8.5%, 6.5%, 12.5% and 6.5% respectively for the entire year. This is the lower tariff of the two-tariff structure for <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework countries. For <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences, the tariff for these products is set to 0% for the entire year. This change makes it simpler for countries to trade with the UK in these products.</p>

<h4>Simplifying nuisance tariffs</h4>

<p>In the public consultation we asked whether the government should set tariffs of 2% or less to zero, in line with the approach taken in the <abbr title="UK Global Tariff">UKGT</abbr>. Respondents generally supported the removal of nuisance tariffs for <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework countries, except where this might result in preference erosion for <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework countries.</p>

<p>To simplify the scheme, all 33 nuisance tariffs are set to 0% for <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Standard Preferences. These tariffs are already 0% in the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework and continue to be 0% in <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences.</p>

<h4>Maintaining tariffs on products where there are <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr>/<abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> sensitivities</h4>

<p>A notable number of consultation responses raised concerns around preference erosion for the most economically vulnerable countries. These respondents raised concerns around specific products and preference erosion for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>. Products such as sugar, cut flowers, bananas and canned fish were identified as being particularly sensitive for <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr>. Respondents also argued in favour of tariffs designed to support value addition on products such as cocoa.</p>

<p>The government is therefore maintaining tariffs for <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences and <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Standard Preferences on these products, including bananas and raw sugar products.</p>

<h3>Other factors</h3>

<p>Other factors are relevant to the government’s proposed approach on tariffs in the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>, including:</p>

<h4>UK Global Tariff</h4>

<p>The government is committed to supporting developing countries to reduce poverty through trade. The UK will ensure that developing country interests are carefully considered as part of any future changes to the UK Global Tariff, while also having regard to other relevant considerations, including the factors under Section 8(5) of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018.</p>

<h4>UK business interests</h4>

<p>The objective of the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> is to support economic growth in developing countries. Government and private sector stakeholders have been carefully consulted on UK market sensitivities in the design of the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> tariff provisions. Where there is a risk that the volume of trade from beneficiary countries reduces the competitiveness of UK products in the domestic market, the government has maintained tariffs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Goods graduation</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Goods graduation is the suspension of preferential rates of customs duty on certain imports. These imports are deemed to be highly competitive and to no longer need preferences to compete in the UK market. The goods graduation assessment applies to countries in the GSP General Framework only.</p>

<p>Graduation means that imports of a particular group of products originating in a given country lose preferences while imports of other groups of products from that country retain their preferential treatment. This means preferences are removed from products that no longer need them which provides greater opportunity to countries in greater need of preferential market access.</p>
</div>

<h3>Current position</h3>

<p>The goods graduation assessment only applies to countries in the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework. Goods graduation suspends access to preferential tariffs on specific groups of goods where a country has been deemed highly competitive.</p>

<p>Many consultation respondents were in favour of the government amending its approach on goods graduation in the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework. The rationale was to protect the interests of the least developed and more vulnerable developing countries in the scheme. Some respondents said it would be easier to align with the EU categorisation for simplicity. Responses were mixed on how frequently the government should run the goods graduation assessment. Some respondents favoured a shorter time period due to changing market dynamics. Others favoured a longer time to provide more certainty for business.</p>

<p>Analysis to inform the government’s position was undertaken on the frequency, threshold and sensitivity of the goods graduation assessment. This highlighted the benefits of maintaining a goods graduation approach to ensure sufficient preference and space for exports from <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and more economically vulnerable countries. It also highlighted the need to continue to include sensitive chapters, with a lower graduation threshold, to support the interests and exports of the more economically vulnerable developing countries.</p>

<p>The government shares respondents’ views on protecting the interests of more economically vulnerable developing countries and ensuring product graduation is targeted at goods that are genuinely competitive.</p>

<h3>New policy</h3>

<p>Given the changes to how enhanced preferences are accessed, the only <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Standard Preferences countries are India and Indonesia. Only these countries are subject to goods graduation. The government is graduating goods for <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Standard Preferences countries on the basis of <abbr title="Harmonized System">HS</abbr> chapters rather than <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> sections. This ensures that graduation is more objective, as the products in the <abbr title="Harmonized System">HS</abbr> chapter categories are more homogeneous. This also avoids graduation ’overshoots’, removing preferences from some products which are not competitive simply because they are in a section which includes other very competitive products, potentially from a different industry.</p>

<p>The calculation is also based on an assessment of imports of goods from a country at the <abbr title="Harmonized System">HS</abbr> chapter level as a proportion of total UK imports. The threshold is reduced to reflect these changes and is set at 6% of total UK imports. For chapters that the government has deemed sensitive for other developing countries and our <abbr title="economic partnership agreement">EPA</abbr> partners the threshold is set at 1%.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> Using UK imports means that the graduated products are more competitive for the UK market, which also helps support domestic UK industry.</p>

<p>This policy change only has an impact on imports from India and Indonesia and the proposed threshold ensures that a similar volume of imports graduate for both countries as under the current scheme. Many of the same products remain graduated, such as textiles for India and animal and vegetable oils for Indonesia. However, some products that India and Indonesia are especially competitive at exporting to the UK move on to the <abbr title="UK Global Tariff">UKGT</abbr> rate, such as leather for India and musical instruments for Indonesia. Other exports that are not as competitive for the UK market, such as India’s metal exports, move on to the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Standard Preferences rate. Overall, this change in approach means £748 million of Indian exports graduate off the preferential rate, compared to £791 million in <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>. For Indonesia, £62 million of exports graduate compared to £88 million in <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-three">Annex 3</a> for full list of products graduated under the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The government considered setting higher and lower thresholds and changing the frequency of the graduation assessment. It was decided that 6% struck a balance between the interests of developing countries, including <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> and domestic industry.</p>

<p>Given divergent views from stakeholders on the frequency of the goods graduation assessment, the government has decided to retain the 3 year assessment period. This timeframe seeks to allow for diverging market trends while still providing a reasonable degree of certainty to business.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Conditions</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The GSP has conditions which, if not met, allow for the suspension or variation of preferences from any beneficiary in any tier of the scheme.</p>

<p>The GSP Enhanced Framework is for economically vulnerable LICs and LMICs that have ratified, acceded to or otherwise expressed consent to be bound by, and are effectively implementing, specified international conventions.</p>
</div>

<h3>Current position</h3>

<p>The conditions on which suspension decisions are based include serious and systematic violations of human rights and labour rights contained in certain international conventions. There are also conditions that cover World Trade Organization (<abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr>) determinations; requirements of regional fisheries management organisations; export of prison labour goods; and illegal narcotics customs controls.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework provides more generous trade preferences (compared to the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> General Framework) as an incentive to economically vulnerable countries to ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions. These are listed in Schedule 2 to the Trade Preference Scheme (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. A serious failure to effectively implement any one of the 27 international conventions may result in a <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework country being removed from that tier and placed into the General Framework (thereby a suspension of their enhanced arrangement).</p>

<p>The Trade Preference Scheme (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 set out a comprehensive process prior to the suspension or variation of preferences. This provides transparency to <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries. It also provides them with an opportunity to make representations during the process and to address the issues for which the Secretary of State for International Trade is considering suspending preferences.</p>

<p>Just over half of respondents to the consultation did not express a view about conditions within the scheme. Views expressed were that suspensive conditions were negative for exports and business but did have an impact on compliance with human and labour rights, good governance and sustainability obligations in <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries. Of those who expressed views, the majority would prefer simpler requirements to access enhanced preferences.</p>

<p>Analysis to inform the government’s position included a comparison of the approaches in other preferences schemes, such as the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Japan, from which it was clear that the EU <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> (and therefore the current <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>) apply many more conditions for accessing and removing preferences. Analysis of academic evidence related to the EU <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> highlighted that the threat of suspension of trade preferences has been shown to bring some countries to the table for diplomatic dialogue on improvements. On the other hand, the activation of suspension has not and has instead had negative impacts for poor people, businesses and investors. The use of enhanced preferences has in some limited cases encouraged the ratification of conventions but cannot on its own influence their implementation.</p>

<p>The government shares consultation respondents’ views on the impact of preferences’ suspension and on simplification of requirements to access enhanced preferences.</p>

<h3>New policy</h3>

<p>The government is retaining the power to suspend a country’s preferences for serious and systematic violations of human rights and labour rights based on international conventions. The government is expanding the list of international conventions that form the basis for suspension. The new list includes conventions on anti-corruption, climate change and the environment (a full list of all international conventions relating to suspension can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-four">Annex 4</a>). The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> does not include suspensive conditions specifically related to <abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> determinations; requirements of regional fisheries management organisations; export of prison labour goods; and illegal narcotics customs controls.</p>

<p>International conventions provide a clear legal basis to inform decisions, including requirements for monitoring and reporting. Existing international conventions bodies have clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The government believes that secure and growing trading relationships can increase UK influence and enable open conversations with partners on a range of issues, including human rights and labour rights. The inclusion of climate change and environment conventions is intended to contribute to minimising trade that is harmful to the planet.</p>

<p>Access to <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences is based solely on the economic vulnerability of eligible <abbr title="Low Income Countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower-Middle Income Countries">LMICs</abbr>. This approach is more generous, with 8 more countries becoming immediately eligible for these preferences (Algeria, Congo, Cook Islands, Micronesia, Nigeria, Niue, Syria, Tajikistan). This approach creates a more gradual increase in tariffs for countries which graduate from <abbr title="Least Developed Country">LDC</abbr> status by ensuring that all economically vulnerable <abbr title="Least Developed Countries">LDCs</abbr> graduate to <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences.</p>

<p>India and Indonesia are not eligible to be classified as economically vulnerable and therefore do not have <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences. Countries will lose <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences and move to <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Standard Preferences when their economies have developed enough to no longer be classified as economically vulnerable. The economic vulnerability assessment is revised in the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>, by suspending the criteria on export competitiveness and only applying the existing criteria on export diversification.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> The government intends to complete a review of alternative options for assessing economic vulnerability within one year of the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> launch with a view to refining the basis for this assessment. The government grants <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> Enhanced Preferences to existing <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Enhanced Framework countries (without another preferential trading arrangement with the UK) for 3 years from the launch of the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> to ensure continuity for businesses.</p>

<p>The government considered retaining the requirement to ratify and implement international conventions to access enhanced preferences but rejected it. Reasons included the lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach in achieving improvements in the areas of concern, as well as the objective of simplifying the <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>. Furthermore, fewer developing countries would benefit from the more generous preferences offer and the new UK scheme would have continued to be more complex than most other schemes.</p>

<h2>Annex 1: overview of <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries and frameworks</h2>

<p>The UK’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences has been in place since 1 January 2021. The UK <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> largely replicates the EU <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>, providing continuity of trade access to UK markets for 70 developing countries. The scheme reduces and removes those tariffs reduced or removed by the EU <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>.</p>
