<p>This notice sets out how we will use your personal data for monitoring, evaluation, and research to support ‘public tasks’ related to the Boiler Upgrade Scheme (<abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>). It also sets out your rights. It is made under Articles 13 and/or 14 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>).</p>

<p>Within this Privacy Notice, ‘personal data’ refers to information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual and only includes information relating to neutral persons who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can be identified or who are identifiable, directly from the information in question</li>
  <li>who can be indirectly identified from that information in combination with other information</li>
</ul>

<h2>The data</h2>

<p>We will process the following data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact details including your name, email address and telephone number (for both installers and property owners)</li>
  <li>installer name (for example sole trader name or company name), company location and registered office</li>
  <li>addresses of property owners, installers, and correspondence addresses, if applicable (including postcodes). For applications from private landlords, there is also address and postcode for their organisation</li>
  <li>identification numbers, such as the&nbsp;<abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr> voucher&nbsp;number, <abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr> account number, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Microgeneration Certification Scheme">MCS</abbr>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<abbr title="energy preformance certificate">EPC</abbr>&nbsp;certificate numbers</li>
  <li>financial data on the total installation cost, date of quote and value of grant (this does not include details of the account into which the grant is paid)</li>
  <li>administrative details regarding your application, including:
    <ul>
      <li>dates of submission and approval</li>
      <li>property owner consent requested and received</li>
      <li>commissioning date</li>
      <li>application statuses and types</li>
      <li>details on the installer account creation process</li>
      <li>details on the redemption application</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>details about the current and past heating system including information on the&nbsp;<abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>-supported system such as the manufacturer, model, capacity, system type and fuel</li>
  <li>property data, such as whether new or self-build, whether in a rural or urban area, property type, tenure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purposes for which we are processing your personal data are listed below.</p>

<p>1. Evaluation of the <abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>. Your personal data will be processed for activities including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sampling – the activity of using your personal data to contact you, to invite you to consent to participate in research activities, including but not limited to surveys and interviews</li>
  <li>data analysis – the activity of carrying out statistical activities on your personal data, either in isolation or combined with other datasets</li>
  <li>tailoring - the activity of including your personal data on research apparatus to make it more specific to you, such as the inclusion of your name on the introductory message of a survey</li>
</ul>

<p>2. For monitoring of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>, your data will be processed for activities including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monitoring of applications, voucher redemptions and payments made to participants</li>
  <li>the publication of Official Statistics</li>
</ul>

<p>3. For analysis, research and future policy development, your data will be processed for activities including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>research for the development of policies on clean heat and any related activities</li>
  <li>data analysis – the activity of carrying out statistical activities on your personal data, either in isolation or combined with other datasets</li>
  <li>conduct research and analysis to support related policies</li>
  <li>linking – your data may be linked to other datasets in which your data is stored for evaluation, monitoring, and analytical purposes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal basis of processing</h2>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is public task (Article 6(1)(e) UK&nbsp;<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>). Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, such as the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown, or a government department; the exercise of a function conferred on a person by an enactment; the exercise of a function of either House of Parliament; or the administration of justice.</p>

<p>In this instance, one of the tasks which&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>&nbsp;needs to complete is an evaluation of the <abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>. A proper evaluation of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>&nbsp;is required to assess the value-for-money of public spending, the extent to which the <abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr> has met it’s aims and whether it has resulted in the expected impacts. The Public Value Framework published by Her Majesty’s Treasury makes clear the necessity of evaluation to public policy (this is particularly clear on page 47).</p>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>&nbsp;needs to monitor the scheme and how it is functioning, from an operational, financial and a policy development perspective. This is done by producing Official Statistics, financial forecasts, and other analysis. The statistics provide transparent information on the scheme, e.g., the number of applicants. The financial forecasts enable control of spend of the scheme as well as payments to applicants. Financial auditing is also done by the National Audit Office.&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>&nbsp;also carries out research to inform the development of the <abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>&nbsp;and other policies.</p>

<h2>Recipients</h2>

<p>For evaluation purposes, your personal data will be shared by us with any contractor or sub-contractor with whom&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>&nbsp;deem necessary for undertaking evaluation activities as part of the <abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>&nbsp;evaluation. These contractors and sub-contractors will not have the right to share your data more widely without <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ permission. They will not use your data for purposes other than carrying out the evaluation of the <abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>.</p>

<p>For monitoring and research purposes, personal data will be shared by us with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Welsh Government</li>
  <li>Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>other government departments and agencies as required for monitoring and research purposes, for example <abbr title="Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs">DEFRA</abbr> (Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs), Department for Levelling Up, Housing &amp; Communities (<abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>), Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>), Cabinet Office, Prime Minister’s Office</li>
  <li>HM Treasury (<abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the National Audit Office</li>
  <li>any contractor or sub-contractor we deem necessary for undertaking research activities</li>
</ul>

<p>In accordance with UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Principle (C): Data Minimisation,&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>&nbsp;will limit the sharing of your personal data to what is necessary and relevant. We will limit the data sharing to those who require it to undertake their contractual obligations in completing work as part of the evaluation or monitoring of the <abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>. We only share personal data when that is essential for the research activity. Where personal data is not essential for the monitoring, evaluation, or research we may instead share extracts of data.</p>

<p>As your personal data will be stored on our IT (Information Technology) infrastructure it will also be shared with our processors: Microsoft and Amazon Web Services.</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>

<p>Your personal data will be kept by us for no longer than 5 years to fulfil our functions in evaluating and monitoring the <abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr>. Extracts of property-level data (for example a dwelling that has received a <abbr title="Boiler Upgrade Scheme">BUS</abbr> grant to install an air source heat pump) may be retained for wider analysis purposes.</p>

<p>Your data will be retained separately by&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>&nbsp;for monitoring, statistical and / or research purposes. Data will be retained to monitor payments and make financial forecasts until all payments on the scheme have been made.</p>

<h2>Where personal data has not been obtained from the data subject</h2>

<p>Your personal data is obtained by us from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (<abbr title="Office of Gas and Electricity Markets">Ofgem</abbr>). <abbr title="Office of Gas and Electricity Markets">Ofgem</abbr> are legally compelled to supply data to&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>&nbsp;under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2022/9780348232349/contents" rel="external">The Boiler Upgrade Scheme (England and Wales) Regulations 2022</a> when&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>&nbsp;requests it.</p>
