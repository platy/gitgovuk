<p>This guidance outlines how the government will undertake the desktop review of coronavirus (COVID-19) detection tests submitted for assessment under the Coronavirus Test Device Approvals Regulation. The Regulation requires manufacturers or distributors of molecular and antigen tests for COVID-19 to apply to the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) for approval to market their test in the UK. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-test-approval-how-to-apply">COVID-19 test approval: how to apply</a>.</p>

<p>Their product must meet the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/910/contents/made" rel="external">The Medical Devices (Coronavirus Test Device Approvals) (Amendment) Regulations 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Coronavirus Test Device Approval (<abbr title="Coronavirus Test Device Approval">CTDA</abbr>) applies to all molecular diagnostic or antigen tests, irrespective of the detection technology used, the sample type or the environment in which the test is carried out. The use of algorithms to analyse the data is also in scope.</p>

<p>Molecular diagnostic tests detect nucleic acids, RNA in the case of SARS-CoV-2. Examples include polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>), Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (<abbr title="loop-mediated isothermal amplification">LAMP</abbr>) tests. Antigen tests detect any other viral component or components such as proteins, lipids or whole virus and include those that require an analyser or reader and those that do not. Examples include lateral flow tests, mass spectrometry and microscopy.</p>

<p>The SARS-CoV-2 component of tests that include detection of multiple pathogens is currently within scope, while the detection of the other pathogens is out of scope. Currently, tests that rely on host response, for example the measurement of volatile organic compounds in breath or cytokines in blood are out of scope.</p>

<p>All COVID-19 molecular and antigen tests are subject to approval, whether they are designed for use in a laboratory, at point of care, near patient or for home use (self-test).</p>

<h2>Overview of the process</h2>

<p>The desktop review is a systematic assessment of the evidence submitted by a supplier against a minimum required data set. The purpose of this step is to prevent tests that are below the expected standards from progressing to a technical validation in a laboratory.</p>

<p>The information submitted will be reviewed to check for completeness and then passed to a scientific advisor who will undertake the initial assessment. The assessment will be peer reviewed and presented to the Desktop Review Assurance Group meeting who will make a recommendation for pass or fail. All decisions will be ratified by the Regulatory Approvals Committee. The main areas of assessment are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Manufacturer and test information</li>
  <li>Regulatory status</li>
  <li>Intended use case</li>
  <li>Product performance</li>
  <li>Biosafety</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Manufacturer and test information</h2>

<p>As a minimum the applicant should supply a Word or PDF document of the instructions for use (<abbr title="instructions for use">IFU</abbr>) for the submitted test. This document will be required to demonstrate the submitted test aligns with the intended use and evidence the stated performance characteristics of the submitted test. Several supporting documents in addition to the <abbr title="instructions for use">IFU</abbr> will also be required (see table below).</p>

<p>The submitted information will be assessed to ensure that the key documents for the application are present.</p>

</table>

<p>The essential and desirable numbers of samples apply to each sample type in line with the <abbr title="instructions for use">IFU</abbr>, for example: nasal, nasopharyngeal, throat and saliva. Results for different sample types should not be aggregated. Approval will only be provided for sample types where sufficient data is provided for that sample type, and where that data demonstrates performance above the thresholds specified in the regulation. The clinical performance of the assessed product, for the purposes of the regulatory thresholds, must be assessed across the full dynamic range of viral loads.</p>

<p>Samples from more than one study may be combined to complete the data set, even where different comparators have been used. Samples from pre-identified participants (such as previously <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> positive) are accepted; these may be required to ensure that you gather data required on the full range of viral loads.</p>

<p>Do not exclude discordant results; where a resolver assay (an additional comparator test) has been used to help explain discordant results please include this data.</p>

<p>Where a test has already been validated by the Technologies Validation Group (TVG), the applicant can make a request to use the TVG data for the purposes of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Test Device Approval">CTDA</abbr> application. Please email your request for data to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:TVGdata@ukhsa.gov.uk">TVGdata@ukhsa.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3>Criteria for comparator method</h3>

<p>The comparator must be an <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr> method that meets the diagnostic criteria from the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/technologies-validation-group-using-tests-to-detect-covid-19">Technologies Validation Group: using tests to detect COVID-19</a>. This means it should be <abbr title="Certificate European">CE</abbr>-marked, have a sensitivity of 97% or above with the lower 95% confidence interval at 93% or above, and a specificity of 99% or above with the lower 95% confidence interval at 97% or above.</p>

<p>Clinical diagnosis or results derived from the use of contrived samples (for example those that have been spiked or diluted) are not acceptable comparator methods.</p>

<p>The raw data (<abbr title="cycle threshold">CT</abbr> values or equivalent) from the comparator <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr> method are required in the supplementary evidence submitted via the portal (to evidence that the full dynamic range of clinically meaningful viral loads have been evaluated).</p>

<p>The raw data (<abbr title="cycle threshold">CT</abbr> values or equivalent) for internal positive controls from the comparator <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr> method, are also required in the supplementary evidence submitted via the portal (to evidence that negative comparator results are true negatives and not due to assay failure).</p>

<h3>Clinical performance</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="instructions for use">IFU</abbr>, relevant raw data and published supporting documents will be assessed for key requirements for evidence of clinical performance.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The clinical performance characteristics of the submitted test.

<p>*Setting a standard for technology types so government does not endorse tests that are substandard for their type.</p>

<p>Sensitivity in regard to a coronavirus test device means the percentage of coronavirus positive samples detected by the comparator <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr> that are correctly identified by the test, calculated using the following equation.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/129448/Sensitivity_formula.png"></div></figure>

<p>The above equation states the percentage sensitivity equals the number of true positives divided by the sum of the number of true positives and the number of false negatives, all multiplied by 100.</p>

<p>Specificity in regard to a coronavirus test device means the percentage of coronavirus negative samples classified by the comparator <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr> that are correctly identified as negative by the test, calculated using the following equation.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/129449/Specificity_formula.png"></div></figure>

<p>The above equation states the percentage specificity equals the number of true negatives divided by the sum of the number of true negatives and the number of false positives, all multiplied by 100.</p>

<p>True positive results are those that have a positive result on both the test device and the comparator <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr>. False negative results are those that have a negative result on the test device and positive on the comparator <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>True negative results are those that have a negative result on both the test device and the comparator <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr>. False positive results are those that have a positive result on the test device and a negative result on the comparator <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>We will use the following formula<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> for calculating 95% confidence intervals.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/129450/95__CI_formula.png"></div></figure>

<p>The above equation states the lower 95% confidence interval equals A minus B, all divided by C. The upper 95% confidence interval equals A plus B, all divided by C, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A equals 2 r, plus 1.96 to the power of 2</li>
  <li>B equals 1.96 multiplied by the square root of D</li>
  <li>C equals n, plus 1.96 to the power of 2, all multiplied by 2</li>
  <li>D equals 1 minus p, all multiplied by 4r, plus 1.96 to the power of 2</li>
  <li>r equals the number of true positives (for sensitivity) or the number of true negatives (for specificity)</li>
  <li>n equals the number of positives on the comparator <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr> (for sensitivity) or the number of negatives on the comparator <abbr title="quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-qPCR</abbr> (for specificity)</li>
  <li>p equals r divided by n (that is p is the sensitivity or specificity as a proportion)</li>
</ul>

<p>When calculating the percentage sensitivity and specificity and 95% confidence intervals, we will round to the nearest 0.1% for comparison with the thresholds. For example, a test with a lower 95% confidence interval that rounds to 92.9% or 93.0% would fail against a threshold of 93%, as the requirement is that the lower 95% <abbr title="confidence interval">CI</abbr> is entirely above 93%. For examples, see the table below.</p>
