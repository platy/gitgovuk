<h2>Summary</h2>

<h3>How we use your information</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The SCA is one of the competent authorities responsible for the National Referral Mechanism process, which identifies and supports potential and confirmed victims of modern slavery.</li>
  <li>We will use your personal information to decide whether or not you are a victim of modern slavery.</li>
  <li>We will use your personal information to make sure you are provided with appropriate support or have the opportunity for support.</li>
  <li>We may contact you directly (if you are an adult) or via your representative to request further information about your case or support needs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How we share your information</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We will only share your information when it is legal to do so and will only keep it for as long as necessary.</li>
  <li>You have the right to be told if we hold any personal information about you. If we do, you are entitled to request a copy. There are times that we may have to restrict the information we provide you.</li>
  <li>We may pass your personal information to other teams within the Home Office and other organisations that are involved in your case or your support.</li>
  <li>We may pass your personal information to other teams within the Home Office or other Government departments so that they can carry out their functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our commitment to you</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We will do everything we can to make sure that your personal information is recorded accurately and stored securely.</li>
  <li>We will provide clear information about how and why we process your information, helping you understand how it is used.</li>
  <li>We will only gather the information that is necessary for carrying out our responsibilities and will make sure that we only keep it for as long as it is needed.</li>
  <li>We will only share information with others where the law allows this, and we will only provide the information needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> How we protect your personal information</h2>

<p>We have a duty to safeguard and ensure the security of your personal information. We do that 
by having systems and policies in place to limit access to your information and prevent 
unauthorised disclosure. Staff who access personal information must have appropriate security
clearance and a business need for accessing the information, and their activity is subject to 
audit and review.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> The Single Competent Authority</h2>

<p>The Single Competent Authority is often shortened to the SCA. The SCA is part of the Home 
Office, and is one of the competent authorities who identify and support potential and confirmed victims of modern slavery through the 
National Referral Mechanism (NRM).</p>

<p>The SCA gathers information from inside the Home Office and from other external
organisations to decide if a person is a victim of modern slavery.</p>

<p>Where an individual asks for support, the SCA will provide support for adult potential and 
confirmed victims of modern slavery in England and Wales through the Modern Slavery Victim 
Care Contract (MSVCC) held by The Salvation Army (TSA).</p>

<p>If you are under the age of 18, we will share your information with organisations that need it to 
provide you support. For more information see section 7 below.</p>

<p>If you live in Scotland or Northern Ireland and you ask for support, the SCA will share your 
information with other organisations who will provide you with the appropriate support you 
need. For more information see section 6 below.</p>

<p>All information sent to the SCA or those that process data on our behalf will be governed by the 
Home Office as data controllers.</p>

<h3>Immigration Enforcement Competent Authority (IECA)</h3>

<p>If your case falls within the IECA cohort (the letters you receive will be from IECA) then your referral and personal information will come into and be processed by the SCA. However your information will then be passed to IECA (which is another competent authority within the Home Office) who will decide whether or not you are a victim of modern slavery and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-information-use-in-borders-immigration-and-citizenship/borders-immigration-and-citizenship-privacy-information-notice">Borders, Immigration and Citizenship privacy information notice</a> will apply.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Legal Basis for Data Processing</h2>

<p>The SCA is part of the Home Office. This means that the Home Office is the data controller of
your data that is sent to the SCA or collected on our behalf.</p>

<p>Preventing modern slavery and supporting people who have been affected by it is an important 
priority for the UK. We will process your data to decide if you are a victim of modern slavery 
and to make sure you have support if you need it and want it.</p>

<h3>Legal basis</h3>

<p>There must be a reason in law for your data to be processed.</p>

<p>The Home Office has a legal responsibility to identify and support victims of modern slavery 
because of a Convention (Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in 
Human Beings) that became law on 1 April 2009.</p>

<p>The Home Office will process your personal data because it is necessary for the 
performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority 
vested in the controller (Article 6 (1)(e) of the UK General data protection regulations â
UKGDPR). The Home Office may also process your data if it is necessary in order to 
protect your vital interests or those of another person (Article 6 (1)(d) UKGDPR).</p>

<p>We process your special category data where it is necessary for reasons of substantial 
public interest (Article 9(2)(g) UKGDPR).</p>

<h3>Personal data</h3>

<p>Personal data is information specifically about you that can be used to identify you. Below is 
a list of the personal data we may process about you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Date of birth</li>
  <li>Nationality</li>
  <li>Gender</li>
  <li>Contact details</li>
  <li>Reference numbers from within and outside the Home Office</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special category data</h3>

<p>Special category data is personal information about you, but it is likely to be more sensitive 
than the personal data mentioned in the list above. Below is a list of the special category 
data we may process about you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Racial or ethnic origin</li>
  <li>Religious and other beliefs</li>
  <li>Biometric data for identifying you (e.g. fingerprints)</li>
  <li>Health or medical information</li>
  <li>Sexual orientation</li>
  <li>Sex life (including sexual history, history of sexual abuse, mistreatment and/or 
exploitation)</li>
  <li>Criminal offence data â information relating to
    <ul>
      <li>Criminal activity</li>
      <li>Allegations</li>
      <li>Investigations</li>
      <li>Proceedings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> How your data is collected, used and stored</h2>

<p>The information we hold about you will be gathered from both you and any organisations that 
are involved in your case or support such as:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Your non-legal appointed representative (with your permission)</li>
  <li>Credit reference agencies</li>
  <li>International partners such as other governments and embassies</li>
</ul>

<p>These organisations, and others depending on who is involved in your case, will share 
necessary information with us so that we can carry out our responsibilities. Your information 
may be used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decide if you are a victim of modern slavery</li>
  <li>Decide if you need discretionary leave to remain in the UK, relating to your experience 
of modern slavery</li>
  <li>Provide you with appropriate support through the MSVCC</li>
  <li>Ensure other organisations have the appropriate information to provide you with 
support</li>
  <li>Ensure that you, your dependants and the general public are safeguarded</li>
  <li>Detect, prevent and prosecute modern slavery offences</li>
  <li>Comply with obligations related to legal proceedings</li>
  <li>Inform modern slavery policy making</li>
  <li>Ensure our staff are sufficiently trained</li>
  <li>Verify your contact and bank account details</li>
</ul>

<p>The Home Office may also share your information with other organisations and government 
departments where it is necessary in the course of carrying out our functions, or necessary to 
enable others to perform their functions.</p>

<p>Your information will be stored on secure Home Office approved servers either in the United 
Kingdom or a country in the European Economic Area (EEA) that is subject to GDPR.</p>

<p>Your information will be retained for 15 years from the date of the last action on your case. We 
have assessed this period to be necessary to carry out our responsibilities to identify and 
support victims of modern slavery, as well as to detect and prevent modern slavery.</p>

<p>To find out how long we keep other records, such as corporate documents and information 
requests, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/home-office-retention-and-disposal-standards/what-to-keep-home-office-guide-to-managing-information">What to keep: Home Office guide to managing information</a>.</p>

<p>Your information that is passed onto Home Office teams or other organisations will be held by 
them in line with their data retention and deletion policies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Support in England and Wales</h2>

<p>This section is only relevant to adults in England and Wales, and their dependants, who 
have requested support through the MSVCC.</p>

<p>The Salvation Army provides support, if it is asked for, to adults and their dependants in 
England and Wales who are potential or confirmed victims of modern slavery with support 
needs. If you ask for support The Salvation Army will collect and process your information on 
our behalf, for reasons set out by us. The support is provided through the Modern Slavery 
Victim Care Contract (MSVCC).</p>

<p>The Home Office are data controllers and The Salvation Army are data processors of all this 
information.</p>

<p>The Salvation Army use many organisations as sub-processors, who will collect and process 
your and your dependantâs information on The Salvation Armyâs behalf.</p>

<p>These organisations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support organisations
    <ul>
      <li>Ashiana, B.A.W.S.O, BCHA, Black Country Womenâs Aid, City Hearts, Hestia, 
Medaille Trust, Migrant Help, Saint John of God Hospitaller Services, Palm Cove

      <li>Connect Assist</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Transport Services
    <ul>
      <li>Cabline</li>
      <li>365 Response</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Interpretation and Translation Services
    <ul>
      <li>The Big Word</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All organisations used by The Salvation Army as sub-processors to collect and process your own 
and your dependantâs data are approved by the Home Office.</p>

<p>The Salvation Army and their sub-processors will collect and process your data and your 
dependantâs data to help you with tailored support to meet your needs. Examples of this support 
are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accommodation</li>
  <li>Physical and mental wellbeing</li>
  <li>NRM decision service</li>
  <li>Financial aid and advice</li>
  <li>Practical help and guidance</li>
  <li>Help with transport</li>
  <li>Planning for your future</li>
  <li>Cultural and spiritual needs</li>
  <li>Interpretation and translation services</li>
  <li>Education support for dependent children</li>
  <li>Legal aid signposting</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure you are provided with appropriate support, The Salvation Army and its sub processors will make detailed records of any information relating to your case that they think 
might be relevant to the provision of support. This may include information you share with your 
legal representative. You have the right to speak with your legal representative privately: if you 
wish to speak to your legal representative privately, please inform the person offering you 
support.</p>

<p>Your own and your dependantsâ information will be shared with the SCA or other Home Office 
departments if it is considered necessary for your support, to meet our legal obligations or for 
ensuring that the MSVCC is fulfilled.</p>

<p>To provide support, The Salvation Army and their sub-processors may also need to share 
necessary information with private, public and charitable organisations, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>National Health Service and other health providers</li>
  <li>Police</li>
  <li>Local Authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>Your data may be used to assess the support services we are providing and improve them.</p>

<p>Your information may also be shared with other Home Office teams or other Government 
Departments to enable us to carry out our responsibilities or enable them to carry out theirs.</p>

<p>The Home Office use the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to independently asses the service 
you are provided through the MSVCC. CQC are independent regulators of health and social 
care in England and Wales. Your information that is collected by The Salvation Army and their 
sub-processors may be transferred to CQC who will then use that information to ensure that
appropriate support is being provided. CQC may also collect data directly from service users 
through interviews or surveys which will be used to assess quality of support.</p>

<p>The Care Quality Commission are data processors of this information and the Home Office are 
data controllers. This means the Care Quality Commission will process your information for 
purposes set out by the Home Office.</p>

<p>You can find out more about your information rights in section 8 of this document. If you wish to 
request access to your information that is held and processed by The Salvation Army on behalf 
of the Home Office you can do so by contacting <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:mstsar@salvationarmy.org.uk">mstsar@salvationarmy.org.uk</a>.</p>
