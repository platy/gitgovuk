<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>It is important everyone on the board has the skills to understand the performance data for their school or academy trust so they can hold school leaders to account.</p>

<p>This resource:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provides information, grouped into 7 themes, about what performance data the board <strong>must</strong> and should be analysing</li>
  <li>supports the board to analyse performance data and build an evidence base to help identify the reasons behind success and establish the “root causes” behind any problems or failures</li>
  <li>boosts confidence in using performance data to make decisions and challenge others where problems/ failures are identified or persist</li>
  <li>helps guide board discussions to ensure the best possible outcomes for pupils and value for money is achieved</li>
  <li>signposts to other useful sources of information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Analysing your data</h3>

<p>We recommend the 7 themes in this resource are used in <strong>conjunction with each other, and in the context of your organisation</strong> and its wider operational strategy to help you analyse your school/ academy trust’s performance data and form an evidence base.</p>

<p>You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the size of your organisation</li>
  <li>type of school(s) within your organisation (e.g., primary/ secondary/ alternative provision/ special school) and whether a school has a specialist Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) unit or resourced provision</li>
  <li>key stage</li>
  <li>curriculum offer</li>
  <li>pupil wellbeing, resilience, and behaviour</li>
  <li>quality of career guidance</li>
  <li>implications of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/equality-act-2010-advice-for-schools">Public Sector Equality Duty under the Equality Act 2010</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, you should consider what the data is telling you to form your evidence base:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what is going well?</li>
  <li>what learning can you apply from one area to another?</li>
  <li>what are the concerns?</li>
  <li>are any areas at risk of becoming a concern?</li>
  <li>what changes need to be made?</li>
  <li>what can be done about it?</li>
  <li>how will this affect productivity for your school or academy trust?</li>
  <li>what is the impact on educational and financial outcomes?</li>
</ul>

<p>Benchmarking against comparators and analysing trends will bring together financial health, pupil educational outcomes and the quality of leadership and support effective <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/schools-financial-health-and-efficiency">school resource management</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">governance handbook and competency framework for governance</a> provides information on the knowledge, skills and effective behaviours required by the board.</p>

<h3>Your evidence base</h3>

<p>The data required for your evidence base should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the most recent data available and in the format in which it is routinely available</li>
  <li>easily accessible and understood</li>
</ul>

<p>Use your evidence base to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify underlying reasons where you might expect performance to be better</li>
  <li>challenge any mitigating actions, analysing the risks and benefits</li>
  <li>clearly document the changes and progress made since your last board discussion</li>
</ul>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid over-interpreting analysis of small subgroups of pupils</li>
  <li>understand the precision and limitations of data, and what can be inferred from it, the collection of data and its analysis must be proportionate</li>
  <li>consider what is the minimum information the board requires to hold leaders to account - time spent collecting and analysing data can be burdensome, placing additional workloads on individuals</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-workload-advisory-group-report-and-government-response">making data work</a> report provides information on removing unnecessary workload associated with data management and sets out the principles for data use.</p>

<h3>Reporting by exception</h3>

<p>An exception report should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be used to identify and prioritise instances that require immediate attention when reviewing the performance of your school/ academy trust</li>
  <li>form the basis for structured discussions and help you question and challenge your school leaders</li>
  <li>support with future risk and planning</li>
</ul>

<p>To help you do this we have provided an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-your-data-a-guide-for-school-governors-and-academy-trustees?utm_source=ASK%20">exception report template</a>, with guidance notes, and example case studies (example A and example B).</p>

<h2>Cyber security and data protection</h2>

<p>All schools rely heavily on IT and online services to function. They hold vast amounts of sensitive and personal data on pupils, parents, and staff, which <strong>must</strong> be kept safe and secure.</p>

<p>You should ensure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your school has IT and data protection policies and procedures in place to safeguard systems, staff, and learners that are compliant with UK data protection legislation that is currently the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/" rel="external">UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018</a>
</li>
  <li>you understand the policies and procedures in place, and you know how to apply them to ensure data is kept safe and secure</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/school-governor-questions" rel="external">cyber security in schools: questions for governors and trustees</a> provides a series of questions for boards to ask school leaders and start conversations about cyber security to improve awareness and understanding.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-protection-toolkit-for-schools">data protection toolkit for schools and annual review of school records and safe data destruction checklist</a> helps you understand your data protection obligations and manage your compliance with UK data protection law.</p>

<h2>The 7 themes</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Pupil numbers/ attendance and exclusions</h3>

<h4>1.1 Pupil numbers</h4>

<p>Pupil numbers account for the majority of your income. Understanding the growth or decline in numbers is vital to safeguard the financial health of your organisation.</p>

<p>You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>latest trends, current numbers, and in-year churn in all year groups</li>
  <li>first, second and third choices and transition from primary to secondary schools</li>
  <li>pupil projections/ future financial planning, including those with additional needs that will require additional funding</li>
  <li>differences between pupil projections and actual pupil numbers</li>
  <li>the number of pupils who fall into various categories, including those who are on free school meals, have EHCPs, have SEND but no EHCP, attract Pupil Premium (or Service or Early Years Pupil Premium), those from gypsy/ Roma/ traveller families</li>
  <li>if a local school increases or decreases their PAN, or accepts children over their PAN</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.2 Pupil attendance levels (including persistent absence)</h4>

<p>In line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-improve-school-attendance">working together to improve school attendance</a>, all boards should regularly review and discuss attendance data to challenge school leaders and help them focus improvement efforts on the individual pupils and cohorts who need it most. For schools struggling with attendance, boards are also expected to work with school leaders to develop a comprehensive plan to improve attendance. This should be evaluated and reviewed regularly at meetings.</p>

<p>Boards of multi academy trusts (MATS) or federations may also wish to hold termly attendance review meetings with each individual school and/ or ask them to report on their attendance at defined intervals.</p>

<p>You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>current and historic trends on attendance</li>
  <li>pupil cohorts who historically have had poor attendance, e.g., pupils who have a social worker, are from a background or ethnicity where attendance has historically been low, have a long-term medical condition, special educational needs, or a disability, or are eligible for free school meals</li>
  <li>benchmarking with comparator schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Schools are strongly encouraged to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/share-your-daily-school-attendance-data">share their daily attendance data</a> through an automated collection from their management information system which provides them with easy-to-use attendance reports. To meet the expectations outlined above, boards are encouraged to prompt their school(s) to sign up to the programme and share attendance data from the reports with them.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-pupil-absence">Pupil absence statistics</a>&nbsp;provides information on overall authorised and unauthorised pupil absences by school type, including persistent absentees and pupil characteristics. Statistics are published 3 times per year.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Analyse school performance (ASP)</a>&nbsp;also applies. Boards can request a “governor” account from their&nbsp;DfE&nbsp;Sign-in approver which allows access to&nbsp;ASP.</p>

<h4>1.3 Pupil moves (including exclusion levels)</h4>

<p>Boards should carefully consider the level of pupil moves and the characteristics of pupils who are moving on any permanent exclusions to ensure the sanction is only used when necessary, and as a last resort.</p>

<p>You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>effectiveness and consistency in implementing the school’s behaviour policy</li>
  <li>the school register and absence codes</li>
  <li>instances where pupils receive repeat suspensions</li>
  <li>interventions in place to support pupils at risk of suspension or permanent exclusion</li>
  <li>variations in the rolling average of permanent exclusions to understand why this is happening, and ensure they are only used when necessary</li>
  <li>characteristics of children who are suspended, permanently excluded, removed from roll, or educated off site, and why this is taking place</li>
  <li>timing of moves and permanent exclusions, and whether there are any patterns including any indications, which may highlight where policies or support are not working, e.g., if high numbers of children with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) are moving, your school may wish to consider reviewing its SEN support</li>
  <li>whether the placements of pupils directed off site into&nbsp;alternative provision (AP)&nbsp;are reviewed at sufficient intervals to provide assurance the education is achieving its objectives and that the pupils are benefiting from it</li>
  <li>cost implications of directing children to be educated off site in AP</li>
</ul>

<p>Academy trusts:</p>

<p>Multi academy trust’s (MATs) may choose to work with their academies to consider this information, and if there are patterns across academies within a MAT, recognising that numbers in any one academy are often too low to allow for meaningful statistical analysis.</p>

<p>For all boards:</p>

<p>Find out more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-exclusion">school suspensions and permanent exclusions</a> statutory guidance.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Analyse school performance (ASP)</a> also applies. Boards can request a “governor” account from their&nbsp;DfE&nbsp;Sign-in approver which allows access to&nbsp;ASP.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.&nbsp;Attainment </span> and progress</h3>

<h4>2.1 Pupil education outcomes</h4>

<p>Monitor actions taken by your school to close the attainment gap and to improve year on year.</p>

<p>We appreciate that the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic mean that schools will be cautious about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2022/06/22/were-changing-the-way-we-present-school-and-college-results-data-this-year-what-you-need-to-know-about-performance-tables/" rel="external">making comparisons with performance data</a> from previous years, and directly with other schools/ academy trusts, and when comparing with national or local authority averages. Talking to your school is a vital step to understanding the broader context around data and how the pandemic may have impacted your school and its pupils.</p>

<p>You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>progress of pupils attracting pupil premium and recovery premium to the school, monitored, and reported together</li>
  <li>progress of disadvantaged pupils by key stage/ year group against that of their non-disadvantaged peers nationally</li>
  <li>use of pupil premium plus and how it is being used to raise the educational attainment of previously looked after children</li>
  <li>progress of pupils with an&nbsp;EHC&nbsp;plan, or on&nbsp;SEN&nbsp;Support and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the provision made for them</li>
  <li>progress of pupils who have benefitted from the catch-up premium, tracked against the use of that funding</li>
  <li>most recently published destination/ career data including for pupils with&nbsp;SEND</li>
  <li>most recently published&nbsp;DfE&nbsp;performance measures at KS4 and 16-18 (KS2 data will not be published for 2021/ 22, however, we will still produce the normal suite of KS2 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/primary-school-accountability">accountability measures</a> at school level)</li>
  <li>breakdown of current numbers, e.g., by boys/ girls, ethnicity, free school meals, pupil premium, English as an additional language, SEN (those with an education, health, and care (EHC) plan and those on SEN Support), disability, looked after children, and previously looked after children</li>
</ul>

<p>Special schools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>should use individual pupil progress data measures and progress against outcomes in Education, Health, and Care plans)</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.2 Additional support for pupils with special educational needs or disabilities</h4>

<p>Boards play an important role in the school’s work to support children and young people with special educational needs and disability (SEND). The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">SEND&nbsp;code of practice</a> sets out an expectation that, alongside the headteacher, there should be a member of the board, or a sub-committee who has specific oversight for determining the strategic development of&nbsp;SEN&nbsp;policy and provision in the school, and ensuring the school meets its responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010, including in relation to reasonable adjustments for disabled pupils.</p>

<p>You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>data on&nbsp;SEN&nbsp;population and compare the numbers of pupils identified with neighbouring schools, the&nbsp;LA, and national positions</li>
  <li>what % of the school population has&nbsp;SEN</li>
  <li>what % of the school population has a disability</li>
  <li>what % is at&nbsp;SEN&nbsp;Support</li>
  <li>what % has an&nbsp;EHC&nbsp;plan</li>
  <li>what is the breakdown of&nbsp;SEND&nbsp;by category of need</li>
  <li>data relating to&nbsp;SEN&nbsp;funding information (e.g., notional&nbsp;SEN&nbsp;funding and top up funding), how is it spent and its impact</li>
  <li>if it is targeted strategically based on your knowledge of the school&nbsp;SEND&nbsp;profile</li>
  <li>if the&nbsp;SEN&nbsp;funding is leading to improved progress and if so, how?</li>
</ul>

<p>All schools are required to publish a&nbsp;SEN&nbsp;information report about the implementation of the board/ proprietor’s policy for pupils with&nbsp;SEN&nbsp;and to update it at least annually. Data will play a key part in demonstrating the effectiveness of that policy.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sendgateway.org.uk/page/wss-review-guides" rel="external">SEND&nbsp;governance review</a> guide sets out a framework to ensure learners with&nbsp;SEND&nbsp;access high-quality provision.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Curriculum planning – staff and class sizes</h3>

<h4>3.1 Curriculum planning (integrated with financial planning)</h4>

<p>It is vital that curriculum planning is coordinated as a joint exercise with your budget planning to produce a curriculum that meets the needs of&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;pupils (including those with additional needs) and is affordable.</p>

<p>A curriculum-led and data-informed approach to financial planning will help establish a staffing structure that can deliver the greatest impact. Boards should challenge leadership teams on the effective organisation of the curriculum and deployment of staff.</p>

<p>You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pupil to teacher ratio</li>
  <li>average class size</li>
  <li>teacher contact ratio (at secondary)</li>
  <li>average teacher cost</li>
  <li>% of total spend on teaching/ non-teaching staff</li>
  <li>% of total spend on senior leadership team</li>
  <li>spend per pupil for non-pay expenditure lines (e.g., catering,&nbsp;ICT, estates management, business administration, energy, and curriculum supplies)</li>
  <li>data on the deployment of teaching assistants (TAs) and higher-level teaching assistants (HLTAs)</li>
  <li>amount of non-teaching time the special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCo) has available in relation to the number of pupils with&nbsp;SEN</li>
  <li>whether the current staff deployment strategy supports the school’s educational vision and pupil outcomes</li>
  <li>current and future pupil forecasts to identify any changes in staffing requirements, including consideration of current and future pupils with SEND</li>
  <li>progress against the school’s published accessibility plan, which <strong>must</strong> include plans to increase access for disabled pupils to the curriculum</li>
  <li>where actual pupil numbers diverge from forecasts</li>
  <li>succession planning/ staff turnover</li>
  <li>teaching and learning responsibility (TLR) and on costs (e.g., National Insurance)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use this data to model alternative scenarios and plan strategically to implement new structures if necessary.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/integrated-curriculum-and-financial-planning-icfp">integrated curriculum and financial planning (ICFP)</a> guidance provides information on how all schools can use&nbsp;ICFP&nbsp;to create the best curriculum for pupils with available funding.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.&nbsp;Financial </span> management and governance</h3>

<h4>4.1 Financial management</h4>

<p>All schools should have robust systems and processes in place to manage their finances securely and effectively and provide assurance of this. It is important the board understands the financial data that is presented to them to ensure there is sufficient challenge.</p>

<p>As a minimum we recommend you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>highlight any material divergence from initial budgets set and ongoing forecasts</li>
  <li>identify and challenge trends and inefficiencies to understand what is happening in your school(s)</li>
  <li>track income versus planned and actual expenditure against budget forecasts, revenue expenditure and non-staff costs as a percentage of total expenditure (and of income)</li>
  <li>analyse cash flow</li>
  <li>ensure pupil number projections have been accurate and if not, immediately re-budget accordingly</li>
  <li>take a longer-term view so you understand financial commitments likely to arise beyond the current year (e.g., replacement of capital assets)</li>
</ul>

<p>Academy trusts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>must</strong> monitor their budget in accordance with the requirements set out in the Academy Trust Handbook</li>
  <li>should ensure there is clarity around the services provided centrally to its academies (e.g., through service level agreements) and have robust processes in place for assessing the quality of these services and their value for money</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-trust-financial-management-good-practice-guides">academy trust financial management good practice guides</a> provide information outlining good practice in academy trust financial management, accounting, and assurance.</p>

<p>LA&nbsp;maintained schools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>must</strong> provide the authority with details of anticipated and actual expenditure and income, in a form and at times determined by the authority</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schemes-for-financing-schools">Schemes for financing local authority-maintained schools</a> sets out the financial relationship between local authorities and the schools they maintain.</p>

<p>All boards can review financial data for their school(s) using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/view-my-financial-insights">View my financial insights (VMFI)</a> - access is given by requesting a “governor” account from your&nbsp;DfE&nbsp;Sign-in approver</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://schools-financial-benchmarking.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Schools financial benchmarking service</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/schools-financial-health-and-efficiency">School resource management</a> provides information, tools, training, and guidance to help all schools save money on day-to-day costs.</p>

<h4>4.2 School and academy trust improvement activities</h4>

<p>The budgetary process should be embedded within the strategic leadership function. It is an integral part of the planning cycle, not an isolated activity that is the sole responsibility of the finance manager.</p>

<p>You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if your school(s) improvement initiatives prioritised, costed, and linked to the budget?</li>
  <li>are all new initiatives fully costed before your school is committed to the proposal?</li>
  <li>any additional workload burden to staff as a result of new initiatives</li>
  <li>do outcomes for pupils with&nbsp;SEND&nbsp;suggest you require a specific focus on&nbsp;SEND&nbsp;in terms of school improvement?</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wholeschoolsend.org.uk/" rel="external">Whole School SEND</a> provides resources/ training in relation to&nbsp;SEND.</p>

<h4>4.3 Long and short-term financial/ budget planning</h4>

<p>Ensure there is a 3-5 year financial/ budget plan, including a balance sheet.</p>

<p>You should challenge the assumptions about future funding, pupil numbers and pressures to ensure they are realistic.</p>

<p>You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your school(s) formula funding for additional needs and the available data on the pupils it will support (e.g., those with special educational needs or English as an additional language) and funding provided through pupil premium</li>
  <li>consult your school(s) published strategy for using pupil premium and recovery premium, check with senior leaders the rationale for the spending decisions and the impact on pupil progress</li>
  <li>planning for expenditure on your estate, including in implementing your published accessibility plan (the content of which&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;include plans to increase access for disabled pupils to the physical environment)</li>
  <li>planning for implementation and refresh of digital and technology infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<h4>4.4 Schedule of contracts</h4>

<p>It is important that contract renewal is planned for in advance of expiration.</p>

<p>All schools should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a contract log to identify which contracts are due for renewal</li>

  <li>analyse what you spend on your estate now, and what you need to spend to keep it safe, watertight and to provide for the future</li>
  <li>prioritise expenditure and investment accordingly</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>boards challenge leadership teams to identify potential causes of the gender pay gap in their school(s)</li>
  <li>develop an effective action plan to tackle gender pay gap</li>
</ul>
