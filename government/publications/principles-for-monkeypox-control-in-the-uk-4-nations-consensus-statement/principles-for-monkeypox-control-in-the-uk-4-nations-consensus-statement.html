<p>This statement has been agreed by the UK public health agencies: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency">UK Health Security Agency</a> (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/" rel="external">Public Health Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://phw.nhs.wales/" rel="external">Public Health Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/" rel="external">Public Health Agency Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h2>Rationale for change</h2>

<p>Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease that until May 2022, was primarily identified in Central and West Africa. There are 2 historical clades of monkeypox – Clade I (former Central African clade) with a reported mortality of 10%, and Clade II (former West African clade)  with a reported mortality of 1% from epidemiological cluster and outbreak reports from Africa. Prior to 2022, it was occasionally identified in other countries related to travel from endemic areas in Central and West Africa.</p>

<p>Within the UK, monkeypox has previously been classified as a High Consequence Infectious Disease (<abbr title="High consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr>). This is not a legal classification but agreed by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and the NHS to enable a consistent approach to public health and clinical or NHS management.</p>

<p>The rationale for classifying monkeypox as an <abbr title="High consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> was that there were infrequent importations, limited information about the disease course and outcome, no confirmed availability of vaccine and unclear approaches to treatment. Therefore, it was reasonable to have a highly precautionary approach designed for complete containment around single cases. This recognised that since the initial clinical assessment cannot determine the particular clade of monkeypox, this approach would reduce the potential for spread.</p>

<p>Since 13 May 2022, cases of monkeypox have been reported in multiple countries that do not have endemic monkeypox virus in animal or human populations, including countries in Europe, North America and Australasia. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing; however reported cases thus far have no established travel links to an endemic area. This suggests significant community transmission in multiple non-endemic countries. In the UK, all reported cases where rapid molecular testing results are available have been identified as Clade II. The World Health Organization (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>) has agreed that Clade II consists of 2 subclades, Clade IIa and Clade IIb. Each of the clades and subclades subdivide into multiple lineages.</p>

<p>The situation in the UK has changed. There are now many cases and it is clear that community transmission is occurring with multiple generations of spread. Illness appears to be generally mild, though some individuals will require hospital admissions to manage secondary infections or complications from the illness. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-vaccination">Pre and post exposure prophylaxis</a> is now available. Due to this changed context, the clade of monkeypox predominantly circulating in the UK (Clade IIb, B.1 lineage) is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hcid-status-of-monkeypox">no longer classified as an <abbr title="High consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>However, importations of monkeypox from West or Central Africa, and/or monkeypox not caused by Clade IIb, B.1 lineage should remain classified as an <abbr title="High consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr>, as the severity of the original clades remains unknown.</p>

<p>Monkeypox is a Hazard Group 3 organism <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/misc208.pdf" rel="external">(ACDP/HSE)</a>. Other organisms in this category include Salmonella typhi, HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are managed routinely in the community. From July 2022, the internationally agreed approach for managing clinical waste and diagnostic samples from monkeypox cases is that they are now managed as Category B, similar to the other organisms in Hazard Group 3.</p>

<p>These principles are to ensure a proportionate response and to deliver on achievable strategic outcomes. These principles do not replace the need for local dynamic risk assessments which remain key.</p>

<h2>Strategic aims</h2>

<p>An overly precautionary response creates public health risk; for example the exclusion of healthcare workers can adversely affect clinical services, especially sexual health clinics and emergency departments (<abbr title="emergency departments">EDs</abbr>). It is important that public health management promotes engagement with health services as well as preventing stigma and controlling spread. Given this, the strategic aims of the public health response to the clade of monkeypox currently circulating in the UK are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to suppress the transmission of monkeypox in the community and aim for eradication (decreasing Rt below 1) by targeting public health measures to the highest risks for transmission</li>
  <li>to protect against spread of infection in hospitals and healthcare settings and to healthcare workers assessing and managing patients</li>
  <li>to enable safe functioning of NHS services, including those services which can diagnose and manage cases, in the context of community transmission of monkeypox</li>
</ul>

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>Professionals – to inform development of operational guidance in <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, NHS and other organisations.</p>

<h2>Assumptions about transmission and biology</h2>

<p>These assumptions are based on the available data and expert opinion and are aligned with <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>. They will be regularly reviewed using the evidence generated in the incident response.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>For individuals with infection who are well, ambulatory, and have either prodrome or rash, the highest risk transmission routes are direct contact, droplet or fomite. Transmission seen so far in this outbreak is consistent with close direct contact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is currently no published evidence that individuals are infectious before the onset of the prodromal illness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For individuals with infection who have evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement or severe systemic illness requiring hospitalisation, the possibility of airborne transmission has not been excluded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It remains important to reduce the risk of fomite transmission. The risk can be substantially reduced by following agreed cleaning methods based on standard cleaning and disinfection, or by washing clothes or domestic equipment with standard detergents and cleaning products. Within healthcare, refer to the local country national infection prevention and control manual or guidance for decontamination.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waste management and decontamination practice should follow best practice and be based on all the available evidence on safe handling of all waste in accordance with country specific legislation and regulations (clinical waste is now managed as Category B).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The highest risk period for onwards infection is from the onset of the prodrome until the lesions have scabbed over and the scabs have fallen off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deroofing procedures and throat swabs are not considered to be aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>) but may cause droplets. The list of <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-infection-prevention-and-control/" rel="external">national infection prevention and control manual</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little available evidence on monkeypox in genital excretions, so a precautionary approach is recommended: in addition to abstaining from sex while symptomatic (including during the prodromal phase and while lesions are present), <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/principles-for-monkeypox-control-in-the-uk-4-nations-consensus-statement/principles-for-monkeypox-control-in-the-uk-4-nations-consensus-statement">condoms should be used for 12 weeks after infection</a> (this will be updated as evidence emerges).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disease in healthy adults is primarily self-limiting and with a relatively low mortality. There is remaining uncertainty over potentially increased severity in children and in individuals who are immunocompromised or pregnant.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Implications</h2>

<p>Risk assessment and consideration of the hierarchy of controls will help determine the level of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) to use.</p>

<p>For possible/probable cases, the minimum <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gloves</li>
  <li>fluid repellent surgical facemask (<abbr title="fluid repellent surgical facemask">FRSM</abbr>) (an <abbr title="fluid repellent surgical facemask">FRSM</abbr> should be replaced with an FFP3 respirator and eye protection if the case presents with a lower respiratory tract infection with a cough and/or changes on their chest x-ray indicating lower respiratory tract infection)</li>
  <li>apron</li>
  <li>eye protection is required if there is a risk of splash to the face and eyes (for example when taking diagnostic tests)</li>
</ul>

<p>For confirmed or highly probable cases requiring ongoing clinical management (for example inpatient care or repeated assessment of an individual who is clinically unwell or deteriorating), the minimum recommended <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for healthcare workers is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fit-tested FFP3 respirator</li>
  <li>eye protection</li>
  <li>long sleeved, fluid repellent, disposable gown</li>
  <li>gloves</li>
</ul>

<p>The above <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> will be used as the basis for contact classification.</p>

<h3>Community and domestic</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Home isolation may be used for clinically well ambulatory possible, probable, highly probable or confirmed cases for whom it is judged by the primary clinician and the <abbr title="High consequence infectious disease">HCID</abbr> network as safe and clinically appropriate, with ongoing clinical and public health support for clinical management and isolation.</li>
  <li>For ambulatory well possible, probable, highly probable or confirmed cases with limited lesions, covering lesions and wearing a face covering or mask reduces the risk of onwards transmission.</li>
  <li>Individuals with possible, probable, highly probable or confirmed monkeypox should avoid close contact with others until all lesions have healed, and scabs dried off. This should include staying at home unless requiring medical assessment or care, or other urgent health and wellbeing issues.</li>
  <li>Close household and non-household contacts of confirmed or highly probable cases should be risk assessed. Medium risk (category 2) and high risk (category 3) contacts do not need to isolate, but should avoid sexual or intimate contact with others for 21 days. High risk (category 3) contacts should also avoid contact with children aged under 5 years and individuals who are pregnant or immunocompromised, where possible.</li>
  <li>Cleaning to reduce risk from the environment in community settings can be effectively achieved without using specialist services or equipment.</li>
  <li>The risk of transmission in the home environment for possible, probable, highly probable or confirmed cases can be reduced by the case performing regular domestic cleans and washing their own clothing and bed linen in a domestic washing machine.</li>
  <li>Transport from the community to healthcare facilities for possible, probable, highly probable or confirmed cases should be via private transport where possible. Where private transport is not available, public transport can be used but busy periods should be avoided. Any lesions should be covered by cloth (for example scarves or bandages) and a face covering must be worn.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ambulatory care</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>For possible, probable, highly probable or confirmed cases, attending ambulatory healthcare (for example outpatients, <abbr title="emergency departments">EDs</abbr>, urgent care centres, general practice, sexual health clinics), patients should be placed in a single room for assessment. The case should be provided with a <abbr title="fluid repellent surgical facemask">FRSM</abbr> to wear as appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where possible, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals (as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contraindications-and-special-considerations-the-green-book-chapter-6">Green Book</a>) should not assess or clinically care for individuals with suspected or confirmed monkeypox. This will be reassessed as evidence emerges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close household and non-household contacts of confirmed or highly probable cases should be risk assessed. Medium risk (category 2) and high risk (category 3) contacts do not need to isolate, but should avoid sexual or intimate contact with others for 21 days. High risk (category 3) contacts should also avoid contact with children aged under 5 years and individuals who are pregnant or immunocompromised, where possible.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Inpatient healthcare</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>For cleaning and decontamination of the room within healthcare settings, healthcare facilities should refer to the relevant country national infection prevention and control manual.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where possible, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals (as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contraindications-and-special-considerations-the-green-book-chapter-6">Green Book</a>) should not assess or clinically care for individuals with suspected or confirmed monkeypox. This will be reassessed as evidence emerges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close household and non-household contacts of confirmed or highly probable cases should be risk assessed. Medium risk (category 2) and high risk (category 3) contacts do not need to isolate, but should avoid sexual or intimate contact with others for 21 days. High risk (category 3) contacts should also avoid contact with children aged under 5 years and individuals who are pregnant or immunocompromised, where possible.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Other residential settings</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Within non-domestic residential settings (for example adult social care, prisons, homeless shelters, refuges), individuals who are clinically well should be managed in a single room with separate toilet facilities where possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In domestic and non-domestic settings where healthcare is being provided, waste generated is classified as healthcare waste and should be managed appropriately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where possible, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals (as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contraindications-and-special-considerations-the-green-book-chapter-6">Green Book</a>) should not assess or clinically care for individuals with suspected or confirmed monkeypox. This will be reassessed as evidence emerges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close contacts of confirmed or highly probable cases in these settings should be assessed for vaccine, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-vaccination">following the contact recommendations</a>.</p>
