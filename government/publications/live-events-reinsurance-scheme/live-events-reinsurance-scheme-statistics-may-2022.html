<p>The delivery partner for the Live Events Reinsurance Scheme provides DCMS with a monthly data pack reporting against a number of metrics on Scheme delivery including policies bound, sums insured, premiums and claims. A selection of these are shared and defined below. All data is cumulative and as the Scheme is live, policies are being written on an ongoing basis. The data reported here was reported to DCMS as of 16 May 2022.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>Cover written under the Scheme to date: £117m.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>This is the total sum insured for policies written under the Scheme since its launch in September 2021. This includes those insured events which have already taken place, and those insured events which are still yet to take place.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>Total investment associated with events covered under the Scheme to date: over £400m.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Information on event budgets are provided by each purchaser of insurance at the point of purchase. These are self-reported by the purchaser and DCMS has not taken any steps to verify these numbers. These self-reported data points are added together to calculate total investment associated with events covered under the Scheme since its launch in September 2021. This includes those insured events which have already taken place, and those insured events which are still yet to take place.</p>

<p>Information on jobs supported by the Scheme is provided by each purchaser of insurance at the point of purchase. It is self-reported by the purchaser and DCMS has not taken any steps to verify these numbers or to assess the extent to which there is any double-counting, for example of contractors supplying to multiple events covered by the Scheme. The nature of these jobs are not known. These self-reported data points are added together to calculate total jobs supported by the Scheme since its launch in September 2021, this does not include data from October/ November.
