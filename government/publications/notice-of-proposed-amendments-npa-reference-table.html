<p>If consultation is to be undertaken on an amendment to the regulations or the implementation of new regulation, the <abbr title="Military Aviation Authority">MAA</abbr> will issue an <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Amendments">NPA</abbr>. The <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Amendments">NPA</abbr> will explain the rationale behind the amendment, the possible impact on the regulated community (developed into an impact assessment (<abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr>)) and set the deadline for comment/feedback. Feedback is important to further develop the <abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Comments or enquiries on any <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Amendments">NPA</abbr> are to be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DSA-MAA-MRPEnquiries@mod.gov.uk">DSA-<abbr title="Military Aviation Authority">MAA</abbr>-MRPEnquiries@mod.gov.uk</a> by the date stated in the <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Amendments">NPA</abbr>.

<p>After the comments closure date, the <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Amendments">NPA</abbr> will be removed from the website.</p>

<p><abbr title="Notice of Proposed Amendments">NPA</abbr> comment response sheets contain the collated <abbr title="Military Aviation Authority">MAA</abbr> responses to individual <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Amendments">NPA</abbr> publications.</p>

<p>In the final preparation for publication similar Regulated Community comments have been consolidated into one response.</p>

<p>Some of the <abbr title="Military Aviation Authority">MAA</abbr> responses to the Regulated Community comments may have been superseded by further internal review prior to the official publication of the new issue.</p>
