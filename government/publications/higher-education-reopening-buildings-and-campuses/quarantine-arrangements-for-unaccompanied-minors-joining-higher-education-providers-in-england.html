<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The guidance in this document applies in relation to Higher Education (<abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>) students who are under the age of 18 and are travelling alone to join a course of <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> at a Higher Education Provider (<abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>) in England or Wales who will not be living with a host family. Specifically, those who arrive in England and meet the UK entry requirements and have travelled from or through a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#red-list">red list country (<abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr>)</a> in the previous 10 days.</p>

<p>Any reference to a ‘student’ in this document refers to an unaccompanied minor (<abbr title="unaccompanied minor">UM</abbr>) from a <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr> travelling to join a <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> as described above.</p>

<p>In line with this guidance, these students may be invited to quarantine within accommodation provided for or arranged by their <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>. If a <abbr title="unaccompanied minor">UM</abbr> arrives here for a course of <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> but is living with a host family or needs to enter managed quarantine in a managed quarantine hotel, they should refer to the relevant <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/unaccompanied-higher-and-further-education-students-under-18-arriving-from-a-red-list-country#other-types-of-quarantine-for-he-and-fe-students-under-18" class="govuk-link">quarantine guidance on gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Any <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> providers in Scotland or Northern Ireland who wish to take red list arrival students under the age of 18 and travelling alone should follow the procedures for those countries.</p>

<p>Any Welsh HEPs should refer to the relevant guidance for HEPs in Wales.</p>

<p>Anyone who is not a British or Irish national, or who does not have the right to reside in the UK, who has travelled from or through a <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr> in the previous 10 days, is not permitted to enter the UK and should not travel. International students with a student visa are permitted to enter the UK from an <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Students arriving from (or who have, in the past 10 days, travelled through) RLCs are not permitted to use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel" class="govuk-link">test to release scheme</a>. This remains true in the case of this guidance.</p>

<p>Other students travelling to attend a <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> in England who have not travelled from, or through, a <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr> in the previous 10 days should consult the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses/higher-education-covid-19-operational-guidance#new-and-returning-students-travelling-from-overseas" class="govuk-link">relevant guidance on arrivals procedures for <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> return more broadly</a>. Much of the guidance below will overlap with this guidance and some of the additional advice may be useful in setting up quarantine arrangements for these UMs.</p>

<p>UMs travelling from or through RLCs should never quarantine in the same household (as defined below) as students travelling from non-red list countries, and there are specific arrangements required to ensure they quarantine in a COVID-secure manner.</p>

<p>These students should not be charged for this quarantine, and students can only be housed by the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> they are coming to join in England or Wales for the purpose of receiving a course of <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>.</p>

<p>It is important to read this document in its entirety before hosting UMs from RLCs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>The International Travel Regulations</h2>

<p>Subject to certain exceptions, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/contents">The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021</a> (the International Travel Regulations) require UK or Irish nationals or those with a right to reside in the UK who have travelled to, from, or through a <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr>, in the 10 days before arriving in England, to self-isolate in government approved accommodation.</p>

<p>Amendments have now been made to the International Travel Regulations that mean that minors travelling to the UK alone (‘unaccompanied minors’), for the purpose of receiving education at a <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> in England or Wales at which education and accommodation is due to be provided, who are either UK or Irish nationals or who have a right to reside in the UK and have travelled from or through a <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr> within the 10 days before the date of their arrival in England, are allowed to quarantine at their eventual destination, which includes in the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>’s accommodation.</p>

<p>Schedule 11, paragraph 18 of the International Travel Regulations, provides that self-isolation must be in government approved accommodation, unless you are a ‘relevant person’.</p>

<p>The person travelling (referred to as P in this section) is a ‘relevant person’ if all of the following conditions apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(a) P is a child on the day P arrives in England</li>
  <li>(b) P travels to the UK for the purposes of receiving education at a further education institution or higher education provider in England or Wales at which education and accommodation is due to be provided for P</li>
  <li>(c) P is not accompanied into the UK by an individual who has responsibility for P; and</li>
  <li>(d) the Secretary of State has confirmed in writing that this paragraph applies in relation to P and has not withdrawn that confirmation</li>
</ul>

<p>A ‘higher education provider’ means an institution which provides higher education.</p>

<p>To satisfy requirement (d), the Secretary of State has decided to confirm (by writing to HEPs) that paragraph 18 of Schedule 11 to the International Travel Regulations applies in relation to any person who meets each of the requirements listed in sub-paragraphs (3A)(a) to (c). The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) will write to HEPs setting out this decision. In the letter to HEPs, the Department will also explain what arrangements for quarantine accommodation, transport from the port of entry to the quarantine accommodation and testing of those quarantining should be made.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>HEPs in scope to host minors from RLCs</h2>

<p>To be considered eligible to host UMs, HEPs are required to already be a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-students">Student sponsor</a>. HEPs must be aware of and maintain all <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-sponsor-guidance" class="govuk-link">sponsorship duties</a> and not be in breach of the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/regulation/conditions-of-registration/">conditions of registration</a> as set out by the Office for Students.</p>

<p>If any <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> has not received a letter but wishes to be considered, please contact <a href="mailto:HE.covid@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>.covid@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>There is no disapplication of these requirements in relation to unaccompanied minors quarantining having arrived from, or having travelled, through an <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> deemed to be eligible will receive a letter from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> confirming this to be the case, and they should ensure the student is able to present this at the border as set out in the ‘Before Travelling’ section below.</p>

<p>HEPs considering hosting unaccompanied minors in their accommodation may find it useful to familiarise themselves with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2" class="govuk-link">Keeping children safe in education</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2">Working together to safeguard children</a> guidance which, while aimed at schoolchildren, will help to serve as a guide for the expectations of safeguarding standards <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> places upon them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Before Travelling</h2>

<p>HEPs hosting UMs from RLCs will need to have plans in place for the collection and transfer of students from their port of arrival to the <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> facilities where they will quarantine. It is the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>’s responsibility to ensure they collect their arrival(s) from their port of entry.</p>

<p>These plans will need to be explained to the students and, where appropriate, their parents, before they travel.</p>

<p>Students should ensure that they have been issued with a student visa before travelling, and they must bring this with them as evidence of their student status.</p>

<p>If the student is a British national returning from an <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr> they will not be in possession of a student visa, but instead should present proof of study such as an acceptance letter that quotes their name or photo identification from the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>.</p>

<p>In addition, HEPs should send students coming from or through RLCs the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A copy of the letter from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to HEPs confirming that UMs are covered by an exception to managed quarantine. This will be sent to all HEPs who are student sponsors, addressed to their vice chancellor. If any <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> has not received a letter but thinks they should have done, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:HE.covid@education.gov.uk"><abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>.covid@education.gov.uk</a>.</li>
  <li>A letter from the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> to the individual student. This letter needs to include:
    <ul>
      <li>the student’s name and date of birth</li>
      <li>a 24hr contact phone number for the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> (this should be different to the pick-up contact below). Please be aware that this number will be called when the individual arrives at the airport to confirm you are expecting the individual</li>
      <li>confirmation of pick-up arrangements from the port of entry (including contact name and phone number for the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> representative responsible for pick up and travel arrangements)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Students should have their proof of student status (for example, student visa documentation or student ID/acceptance letter that quotes their name) and both of the letters in (1) and (2) ready to present to border force.</p>

<p>Before travelling, all students must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england#take-a-coronavirus-test-before-you-travel-to-england">Take a coronavirus (COVID-19) test and get a negative result during the 3 days before they travel</a>. For example, if they travel directly to England on Friday, they must take the test on the Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that this test meets the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england#type-of-test" class="govuk-link">minimum requirements</a> for a coronavirus COVID-19 test. They must bring proof of this negative test with them.</li>

<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/">Book and pay for a travel test package</a> through Corporate Travel Management (<abbr title="Corporate Travel Management">CTM</abbr>) – the package will include COVID-19 tests to be taken on day 2 and day 8 of their quarantine. They must take a COVID-19 test on or before day 2 for variant surveillance and a test on or after day 8 to check that they do not have COVID-19. These tests will need to be received and stored by the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> and given to the student on days 2 and 8 of their quarantine. This is important as a negative day 8 result is how a student will be released from quarantine. More details are below.</li>

</ul>

<p>If available in the student’s home country they should, where possible, get a COVID-19 vaccination before travel and also ensure they bring the relevant paperwork proving their vaccination status with them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Travelling to the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> from the port of entry</h2>

<p>Schedule 11 paragraph 6 of the International Travel Regulations, in effect, requires an unaccompanied minor to travel directly to where they are quarantining using transport determined by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has determined that the transport must meet the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it must be a motor vehicle</li>
  <li>it cannot be public transport</li>
  <li>it must be transport that has been pre-arranged by the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> in England or Wales at which the student is due to attend as a student on their arrival in England</li>
</ul>

<p>When arriving from an <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr>, <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> students should be met at their port of entry by a representative of their <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>, which the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> can designate as the transport operator if required. The students should be transported directly to their facility to isolate.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> representative should ensure they are at the port of entry in good time to pick up the arriving student or students and carry proof of identity.</p>

<p>If the representative has issues getting to the port of entry on time they should phone and advise the Managed Quarantine Operations Centre on +44(0) 207 429 9732.</p>

<p>This includes if there is a change in the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> representative responsible for the student’s or students’ pick up and transport after the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> has issued its letter to the student or students.</p>

<p>When the representative arrives at the port of entry and is ready to pick up the student or students, they should go to the ‘Managed Quarantine’ collection point in the arrivals hall. Once their identity has been confirmed the student or students will be brought through to meet them. The <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> representative who is responsible for transport should ensure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appropriate social distancing (at least 2 metres) is maintained at all times, including in the airport</li>
  <li>students should wear face coverings</li>
  <li>good hand hygiene in maintained by ensuring a plentiful supply of alcohol hand gel</li>
  <li>if more than 1 student is travelling, ensure the transport is of a size that will allow social distancing and ensure there is a seating plan with allocated seating</li>
  <li>in coaches, 3 rows of seats must be allowed between students and the driver</li>
  <li>good ventilation within the vehicle through open windows or effective air conditioning</li>
  <li>that transport does not stop at any services (including at request of passenger), unless in an emergency such as fire</li>
  <li>where a long journey necessitates toilet breaks, these stops should be prearranged with facilities that should be exclusively for the use of the travelling student(s) for the duration of the stop and can be cleaned afterwards before being used again (HEPs may want to make arrangements with other HEPs to use facilities if needed en route)</li>
  <li>the destination <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> is notified around 20 minutes prior to arrival so they can prepare for the arrival</li>
  <li>students disembark in a socially distanced manner and are transferred to the care of <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> staff</li>
  <li>if more than 1 student has travelled, pass the seating plan to the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> for test and trace purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>On arrival at the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>, an outdoor route along paths that take students directly to the areas where they will quarantine should be used. These paths should, where possible, not cross over with domestic student population areas and should keep away from areas where other students are likely to congregate, such as shops, libraries or other amenities.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> may wish to consider closing a section of campus for a short time to allow safe passage to ensure minimal chances for interaction with other students. As much of the journey from their transport to their quarantine facility as possible should be outdoors.</p>

<p><abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> staff facilitating arrival should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times. PPE in this instance refers to face coverings and frequent hand washing.</p>

<p>A clear system should handle the arrival of multiple <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> students at once and ensure strict social distancing. Students arriving from RLCs should be kept separate from students arriving from other countries and other students at all times.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Defining a household for HEPs</h2>

<p>Students arriving from RLCs must quarantine for at least 10 days on arrival in England. 
Under the International Travel Regulations, this quarantine must be completed in accommodation that the Secretary of State considers appropriate.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has determined that in the case of <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> accommodation for <abbr title="unaccompanied minor">UM</abbr> students, the quarantine can take place in accommodation that comprises of residential facilities organised by the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> in England that the student (as the case may be) is due to attend as a student on their arrival in England.</p>

<p>A quarantine household (where a household is defined as no more than 8 arrivals from the same <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr> entering into <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> accommodation that meets the requirements set out in this section of the guidance for the purpose of quarantine) should be a separate and physically isolated from the rest of the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> residents.</p>

<p>Each household should occupy part of the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> site which can be separated from the parts of the site used by other households for isolation and quarantine purposes and areas used by other staff and students.</p>

<p>For example, households may occupy separate buildings or parts of buildings. The latter could be a separate floor or part of the building that has its own entry system.</p>

<p>As above, students arriving from RLCs must quarantine in a separate household both from students required to quarantine who have not come through red list countries and from students who are not required to quarantine.</p>

<p>This allows multiple international <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> students arriving from (or having travelled through) the same <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr> to quarantine together in the same household, however there should be no more than 8 people sharing the same facilities.</p>

<p>So, for example, a floor with its own entry system that has 8 rooms or more, with at least 1 bathroom and at least 1 kitchen could theoretically house a maximum of 8 unaccompanied minors who travelled through the same <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Please refer to the Facilities section below for rules of how these facilities are to be used by members of the household. Both the conditions for the sharing of facilities and those conditions set out in this section must be met.</p>

<p>As above, the maximum number of UMs from RLCs per household is 8. Where HEPs wish to take on more than 8 students from the same <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr>, a new household must be formed and other accommodation that adheres to the same principles as set our here should be used.</p>

<p>Similarly, a new household would need to be formed for each distinct <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr>, meeting the requirements stated here (for example, <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr> A arrivals cannot be in the same building or part of a building as <abbr title="red list country">RLC</abbr> B arrivals).</p>

<p>If HEPs have students arriving to quarantine on different days, other members of the household should be asked to remain in their rooms while the new entrant is being brought in and shown to their room.</p>

<p>No member of a household may leave quarantine until they have met the criteria for ending quarantine, also set out below. Even if only 1 student is in quarantine, all relevant conditions outlined here will need to be met.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Facilities required for quarantine</h2>

<p>Students in a household have a legal duty to self-isolate from one another, unless an exception applies (see schedule 11, paragraph 11 of the International Travel Regulations for exceptions) and there is an expectation that the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> facilitates this for students within the household. This means that primarily the period of quarantine is to be undertaken in the student’s room.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Rooms</h3>
<p>As such, students from RLCs within the household (as defined in the section above) must have an individual room.</p>

<p>Students cannot go in and out of each other’s rooms during their period of quarantine, however they can access shared facilities (more details below).</p>

<p>Rooms should have a window. Students should be asked for this window to be open as much as is feasible in order to allow fresh air to enter the room.</p>

<p>Any time a student is outside of their room they should wear a face covering.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Bathroom</h3>
<p>Ideally, student rooms would have an en suite with shower and toilet facilities to allow for maximum isolation from other quarantining residents.</p>

<p>Where this is not possible, as a minimum, there must be at least 1 bathroom (including a shower) for the household. This bathroom must be used exclusively by students from within the quarantining household. There should be an expectation placed upon the quarantining students that the bathroom be cleaned between uses.</p>

<p>To the extent that is feasible, HEPs should facilitate the usage of bathroom facilities at separate times. Students should be made aware that, within reason, they should not use bathroom facilities if there is another member of the quarantining household in there. In isolated instances where this is unavoidable the students should maintain social distancing and, as above, wear a face covering.</p>

<p>If there are multiple bathrooms in the household, HEPs may wish to designate bathrooms to certain rooms to minimise the number of people sharing the same facilities.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> may wish to assist by providing cleaning staff.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Kitchen</h3>
<p>Ideally, students would have food delivered to their room. Frequency and dietary requirements can be arranged with the student beforehand.</p>

<p>Where this is not possible, as a minimum there should be at least 1 kitchen facility that quarantining students can share. This kitchen must not be accessed by anyone outside of the red list household. The kitchen also cannot be used by quarantining students simultaneously.</p>

<p>There is an expectation that the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> to designate a rota to allocate times for using the kitchen. An expectation should also be placed upon the student that they return to their room and wait for the kitchen to be free if it is occupied at the time they attempt to use it.</p>

<p>Where food is consumed is at the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>’s discretion and will depend on the number of quarantining students in the household and how much time they will require use of the kitchen. If food is consumed in the student’s room the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> will need to consider collecting dirty dishes if the student cannot go back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>If students are sharing a kitchen, they cannot leave their quarantine accommodation to visit a supermarket, and so groceries would need to be delivered directly to them. This should be done taking into account individual needs and dietary requirements.</p>

<p>It is at the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>’s discretion as to whether the students can order food from outside to be delivered. The <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> would need to facilitate the delivery of this to the quarantine room in a COVID-secure way, for example, left outside the student’s door for them to collect.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Bedding and waste disposal</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> should put in place COVID-secure arrangements for the disposing of waste. Bedding can be left outside the students’ doors to change themselves. As a default, a laundry service should not be offered given the short period of time in question. If laundry is to be done, the student should request this from the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> on an ad hoc basis by contacting a designated contact.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Supervising and supporting students during their quarantine</h2>

<p>HEPs are in a strong position to support their students who are self-isolating having done this multiple times throughout the last academic year.</p>

<p>It is of vital importance that students are informed of the conditions of their quarantine before they arrive, and made aware that they will be spending 10 days in a room, alone (with occasional breaks for outdoor exercise). They should prepare themselves for that as best they can.</p>

<p>HEPs will need to provide appropriate information to students about how they need to behave while in quarantine, for example, not entering into each other’s rooms and reminding them of the importance of cleaning facilities after use. They will also need to set out the rules for using facilities separately from one another and it is at the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>’s discretion as to how this is implemented (for example, using a timetable). However, as mentioned above, it must be made clear to students that they should not use kitchen facilities if someone else is in there.</p>

<p>It is highly important that students are made aware of procedures to follow, such as how they will access services and how can contact staff if help is required or in the event of emergency, for example, a fire or medical trauma.</p>

<p>HEPs should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure students follow the guidance on how to quarantine when they arrive in England</li>
  <li>ensure that there is no opportunity for students to leave their household area (for example, building or floor of a building), except where carefully supervised (for example, for exercise)</li>
  <li>put in place arrangements for the oversight of students in quarantine to the extent required that the safety and welfare of all students and staff who interact with them is protected</li>
  <li>provide students with clear rules (based on this guidance) as to what is expected and acceptable during their quarantine period including a clear statement of the area that the students are allowed to occupy (for example, an area including their room and toilet/bathroom facilities that are for the use of red list quarantining students and no-one else)</li>
  <li>provide students with as much information as will be helpful for them to understand the practicalities of being in quarantine such as arrangements for meals, room cleaning, disposing of rubbish, laundry, process for requesting and enjoying outdoor exercise and emergency procedures. Rules and information should be provided verbally and in writing</li>
  <li>provide alcohol gel for each student, with advice on how to use the gels and the risk of ingestion and flammability of the gel</li>
  <li>have procedures in place, where possible agreed in advance with the student themselves, setting out what it will do in the case of an emergency</li>
  <li>put in place appropriate arrangements for the collection of waste from each quarantining household. This should be conducted without unnecessary contact between staff and members of the household, for example, left outside students’ doors</li>
  <li>staff should wear appropriate PPE (masks, aprons, gloves, eye protection etc.) when handling laundry from quarantining students</li>
  <li>if required, laundry should be treated as infectious and double bagged, should be tagged with the care area and date, and stored in a designated, safe lockable area while awaiting laundering. Laundry should be washed on a hot wash at 60˚C</li>
  <li>all consumable waste items that have been in contact with quarantining students, including used tissues, should be put in a plastic rubbish bag, double bagged and tied. This should be disposed of with normal household rubbish after a wait of 24 hours</li>
  <li>make other, non-quarantining staff and students on campus aware of quarantine areas and advise that they stay away</li>
  <li>provide, where possible, materials relating to emotional and mental health support, and if they do not have a way of doing so already, facilitate contact with a trusted adult, for example, loaning digital equipment for video calls to home</li>
  <li>HEPs should arrange for in-person contact with the students at least once during their quarantine. This might be outside during a period of exercise, so that they can check on the students’ wellbeing and ensure they are coping with quarantine. This is particularly important if there is one individual quarantining alone. HEPs should also remotely check that a student is coping with their quarantine on a regular basis</li>
  <li>HEPs should make provision for students to have a 24h contact who could respond swiftly in the event of a medical or other emergency</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Exercise and fresh air</h2>
<p>Students may leave the place in which they are quarantining for socially-distanced exercise once per day, and only under staff supervision.</p>

<p><abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> staff should ensure that students within a quarantining household do not come into contact with any individuals from outside the students’ household or staff supervising and providing care to their household.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Testing students</h2>

<p>Students arrive on day zero and testing must take place on days 2 and 8 as per the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england#rules-if-you-are-not-fully-vaccinated" class="govuk-link">testing package</a> that students will have booked in advance (see the ‘Before Travelling’ section above). Students will have ordered these tests to arrive at the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>. The <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> may wish to choose a preferred provider from the <a href="https://www.find-travel-test-provider.service.gov.uk/test-type" class="govuk-link" rel="external">list of approved providers</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> staff should collect new test kits when students arrive and put them in storage (ensuring storage is at an appropriate temperature: 5°C to 22°C). Students will need to be made aware of the address to which they should have their tests sent when booking.</p>

<p>HEPs should have a plan setting out which student will receive test kits on which day. When required, <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> staff should collect test kits from storage and deliver them to students within their household accommodation. 
After students have completed the test, <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> staff should collect the test kit and put it into a box which should be closed and sealed for transport.</p>

<p>They should not handle the test kit further before collection when they should be passed to the courier. Students should normally complete the test themselves, following the instructions. <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> staff should familiarise themselves with test-kit instructions so that they can provide appropriate support for students where necessary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Visitors to students in quarantine</h2>
<p>Students in quarantine from RLCs should not receive visitors, except in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>If it is necessary for social workers, other social care staff, medical staff or other professionals to engage with a student they should consider in the first instance if this can be done so remotely. Where this is not possible or appropriate, they should follow the safe working in education guidance when making any unavoidable visits.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Leaving quarantine under exceptional circumstances</h2>

<p>Students must not leave the place where they are quarantining until their quarantine has ended (see below), except on any of the grounds set out in paragraph 13(1) of Schedule 11 to the International Travel Regulations.</p>

<p>These include, but are not limited to, the student leaving:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to fulfil a legal obligation (for example, to attend court)</li>
  <li>to seek medical assistance where this is required urgently or on the advice of a registered medical practitioner</li>
  <li>to avoid injury, illness or escape a risk of harm (for example situations such as fire or flooding or where there is a risk of abuse) or</li>
  <li>to access critical public services including social services or services provided to victims (for example critical access such as for a student to see their social worker)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of some of the other grounds (related to exercise, visiting a person who appears to be dying and attendance at a funeral), prior permission (‘a required prior permission’) needs to be given by a person authorised by the Secretary of State for this purpose. Prior permissions are granted in the letter from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to HEPs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Ending quarantine</h2>
<p>Each member of a household (see definition above) that has entered quarantine in a household at an <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> must remain in quarantine for a full 10 days.</p>

<p>It is important that students are made aware of this fact and be prepared for being isolated for 10 days.</p>

<p>Students are allowed to leave quarantine after midnight on day 10 assuming their day 8 test is negative. If the result of a student’s day 8 test is inconclusive, they must stay in quarantine until they take an additional test and receive a negative result.</p>

<p>If it is positive, a further 10 days of isolation would be required. The student should also be made aware of this.</p>

<p>Once quarantine is over, <abbr title="unaccompanied minor">UM</abbr> students can join the rest of the student population. However, HEPs should continue to manage all students in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses/higher-education-covid-19-operational-guidance" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> COVID operational guidance</a>.</p>

<p>The JCVI is now advising that all 16- and 17-year olds receive their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. As such, on leaving quarantine, students should be encouraged to vaccinated against COVID-19. As part of the information given to students during quarantine, HEPs may wish to invite them to register with a GP and provide information regarding the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Risk assessments</h2>
<p>HEPs will need to undertake their own risk assessments about how to quarantine students safely. HEPs should have regard to <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/963541/Schools_coronavirus_operational_guidance.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on isolation for those showing symptoms of coronavirus</a> in planning for the quarantine of arriving students.</p>

<p>For example, fire safety risk assessments should be updated to consider the need for social distancing on evacuation and risk assessments in completing emergency repairs and maintenance should consider the need for social distancing.</p>

<p>HEPs can seek advice from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team" class="govuk-link">local health protection teams</a> if needed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>
<abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> staff</h2>

<p>Households (as defined above) will almost always need to have staff and other professionals arriving and leaving during the period of quarantine.</p>

<p>Where possible, HEPs should operate a consistent staff rota to minimise the risk of transmission. The rota should avoid individual staff having contact with multiple quarantining households.</p>

<p>Staff who are non-resident, visiting or partially resident and who travel between an affected setting and their own home will need to pay particular attention to careful infection prevention and control, including social distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene.</p>

<p>Any staff member who develops symptoms of COVID-19 should cease working immediately and self-isolate. <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> staff working with students who are in quarantine after arriving from red list countries should be supplied with Lateral Flow Device (LFD) test kits to self-swab and test themselves once per day at home.</p>

<p>Staff must report their result to NHS Test and Trace as soon as the test is completed either online or by telephone as per the instructions in the home test kit. Staff should also share their result, whether void, positive or negative, with their <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> to help with contact tracing. Staff with a positive LFD test result will need to self-isolate in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay-at-home guidance</a>. They will also need to arrange a lab-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to confirm the result if the test was done at home.</p>

<p>Those with a negative daily LFD test result can continue to attend their <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> to work with the quarantine students as long as they take the protective measures outlined in this document, for example, maintaining social distancing and wearing PPE.</p>

<p>HEPs may wish to refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe">safe working in education, childcare and children’s social care settings</a> document as a guideline for engagement with students in quarantine. This includes arrangements where a child or young person showing symptoms of COVID-19 requires staff contact for personal care.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Education</h2>

<p>Where HEPs wish to commence the education of any quarantining students, this may only be done where it would be consistent with the student maintaining their quarantine (for example, through remote learning). We would strongly encourage this as it may help with students’ mental health during quarantine by keeping them stimulated.</p>

<p>If it is not possible for them to start the course remotely at the same time as the rest of the students because of their quarantine, providing reading materials related to the students’ course or making them aware of these before they travel so that they can commence education-related learning would be beneficial to help them to feel part of the university while quarantining. At the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr>’s discretion, catch-up sessions should be considered for students who miss out on education as a result of having to quarantine.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>HEPs who are unable to offer quarantine to unaccompanied minors</h2>

<p>Full guidance for these students is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/unaccompanied-higher-and-further-education-students-under-18-arriving-from-a-red-list-country">Unaccompanied higher and further education students under 18 arriving from a red list country</a>.</p>

<p>Where an <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> has accepted an unaccompanied minor onto a course, but that <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> is unable to provide accommodation in-line with guidance and/or requirements for them to quarantine, the student may be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/unaccompanied-higher-and-further-education-students-under-18-arriving-from-a-red-list-country#other-types-of-quarantine-for-he-and-fe-students-under-18">staying with a host family</a>. Where this is not the case, the managed quarantine service will be making available a small number of rooms with additional safeguarding in place to host them.</p>

<p>In either instance, the <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> should write to the student to confirm that they are unable to provide <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> accommodation to ensure that the student is able to come through at the border and undertake managed quarantine or travel on to a host family.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Entering managed quarantine as a minor</h2>

<p>To get permission to book an under-18 student into managed quarantine, the student, or an adult responsible for the student, should email <a href="mailto:MQS_new_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">MQS_new_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk</a>. They will receive an automated response with a list of questions that they need to answer.</p>

<p>Once permission to book managed quarantine has been granted, the student or adult responsible for the student will be directed to contact <a href="https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="Corporate Travel Management">CTM</abbr></a> to book managed quarantine.</p>

<p>HEPs should consider how <abbr title="unaccompanied minor">UM</abbr> students will get from managed quarantine to their <abbr title="higher education provider">HEP</abbr> and may wish to assist by providing transportation from the port. Where HEPs provide transport, such as ‘meet &amp; greet’, they should ensure it is risk assessed including what safeguarding procedures are needed. HEPs may wish to extend some of the support suggested in this guidance, such as remote wellbeing check-ins or providing educational materials, to UMs in managed quarantine.</p>
