<h2>Technical updates and reminders</h2>

<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>You can find more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">COVID-19 for employers and businesses</a>.</p>

<h3>Further&nbsp;support on COVID-19 schemes</h3>

<p>You and your clients&nbsp;can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://subscriptions.hmrc.gov.uk/" rel="external">sign up to receive regular email updates from HMRC</a>, to keep up to date with the latest information on our COVID-19 schemes. You can simply register and add the subscription topics you’re interested in.</p>

<p>Many agents have also benefitted from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/help-and-support-if-your-business-is-affected-by-coronavirus-covid-19">our webinars</a> which offer information on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), other government support and how it applies to your clients.</p>

<h2>UK transition</h2>

<h3>Social security coordination with the EU: COVID-19 easement ending</h3>

<p>During the pandemic, HMRC disregarded changes to individuals’ work locations caused solely by COVID-related restrictions when deciding whether National Insurance contributions are due in the UK. This approach will end on 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2022, HMRC will consider all changes to work location under the standard social security coordination rules when deciding whether UK social security legislation applies, and UK National Insurance contributions are due in the UK.</p>

<p>If an employer or employee needs proof that they have to pay UK National Insurance contributions while working in the EU, they should read guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-insurance-for-workers-from-the-uk-working-in-the-eea-or-switzerland">National Insurance for workers from the UK working in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland</a> to apply for a PDA1 certificate.</p>

<h2>Tax</h2>

<h3>Reporting rules for digital platforms</h3>

<p>Following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reporting-rules-for-digital-platforms/reporting-rules-for-digital-platforms-consultation">consultation on the implementation of the OECD’s Model ‘Reporting rules for digital platforms’</a>, the government has decided that the new rules will start from 1 January 2024.</p>

<p>This will give platforms and their advisors time to prepare for the implementation of the new rules, with collection of information starting from January 2024 and submission of the first reports due by the end of January 2025.</p>

<p>HMRC is considering the many comments and issues that have been raised by consultation respondents. It is aiming to publish the government’s response to the consultation, draft regulations giving details of the new rules, and an update on interactions with EU rules, at the next legislation day in the summer.</p>

<p>HMRC will also be engaging with platforms and their advisors before the new rules come into effect to make sure they are implemented proportionately and effectively.</p>

<h3>Tell HMRC about a new employee</h3>

<p>When adding a new employee onto your payroll system you should use the employees P45 information to record their previous pay, tax and student loan (if applicable).</p>

<p>If the employee does not have a P45, you can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-starter-checklist">starter checklist</a> available.</p>

<p>After the starter checklist is added and submitted on your full payment submission (FPS) only use any tax code or previous pay or tax changes received directly from HMRC.</p>

<p>If you use the starter checklist to add the employee onto your payroll records and you receive the P45 after you have submitted your first full payment submission, you do not need to update the previous pay, tax, or tax code on your payroll software, only update student loan details (if applicable).</p>

<h3>Disguised remuneration tax avoidance schemes ― settlement opportunities</h3>

<p>HMRC has published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-issue-briefing-disguised-remuneration-charge-on-loans">issue briefing about disguised remuneration tax avoidance schemes</a> and how people can settle their use of them and/or pay the loan charge that has been introduced to tackle their use.</p>

<p>Disguised remuneration schemes are arrangements that pay loans instead of ordinary income to avoid Income Tax and National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>This briefing explains how HMRC will help customers settle their disguised remuneration and loan charge liabilities.</p>

<p>This information can help your clients settle their tax affairs to prevent them building up a large tax bill and help them get out of tax avoidance for good.</p>

<h4>Remuneration trust schemes</h4>

<p>HMRC has also published a new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/settlement-opportunity-for-users-of-remuneration-trust-tax-avoidance-schemes">settlement opportunity for people who have used a certain type of tax avoidance schemes involving a particular type of trust</a>, commonly known as “remuneration trusts”.</p>

<p>The opportunity is open for applications until 31 July 2022 and is only for individuals or companies, whose scheme use meets certain criteria which are set out fully in the terms.</p>

<p>Remuneration trust schemes do not work to deliver the ‘tax free’ environment they say they do. You should encourage any clients using these schemes to withdraw from them and use this settlement opportunity to settle their tax affairs.</p>

<h3>HMRC’s new powers to tackle electronic sales suppression</h3>

<p>Finance Act 2022 includes new powers and penalties to tackle electronic sales suppression (<abbr title="electronic sales suppression">ESS</abbr>) which have now come into effect.</p>

<p>We want to make you aware of what <abbr title="electronic sales suppression">ESS</abbr> and the new powers are so that you can help your clients if they have been involved in this activity.</p>

<p><abbr title="electronic sales suppression">ESS</abbr> is a form of tax evasion where a business manipulates electronic sales records. The business does this either during or after the point of sale. This activity hides or reduces the value of individual transactions. It reduces the recorded turnover of the business and corresponding tax liabilities, whilst providing what appears to be a credible and compliant audit trail.</p>

<p>HMRC’s operational experience suggests that <abbr title="electronic sales suppression">ESS</abbr> is a growing form of tax evasion. Precise estimates of the scale of evasion are difficult to calculate, given the concealed nature of this activity.</p>

<p>The new powers under Finance Act 2022 tackle the possession, making, supply and promotion of <abbr title="electronic sales suppression">ESS</abbr> software and hardware. The penalties will be up to £50,000 for each of these offences. The Act also provides HMRC with <abbr title="electronic sales suppression">ESS</abbr>-specific information powers. These information powers will allow HMRC to obtain details of those involved in the supply chain of <abbr title="electronic sales suppression">ESS</abbr> tools, as well as details of traders which HMRC suspects are using the tools. The powers will also enable HMRC to gain information which will help us to understand more about the tools.</p>

<p>The legislation includes taxpayer safeguards. On the first occasion that HMRC has reason to believe a business possesses <abbr title="electronic sales suppression">ESS</abbr> software, the business is given a 30-day grace period to remove the software in order to avoid a penalty. Businesses also have the right to appeal against penalties.</p>

<p>The new powers strengthen the government approach to tackling tax evasion. They reinforce the government commitment to ensuring that everyone pays the correct amount of tax. <abbr title="electronic sales suppression">ESS</abbr> results in a loss of money for public services. It has the potential to give non-compliant businesses an unfair market advantage over their competitors. The new powers support the position of compliant businesses by promoting fairness and a level playing field.</p>

<p>HMRC encourages all taxpayers to meet their tax liabilities. If you or a client have been involved in any tax fraud activity relating to <abbr title="electronic sales suppression">ESS</abbr>, contact HMRC and ask to use the Contractual Disclosure Facility (<abbr title="Contractual Disclosure Facility">CDF</abbr>).</p>

<p>An individual can ask HMRC to consider them for a <abbr title="Contractual Disclosure Facility">CDF</abbr> contract by filling in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/voluntary-disclosure-contractual-disclosure-facility-cdf1">contractual disclosure form CDF1</a>. The <abbr title="Contractual Disclosure Facility">CDF</abbr> can be used to disclose deliberate behaviour which has led to a loss in any of the taxes, duties and payments administered by HMRC. The <abbr title="Contractual Disclosure Facility">CDF</abbr> can be used by any entity but it has to be an individual and not a company which registers with the <abbr title="Contractual Disclosure Facility">CDF</abbr>.</p>

<p>The individual can disclose their deliberate behaviour in whatever capacity they have acted. If they make a complete, open and honest disclosure of all deliberate behaviour, HMRC will not open a criminal investigation into the disclosure.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/admitting-tax-fraud-the-contractual-disclosure-facility-cdf">admit tax fraud to HMRC using the Contractual Disclosure Facility</a>.</p>

<h3>Student and postgraduate loans</h3>

<p>For agents who process payroll on behalf of a client</p>

<h4>Off-payroll working</h4>

<p>Student loan or postgraduate loan (<abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr> or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr>) loan deductions should not be taken for workers who are subject to the off payroll working (<abbr title="Off Payroll Working">OPW</abbr>) rules. These workers will pay their <abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr> or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> obligations through their own Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<p>During a recent review of our records, we noticed some instances when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fee payers are continuing to select the <abbr title="Off Payroll Working">OPW</abbr> indicator and taking student or postgraduate loan deductions in error</li>
  <li>agents for employees who are not subject to the <abbr title="Off Payroll Working">OPW</abbr> working rules, are selecting the <abbr title="Off Payroll Working">OPW</abbr> indicator in error on their employee’s payroll submission — this prevents any <abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr> or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> loan deductions being sent to the Student Loans Company</li>
</ul>

<h4>Student or postgraduate Loan ― start or stop notifications</h4>

<p>We have noticed an increase in the number of student or postgraduate loan start or stop notifications being returned to HMRC.</p>

<p>On receipt of these notifications the following action should be taken:</p>

<ul>
  <li>start notifications ― agents should update their payroll software using the correct loan and plan type from the notice and start taking deductions from the next available pay day (payroll software should be updated even if the employee’s earnings are below the appropriate plan and/or loan type threshold)</li>
  <li>stop notifications ― agents must cease taking the appropriate student and/or postgraduate loan deductions as stated on the stop notice from the next available pay day (agents must only stop taking deductions if they have been asked to by HMRC either in writing or by phone)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the notifications have been actioned, they must be kept for a period of 3 years. There is no need to return the notice to HMRC.</p>

<h3>Changes to our Employer Helpline processes</h3>

<p>It’s important the information we hold is secure to help protect customer data.</p>

<p>Following a review of our procedures, when customers call our Employer Helpline, we will no longer be able to proceed if they do not have a PAYE or accounts office reference. Where customers do not have either reference, we can now only give general advice. If the customer requests the references to be sent by post, we will send these to the address held on record.</p>

<p>In addition, we will no longer be able to provide the PAYE or accounts office reference over the phone following a request for a new PAYE registration. Details of the references will be sent by post within seven days.</p>

<h3>Reminder not to use clients’ login details</h3>

<p>We’re launching a campaign to warn customers of the dangers of sharing their log in details with anyone, including their agent. Doing so opens them up to a greater risk of fraud. We’re urging them to treat their HMRC login details with the same level of care as their login details for their bank.</p>

<p>You may see messages in other HMRC communications, including social media activity over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>We’re asking agents to help us protect customers by not asking for or using your client’s HMRC login details to access their tax account. If you need to access your client’s information, then you should obtain the correct authorisation from your client and use HMRC’s agent digital services.</p>

<p>If you cannot get your clients’ information using agent digital services, then we recommend asking your client to log into their Personal Tax Account and provide the information or contact HMRC. Using the right authorisation process will help make sure you can access the right data through the right channel to deal with your client’s tax affairs.</p>

<p>Access to digital services will vary based on the type of service being sought. Agents can log into either their HMRC Online Services for agents account or Agent Services Account by navigating to a Government Gateway log in screen and typing in the relevant User ID and Password.</p>

<p>Some services can be accessed by navigating to the relevant GOV.UK page and then logging in with their relevant User ID and password.</p>

<p>Agents can also call the helpline on 0300 200 3311 and will be required to verify their identity in addition to HMRC doing an authorisation check.</p>

<p>More details were published in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agent-update-issue-81">Agent Update 81</a>.</p>

<h3>Administrative Burden Advisory Board (<abbr title="Administrative Burdens Advisory Board">ABAB</abbr>) survey</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/administrative-burden-advisory-board">Administrative Burdens Advisory Board (<abbr title="Administrative Burdens Advisory Board">ABAB</abbr>)</a> is inviting small businesses to share their views on the tax system by completing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ondemand.questionmark.eu/delivery/open.php?session=0386163000386163&amp;customerid=607443&amp;name=TellABAB&amp;group=2022" rel="external">Tell <abbr title="Administrative Burdens Advisory Board">ABAB</abbr> Survey 2022</a>.</p>

<p>The survey only takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete and is open until 4 June 2022.</p>

<p>The feedback will help <abbr title="Administrative Burdens Advisory Board">ABAB</abbr> achieve their goal of making a difference for small businesses by working closely with HMRC to help make tax easier, quicker and simpler.</p>

<p><abbr title="Administrative Burdens Advisory Board">ABAB</abbr> members are independent and come from a wide range of businesses and professions who represent the small business community.</p>

<p>Their work involves listening to the views of small businesses about their experience of the tax system.</p>

<p>Results from the survey will be published in the ‘Tell <abbr title="Administrative Burdens Advisory Board">ABAB</abbr> Report’ on GOV.UK this summer.</p>

<h2>Making Tax Digital</h2>

<h3>VAT Registration Service</h3>

<p>Development work on the new VAT Registration Service (<abbr title="VAT Registration Service">VRS</abbr>) is progressing well and we remain on track to launch the <abbr title="VAT Registration Service">VRS</abbr> in the summer.</p>

<p><abbr title="VAT Registration Service">VRS</abbr> will deliver important improvements to the VAT registration process. Ahead of its introduction, we will continue to work with agents to make sure any applications in the system at the time of launch are completed before switching over.</p>

<p>Further details on timelines, and what you and your clients will need to do will be published in future Agent Updates.</p>

<h2>HMRC agent services</h2>

<h3>Agent Talking Points</h3>

<p>All agents will be aware of our popular Agent Talking Points webinars, for which most agents receive regular Monday morning updates.</p>

<h3>Support for customers who need extra help</h3>

<p>We have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-charter/hmrcs-principles-of-support-for-customers-who-need-extra-help">principles of support for customers who need extra help</a>. These set out our commitment to support customers according to their needs, and underpin the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-charter">HMRC Charter</a>.</p>

<p>Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-hmrc-extra-support">get help and learn about what extra support is available</a>.</p>

<h3>Changes to our webchat service</h3>

<p>We paused some of our webchat services for 3 months from January 2022.</p>

<p>Following a review, we now offer webchat services for employers on their reporting obligations as they submit their PAYE submissions through the Real Time Information (RTI) online service.</p>

<p>We will shortly be bringing back a service for contractors, as they submit their monthly and annual returns.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to offer those webchat services that remained open, including those for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Self Assessment customers</li>
  <li>traders for their Borders and Trade obligations</li>
  <li>customers who might need extra support or struggle to use our telephony services</li>
  <li>customers who need help accessing online services</li>
</ul>

<p>To support these services, we’ll trial Digital Assistants, sometimes known as chat bots. Digital Assistants are designed to help customers navigate through online guidance. They will direct them to where they need to go in order to self-serve and handle straightforward enquiries without the need to interact with our advisers.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to monitor the customer experience to make sure we’re delivering the best service we can through our digital channels and look at developing further webchat and other digital engagement opportunities for our customers.</p>

<h3>PAYE for agents online service</h3>

<p>The rollout is progressing well, and almost 39,000 agents have opted in to see liabilities and payments data for their employer clients.</p>

<p>We have now expanded the scope so agents with up to 9,600 employer clients will see the advert, and can opt in. If you’re an agent in this category and have previously tried unsuccessfully to access the viewer, try again as you will now be able to opt in. We intend to increase the scope further in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>If you log in using the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/payecis-for-agents-online-service">HMRC Online Services for reporting PAYE and CIS</a> you may not see the advert. You may also not see the employer liabilities and payments pages.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services">sign in to HMRC online services</a> and log in as usual if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>think you qualify to see the advert, but have not seen it</li>
  <li>opted to see employer liabilities and payments pages</li>
</ul>

<p>The response to the viewer from agents has been extremely positive. We’ve had feedback that sometimes the account is showing information that was not expected. Although this may involve the agent having to contact HMRC, agents have told us it was useful to know about it.</p>

<h4>Allocation of payments</h4>

<p>The online account shows the data as held on our financial systems. Within the online account we do not allocate payments. If you believe the payments have been allocated incorrectly you should contact HMRC through the normal routes. We are planning to issue reminders to employers and agents to make sure they use the correct monthly identifier when making payments.</p>

<h3>Consultations</h3>

<p>Check the status of tax policy consultations duplicated. Find out about ongoing and closed tax policy consultations.</p>

<h3>Tax agent toolkits</h3>

<p>HMRC have 20 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tax-agents-toolkits">Tax agent toolkits</a> available for you to download and use. They have been designed to address the most common errors seen from previous years. They include checklists of the key issues to consider and links to HMRC technical guidance and manuals.</p>

<p>Our toolkits are currently being updated.</p>

<p>Here is the breakdown of toolkits by category:</p>

<h3>Tax disputes</h3>

<p>If your client is in dispute with HMRC over an appealable tax decision, you may be interested in our Alternative Dispute Resolution (<abbr title="Alternative Dispute Resolution">ADR</abbr>) service.</p>

<p>This service involves an impartial HMRC mediator working with all parties to prevent unnecessary litigation.</p>

<p>We hope to resolve tax disputes within 120 days using a collaborative and flexible approach, which does not affect your client’s right to appeal or review.</p>

<h2>Agent Forum and Engagement</h2>

<h3>Online forum etiquette</h3>

<p>The Agent Online Forum (<abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr>) continues to grow in popularity as a service where agents can raise and post supporting evidence of potential systemic issues impacting the operation of the tax system.</p>

<p>Agents can also use the <abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr> to provide suggestions and ideas on tax processes and systems for consideration by HMRC.</p>

<p>There are now over 2000 agents registered on the <abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr> generating increasing numbers and variety of posts. Answered posts provide a valuable additional knowledge source to agents and professional bodies seeking support and resolution on potential systemic issues.</p>

<p>To aid the triage of increasing numbers of posts, and to improve the timing and quality of responses and effectiveness of the service, agents are reminded to make sure the <abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr> Good Practice Guide is followed when posting on the forum.</p>

<p>Posts must focus on a single issue, contain no more than one question, be supported by evidence not comment or opinion, and not exceed 250 words.</p>

<p>Where an agent persistently fails to observe these protocols, they may be suspended and access to the <abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr> withdrawn.</p>

<p>In complex cases, when agents wish to or are requested to provide additional supporting evidence, this may be emailed direct to the <abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr> Team <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:AgentForumWT@hmrc.gov.uk">AgentForumWT@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Triage priority will be given to posts on systemic issues.&nbsp; Feedback, opinion, and comment may not receive a response, the insight will however be made available to the relevant business area.</p>

<p>Where a post is primarily a complaint, this may be directed to the HMRC complaints procedure.</p>

<h3>Issues Overview Group — Agent Forum updates</h3>

<p>Professional bodies on the Issues Overview Group and Agent Support Group have identified the issues and items below for escalation. Background and updates on these issues is available on the Agent Forum Escalation Board.</p>

<p>SA-11680 — HMRC emails without a client reference — Firms using an Agent Login to register a client for Self-Assessment should be able to link to a client reference. Agents should report examples where this is not happening on the Agent Forum. Work is continuing to identify how client references can be included in other SA processes.</p>

<p>SA -9471 SA services returning unexpected data — HMRC is reviewing a range of examples emailed to the Agent Forum team in seeking to understand queries raised by professional bodies and agents. HMRC is working with agents who provided the examples to examine the circumstances in each instance.</p>

<p>Professional bodies have requested a discussion at the 25 May meeting of the Issues Overview Group on how the process for answering queries on the <abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr> can be improved.</p>

<p>Agents are invited to provide ideas and examples to their professional bodies to assist discussion of this item.</p>
