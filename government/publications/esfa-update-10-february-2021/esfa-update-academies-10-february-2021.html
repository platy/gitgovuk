<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Latest information on coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>

<p>The Department for Education has published guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-schools-coronavirus-covid-19">COVID-19 in educational settings for staff, parents and carers, pupils and students on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Please check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-schools-coronavirus-covid-19">GOV.UK</a> regularly for updates.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: academies budget forecast returns</h2>

<p>This year we are combining the two academies budget forecast returns into a single form to help reduce the administrative effort required to complete two BFR forms.</p>

<p>This single BFR form will go live on 22 June 2021 with a deadline of 27 July 2021. This is consistent with the usual timings of the BFR3Y.</p>

<p>The single combined form will include the usual BFRO data and the BFR3Y data – including the 3-year forecast elements.</p>

<p>We have updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-budget-forecast-return">BFR webpage</a> with more details and will publish the Excel workbook in due course to show users the exact layout of the form.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: guidance on buildings with reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete</h2>

<p>The Department for Education have published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reinforced-autoclaved-aerated-concrete-in-roofing-in-schools" class="govuk-link">guidance on reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC)</a>.</p>

<p>This guide on reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) follows previous DfE alerts (linked to <a rel="external" href="https://local.gov.uk/information-reinforced-autoclaved-aerated-concrete-raac" class="govuk-link">advice</a> from the Local Government Association) to responsible bodies in the education sector. RAAC panels were commonly used in school and other buildings from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s - mainly in roofs, although occasionally in floors and walls.</p>

<p>This guide is intended to help building owners identify the presence of RAAC, and whether further investigation might be needed. The main audience is schools, but it may be relevant for other buildings in the education sector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: 16 to 19 tuition fund payments</h2>

<p>If you receive your 16 to 19 funding directly from your local authority, you will also receive your 16 to 19 tuition fund payments from them. The total amount awarded to you is shown in the table on the front of your funding allocation statement, ‘Summary of 2020 to 2021 Funding Allocation’. This can be viewed and downloaded from ESFA Information Exchange in the Document Exchange ‘revenue funding folder, under ‘AY 2020-21’.</p>

<p>Detailed guidance about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund">16 to 19 tuition fund can be found on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: help the Department for Education (DfE) design a new international teaching qualification</h2>

<p>DfE is now consulting industry experts and stakeholders on our proposals for a new international teaching qualification: International Qualified Teacher Status (iQTS). <a href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/international-teacher-recruitment-unit/introducing-a-new-international-qualified-teacher/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">You can find the consultation online</a>.</p>

<p>Our draft proposals set out the following aims for the new qualification.</p>

<p>iQTS should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be delivered by accredited English initial teacher training providers</li>
  <li>meet English standards for initial teacher training</li>
  <li>be accessible to trainees in a range of international settings</li>
  <li>become globally recognised as an international teaching benchmark</li>
  <li>equip successful candidates to work both in their domestic and the wider international market</li>
  <li>be customisable to suit local expectations and needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>DfE’s public consultation seeks your views on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the highest demand for this qualification might be – for example which countries or regions, and which types of school (e.g. British international schools versus local state schools)</li>
  <li>the required standards, entry criteria and course content for the development of iQTS</li>
  <li>whether ITT providers have capacity or interest in designing and delivering this new qualification</li>
  <li>any other aspect of iQTS detail, delivery, benefits and potential issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Get involved</h3>

<p>You can participate in our public consultation online, or via email/post. We’ll also be holding virtual round tables running until the end of April 2021 if you’d like to find out more or ask any questions.

<p>The public consultation will run for 12 weeks from 6 February 2021. Later in the year, we’ll share our findings and next steps.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: updated school land guidance and forms</h2>

<p>We have published updated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/submit-a-school-land-transaction-proposal">school land guidance and application forms</a>.</p>

<p>The guidance explains how and when to involve the Secretary of State in school land transactions, including the disposal of school land; the change of use of school playing fields; and the acquisition of new land.</p>

<p>There is tailored advice for different types of applicant, including academy trusts, on how the rules apply to them depending on the type of land and transaction being considered.</p>

<p>The guidance also describes the assessment criteria and information required for each transaction. The new application forms include comprehensive questions to obtain the information required.</p>

<p>Guidance on playing field disposals explains the role of independent school playing field panel in advising whether playing field disposal applications meet current policy and legislation. The panel’s advice will now include applications made on behalf of academies as well as maintained schools.</p>
