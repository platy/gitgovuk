<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Latest information on coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>

<p>The Department for Education has published guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-schools-coronavirus-covid-19">COVID-19 in educational settings for staff, parents and carers, pupils and students on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>There is also <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://help.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/sections/360003793119-Coronavirus">guidance on the apprenticeship service about COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Please check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-schools-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a> regularly for updates.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: mid-year funding claims for 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>The mid-year funding claim window opened on Monday 8 February 2021. Please submit your mid-year funding claim by 5pm on Friday 19 February 2021. This is slightly later than we originally published. The claim form will be available on <a href="https://submitlearnerdatabeta.fasst.org.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Submit Learner Data</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to submit a claim if you receive funds through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grant funded – ESFA Adult Education Budget (AEB) (Adult Skills, Community Learning, 19 to 24 Traineeships and COVID-19 skills offer)</li>
  <li>learner support for ESFA AEB procured (Adult Skills and 19 to 24 Traineeships) – paid-on-profile</li>
  <li>grant funded - Advanced Learner Loans Bursary (ALLB)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have submitted your claim you will also be able to view it on the <a href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Manage your education and skills funding</a>.</p>

<p>We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone, and time and resources are under strain. However, we will still require you to submit an accurate mid-year claim, so we have visibility of the challenges you are facing.</p>

<p>We will not be taking any action on mid-year forecasts this year because of the uncertainty in the sector. However, the mid-year claims process will enable us to see the expected level of delivery. In addition, we are reviewing the year end reconciliation process, which we hope to announce by the end of next week.</p>

<p>We want to encourage you to deliver to 19+ year olds as much as you can remotely. You may want to consider working with your sub-contracting or partnering if you are unable to successfully deliver remotely. When you complete your claim, we want you to record your best estimate, accounting for your current remote delivery and what you think you can achieve going forward based upon the assumption that the national lockdown ends in March.</p>

<p>We recognise that the statement regarding subcontracting could have been misconstrued that you should look to increase your subcontracting arrangements. To be clear, the overriding expectation remains that providers should look to reduce subcontracting in line with the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/896647/consultation-response-_Reforms_to_subcontracting_education_for_learners_over_16.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">subcontracting consultation</a>. As set out in proposal one, any subcontract you do enter into must have a clear educational rationale which meets the criteria set out within the document</p>

<p>We are investigating what more we can do to support providers to deliver more during these difficult times.</p>

<p>If you have any queries about this, please contact your Territorial Manager.</p>

<span class="number">3.2 </span>The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education’s new podcast channel</h3>

<p>The Institute has launched its very own podcast channel for National Apprenticeship Week. This new channel will have podcast ranging from inspiring interviews with apprentice panel members to explaining how the Institute ensures high-quality apprenticeships and technical education.  </p>

<p>Their first podcast was with Gillian Keegan, Minister for Apprenticeships and Skills answering 10 questions submitted by the apprentice panel. The questions ranged from social mobility to funding for degree apprenticeships.  </p>

<p>You can find all the <a rel="external" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/about/newshub/podcasts/" class="govuk-link">podcast on their blog site</a>. </p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: support available to specialist settings when delivering asymptomatic testing</h2>

<p>If you think that you need additional staff to carry out assisted swabbing, or you require general testing support, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-full-opening-special-schools-and-other-specialist-settings/mass-asymptomatic-testing-in-specialist-settings" class="govuk-link">Rapid Testing in Specialist Settings Guidance</a> has been updated and includes information on the support available to specialist settings.</p>

<p>Where schools or colleges do not have enough staff to carry out assisted swabbing, on pupils that cannot self-swab, additional workforce capacity may be available from Medacs, accessed via the DfE Helpline. For general staffing support on your testing site, your local National Citizenship Service (NCS) Delivery Partner (DP) may be able to provide volunteers. You may approach your local NCS DP directly, or get in touch with the DfE Helpline for their contact information.</p>

<p>If you wish to enquire further about the help that is available, please contact the DfE Helpline (0800 046 8687) or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DfE.coronavirushelpline@education.gov.uk">DfE.coronavirushelpline@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: changes to the register of apprenticeship training providers</h2>

<p>As part of our continued commitment to improving the quality of apprenticeship training, we will be implementing the following changes to the register of apprenticeship training providers: </p>

<ul>
  <li>widening the current set of targeted entry conditions to allow more training providers to apply to the Register </li>
  <li>providers currently on the Register that are not actively delivering may be considered for removal from the Register. No active delivery means within a period of six-months </li>
  <li>refreshing the Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers whilst strengthening the application process for those active providers that remain </li>
  <li>giving notice that the Conditions of Acceptance have been updated and will be effective 10 May 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>These changes are to ensure only high quality, financially stable, skilled, and experienced apprenticeship providers are included on the Register. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers" class="govuk-link">More information is available regarding these key changes</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: apprenticeship non-levy procured allocations from 1 April 2021</h2>

<p>We will shortly be extending apprenticeship non-levy procured contracts to cover the 2021 to 2022 financial year.</p>

<p>These allocations will include funding to cover the carry in costs of learners who started on or before 31 March 2021. From 1 April 2021, all new apprenticeship starts will be funded via the Apprenticeship Service.</p>

<p>Allocation letters will be issued to training providers via <a href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Manage your education and skills funding</a> in early February. Contract extensions will be issued at the end of February.</p>

<p>Training providers must ensure they have signed the contract extension before the current contract expires on 31 March 2021.</p>

This follows the Education Secretary’s announcement of this change in September 2020.  </p>

<p>Following initial webinars held in December 2020, ESFA will be hosting further information and engagement events in partnership with Ofsted and the Office for Students for apprenticeship training providers, regarding Ofsted’s inspection of level 6 and 7 apprenticeship training.

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Information: updated guidance for the financial health assessment of independent training providers</h2>

<p>We have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-financial-health-assessment">updated guidance for the financial health assessment of independent training providers</a> wishing to deliver services on behalf of the ESFA. It guides organisations through the assessment process and we recommend you review this to familiarise yourself with the requirement. This guidance is effective immediately.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Information: 16 to 19 tuition fund payments</h2>

<p>If you receive your 16 to 19 funding directly from your local authority, you will also receive your 16 to 19 tuition fund payments from them. The total amount awarded to you is shown in the table on the front of your funding allocation statement, ‘Summary of 2020 to 2021 Funding Allocation’. This can be viewed and downloaded from ESFA Information Exchange in the Document Exchange ‘revenue funding folder, under ‘AY 2020-21’.</p>

<p>Detailed guidance about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund" class="govuk-link">16 to 19 tuition fund can be found on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Information: National Skills Fund - level 3 adult offer 2020 to 2021 allocations</h2>

<p>We will shortly be revising 2020 to 2021 ESFA funded adult education budget allocation statements to include the National Skills Fund level 3 adult offer.

<span class="number">12. </span>Information: guidance on buildings with reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete</h2>

<p>The Department for Education have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reinforced-autoclaved-aerated-concrete-in-roofing-in-schools">guidance on reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC)</a>.</p>

<p>This guide on reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) follows previous DfE alerts (linked to <a rel="external" href="https://local.gov.uk/information-reinforced-autoclaved-aerated-concrete-raac" class="govuk-link">advice</a> from the Local Government Association) to responsible bodies in the education sector. RAAC panels were commonly used in school and other buildings from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s - mainly in roofs, although occasionally in floors and walls.</p>

<p>This guide is intended to help building owners identify the presence of RAAC, and whether further investigation might be needed. The main audience is schools, but it may be relevant for other buildings in the education sector.</p>
