<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Latest information on coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>

<p>The Department for Education has published guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-schools-coronavirus-covid-19">COVID-19 in educational settings for staff, parents and carers, pupils and students on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Please check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-schools-coronavirus-covid-19">GOV.UK</a> regularly for updates.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: mid-year funding claims for 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>The mid-year funding claim window opened on Monday 8 February 2021. Please submit your mid-year funding claim by 5pm on Friday 19 February 2021. This is slightly later than we originally published. The claim form will be available on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://submitlearnerdatabeta.fasst.org.uk/">Submit Learner Data</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to submit a claim if you receive funds through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grant funded – ESFA Adult Education Budget (AEB) (Adult Skills, Community Learning, 19 to 24 Traineeships and COVID-19 skills offer)</li>
  <li>learner support for ESFA AEB procured (Adult Skills and 19 to 24 Traineeships) – paid-on-profile</li>
  <li>grant funded - Advanced Learner Loans Bursary (ALLB)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have submitted your claim you will also be able to view it on the <a href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Manage your education and skills funding</a>.</p>

<p>We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone, and time and resources are under strain. However, we will still require you to submit an accurate mid-year claim, so we have visibility of the challenges you are facing.</p>

<p>We will not be taking any action on mid-year forecasts this year because of the uncertainty in the sector. However, the mid-year claims process will enable us to see the expected level of delivery. In addition, we are reviewing the year end reconciliation process, which we hope to announce by the end of next week.</p>

<p>We want to encourage you to deliver to 19+ year olds as much as you can remotely. You may want to consider sub-contracting or partnering if you are unable to successfully deliver remotely. When you complete your claim, we want you to record your best estimate, accounting for your current remote delivery and what you think you can achieve going forward based upon the assumption that the national lockdown ends in March. You should also account for any particular local characteristics that may impact their length of lockdown, such as areas with the new South African variant.</p>

<p>We are investigating what more we can do to support providers to deliver more during these difficult times.</p>

<p>If you have any queries about this, please contact your Territorial Manager.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: tender launch for adult education budget (AEB) contracts for services</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: 16 to 19 tuition fund payments</h2>

<p>If you receive your 16 to 19 funding directly from your local authority, you will also receive your 16 to 19 tuition fund payments from them.

This can be viewed and downloaded from ESFA Information Exchange in the Document Exchange ‘revenue funding folder, under ‘AY 2020-21’.</p>

<h4>Information: National Skills Fund - level 3 adult offer 2020 to 2021 allocations</h4>

<p>We will shortly be revising 2020 to 2021 ESFA funded adult education budget allocation statements to include the National Skills Fund level 3 adult offer. These allocations will include funding to cover 1 April 2021 to 31 July 2021 and are primarily based on historic delivery of the qualifications available through this offer.</p>

<p>The level 3 qualification funding within this offer will support the development of new skills for adult learners and improve the prospects of eligible adults in the labour market. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-skills-fund" class="govuk-link">National Skills Fund page</a>.</p>

<p>Additional funding for the National Skills Fund level 3 adult offer for 19 to 23 year-olds will be added to the adult skills line of your allocation statement. Additional funding for the National Skills Fund level 3 adult offer for 24 year-olds and over will be shown as an additional line within the COVID-19 skills offer of your allocation statement. Please review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956885/ESFA_funded_adult_education_budget__AEB__funding_and_performance_management_rules_2020_to_2021.pdf" rel="external">funding and performance management rules</a> for further information.</p>

<p>Allocations will be issued via <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/">Manage your education and skills funding</a>. Your funding agreement will be updated, and we advise you to promptly sign your agreement to ensure payments are made on time.</p>

<p>For 2021 to 2022, allocations through a grant funding agreement will include the National Skills Fund level 3 adult offer. If you are a grant provider that did not receive funding for April 2021 to July 2021, arrangements on how to access this funding from August 2021 will be included in the 2021 to 2022 funding and performance management rules (when published in the spring).</p>

<p>If you are an Independent Learning Provider with a contract for service, or you wish to bid for a contract for service to supplement any grant funding, you will need to access this offer through the current <a href="https://education.app.jaggaer.com/web/login.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">adult education budget procurement</a> for delivery from August 2021.</p>

<p>We will update our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/19-funding-allocations-guidance-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">19+ allocations technical guidance</a> with the methodology used to calculate allocations shortly.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: School Financial Value Standard (SFVS)</h2>

<p>Local authority maintained schools must submit the SFVS annually to their local authority. Local authorities use this information to inform their programme of financial assessment and audit.</p>

<p>Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the Department for Education (DfE) has decided that the SFVS return should be delayed this year. This is to take account of the current pressures schools and local authorities are facing.</p>

<p>For the financial year 2020 to 2021, schools should submit their SFVS to their local authority no later than 28 May 2021.</p>

<p>Local authorities should submit their assurance statement to the DfE within six weeks, no later than 9 July 2021.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-financial-value-standard-sfvs">More information has been published</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: updated school land guidance and forms</h2>

<p>We have published updated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/submit-a-school-land-transaction-proposal" class="govuk-link">school land guidance and application forms</a>.</p>

<p>The guidance explains how and when to involve the Secretary of State in school land transactions, including the disposal of school land; the change of use of school playing fields; and the acquisition of new land.</p>

<p>There is tailored advice for different types of applicant, including academy trusts, on how the rules apply to them depending on the type of land and transaction being considered.</p>

<p>The guidance also describes the assessment criteria and information required for each transaction. The new application forms include comprehensive questions to obtain the information required.</p>

<p>Guidance on playing field disposals explains the role of independent school playing field panel in advising whether playing field disposal applications meet current policy and legislation. The panel’s advice will now include applications made on behalf of academies as well as maintained schools.</p>

<span class="number">9. </span>Information: help the Department for Education (DfE) design a new international teaching qualification</h2>

<p>DfE is now consulting industry experts and stakeholders on our proposals for a new international teaching qualification: International Qualified Teacher Status (iQTS). <a href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/international-teacher-recruitment-unit/introducing-a-new-international-qualified-teacher/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">You can find the consultation online</a>.</p>

<p>Our draft proposals set out the following aims for the new qualification.</p>

<p>iQTS should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be delivered by accredited English initial teacher training providers</li>
  <li>meet English standards for initial teacher training</li>
  <li>be accessible to trainees in a range of international settings</li>
  <li>become globally recognised as an international teaching benchmark</li>
  <li>equip successful candidates to work both in their domestic and the wider international market</li>
  <li>be customisable to suit local expectations and needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>DfE’s public consultation seeks your views on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the highest demand for this qualification might be – for example which countries or regions, and which types of school (e.g. British international schools versus local state schools)</li>
  <li>the required standards, entry criteria and course content for the development of iQTS</li>
  <li>whether ITT providers have capacity or interest in designing and delivering this new qualification</li>
  <li>any other aspect of iQTS detail, delivery, benefits and potential issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Get involved</h3>

<p>You can participate in our public consultation online, or via email/post. We’ll also be holding virtual round tables running until the end of April 2021 if you’d like to find out more or ask any questions. You can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/international-qualified-teacher-status-iqts-public-consultation-tickets-136974120281">register for these events</a>.</p>

<p>The public consultation will run for 12 weeks from 6 February 2021. Later in the year, we’ll share our findings and next steps.</p>

<span class="number">10. </span>Information: guidance on buildings with reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete </h2>

<p>The Department for Education have published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reinforced-autoclaved-aerated-concrete-in-roofing-in-schools" class="govuk-link">guidance on on reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC)</a>.</p>

<p>This follows <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://local.gov.uk/information-reinforced-autoclaved-aerated-concrete-raac">previous advice from the Local Government Association</a> to responsible bodies in the education sector.  RAAC panels were commonly used in school and other buildings from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s - mainly in roofs, although occasionally in floors and walls.  </p>

<p>The advice is intended to help building owners identify the presence of RAAC, and whether further investigation might be needed. The advice relates mainly to offices and schools, but may be relevant for other buildings in the education sector.</p>
