<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, and is not a substitute for independent legal advice.  Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage, or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information.  The information contained in this guide is general and factual.  You should contact local lawyers for independent legal advice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: key points</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you, but they cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer.  Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad</a>.</p>

<p>This detention information pack is designed to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Iraq and who can help.  A printed copy is provided to those in prison or in custody. We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h3>Contacting us</h3>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British Embassy (and must do so if you want them to)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>even if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself, and should do so, particularly if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>friends or family can also contact the local British Embassy/Consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British Embassy even if you don’t want anyone to know that you have been arrested.  This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British Government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>

<p>Consular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London, and in British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates overseas.</p>

<p>The British Embassy in Iraq:</p>

<p>Tel : +44 (0) 1908 516666</p>

<p>Website: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/iraq">https://www.gov.uk/government/world/iraq</a></p>

<p>Address : British Embassy, International Zone, Baghdad, Iraq</p>

<p>You can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office on 020 7008 5000.</p>

<h3>What we can do</h3>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help.  Once notified of your arrest or detention, consular staff will aim to contact you as soon as possible so that we can assess how we can help you.  We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions: our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>In Iraq, notification by the authorities to the Embassy normally takes place several days after arrest. Friends or relations may inform us much more quickly.</p>

<p>Once we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a list of local English-speaking <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/iraq-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers-in-iraq">lawyers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/iraq-translators-and-interpreters/list-of-english-speaking-translators-and-interpreters-in-iraq">interpreters</a>
</li>
  <li>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system (including if legal aid is available)</li>
  <li>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services</li>
  <li>keep in regular contact with you, either by visiting or by telephone/letter. The frequency of contact will depend on local conditions and your personal circumstances</li>
  <li>tell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including medication</li>
  <li>put you, or your family, in touch with a prisoners’ welfare charity called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>in some circumstances we may be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards</li>
  <li>help to transfer money to you from your friends or family.  In places where phone or postal services aren’t available, we can also pass on messages and deliver letters to the prison (but generally we cannot arrange for delivery directly to you
&gt; in some circumstances we may be able to help you apply for a transfer to a prison in the UK</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we can’t do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>get you out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>help you get special treatment</li>
  <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>pay for any costs as a result of being arrested</li>
  <li>forward you packages sent by friends or family</li>
  <li>prevent authorities from deporting you after release</li>
</ul>

<h3>First steps</h3>

<h4>Can you / will you tell my family?</h4>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and can provide them with information about how to contact you in prison or detention.  With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your well-being.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider the impact that not doing so might have.  For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h4>Will the UK Police be informed?</h4>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police.  It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances in which information about you may need to be shared by ourselves or authorities in Iraq.</p>

<h4>Do I need a lawyer?  / How can I find a lawyer?</h4>

<p>Although we cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime, we can offer basic information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. We can give you a list of local interpreters and a list of local English-speaking lawyers is attached to this pack. You will want to consider the benefits of local legal representation and to discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. In no circumstances can we pay your legal or interpretation costs.</p>

<h4>Can you get me out?</h4>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for you because you are British.  However if you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards we will consider whether to approach local authorities.  This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for fair trial or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h4>Who else can help me?</h4>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk">https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk</a></p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Detention conditions in Iraq</h2>

<h3>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<h4>Can my family and friends visit me? How can I arrange a visit?</h4>

<p>Visits must be authorised in advance by the Ministry of Justice. We can make a formal written request on behalf of anyone who wants to visit you; this needs to be prepared at least one month in advance.  You are allowed one visit a month.</p>

<h4>What can visitors expect?</h4>

<p>Visitors will be searched upon arrival.</p>

<h4>What can visitors bring?</h4>

<p>Visitors are not allowed to bring any items in to prison. There may be dispensation for foreign prisoners but this would need to be given by the Ministry of Justice in advance.</p>

<h3>Visits: Consular staff</h3>

<p>A member of consular staff will aim to contact you (by telephone or in person) within 24 hours of notification of your arrest. We will try to visit you as soon as possible afterwards, ideally within 48 hours as long as it is safe for us to travel and we get the necessary approval from the Iraqi authorities. We may also try to contact you by phone.</p>

<p>If you are remanded in custody, we will visit you as necessary. If you are found guilty of an offence and given a custodial sentence we will aim to visit within the first week of your imprisonment and then as necessary after that, depending on your circumstances and vulnerability.</p>

<h4>Emergency trips outside of prison</h4>

<p>Emergency trips outside of prisons for emergencies are not permitted.</p>

<h3>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h3>

<h4>Arrival at the police station and basic rights</h4>

<p>In Iraq you do not have the right to make a telephone call when you are arrested. You should ask that the British Embassy be informed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you wish to make a telephone call yourself you must apply to the detention officer for permission.</p>

<p>A law-officer can only arrest you if they have reasonable suspicion that you have been involved in a criminal offence or they have a judicial order for your arrest.  You must not resist or act violently even if you believe you are innocent.</p>

<p>You have a right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to know why you have been arrested or detained</li>
  <li>to remain silent which means you do not have to answer any questions asked of you by a law officer</li>
  <li>to legal representation, which must be provided free of charge if you cannot afford to pay for it</li>
  <li>to be able to contact your family</li>
  <li>to expect to be treated with dignity and without violence or intimidation. You are innocent until the law officers prove you guilty</li>
</ul>

<p>Your details must be registered at the place where you are held. Your family should be notified without delay and be allowed to see you unless prevention is strictly necessary for reasons of security.</p>

<p>You should be given access to legal representation even if you can’t afford to pay. You must be seen by an Investigative Judge within 24 hours of arrest who will decide whether you should be released or detained.</p>

<p>You should be held in secure but safe and decent accommodation with access to nutritional food, water, light, clean bedding, ventilation and exercise. You should be treated with dignity, fairly and equally no matter your gender, ethnicity, religion or status.</p>

<p>You should not be subject to, or threatened with, torture, physical violence, psychological stress or any other form of physical, emotional, or psychological punishment or coercion. It is a crime for a law-officer to ill-treat you.</p>

<p>You can ask to see a doctor.</p>

<h4>Appearance at court</h4>

<p>You will be taken to a court to see a judge, normally on the day or next working day after your arrest.  You should be given access to legal representation even if you can’t afford to pay.  If you don’t speak Arabic, an interpreter should be appointed to assist.</p>

<p>More information about the Iraq judicial system can be found in Chapter 3.</p>

<h4>Initial arrival at the prison</h4>

<p>In prison detention, convicted prisoners and those on remand should be held separately, as should women and children unless of a single family group.</p>

<p>You will be medically examined by a doctor and will meet the prison psychologist. You will be issued with a prison uniform and bedding before being taken to your cell, which may be shared with other prisoners.</p>

<h3>Prison: conditions and daily life</h3>

<p>Prisons can be run by different ministries – Justice, the Interior or Defence. There is a considerable difference in standard between prisons, with those run by the Ministry of Justice being the highest. These administered by the Ministries of the Interior or Defence are harder to access and less is known about them.</p>

<p>Over-crowding is a problem, even at facilities run by the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice is addressing problems, but issues such as overcrowding, poor sanitation, poor ventilation and pre-trial separation remain.</p>

<h4>Accommodation</h4>

<p>Prison accommodation varies depending on the prison facility you are being held at. Over-crowding is common.</p>

<h4>Food and diet</h4>

<p>The prison provides three meals per day. Breakfast typically consists of eggs, cheese and bread. Lunch is a meat of fish dish with rice and vegetable. Dinner is similar to lunch.</p>

<h4>Work and study</h4>

<p>The Ministry of Justice has increased the number of opportunities for education and vocational training in some prisons. Most prisons have sewing and computer workshops, although with limited equipment, in addition to literacy classes and basic education courses.</p>

<p>Libraries often have little beyond religious literature.</p>

<h4>Contact and Languages</h4>

<p>Contact with other inmates depends on the regulations of the facility you are in. Some prisons have a general common room with a television.</p>

<p>You will not have access to phones. You must apply to the Detention Officer for permission to make a call.  Calls are permitted every two weeks but this can vary depending on the facility you are in.</p>

<p>Guards are likely not to speak English.</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

<p>You will be allowed out of your cell daily to walk about in a designated area. Some prisons have a gym.</p>

<h4>Climate</h4>

<p>The climate of Iraq is characterised by long, hot, dry summers and short, cool winters.</p>

<h4>Religion</h4>

<p>You should be allowed to practice your religion.</p>

<h4>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h4>

<p>The prison medical centre can issue medication to prisoners. Recreational drugs are not allowed in Iraqi prisons.</p>

<h3>Prison: access to help and services</h3>

<h4>How can I receive money?</h4>

<p>There are two ways in which you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Private Funds: Deposited to you by your family or friends</li>
  <li>Prisoners Abroad: Depending on where you are detained, if your family can’t support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day)</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The British Government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.</p>
</div>

<h4>Private funds</h4>

<p>While the FCDO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family.</p>

<p>The Foreign Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) operates a “Prison Comfort” system for money transfers to prisoners. Please ask your family to get in touch with the FCDO in order to arrange this.</p>

<p>We are unable to receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<h4>Private Abroad</h4>

<p>In addition, Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity, may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not in receipt of any regular donations from other sources. Prisoners in Iraq may be eligible for one of the three Prisoners Abroad Funds (the Craig Feehan Fund, the Vitamin Fund and the Medical Fund).  See Chapter 4 for more details.</p>

<h4>Can I receive medical and dental treatment?</h4>

<p>While you are in detention, Iraq is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met. If you need medical or dental treatment you should ask to see the prison doctor or dentist. Medication will be provided.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor.  We can also liaise with your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests.</p>

<h4>Mail/Parcels</h4>

<p>Family and friends can send mail and parcels directly to the prison. Prison authorities will check the contents before handing it over.</p>

<h4>Can I make telephone calls?</h4>

<p>You should speak to the Detention Officer for permission. Calls are permitted every two weeks but this can vary depending on the facility you are in.</p>

<h4>How can I make a complaint about mistreatment?</h4>

<p>If you have been mistreated, please inform Consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and inform you of any local complaints procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider. With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally-accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, please try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible photos of the injuries you received.</p>

<p>If you have a complaint about your treatment you can complain to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the most senior officer in the place where you are detained</li>
  <li>your lawyer</li>
  <li>the Investigating Judge when you are taken before him/her</li>
  <li>staff of the Ministry for Human Rights who carry out detention centre monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p>You must be permitted to speak to these people out of the hearing of the detention officers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: the Iraqi judicial system</h2>

<h3>Overview and first steps</h3>

<h4>Is the system the same as the UK?</h4>

<p>No, it is not. The law requires that confessions be corroborated by other evidence or rejected where allegations of coercion are substantiated, but that is not always the case in court.</p>

<p>The death penalty remains an option for conviction under crimes of terrorism and murder.</p>

<p>There are often lengthy delays before and during trials because of lack of resources.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>
</div>

<h4>What should happen when I am arrested?</h4>

<p>After an Investigative Judge issues an arrest warrant, you should appear within 24 hours before a judge and told of the allegations against you. At this time you should be advised of your right to remain silent and of your right to counsel. This process is also known as the initial hearing or notification of investigation.</p>

<p>A panel of Investigative Judges conducts a private investigation by examining the facts of the case. The panel can range in number from one to several.</p>

<p>A single Investigative Judge considers the merits of the case and issues either a referral of the case to trial or a dismissal of the charges.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Should you have any questions concerning the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. A list of local English-speaking lawyers is provided at the end of this pack.</p>
</div>

<h4>For how long can I be remanded in custody?</h4>

<p>Under the Criminal Procedure Code, if you are arrested for criminal charges you can be held for up to 24 hours, extendable to 72 hours, before being formally indicted and presented to the court. Then you should be transferred to a detention facility of the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p>The Criminal Procedure Code provides an exception for persons accused of capital crimes. Conviction under certain articles of the Anti-Terrorism Law carry the death penalty. Investigating prosecutors and judges can order the detention of suspects for six months, renewable almost indefinitely.</p>

<h4>What happens when I am charged?</h4>

<p>When you are charged you will go before the court.  You should be given access to legal representation even if you can’t afford to pay.  If you don’t speak Arabic, an interpreter should be appointed to assist.</p>

<p>Remember, you should never sign anything you cannot read. If you find yourself under pressure to sign, ask to speak to the British Embassy.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for bail?</h4>

<p>In certain cases, if the judge is satisfied that your release will not lead to your escape, and will not prejudice the investigation, you may be granted bail.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The FCDO is not able to facilitate the transfer of bail funds.</p>
</div>

<h3>Trial and legal assistance</h3>

<h4>What kind of legal assistance is available?</h4>

<p>If you wish to hire a private lawyer, a list of English-speaking lawyers is provided at the end of this pack. Prisoners Abroad can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings, and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>You are entitled to a high standard of legal assistance. If you request it, your lawyer should come to assist you with your case at the police station, court, and in prison if you are in prison custody. You can ask to see your lawyer and they should be contacted by the officer in charge of your detention or the court. If you are convicted your lawyer must advise you on your rights of appeal.</p>

<p>You have the right to have your lawyer present at all times when you appear before a judge, prosecutor, police investigator or any other law enforcement officer. If, contrary to your request, you appear before any of them without your lawyer being present, you can refuse to answer any questions and can ask for your lawyer. You must be provided with the opportunity, time and facilities to prepare your case with your lawyer.  Your meeting with your lawyer is confidential and should be held out of the hearing of anyone else.</p>

<p>If you have complaints about your lawyer you should tell the judge. You or someone on your behalf can also complain to the Bar Association in your town.</p>

<p>The British Embassy cannot pay legal fees or guarantee a lawyer that you will pay them. Consular staff cannot give legal advice.</p>

<h4>What happens at the trial?</h4>

<p>A panel of one or three trial chamber judges hears the case in public. After the trial, the trial chamber reaches a judgement of either guilty or not guilty. If not guilty, the accused is released. If guilty, sentencing takes place.</p>

<h4>Sentences</h4>

<p>Under Iraqi law, there are set penalties for each type of crime. The judge decides the sentence according to these circumstances, taking in to account the circumstances of the case.</p>

<h4>How can appeals be made?</h4>

<p>An appeal can be made to the appellate chamber within 30 days, starting from the day after the judgement was made.</p>

<h3>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>What provision is there for reduction of sentence (remission) e.g. for good behaviour?</h4>

<p>You may be given remission of one quarter of your sentence if you demonstrate good behaviour.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for early release e.g. on parole?</h4>

<p>There is no provision for an early release other than reducing the sentence by one quarter as mentioned above.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for clemency or pardon?</h4>

<p>Under Iraqi law there is provision for clemency but certain crimes are exempt such as conviction under terrorism, financial corruption and honour killings.</p>

<p>The President of Iraq can authorise a pardon.</p>

<h4>What about any financial penalties?</h4>

<p>There are no financial penalties if a prisoner is released earlier by clemency or pardon.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to another prison within Iraq possible?</h4>

<p>It is possible. We can make a request through the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, it can take a considerable time to receive a reply.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to the UK a possibility?</h4>

<p>There is a Prisoner Transfer Agreement between the UK and Iraq. British nationals who have been convicted in Iraq are able to request a transfer if they meet the conditions below.</p>

<p>To transfer, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a British citizen or have close family ties with the UK (normally through permanent residence in the UK)</li>
  <li>not be awaiting trial</li>
  <li>have exhausted all appeals against your conviction and/or the length of your sentence; or have waived your right to an appeal</li>
  <li>have at least 6 months of your sentence left to serve when you apply for transfer</li>
  <li>have no outstanding fines or other non-custodial penalties</li>
</ul>

<p>The offence you were convicted for must also be a criminal offence in the part of the UK you wish to be transferred to: England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The authorities in the sentencing country may refuse your request. You should be aware that even if the sentencing State agrees to your transfer then the UK authorities may also refuse your request. Reasons for this might include if you have not lived in the UK for a number of years and you have no close family residents there.</p>

<p>We can submit a transfer request on your behalf to the Iraqi Ministry of Justice. It can take a considerable time to receive a reply.</p>

<p>To find out more about transfers to the UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/in-prison-abroad/in-prison-abroad-transfer-to-a-uk-prison">In prison abroad: transfer to a UK prison</a>.</p>

<h4>What are the procedures for release and deportation?</h4>

<p>Two months before your release date the prison will notify you and us. You will not be deported automatically. This will depend on the nature of your offence.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. Possibly you have never lived in the UK and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may simply want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Prisoners Abroad you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance it is best to write and tell your caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroad’s Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</li>
  <li>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</li>
  <li>making appointments with doctors and dentists</li>
  <li>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency.</p>

<p>Other sources of practical help back in the UK are The Salvation Army – UK Helpline 020 7367 4888, Monday to Friday 8 AM to 4 PM, or contact your local Salvation Army branch – and The Prison Fellowship, UK Helpline 020 7799 2500, Monday to Friday 9 AM to 5 PM.</p>

<h4>Would I have a criminal record in the UK?</h4>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>

<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<h4>Prisoners Abroad</h4>

<p>Since 1978 the charity Prisoners Abroad has offered practical support and advice to British citizens imprisoned overseas. It is the only UK charity providing this service and it is available to all, whether guilty or innocent, convicted or awaiting charge or trial. Prisoners Abroad is concerned with your health and welfare, both during your imprisonment and also on your return to the UK, through their resettlement service (if you have registered whilst in prison). They can also provide support and advice to your family during your imprisonment. In order to access any services, prisoners must first register with Prisoners Abroad by signing and returning their authorisation form.</p>

<p>Once you seek help from Prisoners Abroad, the Prisoner &amp; Family Support Service will be your point of contact for advice and information. The type of assistance they can offer will vary from country to country, but generally they can provide you with information, in English, on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your rights as a prisoner and issues that may affect you such as health or transfer to the UK</li>
  <li>obtaining magazines, newspapers, books and the regular Prisoners Abroad newsletter</li>
  <li>learning the language of your country of imprisonment</li>
  <li>translation of documents</li>
  <li>grants for food if you are in a developing country and don’t have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>grants for essential medicines and toiletries if you don’t have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>preparing for release</li>
  <li>help for your loved ones, including information, family support groups and, in a few cases, assistance with the cost of visiting</li>
</ul>
