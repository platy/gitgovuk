<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>First steps</h2>
<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 112</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact your nearest British Embassy: +36 1 266 2888.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-budapest/office/british-embassy%0d">www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-budapest/office/british-embassy</a></p>

<p>If you contact us, our Embassy staff will be polite, patient, empathetic and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>If you DO want to report the incident to the police in Hungary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you are in an area where there is a British embassy or consulate, they will try to send a consular officer to support you even while reporting to the police. If timing and location does not allow support in person, you will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7.</li>
  <li>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the British Embassy on +36 1 266 2888 so they can offer you consular support.</li>
  <li>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. You do not need to supply any specific evidence – but washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence.</li>
  <li>If you do change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or text messages. These will be sent over for forensic examination and later be given back to you.</li>
  <li>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Additional information:</h3>

<p>Reporting a crime in Hungary does not carry any risk to you. The police are obliged to inform you that you can request for your information to be handled in a secret manner (in which case, your data will be attached to the file in a closed envelope), and if you name the perpetrator, s/he will only find out about the report if an arrest is to be made.</p>

<p>Neither extramarital sex nor homosexuality is considered a crime in Hungary. The legal drinking age is 18 (with a zero alcohol tolerance for driving), and both the consumption and possession of ANY drugs is illegal.</p>

<p>Local authorities do not normally inform the authorities of the UK about a denunciation (and information about you may only be requested from foreign authorities in justified circumstances). They will contact a consular officer who can assist you in the proceedings if you request it.</p>

<p>During the proceedings you do not have to surrender your passport and you can leave the country freely at any time. You do, however, have to notify the authorities within 3 working days if your residential address, mailing address or actual residence changes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>If you DON’T want to report the incident to the police in Hungary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The British Embassy will still be able to help you. This includes helping you contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.</li>
  <li>They can provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators.</li>
  <li>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can also report the incident to them and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. If you wish, and depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is your choice whether to report the crime, and you can get medical attention whether you report it to the police or not.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you are staying in the country where the crime took place, it might be best to report the crime in that country. If you are a British national in Hungary and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the British Embassy at +36 1 266 2888 or <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-budapest/office/british-embassy">www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-budapest/office/british-embassy</a>.</li>
  <li>It is possible to report the crime to the police in the UK after you return there. However, UK police forces cannot investigate crimes committed overseas. It is for the police in Hungary to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction. The UK police can decide to request assistance from the Hungarian police, but this cannot be guaranteed and it can be a lengthy process. It can therefore be difficult to ensure that justice is served without reporting the crime locally. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK after rape or sexual assault abroad</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Reporting the crime in Hungary - what happens next?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. If possible make notes about what happened during the assault before making the report, so that you can refer to them if necessary.</li>
  <li>You can bring a person you trust with you to the police station.</li>
  <li>Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages.</li>
  <li>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>At the police station – what to expect</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You will be provided with an interpreter as soon as possible (free of charge), and will be asked to describe in detail what happened so that immediate action can be taken to identify the alleged offender.</li>
  <li>Where possible, female victims will have a female officer in attendance. Unfortunately at some police stations this might not always be manageable.</li>
  <li>If the police officer seems reluctant or is not willing to take minutes of your criminal report, ask for his/her name and service number and make a complaint.</li>
  <li>Your consulate will always be notified, as well as any other person you wish to notify.</li>
  <li>Evidence such as the clothing and underwear you were wearing and other items that the offender has touched will help the police to gather evidence and to build a criminal case. These items will be sent in for forensic examination, after which – if they are not needed for your case anymore - they will be given back to you.</li>
  <li>Once the police officer has taken minutes of your testimony, read it carefully and, if you find that it is full and correct, sign it. If you think it does not correctly contain your testimony, do not sign it and request a correction. You can insist on certain parts of your testimony being included in the minutes word-by-word.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to specifically include in your testimony that you wish the perpetrator to be brought to criminal justice (if you so wish).</li>
  <li>An officer will give you the police reference number for future reference, as well as the contact details of the officer responsible for the case.</li>
  <li>The police will arrange to take you to the hospital for a medical and forensic examination if that’s what you wish.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>The medical examination – what to expect</h2>

<p>The examination may be carried out by a family doctor, a specialist, a general practitioner or a specialist on-call doctor; it can take place in a hospital, surgery or forensic medical institution. It is highly advisable that you see a forensic medical expert and not just a doctor who is not a forensic medical expert. The opinion of a forensic medical doctor qualifies as an expert opinion for the purposes of official proceedings, whereas the opinion of a doctor (who does not qualify as a forensic medical doctor) qualifies as a deed for the purposes of official proceedings.</p>

<p>When you present yourself to have evidence secured confidentially, it may be helpful to use the phrases below to explain what you need to the receptionist.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Female: “Szeretnék egy nőgyógyász igazságügyi orvosszakértővel beszélni és sürgős vizsgálatot kérni” – I need to see a forensic gynaecologist urgently</li>
  <li>Male: “Szeretnék egy urológus igazságügyi orvosszakértővel beszélni és sürgős vizsgálatot kérni” – I need to see a forensic urologist urgently</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not take a shower or bath before the examination, so that any evidence is preserved. You will have a forensic medical examination and possibly tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs, such as syphilis). This may include taking a blood sample and, if you consent, taking photographs to document any injuries.</p>

<p>The doctor will first look for external signs of harm. It will help if you can describe where on your body you were injured and be sure to mention if you feel pain anywhere or certain body parts are sensitive. The doctor may perform a vaginal examination, which is similar to a gynaecological examination. Inform the doctor know if you never had this before.</p>

<p>If you were under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the attack, you may not have been able to defend yourself effectively. You can ask the doctor to examine your blood. This will not make you liable in criminal proceedings – on the contrary, this circumstance can increase the responsibility of the offender alleging that he took advantage of your inability of self-defence.</p>

<p>HIV as well as syphilis testing are usually performed, however, hepatitis B is not routinely screened for. Since pregnancy would not be detected until one week after the incident at the earliest, a pregnancy test is not performed by the doctor at this stage.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Treatment</h2>

<p>HIV PEP medication (post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection) needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The preventative use of the HIV medication (emtricitabin/tenofovir) is not yet supported by the Hungarian health care; patients have to pay for this service in full.</p>

<p>To prevent pregnancy you can ask for an emergency contraception prescription and get the pill at a pharmacy. The pill should be taken within 72 hours.</p>

<p>The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28-day treatment on return to the UK. If you have had medication administered overseas, you should keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home. Ask to be informed and advised about what treatment is recommended in your particular case to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How is the hospital treatment and tests paid for?</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of social security-based care, the examination is free of charge, and if the examination is carried out in the framework of private health care, it must typically be paid for on the spot after the examination. Check with your travel insurance provider regarding their policy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do hospitals automatically report the results of any examination to the police?</li>
</ul>

<p>Sexual violence is a privately punishable offence (except for certain sexual violence crimes which qualify as a more serious category of offence), which means that proceedings can only be initiated following a complaint by the victim. The doctor is obliged to report the crime to the authorities.</p>

<p>Medical findings may be important evidence if the case goes to court. (Although you can request a medical examination even if you decide not to involve the police.) If you want the assault to be investigated you will need to give consent to the doctor at the hospital to share information with the police.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Police investigations in Hungary – what to expect</h2>

<p>The British Embassy has received feedback from some rape victims that they have found the process of reporting the assault at times difficult, lengthy and quite different from what they would expect of UK police proceedings.</p>

<p>Normally you would first speak with an officer at the nearest police station, who will record a criminal complaint. An interpreter will be called in as soon as possible. If you know the whereabouts of the offender, it is enough if you provide this information and a description of him/her to the police. Identification is usually based on your description and a photograph, so in most cases you will not have to meet the perpetrator in person unless it is absolutely necessary for the investigation.</p>

<p>The officer will refer the case to a criminal investigator, who will be responsible for interviewing you about the assault and for investigating the assault. You can freely leave the country after this, but must be available for contact until the end of the procedure.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Court procedures – what to expect</h2>

<p>The police can detain a suspect for 72 hours. They will notify the Public Prosecutor’s office about the detention, who will than decide whether there is enough evidence to take the case to court.</p>

<p>The court can order an arrest for a period of one month, which can be extended by a period of up to three months at a time during the first year, and by periods of up to two months at a time subsequently.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Trial procedures</h2>

<p>You will know whether there is going to be a trial when the Public Prosecutor has made a decision. This decision is dependent on the evidence gathered during the investigation phase.</p>

<p>The language of the hearing is always Hungarian. The authorities will provide an interpreter if you do not speak the language – this will be free of charge (the cost will be paid by the accused or the State, depending on the outcome of the trial).</p>

<p>During the investigation phase you are free to go home to your home country or elsewhere.</p>

<p>If it is difficult for you to travel to Hungary for the trial, depending on the nature of the case you may be able to give evidence in writing or by telecommunication, or possibly by means of procedural legal aid before the authorities in the UK.</p>

<p>If you do travel to Hungary for the trial, the court will reimburse travel and, if necessary, accommodation costs - within the limits of reasonableness and necessity, under a special law. However, the authorities will not provide any special assistance in organising travel.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Communication</h2>

<p>Even if you do not have a lawyer, you will still be able to request information about your rights from the authorities (police, prosecutor’s office, court) at any time. You can inspect the case file, attend hearings and make motions.</p>

<p>If you wish to be informed of the future developments of the case, the criminal proceedings or the court trial, request this. Your request will then be added to the investigation file, so that the Public Prosecutor and the Judge know that you wish to be kept informed of the future stages of the investigation and the result of the trial.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Legal aid</h2>

<p>While not obligatory, it is recommendable that you seek legal advice from a lawyer. If you think you need it, you can request financial legal aid even if you are not Hungarian. This benefit is granted depending on your income and assets (a minor victim is eligible regardless of his/her income and assets). The application must be submitted to the determining authority on the form provided for this purpose (it can obtained from any legal authority).</p>

<p>If the legal aid is granted, you will be entitled to advance payment by the State to cover the fees and expenses of the lawyer acting in your defence and, where appropriate, to have them borne by the State; to advance payment by the State of the fees and expenses of the guardian ad litem; and to advance payment by the State of the court fees for the civil proceedings of a civil claim brought by you.</p>

<p>A list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hungary-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyers is available on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office website.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Sentencing</h2>

<p>In case the accused is acquitted, it has essentially no consequences for you. However, if there is a suspicion that you have deliberately accused someone else of falsehood or given false testimony in the proceedings, you may be prosecuted.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Compensation</h2>

<p>You might be entitled for compensation for your injuries, regardless of your nationality. Damages closely linked to the crime can be claimed in criminal proceedings, while other indirect damages (such as damages for emotional distress or quantifiable additional damages related to the offence) can be claimed in civil proceedings.</p>
