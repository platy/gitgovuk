<span class="number">1. </span>Action: extension of the school-led tutoring year-end statement to Friday 30 September 2022</h2>

<p>This is a mandatory return. You need to complete this form by 6pm on Friday 30 September 2022. This includes an extension of 2 weeks following the mourning period for Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>The deadline for your submission of the year-end statement is if your institution received school-led tutoring funding in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, even if you have not used it.</p>

<p>Failure to submit your form will result in full recovery of your school-led tutoring grant by ESFA.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;local authority form can be accessed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant/school-led-tutoring-year-end-statement-form-guidance-for-local-authorities-and-virtual-school-heads">online</a>. We have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant">technical</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-year-end-statement">policy guidance</a> (which includes frequently asked questions and scenarios). We have also published tutorial videos for schools and academies.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OYRpNpyna4&amp;t=8s" rel="external">tutorial videos for schools and academies</a></p>

<p>We recommend you sense check your responses before submitting the year-end statement. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>double check you have put the correct figures in the relevant boxes – we ask you to submit the total spend on tutoring and the total number of tutoring hours delivered, please ensure that you do not enter the same figure for both (unless your spend and hours delivered were equal)</li>
  <li>check how much you spent on school-led tutoring – your total spend should include both the funding we provided and your school’s contribution. If you used all your funding from DfE, the amount you enter will be higher than your school’s allocation</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more on the school-led tutoring grant on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-grant">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Action: participate in the National Tutoring Programme (NTP) data collection pilot</h2>

<p>As we enhance and improve the delivery of the NTP, we are working with ImpactEd to pilot a digital platform that schools can use to upload and link tutoring data within their settings to data automatically drawn from their Management Information Systems and other information (such as children’s characteristics, attainment, attendance, and wellbeing).</p>

<p>The pilot is free of charge and will last 10 weeks during the autumn and spring terms.</p>

<p>As well as the ability to link your tutoring data to other data held in your MIS and analyse it over the course of the pilot, our ambition is that in the longer term the outcomes of this pilot can help to inform more streamlined, automated, and user-friendly data collections for schools and more valuable analysis of tutoring and other interventions.</p>

<p>We are looking for volunteers to participate in the pilot to help shape how DfE collects data from schools in the future and to help us to understand what information schools find valuable in return. You will receive full support and training on how to use the platform.</p>

<p>Schools currently delivering tutoring, or planning to do so this term, can join the pilot by completing a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yXfS-grGoU2187O4s0qC-WlE_t08Xv5CpxAysmLH14RUOU9YWlY5U1dRTDdCRFozOVhITkVLNUI1Wi4u&amp;wdLOR=c3E584883-4252-4A3C-A5B6-4172D7E1252C" rel="external">registration form</a> before Friday 7 October. Places are limited and will be allocated on a first-serve basis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: updated schools financial value standard (SFVS) guidance and submission information for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We have published updated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-financial-value-standard-sfvs">guidance for the 2022 to 2023 schools financial value standard (SFVS)</a>. This guidance helps schools and local authorities to meet basic standards for good financial health and resource management, and to complete the SFVS checklist submission.</p>

<p>The checklist questions are the same as in the 2021 to 2022 reporting year. Section E of the guidance has been updated to detail how schools can use the Department’s Get Help Buying for Schools service and good estate management for schools advice.</p>

<p>For the financial year 2022 to 2023, schools should submit their SFVS to their local authority no later than 31 March 2023. Local authorities should submit their assurance statement to DfE within 6 weeks, no later than 31 May 2022. We will let local authorities know when the assurance statement is available online.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span>Information: National Tutoring Programme: 2022 to 2023 tutoring guidance and webinars for schools</h2>

<p>Following feedback from school leaders and stakeholders, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-tutoring-programme-guidance-for-schools-2022-to-2023">NTP has been simplified for the 2022 to 2023 academic year</a>. The refreshed programme provides schools with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-tutoring-programme-ntp-allocations-for-2022-to-2023-academic-year">NTP funding</a> directly and the freedom to decide how best to offer targeted academic support to their pupils.</p>

<p>DfE is hosting 2 webinars to share information with schools on how tutoring could benefit your pupils. The webinars will include guests from NTP’s new delivery partners, Cognition Education and Education Development Trust, who will be able to answer questions about academic mentors and training for tutors.</p>
