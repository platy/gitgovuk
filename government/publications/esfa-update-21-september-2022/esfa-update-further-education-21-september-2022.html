<p>The FE Workforce data collection for the 2021 to 2022 academic year is now open and will close on Friday 25 November 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: designation of employer representative bodies (ERBs) for local skills improvement plans (LSIPs)</h2>

<p>On 5 September, the Secretary of State designated employer representative bodies (ERBs) to lead the development and review of a Local Skills Improvement Plan (LSIP) for local specified areas.&nbsp; This follows an expression of interest process that was launched in May 2022.&nbsp; More information is on the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/designated-employer-representative-bodies">designated employer representative bodies</a>&nbsp;page.</p>

<p>The department is introducing LSIPs to give employers a stronger voice in shaping local skills provision, working closely with providers, and engaging effectively with local leaders and other stakeholders. The aim is to forge a stronger and more dynamic partnership between employers and providers that will enable provision to be more responsive to skills needs of employers and local labour markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The national roll out of LSIPs is underpinned by duties on providers and the Secretary of State outlined in the Skills and Post-16 Education Act (2022) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/21/enacted" rel="external">Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022</a>.&nbsp;Providers including Further Education (FE) Colleges (and designated institutions), Sixth Form Colleges, Independent Training Providers and Higher Education Institutions will need to cooperate with the employer representative body developing and reviewing the LSIP. Once the LSIP is produced they will need to have due regard to it in developing provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initial statutory guidance for the development and review of LSIPs, which took account of learning from the trailblazers, was published 1 August 2022 and will be updated in Autumn 2022 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-skills-improvement-plans">local skills improvement plans</a>.</p>

<p>The update relates to a clarification concerning the reporting of any propriety exceptions arising from the reporting accountant’s regularity engagement.</p>

<p>We have also provided further details on how any actual or suspected cases of significant fraud, including cybercrime, should be reported.</p>

<p>If relevant to your role and/or business, please read the document so you are familiar with the changes.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Information: update from the Office for Students on higher education data collected in the ILR</h2>

The tool provides outputs designed to improve the quality of your final ILR data submission. The OfS regards engagement with the tool as an essential part of providers’ data quality processes.</p>
