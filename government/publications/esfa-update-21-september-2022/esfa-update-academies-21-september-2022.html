<span class="number">1. </span>Action: extension of the school-led tutoring year-end statement to 30 September 2022</h2>

<p>The deadline to submit your year-end statement is now 6:00pm on Friday, 30 September 2022. This includes an extension of 2 weeks following the mourning period for Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>This is a mandatory return. You need to complete this form if your institution received school-led tutoring funding in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, even if you have not used it.</p>

<p>Failure to submit your form will result in full recovery of your school-led tutoring grant by ESFA.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital-forms.education.gov.uk/mQGSRslJ90/start" rel="external">schools and academies form can be accessed</a> here.</p>

<p>We have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant">technical</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-year-end-statement">policy guidance</a> (which includes frequently asked questions and scenarios). We strongly encourage you to watch this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=you+tubes+how+to+complete+your+year-end+statement&amp;docid=608020224011293424&amp;mid=093F092A9C98F52D8F22093F092A9C98F52D8F22&amp;view=detail&amp;FORM=VIRE" rel="external">tutorial video which shows how to complete the form</a>.</p>

<p>We also recommend that you sense check your responses before submitting the year-end statement. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>double check you have put the correct figures in the relevant boxes – we ask you to submit the total spend on tutoring and the total number of tutoring hours delivered. Please ensure you do not enter the same figure for both (unless your spend and hours delivered were equal)</li>
  <li>check how much you spent on school-led tutoring – your total spend should include both the funding we provided and your school’s contribution. If you used all your funding from DfE, the amount you enter will be higher than your school’s allocation</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more about the school-led tutoring grant on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-grant">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Action: participate in the National Tutoring Programme (NTP) data collection pilot</h2>

<p>As we enhance and improve the delivery of the NTP, we are working with ImpactEd to pilot a digital platform that schools can use to upload and link tutoring data within their settings to data automatically drawn from their Management Information Systems and other information (such as children’s characteristics, attainment, attendance and wellbeing).</p>

<p>The pilot is free of charge and will last 10 weeks during the autumn and spring terms.</p>

<p>As well as the ability to link your tutoring data to other data held in your MIS and analyse it over the course of the pilot, our ambition is that in the longer term the outcomes of this pilot can help to inform more streamlined, automated, and user-friendly data collections for schools and more valuable analysis of tutoring and other interventions.</p>

<p>We are looking for volunteers to participate in the pilot to help shape how DfE collects data from schools in the future and to help us to understand what information schools find valuable in return. You will receive full support and training on how to use the platform.</p>

<p>Schools currently delivering tutoring, or planning to do so this term, can join the pilot by completing a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yXfS-grGoU2187O4s0qC-WlE_t08Xv5CpxAysmLH14RUOU9YWlY5U1dRTDdCRFozOVhITkVLNUI1Wi4u&amp;wdLOR=c3E584883-4252-4A3C-A5B6-4172D7E1252C" rel="external">registration form</a> before Friday 7 October. Places are limited and will be allocated on a first-serve basis.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span>Information: Energy Bill Relief Scheme</h2>

<p>The Government has outlined plans for the new Energy Bill Relief Scheme, which will give early years settings, schools, colleges, and universities a discount on wholesale gas and electricity prices.</p>

<p>This will automatically be&nbsp;applied to bills for energy usage between 1 October 2022 and 31 March 2023.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: updated school resource management self-assessment checklist (SRMSAC) guidance and submission information for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We have published updated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-resource-management-self-assessment-checklist">guidance for the 2022 to 2023 school resource management self-assessment checklist (SRMSAC</a>) . This guidance helps academy trusts check they are managing resources effectively and identify any adjustments they need to make, and to complete the SRMSAC submission.</p>

<p>Updates to the 2022 to 2023 SRMSAC are outlined in the guidance. In summary, the checklist includes one new question regarding estate management. Guidance has been updated to detail how schools can use the Department’s Get Help Buying for Schools service and good estate management for schools’ advice.</p>

<p>For the financial year 2022 to 2023, academy trusts should submit their SRMSAC no later than Wednesday 15 March 2023. Returns will need to be submitted using an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/srmsa" rel="external">online form</a>, 2022 to 2023 version of which will go live in January 2023. We will let academy trusts know when this goes live.</p>

<span class="number">8. </span>Information: National Tutoring Programme: 2022 to 2023 tutoring guidance and webinars for schools</h2>

<p>Following feedback from school leaders and stakeholders, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-tutoring-programme-guidance-for-schools-2022-to-2023">NTP has been simplified for the 2022 to 2023 academic year</a>.
