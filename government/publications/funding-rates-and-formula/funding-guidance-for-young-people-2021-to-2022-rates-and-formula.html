<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance document covers the period 1 August 2021 to 31 July 2022 and is our current advice for the funding year. We know that providers are working through exceptional circumstances due to coronavirus (COVID-19). We may publish further updates to this guidance document about the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on our funding rules as these become clear. We will tell you about any changes in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/esfa-update">ESFA updates</a>.</p>

<p>You might find our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/further-and-higher-education-coronavirus-covid-19">published information</a> about what colleges and other providers need to do during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak useful.</p>

<p>This document is part of a series of booklets providing Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) funding guidance for young people for the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">Funding rates and formula</a> (this book)</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision">Funding regulations</a></li>
  <li>Individualised learner record (ILR) funding returns</li>
  <li>Subcontracting funding rules for ESFA funded post-16 funding (excluding apprenticeships) – we expect to publish a new single book <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-guidance-for-young-people-sub-contracting-controls">on GOV.UK</a> for 2021 to 2022 that applies to both 16 to 19 and adult education funding streams later this year</li>
</ul>

<p>This summary applies to all these booklets which will be available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">ESFA funding guidance page</a> on GOV.UK once published.</p>

<p>These documents outline the main features of ESFA funding arrangements for young people in 2021 to 2022 and are an integral part of ESFA’s funding agreements for young people aged 16 to 19 and those aged 19 to 24 with an education, health and care (EHC) plan. All of these documents should be read in this context, unless specifically stated otherwise. This is the definitive ESFA guidance for 2021 to 2022 and supersedes any previous funding guidance for young people.</p>

<p>Subcontracting funding rules for ESFA funded post-16 funding (excluding apprenticeships) applies to providers either with subcontractors or those considering subcontracted delivery. The published 2020 to 2021 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-guidance-for-young-people-sub-contracting-controls">Subcontracting control regulations document</a> should be used until Subcontracting funding rules for ESFA funded post-16 funding (excluding apprenticeships) for 2021 to 2022 is published.</p>

<p>Providers must take into account the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations in respect of the information they retain, particularly when it is personal or sensitive. It is the provider’s responsibility to ensure it is fully compliant with these regulations.</p>

<p>ESFA sets out in its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-privacy-notice">privacy notice</a> how data is collected and used to perform statutory functions on behalf of the Secretary of State. We will rarely ask for data from you outside of the ILR and school census.</p>

<p>Where we do ask for information outside of the ILR and school census, we will set out clearly what we need and why we need it. We will always request that all personal or sensitive information is sent via a secure method of transfer which is fully compliant with GDPR regulations. You must not send us personal or sensitive information at any other time or in any other way.</p>

<p>For further information or to contact ESFA, please use our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">online enquiry form</a>. Maintained schools should contact their local authority.</p>

<h2>What’s new?</h2>

<p>We have made the following updates to this guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the introduction – this now includes arrangements related to coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#Retention">Retention</a> – the funding methodology is temporarily using an average factor</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#IMD-2019">Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2019</a> – the funding methodology now uses the 2019 Index, rather than the 2015 one</li>
  <li>Exceptional in-year growth – we made minor additions to clarify the providers eligible for growth and to state that we have the power to recover growth awards</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#FMP">Formula protection funding</a> – we no longer pay formula protection funding</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2: November 2021</h2>

<p>We have added a section on when <a class="govuk-link" href="#Work-experience-core-aims">work experience learning aims are flagged as core aims.</a></p>

<h2>Scope of the 16 to 19 funding model</h2>

<p>The 16 to 19 model covers provision (including T Levels , but not apprenticeships) for young people aged 16 to 19. It also covers the following groups:</p>

<p>a. young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) aged 19 to 24 who have an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan</p>

<p>b. students aged 19 or over who are continuing a programme they started aged 16, 17, or 18</p>

<p>c. 14- to 16-year-olds who are directly recruited into eligible further education (FE) and sixth form colleges. Allocations for this delivery use modified elements of the standard formula</p>

<p>d. electively home educated (EHE) children of compulsory school age who are enrolled at FE and sixth form colleges</p>

<p>The model funds provision in different kinds of providers, including but not limited to:</p>

<p>a. FE and sixth form colleges</p>

<p>b. designated institutions</p>

<p>c. maintained school and academy sixth forms</p>

<p>d. 16 to 19 academies</p>

<p>e. higher education institutions (HEIs)</p>

<p>f. independent learning providers (ILPs)</p>

<p>g. special post-16 institutions (SPIs)</p>

<h3>Funding methodology</h3>

<p>The funding methodology is used to provide a nationally consistent method of calculating funding for all providers delivering 16 to 19 provision based on:</p>

<p>a.	the number of students</p>

<p>b.	a national funding rate per student</p>

<p>c.	retention factor</p>

<p>d.	programme cost weighting</p>

<p>e.	the level 3 programme maths and English payment</p>

<p>f.	disadvantage</p>

<p>g.	large programme funding</p>

<p>h.	area cost allowance</p>

<h3>The formula</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/116145/The_funding_formula_resized.png"></div></figure>

<p>In 2021 to 2022, there is an additional step in the formula to offset (remove) the in-year programme funding that was paid in 2020 to 2021 for the <a class="govuk-link" href="#HVC">high value courses for school and college leavers</a>. See that section for more information.</p>

<h2>Programme funding: core formula funding elements</h2>

<h3>Student numbers</h3>

<p>The funding formula measures the volume of delivery through student numbers and the size of their programme. Funding allocations use a lagged approach and take student numbers from the number of young people participating in the previous year and programme size from the year before that (that is, the last full year’s data return).</p>

<h4>Lagged student numbers</h4>

<p>Our default approach is to base allocations on lagged student numbers. This gives an appropriate allocation for each provider for the current year. Therefore, we describe it as an allocation based on lagged numbers, rather than lagged funding, funding in arrears or a guarantee of a lagged allocation. The lagged approach applies when there is a reasonably consistent level of delivery over time. It covers most, but not all, circumstances.</p>

<p>The lagged approach does not apply where there is a material change in the volume of provision offered by a provider. In these cases, we remove the provider from the lagged approach and calculate the funded student numbers as described below in the sections on <a class="govuk-link" href="#Student-numbers">new providers</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Student-numbers-closing">closing providers</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Transferred-provision">transferred provision</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Exceptional-growth">exceptional in-year growth</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="#In-year-closures">in-year closures</a>.</p>

<p>We calculate lagged student numbers in different ways for different types of providers.</p>

<p>a. school sixth forms and most academies: we base the lagged student numbers on the number of funded students recruited in 2020 to 2021, taken at the autumn 2020 census point</p>

<ul>
  <li>for a small number of academies, we base student numbers on estimates provided by the provider, if this is specified in their funding agreement. These academies are also subject to a pupil number adjustment in-year based on their actual delivery</li>
</ul>

<p>b. FE colleges, some other FE providers, and some ILPs: we base the lagged student numbers on the number of students funded in 2020 to 2021 as of 1 November and recorded in the ILR R04 return. To count, students must have at least one aim funded by ESFA under the 16 to 19 young people’s funding model that starts on or before this date. As the student numbers are taken partway through the year, we look at the previous full year’s data (2019 to 2020 R14) to find out by what proportion student numbers increased from 1 November to the end of the year. We use this ratio to work out the projected student numbers by the end of 2020 to 2021; this is used for the funded student number in 2021 to 2022</p>

<ul>
  <li>we also compare the student numbers from the November (R04) data return with the student numbers calculated from the February return (R06), both the year-to-date (the position at 1 February) figure and the number recruited by 1 November. Where there is a significant increase or decrease in student numbers, we may revise the allocation accordingly</li>
</ul>

<p>c. ILPs that have significant year-round enrolment: we count students in learning at a rolling 12-month period between February 2020 and January 2021. Students who are in learning in both 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 are only counted once</p>

<ul>
  <li>for some ILPs, neither approach is appropriate. In these cases, we use a hybrid of the methods described in b and c</li>
</ul>

<p>d. SPIs: we will allocate programme funding (element 1) and high needs funding (element 2) using the number of valid students from 2020 to 2021 ILR R06 data returns. We will use a census date of 1 February 2021</p>

<p>e. non-maintained special schools (NMSS): we will base the funding allocation on the pupil number data from the autumn 2020 school census, uplifted by the difference between the autumn 2019 and spring 2020 census pupil number data</p>

<p>f. for local authorities and other smaller providers the above approaches may not be appropriate. In these cases, we use the number of funded students from 2019 to 2020 (the latest year for which a full year’s data is available)</p>

<h4>Student numbers for T Levels</h4>

<p>As T Levels are new, there is no historical delivery to determine student numbers for the 2021 to 2022 allocations. Therefore, to start with we will use student numbers agreed with providers. For 2021 to 2022, we are using the T Level student numbers submitted by providers in October 2020, based on planned recruitment in autumn 2021. Where necessary, we will update this figure in autumn 2021 according to under- or over-delivery.</p>

<p>We will keep this approach under review and confirm from when we will apply lagged student numbers to T Level students.</p>

<p>As the allocation will use planned T Level student numbers, we will make an in-year adjustment to allocations to reflect over- and under-delivery. There is a tolerance of 40% before we adjust for under-delivery. We intend to use the ILR R04 and the school census autumn return to calculate the difference in the number of students enrolled. More <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-will-be-funded-in-academic-year-2020-to-2021#student-numbers">information on student numbers for T Levels</a> and examples of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-will-be-funded-in-academic-year-2020-to-2021#underover-delivery-against-funded-t-level-student-numbers-for-2020-to-2021">under- and over-delivery adjustments</a> are on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>We do not expect that introducing T Levels will affect the overall number of students for a provider, because T Level students will generally be students who would otherwise have taken existing courses.</p>

<h4>Student numbers for new institutions</h4>

<p>We derive student numbers for new providers in different ways for different types of providers:</p>

<p>a. new maintained school sixth forms: at opening, student numbers will be one-third of the sixth form’s full capacity. In the second year, student numbers will be double the first year’s actual recruitment, and in the third year we will use lagged student numbers</p>

<p>b. new academy sixth forms and 16 to 19 academies: we use the same method as for maintained school sixth forms. In a small number of cases we will base the number on the estimated number of students to be recruited in the first year, as agreed between ESFA and the provider</p>

<p>c. new free schools, university technical colleges (UTCs), and studio schools with sixth forms: the estimated number of students to be recruited in the first year, as agreed between ESFA and the provider</p>

<p>d. new providers with ESFA funding for high needs students only: the number of places commissioned by the local authority</p>

<p>e. new SPIs: we will allocate programme funding (element 1) and high needs funding (element 2) using the outcomes of the 2021 to 2022 academic year high needs place change notification process</p>

<p>f. for other new providers we agree student numbers on a case-by-case basis</p>

<p>In all cases, we will review the standard approach when a provider makes a case based on exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h3>Student numbers for providers stopping 16 to 19 provision</h3>

<p>Providers and local authorities (for maintained schools) must inform ESFA when they intend to stop delivering ESFA-funded 16 to 19 provision, whether this is temporary or permanent.</p>

<p>When a provider closes, or stops ESFA-funded 16 to 19 provision, we will reduce the lagged numbers to reflect the planned decline in student numbers.</p>

<p>We will not allocate 16 to 19 funding to a provider that is completely stopping 16 to 19 provision. We will also reduce funding before that if the change in delivery is material – for example, a rundown of provision over 2 years.</p>

<p>For a provider such as a school or academy sixth form, whose students are mainly on 2-year programmes, a typical trajectory for the reduction is half the lagged numbers in the year before closure and no funding in the year of closure.</p>

<h3>Transferred provision</h3>

<p>When 2 providers agree to transfer students, the funding for those students will also transfer.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we will also transfer the funding when a funded provider (the ‘prime’) ceases a subcontracting arrangement and the subcontractor transfers the provision to a different prime contractor: the funding follows the student.</p>

<h3>Exceptional in-year growth</h3>

<p>Each year we review the levels of student number delivery of all colleges, schools, academies (except if funded on estimates), SPIs, local authorities, and HEIs based on the autumn school census or ILR R04 data (with a 1 November reference date applied). When providers deliver exceptional in-year growth compared to their allocation, we may increase their allocations. These arrangements are separate from the reconciliation arrangements that apply to ILPs, which we set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-individualised-learner-record-ilr-returns">ILR funding returns guidance</a>. As this is a data driven exercise, providers do not have to submit a business case to be considered for growth.</p>

<p>We identify exceptional growth through analysing the current allocated student numbers against actual evidenced recruitment and the projected year end position. We also consider under-delivery at the provider in the previous year and the national picture of growth. We will base growth funding on a standard threshold determined by affordability, and growth is likely to be funded at a marginal rate. We may require additional eligibility or audit checks before allocating growth funding. We will notify providers who will receive exceptional in-year growth in February or March 2022. We base growth awards on the assumption that the in-year data return is accurate. If we find later that the data was inaccurate, then we will partly or fully recover the growth award.</p>

<h2>Student numbers and funding factors for merged and disaggregating providers</h2>

<p>The lagged approach does not apply when there is a material change in the volume of provision.</p>

<p>For future year allocations, when mergers take place before 1 August – that is, before the start of the funding year – we will calculate the allocation for the merged provider based on combined data (the underlying data method).</p>

<p>When providers merge in-year, we will either add together the allocations for the 2 providers for the current year or calculate the allocation for the merged provider based on combined data. In-year mergers are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, applying the most appropriate allocation method for the circumstances of each case.</p>

<p>In subsequent years, we will combine the data for the constituent providers and use this to calculate the allocation for the new provider until all data is covered by one return.</p>

<p>We may adjust the area cost weighting according to the methodology set out in the area costs section, so that the weighting is appropriate to the provider’s delivery pattern.</p>

<p>When some or all of the provision at an existing provider moves to one or more other providers, this is known as disaggregation. We review each individual disaggregation and treat it outside the normal processes on an exceptional basis. We will discuss the split of provision with the providers affected and recalculate their allocations as appropriate.</p>

<h2>National funding rates</h2>

<h3>National funding rates for study programmes</h3>

<p>For <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-study-programmes-guide-for-providers">study programmes</a>, we base the funding rate for a student on the planned hours in their study programme. All full-time students are funded at the same basic rate per student, per year. We derive the funding rates for part time students from the full-time rate, proportioned according to the midpoint of the hours range.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We expect that full time study programmes for 16- and 17-year-olds will be on average 600 planned hours per academic year, and we set the funding rate on this basis. For funding purposes, the minimum threshold for 16- and 17-year olds’ full-time programmes is set at 540 planned hours.</p>

<p>We fund band 1, the smallest part time band, on full time equivalents (FTEs). We calculate FTEs as the total planned hours for the student as a proportion of 600 hours.</p>

<p>The definitions of the bands are based on the annual hours that are planned for a student. Providers should refer to the companion document <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision">Funding regulations</a> for further information on what hours may be included.</p>

<p>The funding rates for bands 4 and 5 are intended to fund a student for a programme that lasts the whole of the academic year. Under the 16 to 19 funding methodology, ESFA regards students who start at the beginning of the year and attend a full-time programme as attending for a whole year.</p>

<h3>National funding rates for T Levels</h3>

<p>For <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-are-funded">T Levels</a>, we base the funding rate for a student on the planned hours for the programme. Usually, a T Level programme will last 2 years, so the funding rate is for the whole programme. We set a band for each T Level, and we expect that providers will deliver at least the minimum planned hours unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>The planned hours recorded for T Levels must not include industry placements, maths and English study, or additional qualifications that are not part of the T Level. <a class="govuk-link" href="#Industry-placements">Industry placements have a separate funding rate</a>, there is an <a class="govuk-link" href="#Additional-payment">additional payment for maths and English study in level 3 programmes</a>, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Large-programme">large programme uplift</a> gives extra funding for AS and A levels.</p>

<h3>Programmes and planned hours</h3>

<p>Providers can record a student on a full-time programme even if it does not cover the whole delivery year – for example, for a student who starts a programme in November after withdrawing from a programme at another provider.</p>

<p>In some cases, providers will plan compressed programmes to allow students to complete a significant number of hours in a short period of time where this best meets the assessed needs of the students and/or is strictly necessary to prepare them for their progression outcome. These programmes will be funded at the standard funding rates based on the planned hours. However, the number of hours should not on average be greater than 40 hours per week, and both the study programme’s planned hours and planned dates will need to reflect this. ESFA expects this sort of compressed delivery to lead to excellent results, as demonstrated through qualification success rates and positive destinations. ESFA is monitoring the delivery and value for money of compressed programmes.</p>

<p>Some students will have programmes planned in blocks that extend over multiple funding years – that is, they do not have start and end dates within the usual August to July pattern. We determine the funding band for these students by the number of planned hours assigned to them in the funding year. Therefore it is possible for a student to be funded as full time in one year and part time in the next, or part time in both years, even though their attendance pattern and timetable is the same as students on full time programmes.</p>

<h3>Students who do more than one study programme in a year</h3>

<p>ESFA will not fund students to take more than one full time study programme or the equivalent in multiple part time programmes in one provider in one funding year. If it is appropriate for students to take multiple part time programmes in one year, providers must not claim more than the equivalent of a full-time programme. In addition, we will not fund programmes for students who have completed a full-time programme at one provider to start a new programme at a different provider in the summer term of the same academic year. There is an exception for students doing the Diploma in Sporting Excellence (DiSE). You can find <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-study-programmes-guide-for-providers/16-to-19-study-programmes-guidance-2019-to-2020-academic-year#section3">more information about this</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Students who do multiple programmes including a T Level</h3>

<p>As with study programmes, we do not encourage providers to plan a T Level programme plus other programmes for an individual student in a year. T Levels are full time programmes and we do not fund students for more than the annual amount for their T Level. Therefore, students who do a T Level and another programme (either a T Level transition programme or another study programme) will only be funded for one programme, whichever is the latest programme recorded. However, students who do an AS or A level alongside their T Level are eligible for the large programme uplift, as long as they achieve their qualifications at the required level.</p>

<h3>Changes to study programme planned hours</h3>

<p>If a provider makes an error in recording the planned hours for a student, they must correct this in the next data return. Otherwise, providers must only change the planned hours recorded for a student in the circumstances set out below. Providers may change a student’s planned hours when they do more than one study programme in a year.</p>

<h4>Planned hours for multiple study programmes</h4>

<p>Students doing more than one study programme in a year will have completed all the activities on their first learning agreement or plan. The student may then start a second study programme. The provider must:</p>

<p>a. record a new core aim</p>

<p>b. change the planned hours to reflect the additional delivery</p>

<h4>Changes within the first 6 weeks</h4>

<p>Providers must work out the planned hours for a student’s study programme when they are first enrolled. If the programme content changes within the first 6 weeks of the programme, the provider must update the planned hours.</p>

<p>When a student transfers from one aim to another within the first 6 weeks, providers must calculate the new planned hours value to include:</p>

<p>a. the timetabled hours for any new aims and for continuing or completed aims</p>

<p>b. the hours delivered for the aim that the student has transferred off</p>

<p>When a student withdraws from an aim within the first 6 weeks of a programme, providers must remove all of the planned hours for the aim from the total planned hours, unless excluding the hours already delivered within the first 6 weeks would make a material difference to the student’s funding band. In those cases, providers can include the hours already delivered in the planned hours.</p>

<p>When a student withdraws from all their learning aims, and therefore withdraws from their whole programme, they will not meet the criteria to count as a start and will not be counted for funding. In these cases, providers do not have to change the planned hours.</p>

<p>More information on changes to planned hours in the first 6 weeks are in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision">Funding regulations guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Large programme uplift</h2>

<p>Large programme funding supports students who take much larger study programmes in order to prepare for work and university. It gives providers the ability to stretch their most able students by offering a broad range of qualifications.</p>

<p>The uplift provides increased funding above the full-time national rate for students that successfully study:</p>

<p>a.	4 or 5 A levels</p>

<p>b.	a Technical Baccalaureate (TechBacc)</p>

<p>c.	a full International Baccalaureate</p>

<p>d.	a T Level and an additional A or AS level</p>

<p>16- to 17-year-olds and students up to 24 years old who have an EHC plan are eligible for the uplift when they successfully complete one of the study programmes shown in table 3. We will only pay the uplift for an individual student for a maximum of 2 years.</p>

<p>We do not include AS and A levels in General Studies and Critical Thinking when determining which programmes are eligible for the large programme uplift.</p>

<p>We have used the data (from the 2018 to 2019 Young Peoples Matched Administrative Dataset, YPMAD), which is the last full year’s attainment data that is available when we calculate the 2021 to 2022 allocations.</p>

<p>We will calculate the value of the funding uplift as a separate amount and add it to the funding allocation before the area cost factor is applied.</p>

<p>More information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-large-programme-uplift">large programme uplift</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Historic data</h2>

<p>In line with the lagged approach used for student numbers, we use historic information from the latest full year’s data to determine funding factors. For the 2021 to 2022 academic year allocations, we used data from 2019 to 2020 ILR R14 or autumn 2020 school census relating to the year end position for 2019 to 2020. We use this data to calculate these elements of the funding formula for each provider:</p>

<p>a. programme cost weighting</p>

<p>b. disadvantage funding</p>

<p>c. area cost uplift</p>

<p>d. maths and English study in level 3 programmes</p>

<p>e. high value courses premium</p>

<p>Where historic data is not available (often due to the provider being new and therefore not having submitted any data), we use national or local authority averages for the relevant provider type.</p>

<h2>Programmes and core aims</h2>

<p>The core aim is the principal or ‘core’ activity in a student’s programme. It must be a learning aim so that it can be recorded in the ILR or school census, but it may be an activity represented by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/learning-aim-class-codes">class code</a>, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/16-to-19-funding-study-programmes-work-experience">work experience</a>. Providers returning the ILR identify the core aim for each programme. For the school census, providers must only identify the core aim for students studying vocational programmes, or mixed programmes with a vocational core.</p>

<p>Providers must ensure that students only have the core aim flag against one active learning aim at a time. If a student withdraws from their core aim, providers can flag another learning aim as the core if it is then the substantive and core component of the student’s study programme. If an alternative aim that meets these criteria cannot be identified, then the withdrawn aim should remain as the core aim. Students may also have a second core aim if they start a second programme (see the section Students who do more than one programme in a year).</p>

<p>The core aim is used:</p>

<p>a. to determine whether the programme is academic or vocational</p>

<p>b. to calculate programme cost weighting and high value courses premium</p>

<p>c. as one of the criteria to determine whether the programme is eligible for funding from the T Level capacity and delivery fund (CDF)</p>

<h3>Determining the core aim</h3>

<p>The core aim is the most important or central element of the programme, around which the rest of the programme is built. It will usually be the component with the largest amount of timetabled activity associated with it, and will usually reflect the primary focus of the programme in line with the student’s intended destination (such as employment or further study) at the end of their programme.</p>

<p>In the ILR, the core aim determines whether a programme is academic or vocational. Any programme with an academic qualification (as set out in table 5) as the core aim is an academic programme. When providers select any other type of qualification or work experience as the core aim, the programme is vocational.</p>

<p>In the school census we count any programme with a core aim as vocational because a core aim should only be returned for a vocational programme.</p>

<p>Traineeships must always have work experience as the core aim. Study programmes that are not traineeships may also have work experience as the core aim.</p>

<p>T Levels must always have the technical qualification as the core aim. Each <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-transition-programme-framework-for-delivery-2020-to-2021">transition programme</a> must be linked to its associated T Level route. For these programmes, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/learning-aim-class-codes">class code</a> for the T Level route must be the core aim.</p>

<h3>Work experience core aims</h3>

<p>When a student has work experience as the core aim of their study programme it must be an external placement.</p>

<p>a. Providers must always record work experience that is eligible for funding as employability, enrichment and pastoral (EEP) hours. The ILR and school census have a work placement entity, which providers must use to record placements for which they are claiming funding.</p>

<p>b. We do not expect the hours for internal work placements to be the largest single activity in a student’s programme, and therefore internal work placements must not be the core aim.</p>

<h3>Academic programmes</h3>

<p>Table 5 lists the qualification types that are treated as academic for funding purposes. If the student’s core aim in the ILR is not one of the listed types, the student’s programme is vocational. Providers who return the school census must only flag a core aim when the programme is vocational. All programmes with a core aim recorded in the school census will count as vocational, even if the core aim flag is attached to an academic qualification. You can find information on the correct use of the core aim in the census, and the effects of errors, in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/interactive-post-16-school-census-tool">interactive post-16 school census tool</a>.</p>

<p>For providers that return census data, we may switch a student’s programme type when the data does not indicate a core aim and it appears that a core aim should have been flagged to indicate a vocational programme. However, this switch may not be appropriate in all cases, and providers should not take it as a substitute for correct use of the core aim flag.</p>

<p>A levels in Critical Thinking and General Studies must not be core aims. However, providers should include the planned hours associated with them in the total for the planned programme hours.</p>

<h3>Vocational programmes</h3>

<p>Students who are not on an academic programme are, for funding purposes, on a vocational programme.</p>

<p>For funding purposes, T Levels are vocational programmes.</p>

<h3>Definition of a start</h3>

<p>For funding purposes, we count a student as having started a study programme once they have remained on that programme within the current funding year for a defined period of time, as set out in table 6.</p>

<p>For programmes that span more than one funding year, a student must re-qualify as a start at the beginning of each funding year.</p>

<p>We do not fund programmes that are shorter than 2 weeks.</p>

      <td>2 to 24 weeks</td>
      <td>2 weeks (14 days)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To determine a study programme’s length, we use the earliest start date and latest planned end date of all aims within the programme, or the first and last dates of the funding year if the aims are planned over multiple years. Similarly, the length we use to determine whether the student has met the qualifying period is calculated from the earliest start date and latest actual or planned end date of all aims within a study programme.</p>

<h3>Retention</h3>

<p>In 2021 to 2022, we will use a weighted average retention factor to calculate allocations, rather than using historic data as we have done previously. This approach will provide a retention factor for 2019 to 2020 that represents the expected year end data, had the year not been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It should also avoid detrimental effects on funding resulting from the exceptional nature of provision in 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>We do not expect to use this approach permanently, as the use of an averaged factor is an exceptional measure for use while student recruitment and retention is affected by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>We will calculate your weighted average retention factor based on the 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 retention factors weighted by the allocated student funding in each year.</p>

<p>If a provider’s 2020 to 2021 retention factor was calculated using lagged funding data, but the 2019 to 2020 retention factor was calculated using a national average, then the 2021 to 2022 retention factor will be based on the 2020 to 2021 retention factor only.</p>

<h4>Transfers</h4>

<p>A transfer is when a student stops studying one qualification and takes up another in its place, while staying at the same provider.</p>

<p>When a student transfers between qualifications or other programme components (such as work experience or personal development activity), retention is not affected as long as the student continues to meet the retention criteria.</p>

<p>When a student stops studying for and does not complete their core aim, providers must only record a replacement core aim when it is a substantial and core component of the study programme. If an alternative aim that meets these criteria cannot be identified, the withdrawn aim must remain as the core aim.</p>

<h4>Withdrawing and enrolling at another provider</h4>

<p>When a student withdraws from the whole of their programme at one provider and enrols at another provider within the same funding year, the first provider will receive funding (as long as the student has completed the programme qualification period), adjusted by the retention factor. The second provider should record the student on a full time or part time programme, according to the number of hours that their programme holds for the remainder of the year. The second provider will earn funding for the student.</p>

<h3>Programme cost weighting</h3>

<p>We use programme weightings to recognise that some programmes are more costly to deliver than others. There are 6 programme weighting factors in the 16 to 19 model.</p>

<p>Academic programmes with at least 2 A levels in the science sector subject area (SSA) 2.1 are weighted at 1.1. All other academic and some vocational programmes are weighted at the base rate.</p>

<p>For vocational programmes, we determine the weighting by the core aim’s SSA tier 2 classification. The weighting is applied to the student’s whole programme.</p>

<p>For directly funded 14- to 16-year-old students, we apply a weighting of 1.04 to the student funding rate.</p>

<p>We give the Prince’s Trust Team Programme the medium weighting. In order to be recognised as the Team Programme, providers must record one of the Prince’s Trust Team Programme qualifications as the core aim as well as the Prince’s Trust <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submitlearnerdatabeta.fasst.org.uk/ilr/field/learndelfamcode" rel="external">learning delivery monitoring (LDM) code</a> in the ILR.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-A">Annex A</a> shows the SSA classifications and weightings.</p>

<p>The programme weightings used for 16 to 19 funding are different to those used in other ESFA funding models.</p>

<h4>Specialist land-based programmes</h4>

<p>Certain programmes in the land-based sector, when delivered in specialist settings, are particularly costly to deliver. The higher costs are reflected using the specialist programme cost weighting 1.75.</p>

<p>Providers eligible for the specialist weighting are identified by ESFA, advised by an expert panel that includes Lantra, Landex, and representatives from specialist providers. We publish the criteria to qualify as a specialist provider in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-C">annex C</a> to this guidance.</p>

<p>When delivered by other providers, these programmes attract a 1.3 weighting.</p>

<h3>Disadvantage funding</h3>

<p>Disadvantage funding is made up of 2 blocks: one to account for students’ economic deprivation, and one to account for low prior attainment in English and maths. Disadvantage funding is not ring fenced and providers are free to choose the best ways to use this additional funding to attract, retain and support disadvantaged students and those with learning difficulties and disabilities.</p>

<h4>Block 1: economic deprivation funding</h4>

<p>Block 1 funding recognises that there are additional costs incurred in engaging, recruiting, and retaining young people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. We determine whether a student is eligible for block 1 funding by their home postcode and the level of deprivation recorded for that area in the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2019.</p>

<p>Block 1 also provides an additional amount of funding for students who are in care or who have recently left care (£480 per student). We pay the same amount regardless of whether the student is full or part time.</p>

<h4>Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2019</h4>

<p>We are using the 2019 version of the IMD published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in the funding formula for 2021 to 2022; previously we have used IMD 2015. Using this new version has resulted in changes to the disadvantage factors, and we have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-allocations#IMD">details of the changes</a> on GOV.UK. When a further update of the index is available, we will use that in the calculation of disadvantage block 1 funding for future years.</p>

<p>IMD 2019 gives a value of relative deprivation for every lower layer super output area (LSOA) in the country and is widely used in government. It is based on income deprivation, employment deprivation, health deprivation and disability, education, skills and training deprivation, barriers to housing and services, crime and living environment deprivation.</p>

<p>The IMD 2019-based disadvantage uplift will mean the following:</p>

<p>a. increased funding for students living in the 27% most deprived super output areas of the country</p>

<p>b. the funding uplift for these students ranges from 8.4% to 33.6%, depending on the level of deprivation recorded in IMD 2019</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uplift-factors-and-postcode-files">uplift values for individual postcodes</a> are available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>Block 2: GCSE maths and English</h4>

<p>Block 2 funding accounts for the additional costs incurred for teaching and supporting students who have low prior attainment. Low prior attainment is defined as not achieving English and/or maths GCSEs at grades 9 to 4 by the end of year 11 (typically age 16).</p>

<p>The low prior attainment measure we use for block 2 funding uses similar criteria to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-maths-and-english-condition-of-funding">condition of funding for maths and English</a>. However, students who have achieved an English literature GCSE, but not English language, are eligible for block 2 funding. This is different to the condition of funding criteria, where both English language and literature count as positive prior attainment.</p>

<p>The criteria for block 2 funding uses achievement at the end of year 11, rather than at the start of the programme as the condition of funding does.</p>

<p>For the purposes of calculating block 2 funding, we will count qualifications equivalent to GCSEs (such as IGCSEs) and level 3 qualifications in maths and English (such as AS/A levels in these subjects) as having completed GCSE-level study. Students with these qualifications by the end of year 11 will not attract block 2 funding.</p>

<p>Providers must return data according to these principles in the disadvantage block 2 prior attainment fields in the ILR (learner funding and monitoring (LDM) type ‘EDF’) and school census (maths/English GCSE prior attainment year group).</p>

<p>Block 2 funding is not intended to fund delivery of maths and English qualifications that form part of study programmes, but is to fund support for those students who need it to achieve their learning goals. This includes support for low cost, high incidence learning difficulties and disabilities.</p>

<p>Each instance of a student not having achieved a maths or English GCSE at grade C/4 or above is counted. This means that a student who does not have either GCSE will be counted twice for the block 2 uplift.</p>

<p>We cannot apply the principles of block 2 funding to 14-to-16 year olds. Most students in this age group will only just be starting GCSE study, and therefore we cannot use non-achievement of GCSE maths and English as a proxy for low prior achievement. Therefore any 14-to-16 year old student who is eligible for block 1 funding will also receive funding in place of block 2 funding at the rate of £960 per student.</p>

<h4>Disadvantage top-up</h4>

<p>Every provider will receive at least £6,000 of disadvantage funding. If a provider’s total calculated disadvantage funding (block 1 plus block 2) is less than £6,000, we will top up the amount to this value.</p>

<h3>Level 3 programme maths and English payment</h3>

<p>We give extra funding to providers to deliver maths and English to students doing substantial level 3 study programmes or T Levels.</p>

<p>Students are eligible for additional funding in the first year of a level 3 programme when they have not yet attained a GCSE grade 9 to 4 (or equivalent) in maths and/or English, and their study programme meets at least one of these criteria:</p>

<p>a. it includes at least 2 A levels</p>

<p>b. it includes a level 3 qualification of at least 360 guided learning hours (GLH)</p>

<p>c. it is a T Level</p>

<p>We pay an instance of funding for each subject in which a student does not hold a GCSE grade 4. This means that a student who has not passed either English or maths will receive one instance, and those without both GCSEs will receive 2 instances.</p>

<p>For students on 2 year programmes, we pay the whole 2 year rate in the first year of their programme, as long as they are continuing at the end of their first year. Otherwise we pay the rate for a 1 year programme.</p>

<p>More information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-level-3-programme-maths-and-english-payment">level 3 programme maths and English payment</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Area cost uplift</h3>

<p>Research has shown that there is a clearly marked difference in the relative costs of delivery between London and the South East, and the rest of England.</p>

<p>We normally base the area cost uplift on the delivery locations of the provider’s provision (see the following section for more detail).</p>

<p>The area cost factors are shown in table 10. Annex B lists the detailed area cost uplift factors.</p>

<h3>Area cost uplift factors for geographically dispersed delivery</h3>

<p>Where providers deliver provision across local authorities with different factors, we will calculate the area cost factor, using a weighted average of the area costs uplift for each delivery postcode.</p>

<p>We review the area cost factors for providers that return ILR data every year. This review compares the geographical spread of provision delivered by each provider to the method of calculating their area cost factor. We do this to ensure the area cost factor we use most accurately reflects the way provision is delivered in each provider.</p>

<p>a. we review providers that have 10% or more of their provision in a weighted area</p>

<p>b. for providers where the agreed approach is to calculate the area costs based on delivery each year, we update the calculated area cost accordingly</p>

<p>c. for providers where the area cost has previously been based on a standard figure (the head office’s postcode or another agreed figure), we will not make a change if the calculated area cost based on delivery postcode is within 1% of the figure used in the previous year’s allocation</p>

<p>d. for local authorities we use the head office postcode unless the authority itself has different fringe/non-fringe values (for example, Hertfordshire). This is due to low student numbers and potential year-on-year fluctuations</p>

<p>e. for other providers where there is a difference of more than 1% between the area cost factor based on the head office’s location and the area cost factor based on a weighted average of delivery locations, we will normally use the weighted average factor</p>

<h3>Area cost uplift factors for merged providers</h3>

<p>When providers merge, we will review their area cost uplift factors. In the first year, we will calculate the area cost uplift factor for the merged provider as the weighted average of the factors for the predecessor providers. After that, we will use the weighted average method for geographically dispersed delivery, as described in the section above.</p>

<h2>Programme funding: additional formula funding elements</h2>

<h3>Formula protection funding</h3>

<p>We introduced formula protection funding in 2013 to 2014. It shielded providers from significant decreases in funding per student resulting from the changes introduced to the funding formula from 2013 to 2014.</p>

<p>We have phased out formula protection funding over a 6-year period from 2016 to 2017. The final year in which we paid formula protection funding was 2020 to 2021.</p>

<h3>Advanced maths premium</h3>

<p>We give providers additional funding to increase the number of students studying for certain advanced maths qualifications. The funding will help providers remove barriers to advanced maths study and build their capacity to deliver this provision.</p>

<p>We have calculated the average number of students studying eligible maths qualifications in each provider in 2015 to 2016 and 2016 to 2017. This gives the baseline number of students; the premium is paid for each advanced maths student above this number. For 2021 to 2022 allocations, the premium is based on the number of students on qualifying programmes in 2020 to 2021 at ILR R04 or autumn 2020 school census.</p>

<p>The premium is £600 per student.</p>

<p>For advanced maths qualifications that are under 235 hours (according to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-qualifications-discount-codes-and-point-scores">appropriate year’s accountability measure guide</a>), we will only pay the premium in 1 year. For larger qualifications, we will pay the premium in 2 years if the student is still in learning in the second year.</p>

<p>We will include T Level students in the advanced maths premium calculation for the relevant year if they are taking an advanced maths qualification alongside their T Level.</p>

<p>More information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-advanced-maths-premium">advanced maths premium</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>High value courses premium (HVCP)</h3>

<p>The High Value Courses Premium (HVCP) supports providers to increase the number of students studying substantial programmes in particular subjects.</p>

<p>The premium is £400 per eligible student.</p>

<p>We pay the premium for these full and part time programmes:</p>

<p>a. substantial A level programmes – those that include at least 2 qualifying A levels</p>

<p>b. substantial vocational programmes – those that include a qualifying qualification of at least 360 GLH</p>

<p>c. T Levels in the specified subject areas</p>

<p>We have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualifications-getting-approval-for-funding">a full list of the qualifications</a> that qualify for the premium.</p>

<p>We use historic information from the latest full year’s data to determine which students are eligible for the extra funding. For the 2021/22 allocations, we used data from 2019 to 2020 R14 or autumn 2020 school census.</p>

<h3>T Level industry placements</h3>

<p>Industry placements are a compulsory element of T Levels.</p>

<p>The funding rate for a T Level industry placement is £550. As T Levels are designed to be 2-year programmes, £275 is paid in years 1 and 2 of a student’s T Level.</p>

<p>More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-will-be-funded-in-academic-year-2020-to-2021#funding-industry-placements-within-t-levels">T Level industry placements</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Condition of funding adjustment</h3>

<p>Students doing study programmes other than T Levels must study maths and/or English when they do not already hold a GCSE grade 9 to 4, A* to C (a standard pass grade) or equivalent qualification in these subjects.</p>

<p>This requirement is a condition of funding and we remove funding from future allocations for students who do not meet it.</p>

<p>For the 2021 to 2022 allocations, we remove funding for students who do not meet the condition in 2019 to 2020, according to either the 2019 to 2020 R14 or autumn 2020 school census data.</p>

<p>T Level students are not subject to the condition of funding, as each T Level has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-action-plan">maths and English exit requirement</a>.</p>

<h2>Funding outside the formula</h2>

<h3>High needs student funding</h3>

<p>High needs students are those who receive additional learning support funding from their local authority high needs budget (often called top-up funding or element 3), in order to gain access to, progress towards, and successfully achieve their learning goals. High needs students include:</p>

<p>a. students aged 16 to 18 whose additional learning support costs are more than £6,000 who receive top-up funding from the local authority high needs budget. Most, but not all, of these young people will have EHC plans, or</p>

<p>b. those aged 19 to 24, in FE providers and SPIs, who have an EHC plan and require additional learning support costing over £6,000 from the local authority high needs budget</p>

<p>High needs places in non-maintained special schools (NMSS), maintained special schools, special academies, and special free schools are funded at £10,000 per place, rather than element 1 and 2 as described below. They receive top-up funding from the local authorities in which their students are resident.</p>

<p>Maintained schools receive place funding directly from the local authority in which they are located. Academies, free schools, NMSS, FE providers, ILPs and SPIs receive place funding through their allocation from ESFA. High needs students in mainstream and alternative provision academies and free schools, FE providers, ILPs and SPIs receive elements 1 and 2 from ESFA and element 3 (top up funding) from the local authorities in which their students are resident.</p>

<p>a. element 1 – core education funding: programme funding, as described in this document. Providers must not seek funds from local authorities for shortfalls in element 1 in 2021 to 2022</p>

<p>b. element 2 – additional education support funding: £6,000 per high needs student (place numbers determined by local authorities, apart from SPIs and NMSSs, who are funded directly by ESFA on the basis of lagged ILR and lagged school census data)</p>

<p>c. element 3 – top-up funding: the additional education support funding provided on a per-student basis by the local authority in which a student is resident</p>

<p>We also consider young people to be high needs students when they are part time and the local authority in which a student is resident has agreed to provide additional support funding that would total more than £6,000 if provided over the full academic year.</p>

<p>In all instances, the local authority in which a student is resident must commission a high needs student’s placement and include the top-up funding (element 3) to be paid to a provider. An agreement must be in place between the 2 parties to that effect. If the resident local authority does not agree a placement and top-up funding, these students must not be recorded as high needs for funding purposes, even when the provider has assessed a student as requiring additional support or has offered the student a place. We publish information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2021-to-2022">high needs funding</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Care standards: residential accommodation for young people aged under 18</h3>

<p>Providers incur additional costs when they provide accommodation for young people aged under 18 who are living away from home and the provider is considered in loco parentis. Some of the costs are associated with complying with legislation such as the Care Standards Act 2000 and related regulations.</p>

<p>Care standards funding is available to providers where students are in residence primarily because similar provision is not available locally.</p>

<p>To be eligible for care standards funding a provider must:</p>

<p>a. be registered with Ofsted or the Care Quality Commission (CQC) for inspection under the Care Standards regulations</p>

<p>b. have a minimum of 12 students funded under the 16 to 19 young people’s model aged under 18 in residential accommodation on campus, as recorded in the ILR at 2019 to 2020 R14</p>

<p>Care standards funding will be calculated based on the amounts in table 12 and applied to provision for the appropriate year.</p>

<h3>Industry placement: capacity and delivery fund (CDF)</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/applying-for-and-delivering-industry-placements-capacity-and-delivery-fund-cdf-for-the-2021-to-2022-academic-year">capacity and delivery fund (CDF)</a> will help providers prepare to deliver substantive industry placements for students on vocational and technical study programmes at level 3.</p>

<p>The funding is additional to the mainstream allocation, which already funds work experience for all students through the planned hours for qualifications and employability, enrichment and pastoral (EEP) activity.</p>

<p>We have taken the student numbers in your allocation from your 2019 to 2020 data (ILR R14 or autumn 2020 school census). Students are eligible for CDF funding when they meet all of the following criteria.</p>

<p>a. they are full time – that is, their total planned hours are 540 or more if they are 16 or 17 years old, and 450 hours or more if they are 18-year-olds or older</p>

<p>b. they have met the qualifying period for their study programme</p>

<p>c. they are aged 16, 17 and 18 on 31 August of the relevant academic year – students who are 19 at the beginning of their programme are not included</p>

<p>d. they are enrolled on a level 2 or level 3 programme, with a vocational core aim – <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/work-placements-capacity-and-delivery-fund-from-april-2018-to-july-2019#qualifying-students">the qualification types that count as vocational</a> are listed on GOV.UK</p>

<p>The number of industry placements delivered must be no fewer than 25% of the number of funded students.</p>

<p>The funding rate per student is £210.</p>

<p>The CDF allocation includes additional student support funding, to recognise that some placements will incur extra costs for students, and that providers may want to offer them financial support. More information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-financial-support-for-students">16 to 19 bursary fund guide</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Additional guidance on student programmes</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">14- </span> to 16-year-olds at further education providers</h3>

<p>FE and sixth form colleges can enrol and claim funding from ESFA for 14- to 16-year-olds. ESFA will fund this provision where colleges express an interest in doing so, and can confirm that they meet the programme eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>We fund 14- to 16-year-olds who are in a school or academy through the usual school funding methodologies.</p>

<p>Full guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/full-time-enrolment-of-14-to-16-year-olds-in-further-education-and-sixth-form-colleges">full time 14 to 16 funding enrolment</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The funding formula for directly recruited 14- to 16-year-old students is very similar to the formula for all other provision funded by EFSA under the 16 to 19 funding model. The ‘Funding arrangements’ section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/full-time-enrolment-of-14-to-16-year-olds-in-further-education-and-sixth-form-colleges">14 to 16 guidance</a> gives further information on the formula.</p>

<p>ESFA uses the standard 16 to 19 funding formula to fund students under 16 who hold qualifications that are at least equivalent to a full level 2 (achieved at an earlier age than normal) who wish to enrol on a full level 3 course. Providers do not need to meet the direct recruitment criteria to enrol and record funding for these students.</p>

<p>ESFA also funds children who are currently electively home educated (EHE) who attend FE and sixth form colleges. These students can only be enrolled and funded for part time courses  – if a provider recruits them for full time courses, then they are no longer home educated and the provider will need to meet the criteria for direct recruitment.</p>

<p>ESFA does not fund EHE children who attend schools and academies under 16-19 funding arrangements: these children are funded through the pre-16 school funding methodology.</p>

<p>ILPs who wish to deliver provision for 14- to 16-year-olds must comply with the legislation on independent schools, which may involve <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-school-registration">registering as an independent school</a>.</p>

<h3>Pupil premium funding</h3>

<p>Some 14- to 16-year-old students will also be eligible for the pupil premium. When providers have directly recruited 14- to 16-year-olds students, we will calculate pupil premium funding outside the formula and in addition to the total programme funding. The eligible groups are:</p>

<p>a. students who are entitled to free school meals</p>

<p>b. children of service personnel</p>

<p>c. children in care and those who have recently left care</p>

<h3>Traineeships</h3>

<p>For funding purposes, a traineeship programme uses the same principles as any other 16 to 19 study programme, apart from some additional situations in which we count students as retained.</p>

<p>Traineeships last at least 6 weeks and up to 12 months. Usually we would not consider programmes under 12 months as full time. Please refer to the section ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="#Programme-planned-hours">Programmes and planned hours</a>’ for guidance about compressed delivery.</p>

<p>When a student progresses from a traineeship to another 16 to 19 study programme, the second programme must have a new core aim of its own as set out in the section ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="#Large-programme">Students who do more than one programme in a year</a>’. Providers must also update the planned hours to include the additional activity planned for the year.</p>

<p>Providers must record a programme aim in the ILR for all traineeships. We will use the programme aim to calculate retention for students on traineeships.</p>

<p>There is an indicator in the school census to identify learning aims that contribute towards a traineeship. Providers must use this indicator for all traineeship aims.</p>

<p>We have published more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/delivering-traineeships-through-efa-funding">delivering traineeships</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Supported internships</h3>

<p>Supported internships are study programmes that are delivered mainly on an employer’s premises, for young people aged 16 to 24 who have learning difficulties and/or disabilities. We fund them in the same way as any other study programme.</p>

<p>More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-internships-for-young-people-with-learning-difficulties">supported internships</a> is on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>T Levels</h3>

<p>We use the existing 16 to 19 funding methodology for T Levels. Where there are differences, we have noted them in the relevant section.</p>

<p>a. student numbers will be agreed with providers</p>

<p>b. there are 4 new funding bands</p>

<p>c. <a class="govuk-link" href="#Disadvantage-funding">disadvantage funding: block 2</a> (block 1 disadvantage funding is the same)</p>

<p>d. <a class="govuk-link" href="#Industry-placements">industry placements</a></p>

<p>We fund T Level transition programmes as standard study programmes and at standard study programme rates.</p>

<p>More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-will-be-funded-in-academic-year-2020-to-2021">T Levels</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>High value courses for school and college leavers: a one-year offer for 18- and 19-year-olds.</h3>

<p>In 2020 to 2021, we allocated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-value-courses-for-school-and-college-leavers-a-one-year-offer-for-18-and-19-year-olds">exceptional funding to support 18 and 19 year olds</a> leaving school or college in summer 2020. This funding supported providers to offer courses of up to one year duration in high value subjects to prevent young people, who would otherwise have moved into apprenticeships or employment, from becoming NEET.</p>

<p>The funding was made up of programme funding and an additional £400 uplift per student.</p>

<p>For students recruited in August, September and October, we paid the programme funding and the £400 uplift in-year through adjusted allocations. As these students were included in your data returns as usual, we will offset the programme funding against the 2021 to 2022 allocation in order to avoid funding these students twice.</p>

<p>As we could not pay the £400 uplift for students who enrolled after November 2020, we have included it in the 2021 to 2022 allocations. We will pay the programme funding for these students in the 2022 to 2023 allocation through the normal lagged funding approach.</p>

<p>We worked out the number of students eligible for the funding by comparing the number of eligible students in your 2020 to 2021 data to the previous year.</p>

<p>Usually, we fund 18-year-olds doing programmes of 450 hours or more in band 4a; they are never funded in band 5. However, students funded through the offer will be funded in band 5 when they are on a qualification from the published list of 450 GLH and are doing a programme of 540 hours or more. This adjustment will apply when we calculate the funding bands for use in future allocations.</p>

<p>We will also use adjusted retention criteria for students funded through the offer. We recognise that some students will leave their programmes early to go onto an apprenticeship or sustained employment, and that these are positive destinations. As such, we will treat these students positively for retention.</p>

<h2>Annex C: Criteria to identify specialist land-based providers</h2>

<p>Eligible providers offer provision that includes significant volumes of full time students that require the operation of credible land-based enterprises, operated to industry standards through 365 days per year, needing cover for 24 hours per day. This specialist provision involves plant and/or animal production and management that will normally entail using a significant area of land, estates and gardens. An additional higher cost feature associated with this type of specialist provision is the need to recruit from and manage widely and thinly dispersed catchments.</p>

<p>When land-based providers merge with non-specialist providers, the resulting provider will only receive the specialist weighting for qualifying delivery at the land-based provider’s premises, as identified by the delivery location postcode in the ILR. The effect is that we only apply the specialist weighting to the part of the merged provider that has specialist resources.</p>

<h3>Screening criteria</h3>

<p>Providers must meet these criteria:</p>

<p>a. an offer in at least 6 of the 12 land-based occupational areas, at least one of which will be agriculture or horticulture</p>

<p>b. a minimum of 200 full time, full year students in land-based subjects (all modes). Figures include FE and taught HE. Full time programmes must last at least 30 weeks</p>

<p>c. funded provision with progression routes up to and including level 3 or above in at least 4 of the occupational areas</p>

<p>d. clear progression pathways to HE</p>

<p>e. evidence of substantial involvement of representatives (leaders) of local land based industries in the provider’s activity</p>

<p>f. levels of investment in physical resources consistent with the vocational levels and range of provision</p>

<p>g. existence of commercial enterprises in either agriculture or horticulture that are controlled or managed by the provider and supports a realistic working environment for students to experience in acquiring an appropriate range of industrially relevant skills</p>

<h3>Occupational areas</h3>

<p>These are the land-based occupational areas:</p>

<p>a.	agriculture, crops and livestock</p>

<p>b.	animal care</p>

<p>c.	aquaculture</p>

<p>d.	equine</p>

<p>e.	food manufacture and processing</p>

<p>f.	game and wildlife management</p>

<p>g.	landscape</p>

<p>h.	land-based engineering</p>

<p>i.	horticulture</p>

<p>j.	professions allied to veterinary trade</p>

<p>k.	trees and timber</p>

<p>l.	viticulture</p>
