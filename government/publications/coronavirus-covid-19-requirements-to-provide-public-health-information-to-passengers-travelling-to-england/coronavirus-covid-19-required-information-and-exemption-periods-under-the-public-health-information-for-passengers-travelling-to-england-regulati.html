<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The government’s priority is to protect the public and stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). A key part of this is ensuring people entering England are aware of the public health advice and coronavirus-related duties for entering and staying within England, so that they can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make informed decisions about whether to travel</li>
  <li>arrive prepared to follow the necessary public health guidelines and comply with their duties</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirement for transport operators to ensure provision of coronavirus information</h2>

<p>Transport operators are required to ensure that passengers travelling to England by sea, air or rail from outside the Common Travel Area (<abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>) are provided with information about coronavirus, and related duties and public health guidance. From 4am 4 October 2021 changes are being made to the onboard announcement. Operators should begin to use the new announcement as soon as possible. A reasonable timeframe for implementation is permitted.</p>

<p>Passengers must be provided with information at 4 stages of the passenger journey:</p>

<ol>
  <li>at the booking stage</li>
  <li>at check-in stage</li>
  <li>notification 24 to 48 hours prior to departure to England</li>
  <li>on board the vessel, aircraft or train</li>
</ol>

<p>Where the booking or check-in process is managed by someone other than the operator, it is sufficient for the operator to show that they have taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information is provided by that person.</p>

<p>In practice, the reasonable steps may include writing to the third party responsible for managing the booking or check-in process (including via email) and asking that they provide the information to travellers at the stages that they manage.</p>

<p>Where someone books or checks in on behalf of the passenger, it is sufficient for the information to be given to that person along with a request to pass it on to the passenger if they are old enough and have sufficient mental capacity to understand it.</p>

<p>The information in Box A must be provided at stages 1 to 3 of the passenger journey. At stage 3, if the method used to communicate at this stage is text message or <abbr title="application">app</abbr> push notification,  discretion is given as to the wording – see requirements below. There is different wording for stage 4.</p>

<p>When the information is in writing, it must be displayed prominently and not incorporated among terms and conditions.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/covid-19-passenger-public-health/uk-government-logo.png" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government logo</a> may be included with written messages to passengers.</p>

  <p>The following is a public health message on behalf of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s public health agencies.</p>

  <p>Unless exempt, however long you intend to stay in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, everyone must take a pre-booked COVID-19 test within the first two days after you arrive even if you have been fully vaccinated. Unvaccinated passengers must take a further test on day 8 after they arrive and self-quarantine. </p>

  <p>The symptoms of coronavirus are a new continuous cough, a high temperature or a loss of, or change in, normal sense of taste or smell. If you experience any of these symptoms, however mild, you are advised to make yourself known to the crew.</p>

  <p>Please follow the Public Health guidance for the area you are living or travelling in.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Visit gov.uk/coronavirus for more advice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Compliance</h2>

<p>Operators must keep records of the steps taken to provide the required information in the required manner to passengers. These records may be requested by the Civil Aviation Authority, the Office for Rail and Road or the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>

<p>Regulators have the power to audit records of compliance with the new requirements from 29 June 2021. Penalties of £4000 apply for failing to provide the required information to a passenger. A separate offence for failure to keep records also applies.</p>

<h2>Legislation</h2>

<p>These regulations come into force on 04 October 2021.</p>

<p>These regulations apply to commercial transport services on which passengers travel to England from outside the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr> on a vessel, aircraft or train.</p>

<p>The regulations apply to England only. They cover international commercial transport services by sea, air or rail.</p>

<p>In relation to any booking made before 04 October 2021, the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Public Health Information for Passengers Travelling to England) Regulations 2020 apply as if the amendment made by this regulation had not been made.</p>

<p>The regulations that come into force on 04 October 2021 allow implementation as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
