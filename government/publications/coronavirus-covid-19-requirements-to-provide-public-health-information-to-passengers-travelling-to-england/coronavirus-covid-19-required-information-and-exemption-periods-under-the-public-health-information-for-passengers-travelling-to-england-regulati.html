<h2>You must amend the messages for passengers arriving into England from 7 January 2022</h2>

<p>From 4am GMT 7 January 2022, the required information at <a class="govuk-link" href="#box-a">Box A</a> must be updated to reflect changes to international travel rules for passengers arriving into England. Operators must amend the messages they provide to passengers to align with these changes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The government’s priority is to protect the public and stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). A key part of this is ensuring people entering England are aware of the public health advice and coronavirus-related duties for entering and staying within England, so that they can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make informed decisions about whether to travel</li>
  <li>arrive prepared to follow the necessary public health guidelines and comply with their duties</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirement for transport operators to ensure provision of coronavirus information</h2>

<p>Transport operators are required to ensure that passengers travelling to England by sea, air or rail from outside the Common Travel Area (<abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>) are provided with information about coronavirus, and related duties and public health guidance.</p>

<p>Passengers must be provided with information at 4 stages of the passenger journey:</p>

<ol>
  <li>at the booking stage</li>
  <li>at check-in stage</li>
  <li>notification 24 to 48 hours prior to departure to England</li>
  <li>on board the vessel, aircraft or train</li>
</ol>

<p>Where the booking or check-in process is managed by someone other than the operator, it is sufficient for the operator to show that they have taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information is provided by that person.</p>

<p>In practice, the reasonable steps may include writing to the third party responsible for managing the booking or check-in process (including via email) and asking that they provide the information to travellers at the stages that they manage.</p>

<p>Where someone books or checks in on behalf of the passenger, it is sufficient for the information to be given to that person along with a request to pass it on to the passenger if they are old enough and have sufficient mental capacity to understand it.</p>

<p>The information in Box A must be provided at stages 1 to 3 of the passenger journey. At stage 3, if the method used to communicate at this stage is text message or <abbr title="application">app</abbr> push notification,  discretion is given as to the wording – see requirements below. There is different wording for stage 4.</p>

<p>When the information is in writing, it must be displayed prominently and not incorporated among terms and conditions.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/covid-19-passenger-public-health/uk-government-logo.png" rel="external"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government logo</a> may be included with written messages to passengers.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/publications/hmg-identity-guidelines" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidelines for using the logo</a>.</p>

<h2>Box A – information to be provided at stages 1 to 3 of the passenger journey</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Essential information to enter England from overseas</h3>

<p>All persons arriving in the UK must fill in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">passenger locator form</a> up to 48 hours before arrival. You must declare all countries you have visited in the 10 days before arrival.</p>

<p>Before departure check if any of the countries you have visited are on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">red list</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you have visited a country on the red list</strong> you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/booking-and-staying-in-a-quarantine-hotel-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">book a managed quarantine hotel</a>. You can only enter England if you are a British or Irish National, or you have residence rights in the UK. You must enter through a designated port of arrival.</p>

<p><strong>If you have not visited any countries on the red list</strong>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated" class="govuk-link">check if you qualify as fully vaccinated</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you qualify as fully vaccinated</strong> you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider">book a test to take on or before day 2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you do not qualify as fully vaccinated</strong> you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england" class="govuk-link">provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test</a> taken within 2 days of departure to the UK</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england">make plans to quarantine</a> in private accommodation for 10 full days after arrival (or full duration of stay if less than 10 days)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider">book tests to take on day 2 and day 8</a> of quarantine</li>
</ul>

<p>These measures apply to all persons (including UK nationals and residents) arriving in the UK from outside the Common Travel Area comprising the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands. The British Overseas Territories are not in the Common Travel Area. Public health requirements may vary depending upon which nation of the UK you are staying.</p>

<p>Wales: <a href="https://gov.wales/arriving-wales-overseas" rel="external" class="govuk-link">https://gov.wales/arriving-wales-overseas</a></p>

<p>Failure to comply with these measures is a criminal offence and you could be fined. There are a limited set of exemptions from these measures. You may be fined if you fraudulently claim an exemption.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Notification 24 to 48 hours prior to departure to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> </h2>

<p>Operators must send the following information to confirmed passengers 24 to 48 hours prior to their departure to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.

<h3>
<abbr title="short message service">SMS</abbr> and <abbr title="application">app</abbr> notifications</h3>

<p>If communicating via text message or <abbr title="application">app</abbr> notification, operators have discretion to use their own words, but must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inform that passengers both fully vaccinated and not fully vaccinated in a country currently recognised by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or with a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> recognised vaccine type, must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test result prior to departure</li>

<p>The information on board the vessel, train or aircraft must be provided orally by way of an on-board announcement as scripted below. The on-board announcement must be completed in English and an officially recognised language of the country of departure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following is a public health message on behalf of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s public health agencies.</p>

  <p>If you are fully vaccinated or otherwise meet the eligibility criteria, you must take a test on or before day 2 after you arrive.</p>

  <p>If you are not fully vaccinated or do not meet the eligibility criteria, you must self-isolate for 10 days and take tests on day 2 and day 8 after you arrive.</p>

  <p>If you have been in any countries on the red list within the previous 10 days, you must quarantine in a managed quarantine facility for 10 days.</p>

  <p>Please follow the Public Health guidance for the area you are living or travelling in.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Visit gov.uk/coronavirus for more advice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Compliance</h2>

<p>Operators must keep records of the steps taken to provide the required information in the required manner to passengers. These records may be requested by the Civil Aviation Authority, the Office for Rail and Road or the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>

<p>Regulators have the power to audit records of compliance with the new requirements from 29 June 2021. Penalties of £4000 apply for failing to provide the required information to a passenger. A separate offence for failure to keep records also applies.</p>

<h2>Legislation</h2>

<p>These regulations come into force on 7 December 2021.</p>

<p>These regulations apply to commercial transport services on which passengers travel to England from outside the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr> on a vessel, aircraft or train.</p>

<p>The regulations apply to England only. They cover international commercial transport services by sea, air or rail.</p>

<p>In relation to any booking made before 7 December 2021, the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Public Health Information for Passengers Travelling to England) Regulations 2020 apply as if the amendment made by this regulation had not been made.</p>

<p>The regulations that come into force on 7 December 2021 allow implementation as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
