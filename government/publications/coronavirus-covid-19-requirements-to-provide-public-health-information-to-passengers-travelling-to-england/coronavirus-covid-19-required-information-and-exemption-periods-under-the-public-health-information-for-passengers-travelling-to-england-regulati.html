<h2>You must amend the messages for passengers arriving into England from 11 February 2022</h2>

<p>From 4am GMT 11 February 2022, the required information at <a class="govuk-link" href="#box-a">Box A</a> and the on-board announcement must be updated to reflect changes to international travel rules for passengers arriving into England. Operators must amend the messages they provide to passengers to align with these changes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Requirement for transport operators to ensure provision of coronavirus information</h2>

<p>Transport operators are required to ensure that passengers travelling to England by sea, air or rail from outside the Common Travel Area (<abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>) are provided with information about coronavirus, and related duties and public health guidance.</p>

<p>Passengers must be provided with the specified information (Box A) 24 hours before departure to England. This means the information must be sent to or displayed prominently to the passenger. This can be through digital, physical or verbal means. This obligation may be discharged by the operator (or relevant third party who handles booking or check-in) at any time prior to 24 hours before departure to England. For passengers that book within 24 hours of departure the operator (or relevant third party) must provide the information at any time before departure. It is not sufficient to only place the information on a website or amongst terms and conditions.</p>

<p>Where the booking or check-in process is managed by someone other than the operator, it is sufficient for the operator to show that they have taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information is provided by that person.</p>

<p>In practice, the reasonable steps may include writing to the third party responsible for managing the booking or check-in process (including via email) and asking that they provide the information to travellers at the stages that they manage.</p>

<p>Where someone books or checks in on behalf of the passenger, it is sufficient for the information to be given to that person along with a written request to pass it on to the passenger if they are old enough and have sufficient mental capacity to understand it.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/covid-19-passenger-public-health/uk-government-logo.png"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government logo</a> may be included with written messages to passengers.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/publications/hmg-identity-guidelines">guidelines for using the logo</a>.</p>

<h2>Box A – information to be provided before the passenger journey</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Essential information to enter England from overseas</h3>

<p>All persons arriving in the UK must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">fill in a Passenger Locator Form</a> before arrival.</p>

<p>Before departure to the UK <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">check if any of the countries you have visited in the last 10 days are on the red list</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you have visited a country on the red list</strong> you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">follow the red list rules</a>.</p>

<p>If you have not visited any countries on the red list, <strong>what you have to do depends on your vaccination status</strong>. Check the rules before you travel at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">gov.uk/coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>Public health requirements may vary depending upon which nation of the UK you are travelling to. Check the relevant website if your final destination is in <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-advice" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-quarantine/pages/overview/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Scotland</a> or <a href="https://gov.wales/arriving-wales-overseas" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Wales</a>.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with these measures is a criminal offence and you could be fined. There are a limited set of exemptions from these measures. You may be fined if you fraudulently claim an exemption.</p>
</div>

<h2>On board the vessel, aircraft or train</h2>

<p><strong>The information on board the vessel, train or aircraft must be provided orally by way of an on-board announcement as scripted below. The on-board announcement must be completed in English and an officially recognised language of the country of departure.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following is a public health message on behalf of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s public health agencies.</p>

  <p>If you are not fully vaccinated or do not meet the eligibility criteria, you must take a test on or before day 2 after you arrive.</p>

  <p>The symptoms of coronavirus are a new continuous cough, a high temperature or a loss of, or change in, normal sense of taste or smell. If you experience any of these symptoms, however mild, you are advised to make yourself known to the crew.</p>

  <p>Please follow the Public Health guidance for the area you are living or travelling in.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Visit gov.uk/coronavirus for more advice.</p>

<h2>Compliance</h2>

<p>Operators must keep records of the steps taken to provide the required information in the required manner to passengers. These records may be requested by the Civil Aviation Authority, the Office for Rail and Road or the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>

<p>Regulators have the power to audit records of compliance with the new requirements from 29 June 2021. Penalties of £4000 apply for failing to provide the required information to a passenger. A separate offence for failure to keep records also applies.</p>
