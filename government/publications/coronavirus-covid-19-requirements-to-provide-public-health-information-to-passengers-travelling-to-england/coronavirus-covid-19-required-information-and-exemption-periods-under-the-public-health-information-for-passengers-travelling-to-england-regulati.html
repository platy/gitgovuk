<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The government’s priority is to protect the public and stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). A key part of this is ensuring people entering England are aware of the public health advice and coronavirus-related duties for entering and staying within England, so that they can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make informed decisions about whether to travel</li>
  <li>arrive prepared to follow the necessary public health guidelines and comply with their duties</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirement for transport operators to ensure provision of coronavirus information</h2>

<p>Transport operators are required to ensure that passengers travelling to England by sea, air or rail from outside the common travel area are provided with information about coronavirus, and related duties and public health guidance. From  22 January changes are being made to the required information at Box A, including to highlight the requirement for passengers to have proof of a negative COVID-19 test result taken within 3 days of departure to England will apply.</p>

<p>Passengers must be provided with information at 4 stages of the passenger journey:</p>

<ol>
  <li>at the booking stage</li>
  <li>at check-in stage</li>
  <li>notification 24 to 48 hours prior to departure to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> </li>
  <li>on board the vessel, aircraft or train</li>
</ol>

<p>Where the booking or check-in process is managed by someone other than the operator, it is sufficient for the operator to show that they have taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information is provided by that person.</p>

<p>In practice, the reasonable steps may include writing to the third party responsible for managing the booking or check-in process (including via email) and asking that they provide the information to travellers at the stages that they manage.</p>

<p>Where someone books or checks in on behalf of the passenger, it is sufficient for the information to be given to that person along with a request to pass it on to the passenger if they are old enough and have sufficient mental capacity to understand it.</p>

<p>The information in Box A must be provided at stages 1 to 3 of the passenger journey. At stage 3, if the method used to communicate at this stage is text message or app push notification,  discretion is given as to the wording – see requirements below. There is different wording for stage 4.</p>

<p>When the information is in writing, it must be displayed prominently and not incorporated among terms and conditions.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/covid-19-passenger-public-health/uk-government-logo.png"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government logo</a> may be included with written messages to passengers.</p>

<p>Before entering the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, you must complete a passenger locator form online, regardless of where you are arriving from.

<p>Visit GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for more information.</p>

<p>The symptoms of coronavirus are a new continuous cough, a high temperature or a loss of, or change in, normal sense of taste or smell. If you experience any of these symptoms, however mild, you are advised to make yourself known to the crew.</p>

<p>Simple measures you can take to help protect yourself and family are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash your hands</li>
  <li>avoid touching your face with your hands</li>
  <li>catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue and dispose of it immediately”</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Compliance</h2>

<p>Operators must keep records of the steps taken to provide the required information in the required manner to passengers. These records may be requested by the Civil Aviation Authority, the Office for Rail and Road or the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>

<p>Regulators have the power to audit records of compliance with the new requirements from 22 January. Penalties of £4000 apply for failing to provide the required information to a passenger. A separate offence for failure to keep records also applies.</p>

<h2>Exemption periods</h2>

<p>Operators will not be required to ensure the required information is provided to passengers who arrive in England during an exemption period.</p>

<p>The requirement to ensure that passengers are provided with information at the booking and check-in stages also does not apply if the booking is made, or the check-in takes place, during an exemption period.</p>

<p>Statements made by the Secretary of State for Transport which start or end an exemption period will be placed on this page.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>There is no exemption period currently in place.</p>
</div>

<h2>Legislation</h2>

<p>On 22 January, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/68/made">amended regulations</a> were laid requiring transport operators to ensure that passengers travelling to England from outside the common travel area are provided with information about these matters throughout the passenger journey. These regulations come into force on 22 January.</p>

<p>These regulations apply to commercial transport services on which passengers travel to England from outside the common travel area on a vessel, aircraft or train.</p>

<p>The regulations apply to England only. They cover international commercial transport services by sea, air or rail.</p>

<p>In relation to any booking made before 22 January 2020, the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Public Health Information for Passengers Travelling to England) Regulations 2020 apply as if the amendment made by this regulation had not been made.</p>

<p>The regulations made on 22 January allow implementation as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
