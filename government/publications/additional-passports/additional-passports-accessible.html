<h3>Version 10.0</h3>

<p>Guidance for Her Majesty’s Passport Office staff dealing with passport applications from customers in the UK and overseas who ask for additional (more than 1) passports.</p>

<h2>About: Additional passports</h2>

<p>This guidance tells Her Majesty’s Passport Office staff how to process passport applications from customers in the UK or overseas who need additional (or second) passports because they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>need to get visas to travel on business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>travel to incompatible countries (countries with political differences which may prevent travel between them two)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are frequent travellers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An additional passport holder is a customer who holds (or is applying to hold) more than one passport of the same type. It does not apply to customers who are eligible to hold single passports of 2 different types, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>passports in 2 different British nationalities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one diplomatic or official passport and one personal passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Contacts</h3>

<p>If you have any questions about the guidance and your line manager or senior caseworker cannot help you or you think that the guidance has factual errors then email Guidance and Quality, Operating Standards.</p>

<p>If you notice any formatting errors in this guidance (broken links, spelling mistakes and so on) or have any comments about the layout or navigability of the guidance then you can email Guidance and Quality, Operating Standards.</p>

<h3>Publication</h3>

<p>Below is information on when this version of the guidance was published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>version 10.0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>published for Home Office staff on 26 September 2021</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes from last version of this guidance</h3>

<p>This guidance has been updated to include applications from customers working in the haulage industry or food preparation, supply or distribution sector (page 6 and 16).</p>

<h2>What additional passports are</h2>

<p>This section tells Her Majesty’s Passport Office staff about additional (more than 1) passports.</p>

<p>HM Passport Office does not usually allow more than 1 passport per person but may issue additional passports to customers who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have a genuine need for one and can provide evidence to show it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet the criteria in this guidance</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We must issue all additional passports in the same name and have the same observations as the original passport we issued (unless this guidance tells you otherwise, for example, when some dual nationals travel to incompatible countries).</p>

<p>We commonly refer to additional passports as ‘second’ passports but we may consider issuing the customer with more than 2 (on a case by case basis). If a customer asks for 3 or more valid passports and has a genuine need for them, a Higher Executive Officer (HEO) or someone senior must authorise it.</p>

<p>When we issue an additional passport, we must tell customers to be careful when using them for travel, as they result in additional checks taking place in other countries. We must refuse an application for an additional passport, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we have concerns with a customer’s entitlement, nationality or identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer cannot clearly prove they have a genuine need for one (in line with this guidance)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>When we will issue an additional passport</h3>

<p>HM Passport Office only issue additional passports to customers who confirm they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark8">travelling to incompatible countries</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark18">business travellers and students</a> (and those who accompany them) who travel frequently, in connection with their job or for study purposes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark25">frequent travellers</a> who cross borders between countries on a daily basis (for work) these include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>airline staff</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>customers working in the haulage industry or food preparation, supply or distribution sector</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark31">United Kingdom (UK) government staff</a> who need a passport to travel on business</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Customers do not have the right to have their additional passports automatically renewed. When a customer applies to renew an additional passport, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>tell us why they need it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give us evidence to show they still need it</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will review applications for additional passports on a case by case basis, taking into account the customer’s need, the amount of validity they need on their additional passport and whether they would benefit from a 50 page frequent traveller passport instead.</p>

<h3>How customers can apply for an additional passport</h3>

<p>Customers can currently apply for an additional passport by post, in person or online.</p>

<p>The additional passport service is not widely promoted and for postal applications and applications made in person there is no service type on AMS (Application Management Service) or DAP (Digital Application Processing) for the service.</p>

<p>The customer should make their requirement clear on their application and the need must also be clearly seen in the production of documentation, for example a supporting letter from their employer to demonstrate and evidence their need for an additional passport.</p>

<p>Customers may select different options (renewal, first time) when completing the application form by post or in person. On AMS, you must, where necessary, change the service type to renewal where this has not been selected when examining the application.</p>

<p>Digital Application processing (DAP) will identify online applications where the customer has sent us a British citizen passport for renewal, and they also hold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an additional passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>another British nationality status passport (for example a British overseas territories citizen (BOTC) passport)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a Diplomatic or Official passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>DAP creates a multiple British passport task and indicates the customer has more than one passport and guides you, the examiner, how to complete the task (for example checking Main Index and asking for extra evidence)</p>

<p>An application for a first additional passport and any following application requesting the continued use of an additional passport must always be treated as a renewal application (as there is no requirement for a countersignatory or digital referee).</p>

<h2>Additional passports for travel to incompatible countries</h2>

<p>This section tells Her Majesty’s Passport Office staff when we will issue an additional passport for customers travelling to an incompatible country (a country that has political differences with a country the customer may have visited in the past) and provides <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark10">a list of the countries</a> that we know about.</p>

<p>The UK Government does not encourage customers concealing their travel history in multiple passports and the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office website tells customers about country specific travel restrictions.</p>

<p>If a customer is travelling to a country that has political differences with another country, they may be refused entry if their passport has evidence they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>travel to that country (for example, an immigration stamp or visa)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have dual citizenship of another incompatible country the customer needs to travel to (usually in the form of an observation)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a stamp or visa from 1 county will prevent or cause travel problems in another country or area, we will consider issuing an additional passport or travel document.</p>

<p>You must always check the customer’s circumstances and why they need an additional passport.</p>

<h3>Proving travel to incompatible countries</h3>

<p>To prove they are travelling to an incompatible country, customers must send us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>their current passport containing stamps or observations, to show they travel (or have a connection) to an incompatible country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence they intend to travel between incompatible countries (if they do not have a travel schedule, they may send us a signed letter from them, their employer or client, to explain why they need an additional passport)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We normally issue additional passports with full validity but you may consider issuing a restricted validity passport in exceptional circumstances (for example, to allow for a one-off important visit). The FCDO may be able to issue an emergency travel document (ETD) to customers overseas in similar circumstances.</p>

<h3>Links with Israel</h3>

<p>Travel from Israel to some Arab or Muslim states, may cause a situation where the customer can be refused entry. These states include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Iran</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iraq</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kuwait</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lebanon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Libya</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pakistan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Saudi Arabia</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sudan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Syria</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yemen</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a customer intends to travel to any of these countries, you must issue an additional passport to them, as long as their passports have an:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Israeli immigration stamp or visa</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>observation in their passport that refers to them being an Israeli dual national</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a customer is travelling from one of these states to Israel, you must not issue an additional passport.</p>

<h3>Links with Saudi Arabia and Libya</h3>

<p>If a customer is travelling to Saudi Arabia and their passport shows evidence they have travelled to Libya, you must issue an additional passport to them.</p>

<h3>Links with Yemen and Pakistan</h3>

<p>If a customer is travelling to Yemen and their passport shows evidence they have travelled to Pakistan, you must issue an additional passport to them.</p>

<h3>Travel from Cuba to the USA through Mexico</h3>

<p>If you know a customer with an additional passport is travelling from Cuba to the USA through Mexico, you must tell them to use the same passport to enter Cuba and Mexico, as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the Mexican immigration authorities stamp the passport ‘Arrived from Cuba’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>using only 1 passport means the other passport does not make reference to Cuba (as references to Cuba may cause the customer problems when arriving in the USA)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Travel to Serbia from the Kosovo border</h3>

<p>You must issue an additional passport to a customer travelling between Kosovo and Serbia (as Serbian authorities have denied entry to foreign nationals who have Republic of Kosovo stamps in their passport).</p>

<p>If the customer needs advice about travel between Kosovo and Serbia, you must refer them to the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>FCDO travel advice site</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serbian Ministry for Foreign Affair site</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Resident in Qatar</h3>

<p>You must issue an additional passport to a customer who is resident in Qatar and can demonstrate they are working for a government body relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Saudi Arabia</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>United Arab Emirates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bahrain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Egypt</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is because some residents in Qatar have been denied entry at the borders of these countries due to an ongoing diplomatic dispute.</p>

<h3>Observations showing dual citizenship</h3>

<p>If a dual national has a foreign passport in another name, we must issue (or may have previously issued) their British passport with an observation to say:</p>

<h4>‘The holder has a [name of country] passport, number [number] issued on [date] in the name of [name]. This passport is due to expire on [date]’</h4>

<p>If a customer tells us the observation will cause them difficulty (for example, because they intend to travel to an incompatible country) we may consider issuing them with an additional passport. The additional passport will have limited validity to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>cover the period of intended travel (for example, 6 or 12 months)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet the validity requirements of the country they are travelling to. To do this, you must check the entry requirement of the incompatible country on GOV.UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When this happens, you must ask the customer to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>complete a new application form using the first time passport service type</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pay the correct fee for their application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send us written evidence of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>their travel to an incompatible country</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the period of travel</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the length of stay</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you get the application, you must:</p>

<p>1. Ask a Higher Executive Officer (HEO) to authorise it (before you issue the additional passport).</p>

<p>2. Change the passport’s expiry date on the application to show the new validity.</p>

<p>3. Add the following observations to the passport:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>OBTO ‘THE HOLDER IS ALSO KNOWN AS [INSERT FREE TEXT UP TO 56 CHARACTERS]’ and change the free text field to show the customer’s other name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OBTU ‘VALID FOR [INSERT FREE TEXT] MONTHS. NOT TO BE REPLACED WITHOUT REFERENCE TO HM PASSPORT OFFICE [INSERT FREE TEXT].</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4. Add a case note to explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the reason for the limited validity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the length of the visit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how much validity the customer needs in order to travel to the country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all of the supporting documents and evidence you received</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>5. Scan all of the evidence and supporting documents you received on to the system (so you have a permanent record of them).</p>

<p>6. <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark44">Add a passport note</a> to all passport records for the customer (to link them together).</p>

<p>7. Make sure you do not electronically or physically cancel any passport the customer needs for future use.</p>

<p>You must not automatically renew the additional passport when it expires. If you get the additional passport, you must cancel it. If the customer has problems travelling after their additional passport expired, they must reapply for another one and send us the correct evidence (in line with this guidance).</p>

<h3>Customers who have problems travelling to other countries</h3>

<p>If a customer needs an additional passport because they are travelling to countries not listed in this guidance, you (the examiner) must check the country details with them.</p>

<p>If the customer insists they will be refused entry to a country not listed in this guidance, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>check with the Foreign Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) for their latest travel advice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not issue the customer an additional passport while you check the latest travel advice</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the FCDO’s advice confirms the country is incompatible, you must issue the additional passport and tell the Guidance &amp; Quality, Operating Standards, so they can update the guidance.</p>

<p>You must tell the customer to make sure they use their passports so the reference or connection to the incompatible country (shown by immigration stamps or visas) is only shown in 1 passport.</p>

<p>We normally issue additional passports with full validity, but you may consider issuing a Restricted Validity passport in exceptional circumstances, for example, to</p>

<p>allow for a one-off important visit or where there is a limited time period that the additional passport is needed for (evidence of the need must be provided in both of these cases). The FCDO may be able to issue an emergency travel document (ETD) to customers overseas in similar circumstances.</p>

<h2>Additional passports: business travellers and study reasons</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff what to consider when they deal with an application for an additional passport for a business traveller or for someone who frequently travels across borders to study.</p>

<p>Where evidence is provided that a customer needs an additional passport, we will issue one to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>frequent business travellers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>students</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is so they can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>continue travelling for business purposes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>and apply for a visa at the same time</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>while they wait to get a new passport</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>travel to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark8">incompatible countries</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>continue their studies without disruption</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Partners, dependents and those accompanying students</h3>

<p>HM Passport Office may issue an additional passport to a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>frequent traveller’s partners and dependents, so they can accompany them for an extended period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>person accompanying a student (for example, a parent or carer) on their journey across a border</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As we do not usually do this, you (the examiner) must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>consider these applications on a case by case basis, taking in to account the customer’s specific needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask your operational team leader (OTL) for advice (if you are unsure whether a business traveller’s partner or dependents or a person accompanying a student qualify for an additional passport)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If there are still doubts, you (the OTL) must contact your local Quality Examiner Support team (QuESt) for advice.</p>

<h3>Proof of travel for business</h3>

<p>You, the examiner, must contact the organisation, client or customer and ask them why they need an additional passport.</p>

<p>Customers must send us a letter confirming why they need an additional passport. It:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>must be on headed paper, signed and recently dated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>can be from:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a senior person within their organisation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the customer’s client</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the customer themselves</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>continue examining the application without contacting the company, if you complete online checks and are satisfied the:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>company exists and support the content of the letter</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>letter is genuine</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>phone (or email) the organisation to confirm the contents of the letter, if you complete online checks and have doubts</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you contact an organisation and have fraud concerns, you must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Refer the application to your local Counter Fraud team (CFT) explaining your concerns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow their advice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Asking for the customer’s passports (or a colour copy)</h4>

<p>We need to see the customer’s passport they are renewing, so we can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>physically and electronically cancel it (unless they are <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark27">frequent ‘overlap’ travellers</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check they need an additional passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some customer’s may send their other valid passport with their application for an additional passport. If they do not, we must ask for it. We may accept a colour copy of the bio details page and all visa pages from the other passport, when both of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer explains in the letter why they need to keep their other passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer needs to keep their other passport because they are;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a business traveller or student, who travels frequently for their job or study (including those who accompany them) and the passport they are renewing holds visas or travel permits which they need for continued travel</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a frequent traveller who crosses borders between countries regularly for work, and the passport they are renewing holds visas or travel permits which they need for continued travel</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>airline staff who need to continue to travel and they <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">meet the criteria</a> to keep their existing passport</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a business traveller or student who travels frequently for work or study, who currently holds one British passport which they need to keep with them during the application process (for example, as local laws mean they cannot be in a country undocumented)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the customer has provided a satisfactory reason why they cannot send us their other valid passport, you must ask for a colour copy, if they cannot provide that either you can continue with the application without, when both of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you have satisfactorily confirmed the customer’s identity, entitlement and nationality, using our own records</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer (or their organisation) has given you a reasonable explanation why they cannot send it (for example, when it has been sent to an overseas embassy to get a visa)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Who we may consider a traveller for study purposes</h3>

<p>We are aware of situations where students (or the person accompanying them) have to frequently travel across international borders to study. We will consider an additional passport:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>as their passports will fill with stamps quickly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>so they can continue their studies without disruption</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>based on the evidence that shows why they need one</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You may accept applications from students (or a person accompanying them):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>living in Singapore and attending Marlborough College in Malaysia</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>living in Brunei and attending a school in Borneo</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attending the Raffles American school in Malaysia but travel to Singapore</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>from other countries and schools if their circumstances relating to frequent travel for study show this</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Proof of travel for study</h4>

<p>If you decide the customer (or the person accompanying them) is a traveller for study and is eligible for an additional passport, they can apply for one without sending us their old passport.</p>

<p>Customers must send us confirmation from their head teacher or head of faculty confirming why they (or the person accompanying them) need to regularly travel across borders.</p>

<h2>Other frequent traveller exceptions (overlap customers)</h2>

<p>This section tells Her Majesty’s Passport Office staff when we will issue an additional passport to someone who is a frequent traveller who would not usually be eligible for one.</p>

<p>HM Passport Office is aware some customers have to regularly travel across international borders to work and so need to keep their current passport during the renewal process. For example, this could be because they travel as part of their job.</p>

<p>These customers are not normally eligible for an additional passport. However, we may exceptionally consider issuing a second passport to overlap with their current one, so they are not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>stranded in a foreign country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stopped from working because they are without a passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Who we consider a frequent ‘overlap’ traveller</h3>

<p>We will exceptionally consider an additional passport for customers who are frequent travellers, if they meet any of the criteria below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they or their organisation used a frequent traveller exemption before and have always returned their passport to us after receiving their new one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they travel so frequently they are unable to send us their passport for renewal and confirm in writing why being without one would have a significant impact on their employment, for example, when they need to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>travel across borders frequently to get to their place of work and their passport quickly fills with entry and exit stamps</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>get visas or permits in their new passport to continue to travel and they need to travel while they renew their passport</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These customers must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>airline crew</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>working in the haulage industry (for example, lorry drivers)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>working in the food preparation, supply or distribution sector whose jobs involve preparing, supplying or delivering food to supermarkets and shops</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unable to apply for Premium or Fast Track service in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>applying for a standard renewal and none of their personal details have changed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will process their request, if they are a frequent traveller applying for an overlap passport, if either of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>their current passport is due to expire in the next 9 months</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the visa pages in their current passport are full and they need their new passport to put new visas in</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Proof of frequent travel for overlap customers</h3>

<p>If you decide the customer is a frequent traveller and is eligible for an additional passport, they can apply for one without sending us their old passport. The customer must send us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a colour copy of every page of their current British passport and all the visa pages</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a signed and recently dated letter on headed paper from their employer, prospective employer or client (if the customer is self-employed) that confirms:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the employee’s job role</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>an offer of employment has been made (of the customer is about to start work)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the customer needs their passport for their job role for identity or travel reasons</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>why they travel and how often</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>why the customer cannot use the Fast Track or Premium service in the UK (if the customer lives in the UK)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the employer’s email address and phone number</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>confirmation that the employer or client will return the passport to us within 3 months to be cancelled</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must remember that stamps in the customer’s passport will usually confirm their travel history but may not be there if they a new employee.</p>

<h4>Proof of frequent travel for airline crew</h4>

<p>HM Passport Office must accept electronic letters (email) from all airlines in support of additional passport applications.</p>

<p>Confirmation checks must be conducted on all airline letters regardless of whether they are electronic or not.</p>

<h3>Dealing with applications from overlap customers</h3>

<p>If the customer is entitled to hold an additional passport as an overlap customer, you (the examiner) must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>check the customer’s request for an additional passport is genuine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not cancel their current passport on the system when you issue their new one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send them system letter 178 to tell them to return their old passport as soon as they receive their new one, or within 3 months (unless they applied using a Local Service office)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>email an electronic copy of the letter to the Customer Service Management team (CSMT) (as they will cancel the passport at the end of the 3 month period, if it has not been returned to us)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>CSMT must cancel the customer’s passport (physically and on the system) when they receive it, or at the end of the 3 month period.</p>

<p>If the customer is applying from an overseas country with a Local Service Visa Application Centre (VAC) and they need to keep their current passport, you must email the customer (copying in the VAC) to tell them to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visit their local service (VAC) and hand over their old passport as soon as they receive their new passport, or within 3 months of getting it</li>
</ul>

<p>The VAC will physically cancel the passport and forward it to CSMT. CSMT must cancel the passport on the system when they get it.</p>

<h2>Additional passports for Her Majesty’s Government staff</h2>

<p>This section tells Her Majesty’s Passport Office staff what to consider when issuing additional passports to staff working for Her Majesty’s Government.</p>

<p>Her Majesty’s Government employees (and their dependents) who frequently travel overseas, may apply for an additional passport, using a letter from their manager or human resources team. It must be on government department headed paper.</p>

<p>You, the examiner, must deal with requests for additional standard passports using the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark18">for business travellers</a>.</p>

<h3>Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office: additional passports</h3>

<p>Staff in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) may apply for an additional passport (and sometimes more than 1 additional passport) if they frequently travel or because they travel to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark8">incompatible countries</a>.</p>

<p>The FCDO authorising officer will confirm in writing if the customer needs an additional passport. They do not need to confirm which countries the customer will visit.</p>

<p>FCDO staff can submit a Portable Document Format (PDF) letter of authorisation instead of a traditional letter but it must include an electronic signature from their line manager or human resources team.</p>

<h4>Diplomatic and Official service additional passports</h4>

<p>You must be aware that we do not consider someone holding a Diplomatic or Official passport and a standard (or personal use) passport, as having an additional passport.</p>

<p>Diplomatic or Official service staff applying for an additional standard or Diplomatic Passport must also provide authorisation to hold one from a senior member of the service.</p>

<p>If a staff member from a government department asks for 2 or more passports of any type (for example, 2 Diplomatic, Official or standard passports) they must have approval from their human resources department.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Defence and Her Majesty’s Armed Forces</h3>

<p>Staff in the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Her Majesty’s Armed Forces may have an urgent need for an additional passport or may need to hold onto their existing passport while they apply to renew it.</p>

<p>A senior staff member (warrant officer or above) in the department must support the application for an additional passport and confirm in writing why the customer needs one.</p>

<h3>Department for Transport additional passport applications</h3>

<p>There is a special arrangement between HM Passport Office and the Department for Transport (DfT) for staff who have an urgent need for an additional passport. There is no agreement to issue more than 2 additional passports to customers.</p>

<p>The DfT must support the application for an additional passport and confirm why the customer needs it.</p>

<p>You must accept applications with a DfT address, instead of a home address.</p>

<h4>DfT additional passport applications</h4>

<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>make references to the DfT in any case note or passport note held on record</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scan any supporting documents or correspondence onto the application You must type the words ‘Other Government Department concession’ as:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a case note on the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a passport note on the passport record held on Main Index</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Examining applications for additional passports</h2>

<p>This section tells Her Majesty’s Passport office examiners how to examine an application for an additional passport.</p>

<p>If a customer applies for an additional passport (with or without their current passport) you, the examiner, must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm their identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>compare the photo and personal details on their application, against our records</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Comparison must be made on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Main Index (MI)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Generic Issuance Environment (GENIE) database (if you need to) You may accept the application without a countersignatory or digital referee, if:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you can confirm the customer’s identity from our passport records</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are no fraud concerns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is no evidence the customer’s passport is damaged</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you already confirmed the customer’s nationality and identity on the system, you must not invite them to attend an interview, unless they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are applying for the first time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lost their passport multiple times</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional passports: checking the evidence</h3>

<p>The customer must send us evidence to support their application for an additional passport. In all cases, you must check the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>customers evidence is convincing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>organisation (for example, school, airline, company) supporting the application is genuine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must check the letter and the organisation supporting the application for an additional passport are genuine, by checking online to confirm they exist. For example, checking the official website to make sure the company logo and email domain names match the details on the letter.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>continue examining the application without contacting the company, if you complete online checks and are satisfied the:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>company exists and support the content of the letter</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>letter is genuine</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>phone (or email) the organisation to confirm the contents of the letter, if you complete online checks and have doubts</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you contact an organisation and have fraud concerns, you must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Refer the application to your local Counter Fraud team (CFT) explaining your concerns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow their advice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional passports: recording decisions</h3>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>add a case note the application to show the actions and decisions you made</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scan the customer’s evidence showing why they need an additional passport on to the system, so you have a permanent record of it (unless you are told not to)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional passports: checking the need</h3>

<p>You must carefully consider the reason why the customer wants an additional passport and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if it will meet their travel needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the amount of validity they need on an additional passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if they would benefit from the larger, 50 page frequent traveller passport instead</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you think a 50 page frequent traveller passport is more suitable, you must phone the customer to tell them. If the customer agrees that a frequent traveller passport is the better option, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take the correct fee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>change the application to show they want a 50 page frequent traveller passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell them they must send you their old passport so you can cancel it, before you can issue a 50 page frequent traveller passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the customer wants to continue with their application for an additional passport, you must deal with their application for it (as long as they are eligible for one, in line with this guidance).</p>

<p>You must add a case note to the application that shows all the action and decisions you made, including any decisions the customer made.</p>

<h3>Additional passports: cancelling the correct passport</h3>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take care to make sure you cancel the correct passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not cancel a passport recorded on an application for an additional passport, unless the application is to renew an existing additional passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Application Management System (AMS): cancelling the passport</h4>

<p>To make sure you do not cancel the wrong passport, you must:</p>

<p>1. Open the customer’s application to the Photo and Signature tab.</p>

<p>2. Check only 1 passport number is recorded.</p>

<p>3. Remove the tick from the Cancel Passport box on the Previous Passport Details section, if the customer is not renewing this passport (and it must remain valid).</p>

<p>4. Save the record before you move to a new screen. If you do not save the change, AMS will cancel the customer’s other passport.</p>

<p>If the customer is renewing a previous additional passport, you must leave the tick in</p>

<p>Cancel Passport box. The system will automatically cancel the passport on MI.</p>

<h4>Digital Application Processing (DAP): cancelling the passport</h4>

<p>To make sure that the system does not cancel the wrong passport, you must:</p>

<p>1. Open the customer’s application on DAP to the application details tab.</p>

<p>2. Click on the Old passport details link to the left of the screen.</p>

<p>3. Check that the old passport details in this section are the passport that requires cancelling (and not the additional passport that must remain uncancelled).</p>

<p>If you are satisfied that the old passport details are correct you may proceed. The system will automatically cancel the passport on MI.</p>

<h3>Multiple passports: updating Main Index</h3>

<p>If a customer holds more than 1 British passport (of any kind), you must manually update Main Index (MI) records with a passport note on every valid passport record the customer has, including the new passport <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark35">(unless you are told not to).</a> The note must say: ‘Also holds passport [passport number]’</p>

<p>You must do this on any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any valid standard passports (including when the customer holds multiple British nationalities)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any valid Diplomatic or Official passports</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the passport you just issued</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to add a passport note to an additional passport</h4>

<p>Our supplier’s will add the new passport number and customer’s details to MI, when they print and quality check the new passport. It may take up to 48 hours for it to happen. This means there:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>may be a 2 day delay before we can add a passport note to MI</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is a risk that we have incomplete records because we could not link the customer’s passports (which may cause problems for them in the future).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Adding a passport note: AMS examination</h5>

<p>To stop this risk you, the AMS examiner, must:</p>

<p>1. Pass the application for issue.</p>

<p>2. Keep the application form in your team’s storage area (pigeonhole) and make a manual note to check it after 2 working days (to allow enough time for our suppliers to print the passport).</p>

<p>3. Check the system after the 2 days, to find the new passport number.</p>

<p>4. Add a passport note to all the customer’s valid passport records on MI to say the customer also holds this passport number.</p>

<p>5. Check the passport note correctly shows on MI. Adding a passport note: DAP examination To stop this risk you, the DAP examiner, must:</p>

<p>1. Complete the assigned task</p>

<p>2. Make a record of the application and passport details on the central spreadsheet and ensure that this is checked after 2 working days (to allow enough time for our suppliers to print the passport).</p>

<p>3. Check the Main Index (MI) after the 2 days, to find the new passport number.</p>

<p>4. Add a passport note to all the customer’s valid passport records on MI to say the customer also holds this passport number.</p>

<p>5. Check the passport note correctly shows on MI.</p>
