<h4>Latest updates to this page</h4>

<p>14 May: amended Section 1 to read “Advice offered here relates to laboratory procedures conducted in clinical diagnostic laboratories”; amended the note on urine testing in section 5.2</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Scope</h2>

<p>Pathogenic potential and transmission risks for the novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus-2<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> (<abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>), and the associated disease it causes, <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, is still being understood. This interim guidance is based on current knowledge of the virus and other coronaviruses. It aims to minimise risks for laboratory staff handling specimens from patients with possible or laboratory-confirmed <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>This interim guidance is specific to clinical diagnostic laboratory practice in England and may differ from guidance produced by agencies in other countries, including recommendations about containment levels and control measures. Advice offered here relates to laboratory procedures conducted in clinical diagnostic laboratories. It does not cover virus isolation, propagation, research work, or work involving animals infected with <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>. Furthermore, local risk-assessments are required with regard to aerosol generation and containment, as described below.</p>

<p>This PHE guidance has been produced in collaboration with the Health and Safety Executive and will be updated when new information becomes available.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Background</h2>

<p>The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (<abbr title="Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens">ACDP</abbr>) met in early 2020 to discuss the proposed Hazard Group (HG) for <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>. Whilst this is a novel coronavirus it is anticipated that the existing safe systems of work for similar <abbr title="hazard group 3">HG3</abbr> coronaviruses can be used to effectively manage the risks of <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>. Based on the current information, the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens">ACDP</abbr> committee agreed on a provisional classification of <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> as a <abbr title="hazard group 3">HG3</abbr> pathogen.</p>

<p>There is currently limited published or PHE data on the infectivity of human specimens with <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>. It is known that the detection of <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> in respiratory tract samples is highest around the time of symptom onset and gradually declines over time. A case report suggests that <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> may be detected up to 7 weeks<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>, however virus isolation has been successful only up to 8 days following symptom onset<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> can also be detected in other sample types, including blood, faeces, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (<abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:6">[footnote 6]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. The detection of virus in faecal samples has been reported for several weeks (range 5 to 47 days from onset of symptoms), and there is minimal data on virus isolation (2 of 8 patients). In contrast to SARS, viraemia has been identified in only a small proportion of patient samples, approx. 5% of samples tested. For urine samples, <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> may rarely be detected in urine samples, and there are no data regarding the attempted detection by viral isolation. Human tissue specimens may also pose an infection risk, based on information obtained from studies of infected animals.</p>

<p>It is clear that there is human-to-human transmission of <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection (<abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>), and an assumed potential zoonotic source. Infection with <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> occurs by inhalation of aerosolised virus or by contact with droplets and contaminated fomites. Exposure to upper and lower respiratory tract specimens in the absence of appropriate containment and control measures is likely to represent the greatest risk of <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> laboratory acquired infection.</p>

<p>To date, laboratory-acquired infection has not been reported for <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>. Laboratory-acquired infections with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (<abbr title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus">SARS-CoV</abbr>) have been reported previously but only in laboratories performing virus propagation. It is possible that laboratory workers could become infected if appropriate precautions are not taken when handling biological samples from patients with <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>. Since a patient with suspected <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> may present to any healthcare facility, it is important that all clinical diagnostic laboratories take appropriate measures to contain potentially infectious materials and prevent secondary infections and onward transmission.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Risk assessment</h2>

<p>Clinical staff should notify laboratory staff when specimens are submitted from a patient with suspected or confirmed <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, through proper completion of request forms or electronic test ordering systems, and by direct communication with the laboratory.</p>

<p>It is possible that clinicians may not have considered <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> as a potential diagnosis prior to sending specimens to the laboratory. Good laboratory practice, including the use of standard biological safety precautions, regular training of staff, and the use of standard operating procedures, will help minimise potential risks.</p>

<p>Clinical laboratories must perform their own risk assessments for handling biological specimens from patients with suspected or confirmed <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>Near-patient testing (also known as point-of-care tests) for suspected and confirmed <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> cases, including blood gas analysis, must be avoided unless a local risk assessment has been completed and shows that it can be undertaken safely. Near-patient tests for viral nucleic acid amplification vary widely in their general safety and where aerosols or droplets may be generated. If a local risk assessment can show that any aerosol or droplet generation occurs within a closed analyser, and external surfaces can be cleaned with detergent-based disinfectant, then these tests may be used.</p>

<p>A suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks when handling samples potentially containing <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> must be undertaken prior to the work starting. Samples for confirmation of known or presumptive positives must be processed at full containment level (<abbr title="containment level 3">CL3</abbr>). See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section5">section 5</a> for additional guidance on aspects of sample processing that may not need full <abbr title="containment level 3">CL3</abbr> containment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Personal protective equipment</h2>

<p>Laboratory staff must wear personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) when conducting work in the laboratory. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be removed on leaving the laboratory and hygiene practices including hand washing must be rigorously maintained.</p>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must include disposable gloves and a laboratory coat or gown as a minimum, and may also include eye protection and other equipment, as identified by risk assessment. Respiratory protective equipment such as masks or respirators are not necessary when respiratory tract, urine, faecal or tissue samples are handled inside a microbiological safety cabinet (<abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Masks or respirators are not an appropriate substitute for processing samples in an <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr> when there is a risk of aerosols being generated.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>A risk-based approach to sample processing</h2>

<p>Under normal circumstances, any procedure with <abbr title="hazard group 3">HG3</abbr> pathogens involving potentially infectious material where there is a risk of generating aerosols, droplets or splashes, must be performed within a <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr> at <abbr title="containment level 3">CL3</abbr> as defined in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l5.htm" class="govuk-link">Approved Code of Practice and Guidance for the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (<abbr title="Control of Substances Hazardous to Health">COSHH</abbr>) Regulations 2002</a> (as amended).</p>

<p>However, in light of the exceptional circumstances posed by <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> and the potential impact on the diagnostic sector, a risk-based proportionate approach has been adopted in agreement with <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens">ACDP</abbr> and <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> where  certain laboratory activities can be undertaken within a <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr> at containment level 2 (<abbr title="containment level 2">CL2</abbr>). These are described in <a href="#msccl2" class="govuk-link">5.2 below</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Work that may be conducted at <abbr title="containment level 2">CL2</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Routine laboratory blood tests can be carried out in auto-analysers using standard practices and procedures at <abbr title="containment level 2">CL2</abbr>, but only after a suitable and sufficient risk assessment has been conducted which considers the potential for the generation of infectious aerosols. Auto-analysers should be disinfected following local procedures after sample processing and before scheduled maintenance in accordance with manufacturers recommendations.</p>

<p>Some auto-analyser protocols for routine laboratory tests may require specimen tubes to be opened first, or initial processing of the sample to be performed. Evidence suggests that capping and uncapping of samples is not a high-risk aerosol generating procedure which is dependent on the cap and tube design. These factors must be considered in a suitable and sufficient risk assessment which also considers if the sample needs to be centrifuged, vortexed or pipetted manually. The risk assessment must include consideration of whether a <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr> needs to be used.</p>

<p>The following work may also be conducted at <abbr title="containment level 2">CL2</abbr> following standard laboratory precautions, where this is consistent with the terms of the local risk assessment for those activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>diagnostic assays using whole blood, serum and plasma, including routine biochemistry and haematology, unless there is a risk of generating aerosols</li>
  <li>assays using virus-inactivated specimens, including molecular testing of inactivated specimens</li>
  <li>examination of bacterial or fungal cultures</li>
  <li>staining and microscopy of heat-fixed or chemically-fixed smears</li>
  <li>centrifugation of routine blood samples. However, where there is infectious potential, samples must be centrifuged using sealed centrifuge rotors or sample cups which are loaded and unloaded in a <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Work that should be conducted within a <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr> at <abbr title="containment level 2">CL2</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Following completion of a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, the following work with samples potentially containing <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> may be conducted in a <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr> at <abbr title="containment level 2">CL2</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>preparation of specimens for molecular testing (for example respiratory virus <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) prior to sample inactivation</li>
  <li>division, aliquoting, or diluting of respiratory tract specimens, faecal specimens, urine specimens, and tissue 
 specimens in which virus has not been inactivated<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>inoculation of bacterial or fungal culture media from high risk patients</li>
  <li>urine antigen testing (such as for detection of Legionella pneumophila or Streptococcus pneumoniae)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> if the above is not possible (for example, testing instrument does not fit inside the <abbr title="containment level 2">CL2</abbr> cabinet), undertake a local risk assessment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>rapid antigen tests of respiratory tract specimens</li>
  <li>processing of any non-inactivated specimen that might result in the generation of aerosols</li>
  <li>preparation and fixing (chemical or heat) of smears for microscopy</li>
  <li>haematological or immunological work</li>
  <li>rapid diagnostic tests for malaria parasites</li>
</ul>

<p>Where risk assessment has identified that work should be conducted within an <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr> at <abbr title="containment level 2">CL2</abbr> the following still applies to work activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only fully trained and competent staff must undertake the work; in addition to this the level of training provided should be appropriate to the level of risk and the complexity of the procedures being undertaken</li>
  <li>inactivation methods must be in place before removal of sample from <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr>; these methods must be validated to ensure effectiveness of the method (for example through use of a surrogate marker)</li>
  <li>effective emergency procedures, including methods for dealing with spillage, are in place</li>
  <li>waste routes for samples are appropriate for <abbr title="hazard group 3">HG3</abbr> samples (see <a href="#section9" class="govuk-link">section 9</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Work to be conducted at <abbr title="containment level 3">CL3</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The following work must be conducted at <abbr title="containment level 3">CL3</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any propagation, culturing or deliberate work on <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> for diagnostic or research purposes</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Centrifugation</h2>

<p>Centrifugation of specimens with infectious potential must be performed using sealed centrifuge rotors or sample cups which are loaded and unloaded in a <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Movement of samples within the laboratory</h2>

<p>External surfaces of specimen containers and vials must be decontaminated using a disinfectant with proven activity against enveloped viruses, prior to their removal from the <abbr title="microbiological safety cabinet">MSC</abbr> in <abbr title="containment level 3">CL3</abbr>. Take care to avoid accidental contamination of the exterior surfaces of all vessels and containers, regardless of containment level.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Packaging and transport of samples</h2>

<p>Final packaging of potentially infectious specimens (for example, to send to a reference laboratory) may be performed at <abbr title="containment level 2">CL2</abbr> if the specimens are already contained within a sealed and decontaminated primary container. 
Cultured samples for research or calibration must be transported in accordance with Category A transportation regulations. All potentially infectious samples must be transported in accordance with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/packaging-and-transport-requirements-for-patient-samples-un3373" class="govuk-link">Category B transportation regulations (UN3373).</a></p>

<p>Public Health England (PHE) follows the <a href="https://www.who.int/ihr/publications/WHO-WHE-CPI-2019.20/en/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on regulations for the transport of infectious substances 2019 to 2020</a>, published by the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>Transport using same day delivery courier is recommended for all sample types, except for cultured samples for research or calibration which must be transported by an approved Category A carrier.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Cleaning and handling of waste</h2>

<p>Irrespective of the containment level, work surfaces and equipment must be decontaminated after specimens have been processed. Pay attention to all surfaces that may have come into contact with specimens or specimen containers.</p>

<p>Use a disinfectant solution or disinfectant wipe with proven activity against enveloped <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> viruses, in accordance with local policies and following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>Dispose of clinical waste according to local and national policies appropriate to the categorisation of the waste. Waste from auto-analysers is unlikely to pose a significant risk due to the low sample volume and dilution steps, therefore special waste disposal precautions are not recommended for auto-analyser waste.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Emergency procedures</h2>

<p>Emergency procedures must be reviewed according to the results of risk assessments. Fumigation of laboratory spaces will not be possible where samples are spilt outside of <abbr title="containment level 3">CL3</abbr>, therefore consideration must be given to what to do in the event of a spillage, and how effective decontamination of the area will be completed. Staff must be trained on updated emergency procedures.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Maintaining service delivery</h2>

<p>It is recommended that urgent and essential clinical diagnostic tests are not postponed pending the results of <abbr title="SARS coronavirus-2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> (<abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>) testing, provided this is consistent with the local risk assessment for the planned work and that appropriate containment measures are in place.</p>

      <p>Inactivation refers to recognised processes that inactivate viral particles and render the virus replication incompetent, for example, addition of nucleic acid extraction buffer containing guanidinium thiocyanate. The minimum requirement would be the use of an extraction buffer containing guanidinium thiocyanate. Heat inactivation may also be used in addition to this step, but this method would still require validation.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:8" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
