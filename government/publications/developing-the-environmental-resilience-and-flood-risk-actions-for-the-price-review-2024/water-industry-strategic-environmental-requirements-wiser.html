<h2>Section 1: <abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Understanding <abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-policy-statement-to-ofwat-incorporating-social-and-environmental-guidance">strategic policy statement</a> states that the Environment Agency and Natural England will set out the expectations of water companies’ overall environmental performance through the <abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr> is written by the Environment Agency and Natural England. It provides the strategic steer to water companies on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improving the environment</li>
  <li>resilience for the environment and customers</li>
  <li>flood risk</li>
  <li>relevant legal requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>It is designed to help water companies understand their environmental obligations and the regulators’ expectations of them.</p>

<p>Water management within the water sector is governed by 4 statutory planning frameworks. These are the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>river basin management plans</li>
  <li>water resource management plans</li>
  <li>drainage and wastewater management plans</li>
  <li>flood risk management plans</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr> requires water companies to take all these planning frameworks into consideration as well as considering the water industry national environment programme (<abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> gives information to water companies on the actions they need to take to meet their environmental legislative requirements and related government priorities (as set out in <abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr> explains the statutory obligations on water companies and the regulators expectations of water companies. Water companies should embed the statutory obligations and regulator’s expectations in the outcomes, performance commitments and investment decisions which underpin their business plans.</p>

<p>However, these are the minimum requirements. Water companies are expected to go beyond the minimum where there is environmental benefit in doing so, and where water companies have good customer support.</p>

<h3>Audience</h3>

<p><abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr> has been produced for water only undertakers, water and sewerage undertakers, and new appointments and variations to use. They are referred to collectively throughout this document as water companies.</p>

<p><abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr> applies only to English water companies operating wholly or mainly in England.</p>

<p><abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr> should be read alongside:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-policy-statement-to-ofwat-incorporating-social-and-environmental-guidance">strategic policy statement</a>

<h3>The challenge</h3>

<p>Over the past 12 years there has been no significant improvement in the overall ecological status of England’s waters. Only 16% of English water bodies are at good ecological status. Water companies have an important role to play in contributing to achieving the Government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan">25 Year Environment Plan</a> ambition for ‘clean and plentiful water’ and to improve at least three quarters of waters to be close to their natural state as soon as is practicable.</p>

<p>The challenges our planet faces because of climate change and biodiversity loss mean we must transform the way we treat the environment. Protecting and restoring the water environment can help address many of the challenges we face including climate change. The climate is now more extreme, resulting in an increase of unpredictable and intense rainfall and more frequent periods of prolonged drought. The UK population is expected to grow by another 6 million by 2043, putting further pressure on the environment and water.</p>

<p>People want more from the environment, including the opportunity to swim outdoors and spend more time near their local river. Therefore, going beyond damage limitation and creating a water environment that benefits people as well as nature is important.</p>

<p>Water companies have a crucial role to help realise this ambition. In the past 30 years water companies have made good progress in enhancing bathing and river water quality, but pressures are increasing, and more action is needed. Without change, rivers could have up to 80% less water in summer by 2050, and it will not be possible to meet the growing demands of people, industry, and agriculture.</p>

<h3>Government priorities for <abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Protecting and enhancing our nation’s water environment is a priority for the government. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-policy-statement-to-ofwat-incorporating-social-and-environmental-guidance">strategic policy statement</a> sets out the government’s environmental priorities for <abbr title="Water Services Regulation Authority">Ofwat</abbr>’s regulation of the water sector in England.</p>

<p>The water industry needs to prioritise appropriate action to enhance water quality and deliver a resilient and sustainable water supply.</p>

<p>The government’s key priorities for water companies are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>significantly reduce the frequency and volume of sewage discharges from storm overflows, so they operate infrequently, and only in cases of unusually heavy rainfall</li>
  <li>achieve zero serious pollution incidents, and significantly reduce all pollution incidents</li>
  <li>reduce nutrient pollution from wastewater treatment works</li>
  <li>maintain, restore, and enhance protected sites and priority habitats such as chalk streams</li>
</ul>

<h3>Environmental ambitions and targets</h3>

<p>The 25 Year Environment Plan sets out the government’s ambition to improve the environment and people’s connection to it within a generation. Water companies have a leading role to achieve the 25 Year Environment Plan goals. This includes helping to improve at least three quarters of our waters to be close to their natural state as soon as is practicable.</p>

<p>The Environment Act 2021 will help ensure the environmental protections are maintained and improved now the UK has left the European Union. The Act sets out environmental principles and introduces measures to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve air and water quality,</li>
  <li>tackle plastic pollution</li>
  <li>restore habitats so plants and wildlife can thrive.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Act 2021 requires legally binding long-term environmental targets in 4 priority areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>air quality</li>
  <li>water</li>
  <li>biodiversity</li>
  <li>resource efficiency and waste reduction</li>
</ul>

<p>Water companies must take action to meet the targets under the Act.</p>

<p>The Environment Act introduces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new place-based spatial planning framework</li>
  <li>Local Nature Recovery Strategies</li>
  <li>new biodiversity duties for water companies</li>
</ul>

<p>It also makes the requirement for drainage and sewerage management plans statutory.</p>

<p>Supporting the government’s vision for water and biodiversity and the need for more resilient infrastructure alongside economic growth are:</p>

</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conservation-21-natural-englands-conservation-strategy-for-the-21st-century">Conservation 21, Natural England’s Conservation Strategy for the 21st Century</a></li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-strategy-for-england--2">National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England</a> seeking to better manage the risks and consequences of flooding, including flooding from rivers, sewers, and reservoirs.</li>
</ul>

<p>How water companies approach delivering enhancements is important. Water companies need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider a longer-term approach and vision</li>
  <li>demonstrate that they have chosen the best value options, taking natural capital into account</li>
  <li>make data and evidence open and available to all, where appropriate, to demonstrate the integrity of water and sewerage company operations</li>
  <li>be accountable for the design and development of their programmes of work and the resulting outcomes</li>
  <li>support customers to make decisions and change behaviours to reduce unnecessary water use and sewerage abuse</li>
  <li>plan over the longer term (to 25 years) to address complex environmental issues and account for a range of future climate change scenarios and other pressures</li>
  <li>work with others whose activities impact on the water environment to support them with improving water quality and water resource availability</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr> expectations</h3>

<p>Water companies must meet statutory and non-statutory expectations. These expectations are best achieved by focussing on long-term outcomes and service improvements benefiting customers and the environment.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr> expectations are organised around the Environment Agency’s and Natural England’s vision for the water industry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a thriving natural environment – increased environmental value, healthy rivers, lakes, wetlands, coastal waters, and a sustainably functioning eco-system</li>
  <li>performance and compliance – day to day service excellence for customers and acts in the long-term interests of society and the environment</li>
  <li>resilience for the environment and customers – resilient, safe, and affordable water and waste water services today and for future generations</li>
</ul>

<p>The expectations are grouped by the main legislative drivers and current regulatory priorities. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/developing-the-environmental-resilience-and-flood-risk-actions-for-the-price-review-2024/water-industry-strategic-environmental-requirements-wiser-technical-document"><abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr> technical document</a> explains the expectations in more detail.</p>

<p>Many of the expectations set out in this document extend beyond the water industry; other sectors also need to play their part by working with water companies.</p>

<p>Water companies will need to consider these expectations in the context of climate change, by understanding its impact and planning for the longer term across all parts of their business for a range of future climate change scenarios. Actions should preferably be carried out in a low carbon way taking opportunities to maximise carbon sequestration and storage, for instance through supporting recovery of key habitats and tree planting. Opportunities should be taken to restore natural form and function of natural assets to ensure resilience to future climate impacts.</p>

<h3>Definition of expectations</h3>

<p><abbr title="price review 2024">PR24</abbr> expectations of water companies include statutory and non-statutory requirements. Expectations are categorised as either statutory (<abbr title="statutory">S</abbr>), statutory plus (<abbr title="statutory plus">S+</abbr>) or non-statutory (<abbr title="non-statutory">NS</abbr>) in line with the following definitions.</p>

<h4>Statutory obligations (<abbr title="statutory">S</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Statutory obligations arise from legislative requirements and the need to comply with obligations imposed directly by statute or by permits, licences and authorisations granted by the Secretary of State, the Environment Agency or other body of competent jurisdiction. Other statutory obligations include ministerial directions and meeting specific planning requirements. While it is important to understand the costs and benefits of measures needed, these statutory obligations must still be achieved.</p>

<h4>Statutory plus obligations (<abbr title="statutory plus">S+</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Statutory plus obligations are categorised as legal requirements where economic evidence forms part of the decision-making process, that is the balance of costs and benefits, and affordability considerations. In cases where action is considered disproportionately expensive to meet statutory plus obligations, alternative objectives, or timescales to meet them may be set.</p>

<h4>Non-statutory requirements (<abbr title="non-statutory">NS</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Some expectations are not driven by statutory requirements. There may be a public need which may not be underpinned by a specific Act or piece of legislation. Water companies should demonstrate that there is an environmental requirement and customer support and that such investments provide best value for customers over the long term. Effective customer engagement should reveal whether customers (and which types of customers) want to see further environmental improvements, and over what timescale.</p>

<p>These expectations apply to the land that water companies own, the catchments in which they operate and the areas in which they exercise their functions. Whether an expectation is <abbr title="statutory">S</abbr>, <abbr title="statutory plus">S+</abbr> or <abbr title="non-statutory">NS</abbr> water companies should show that there is an environmental requirement and that they have customer support. They must also show that such investments provide the best value for customers over the long term.</p>

<p>In line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-policy-statement-to-ofwat-incorporating-social-and-environmental-guidance">strategic policy statement</a> water companies will need to clearly demonstrate in their business plans how they will meet the expectation and ambition set out in <abbr title="water industry strategic environmental requirements">WISER</abbr>.</p>

<p>Some expectations are not currently statutory but will become statutory in the future through Ministerial directions for example storm overflow targets and drainage and wastewater management plans.</p>

<h3>Legal obligations</h3>

<p>Water companies must address any damage arising from their activities, and are expected to protect, restore, and enhance the environment.</p>

<p>Each water company is required to set out the services and improvements it intends to provide to meet these legal obligations in their 5-yearly business plans. These will relate to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing their impact on the environment</li>
  <li>ensuring environmental compliance</li>
  <li>improving resilience of their assets to climate change</li>
  <li>securing the reliability of water supplies to their customers</li>
</ul>

<p>Water companies should establish internal assurance to identify legal requirements and how to meet them.</p>

<p>Water companies should be aware that further changes to the policy landscape are expected, as well as future changes to environmental targets. They should also be clear that this document does not reference all water company related legal obligations, government targets and statutory requirements. Even when not specifically referenced in this document, water companies are legally bound to abide by them.</p>

  <li>ensure agreed and up to date plans are in place to manage a drought and minimise environmental impacts (<abbr title="statutory">S</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 2: Expected approach and practice</h2>

<p>This section sets out the approaches the regulators expect water companies to take.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency and Natural England recognise that many of the approaches require other sectors to play their part. However, it is essential water companies demonstrate leadership by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>valuing the environment by considering the social and economic value of the water environment, using it to inform decision making, and secure wider benefits for communities and society</li>
  <li>embracing innovation by seeking opportunities to improve the environment through better industry practices, better urban design, and better land management</li>
  <li>building stronger and more collaborative catchment and flood partnerships to maximise and integrate benefits and evolve solutions work with others to allow catchments to function more naturally, wildlife to thrive and to build resilience to future climate impacts</li>
</ul>

<p>Water companies should use new and innovative approaches wherever possible to achieve wider environmental outcomes and provide best value to customers. Exploring solutions which achieve multiple benefits for the environment are encouraged even where the risks are uncertain. However, water companies must understand and control the risks and the risks must be proportionate to the potential benefits. Water companies should share their learning from these approaches across the sector.</p>

<p>Water management needs to be both nationally strategic, operating within the legal and government’s policy framework, and locally owned through place-based partnerships. Planning at a catchment scale to identify improvements that restore the natural ecosystem ensures resilient biodiversity and wider ecosystem benefits.</p>

<p>Water companies should seek partnership opportunities to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>achieve their business plan outcomes</li>
  <li>improve efficiency</li>
  <li>enable more sustainable, resilient options</li>
</ul>

<p>Water companies should work with other local plan makers and authorities to align ambition, programmes, funding, and action in a catchment. This is to make sure there is adequate water for growth, development, and the environment in a changing climate. Working with other place-based partnerships (for example, local nature partnerships, local enterprise partnerships, and coastal partnerships) and engaging with local nature recovery strategies will support a nature recovery network as highlighted in the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan">25 Year Environment Plan</a>.</p>

<p>Developing a shared vision and understanding with catchment partners will help water companies optimise their investments and gain support from local communities and businesses who benefit from a healthy water environment and enhanced landscapes.</p>

<p>Good examples of partnerships include the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://wre.org.uk/projects/norfolk-water-strategy-programme/" rel="external">Norfolk Water Fund project</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://naturalcourse.co.uk/" rel="external">Natural Course</a>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://catchmentbasedapproach.org/learn/eden-integrated-catchment/" rel="external">Eden Integrated Catchment project</a> in Cumbria, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://catchmentbasedapproach.org/learn/wyre-natural-flood-management-project/" rel="external">Wyre natural flood management partnership</a> in Lancashire, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.somersetcatchmentmarket.org.uk/" rel="external">catchment markets in Somerset</a>.</p>

<p>Further information can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://catchmentbasedapproach.org/" rel="external">Catchment Based Approach</a> website as well as information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://catchmentbasedapproach.org/get-involved/" rel="external">local catchment partnerships</a>.</p>

<h3>Green finance</h3>

<p>Government is driving the greening of the finance sector. The government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-finance-strategy">Green Finance Strategy</a> sets out a comprehensive approach to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>greening financial systems</li>
  <li>mobilising finance for clean and resilient growth</li>
  <li>capturing the resulting opportunities for UK firms</li>
</ul>

<p>A UK green finance taxonomy will define which economic activities count as environmentally sustainable. Making Climate Risk Financial Disclosure mandatory will drive companies to further de-risk their business and make them more attractive to future investors. These changes present a new financial environment.</p>

<p>Water companies should adopt, promote, and encourage green finance use to help grow the UK market, green their supply chains and set a green framework for the network of stakeholders that help achieve and support water company outcomes.</p>

<p>There are already a number of trial financial innovation schemes in place, for example, catchment trading, payments for nature-based solutions and resilience financing. The aim in this price review period is to move these from stand-alone projects to mainstream and national scale programmes. The expectation is that these will become mainstream and wide-scale practices ahead of PR29.</p>

<h3>Helping people connect with the water environment</h3>

<p>Water companies have an opportunity to engage with the public and help them develop a closer bond with nature. Helping people connect with where their water comes from will be a crucial part of nature’s recovery. Enabling the public to become an active part of the solution lies in positive, and empowering communication, engagement, and access.</p>

<p>A growing weight of evidence shows that freshwater, coastal and marine places (flowing and standing waters) are particularly beneficial for well-being. Around half of people in England visit blue spaces at least once a month and say they gain psychological benefits and report feeling happier near them.</p>

<p>Our blue spaces are highly valued and visited by the public. The proportion of adults in England taking visits to rivers, lakes or canals between April 2020 and January 2021 was 26%, peaking in September 2020 with 32% of adults reporting visits (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/the-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-data-and-publications-from-adults-survey-year-1-april-2020-march-2021-official-statistics">People and nature survey for England</a>). It was a similar picture with visits to the coast. At the same time, it is clear there are huge inequalities in terms of access to land and blue spaces across the country and across different groups in the population.</p>

<p>Water companies can help achieve a significant change in improving access to the outdoors for all to improve public health, support children and young people and contribute to nature recovery and net zero. Water companies are ideally placed to provide people with access to their land and blue spaces.</p>

<h3>Natural capital and environmental valuation</h3>

<p>A natural capital approach is about thinking of nature as an asset, or set of assets, that benefit people. Water companies should adopt a natural capital approach to inform their planning and long-term investment decisions.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> has produced guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/enabling-a-natural-capital-approach-enca">enabling a natural capital approach</a> which covers natural capital accounting, economic valuation of the environment, and applying natural capital accounting at the local level.</p>

<p>Natural England has produced a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/4658498148499456" rel="external">Natural Capital Evidence Handbook</a> setting out how natural capital evidence can be used in place-based strategic planning. This may provide helpful evidence for developing water company business plans.</p>

<p>A natural capital asset and ecosystem service register will enable water companies to value the environment benefits assets provide through a natural capital account. This information can be presented together in an extended natural capital account, for example <a class="govuk-link" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/4535403835293696" rel="external">Natural England’s Natural Capital Account for National Nature Reserves</a>.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency has produced a Natural Capital Register and Account Tool (<abbr title="Natural Capital Register and Account Tool">NCRAT</abbr>) which water companies could use to create a natural capital register and account using open-source data. Water companies can request the latest version of the <abbr title="Natural Capital Register and Account Tool">NCRAT</abbr> and supporting information (user guide, technical report and natural capital scorecard) from the Environment Agency’s natural capital team:</p>

<p>email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:naturalcapital@environment-agency.gov.uk">naturalcapital@environment-agency.gov.uk</a></p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/6742480364240896" rel="external">Natural capital indicators</a> identify key components of the environment essential for the long-term provision of benefits on which society relies. Using indicators will make sure water companies report on key attributes of the environment important for ecosystem function and ultimately providing benefits to people. The indicators are designed to enable reporting on aspects which can be changed by management in future, providing a baseline upon which to measure progress.</p>

<p>The environmental valuation techniques used should be clear, proportionate, and based on multiple evidence sources. They should include qualitative and quantitative information and monetary assessment, where possible. For example, in their natural capital account companies could use quantitative evidence of customer valuations, supported by qualitative evidence on customer priorities, needs, requirements and behaviours. They could also assess the impacts of business plans on social values.</p>

<p>The economic values of environmental impacts are usually partial estimates as only some economic aspects can be valued. Valuing biodiversity is recognised as a particularly difficult area; consider taking an ecosystem approach as described under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cbd.int/ecosystem/principles.shtml" rel="external">Convention on Biological Diversity</a>, and integrating the concept of natural capital within water company planning and decision making.</p>

<p>Using valuation techniques to measure the costs and benefits to society of the environment informs better decision making and supports actions that increase the resilience of our natural assets for the benefit of people and wildlife, now and in the future.</p>

<p>Water companies can carry out surveys to draw out people’s preferences for changes in the environment. These can be used in benefit valuation work if appropriate. Questions directly linked to well-described environmental changes will help to estimate people’s preferences and the economic value they place on changes to the environment.</p>

<h3>Using sustainable drainage systems</h3>

<p>Well-designed multifunctional sustainable drainage systems deliver a wide range of water quantity, water quality, flood risk, amenity, and biodiversity benefits. Run-off attenuation, storage and infiltration can help relieve pressure on water company assets. Other opportunities include using planting and wetland areas to avoid the embedded carbon of a traditional ‘piped’ system. Overall, there is huge potential for sustainable drainage systems to contribute to achieving the biodiversity net gain mandate brought forward in the Environment Act 2021.</p>

<p>Water companies should take account of the developing knowledge and approach to sustainable drainage systems including the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.defra.gov.uk/water-industry/storm-overflows-discharge-reduction-plan/" rel="external">consultation on the Government’s Storm Overflow Discharge Reduction Plan</a>. The consultation includes a review of the case for the implementation of Schedule 3 to the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 which, if implemented, will introduce standards for new sustainable drainage systems.</p>

<h3>Technology and smart networks</h3>

<p>Embracing technology and developing smart networks is essential to drive process efficiency and to achieve carbon reductions. Employing smart technology to inform drainage and wastewater planning and water resource planning will enable companies to develop targeted solutions. These will achieve more effective environmental outcomes, better customer service and long-term efficiencies. It will also help achieve carbon reductions.</p>

<p>Water companies are already using machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts to drive process improvements which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helps reduce the number of pollution incidents</li>
  <li>enables targeted nature-based solutions</li>
  <li>provides early leak detection</li>
  <li>enhances energy efficiency</li>
  <li>optimises processes and efficient integrated water management</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency and Natural England encourage all companies to follow suit.</p>

<h3>Working with nature-based solutions and catchment scale thinking</h3>

<p>Catchment and nature-based solutions can help restore biodiversity and provide benefits to water companies and their customers through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved water retention</li>
  <li>flood regulation</li>
  <li>water quality</li>
  <li>helping catchments adapt to climate change</li>
</ul>

<p>They can offer more cost-effective and sustainable solutions over more traditional engineered options.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency and Natural England expect water companies to consider using catchment and nature-based solutions more broadly, wherever they can achieve whole or part of the environmental outcome. Proposed solutions should have a plausible mechanism for achieving the required solution, biodiversity gains and improvements to ecosystem integrity.  The longer planning timeframe of 25 years enables the delivery of options which require a longer lead-time such as catchment and nature-based solutions.</p>

<p>Nature-based solutions are defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as “actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human wellbeing and biodiversity benefits”.</p>

<p>Catchment and nature-based solutions can cover a wide range of different approaches and techniques including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>peatland restoration</li>
  <li>tree planting</li>
  <li>river restoration</li>
  <li>floodplain reconnection</li>
  <li>wetland creation</li>
</ul>

<p>Underpinning many catchment and nature-based solutions is an understanding of natural processes and the physical pressures across a catchment. A greater understanding of the operation of natural processes can be a first step in planning and informing the optimal locations and type of approaches to work with nature. To help manage landscape change it is important to consider the right feature in the right place within the landscape. Different nature-based approaches will be appropriate in different situations, but those that restore natural processes, rivers and their floodplains can often offer the most sustainable solutions and widest benefits.</p>

<p>Not all water companies will be able to use all types of catchment and nature-based solutions as qualifying criteria apply for some of them, for example in relation to catchment nutrient balancing. Advice to support development of well-designed catchment and nature-based solutions is provided in the <abbr title="water industry national environment programme">WINEP</abbr> options development guidance.</p>
