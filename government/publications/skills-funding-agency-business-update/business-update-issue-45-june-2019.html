<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Small and medium employers needed to help develop the apprenticeship service</h2>

<p>ESFA has opened an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/esfa-calls-on-small-and-medium-sized-apprenticeship-employers-and-supporting-training-providers-to-help-develop-the-apprenticeship-service" class="govuk-link">Expression of Interest for small and medium-sized apprenticeship employers and supporting training providers</a> that currently have a non-levy contract to test the system functionality of the apprenticeship service for employers who do not pay the Levy.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Framing quality in the apprenticeship landscape</h2>

<p>This week the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (the Institute) published their External Quality Assurance (<abbr title="External Quality Assurance">EQA</abbr>) framework.</p>

<p>The new framework sets out how apprenticeship end-point assessment organisations (<abbr title="end-point assessment organisations">EPAOs</abbr>) will be externally quality assured, what good practice in end-point assessment looks like, and what <abbr title="External Quality Assurance">EQA</abbr> providers will look for to ensure this has happened.</p>

<p>The improved clarity to <abbr title="end-point assessment organisations">EPAOs</abbr> and <abbr title="External Quality Assurance">EQA</abbr> providers will ensure consistency with how assessments are delivered across the country.</p>

<p>To find out more visit the <a href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/about/news-events/new-framework-sets-the-standard-for-external-quality-assurance/" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="External Quality Assurance">EQA</abbr> framework</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> End-Point assessment in principle arrangements</h2>

<p>High-quality apprenticeships include an independent End-Point Assessment (EPA). These assessments check the apprentice has received quality training and supports their employer to know that they are competent in the occupation.</p>

<h3>Change to starts policy for new standards being approved</h3>

<p>From 1 October 2019, the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) will not fund apprentices to start on a new standard until an End Point Assessment Organisation (EPAO) has given an ‘in principle’ commitment to deliver the EPA.</p>

<p>You can read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-end-point-assessments-change-to-starts-policy-for-new-standards-being-approved">apprenticeship end-point assessments: change to starts policy for new standards being approved</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> National Apprenticeship Week 2020 – save the date</h2>

<p>We are thrilled to announce that the next National Apprenticeship Week will be held 3 to 7 February 2020.</p>

<p>The week provides an exciting opportunity to celebrate apprenticeships and bring the whole apprenticeship community together to showcase the positive differences that apprenticeships can make to individuals, employers and to the wider economy.</p>

<p>The earlier date allows apprenticeships to lead the careers conversation, which is particularly useful for young people deliberating their career choices at this crucial time of year.</p>
