<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Apprenticeship service update</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>New 25% apprenticeship funds transfer allowance now visible in accounts</h3>

<p>Levy-paying employers can now see their new 25% transfer allowance in their apprenticeship service accounts. The allowance has increased from 10% cent to 25%.  </p>

<p>The new allowance became visible in apprenticeship service accounts after 24 April 2019.</p>

<p>Levy-payers can transfer funds to any employer, subject to rules. These can include employers in their area, sector or supply chain, or even charities. The funds can be used to pay for apprenticeship training and assessment for new or existing employees.</p>

<p>You can find out more about making a transfer in our video, below.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sH0gDiU9NM&amp;list=PLMNvQX_aIOux3SdHgg3Iw8D8dPrVHbMY7&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s" class="govuk-link">Making a transfer</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Improved apprenticeship assessment service now live</h3>

<p>Our new digital apprenticeship assessment service, which improves the process for end-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) submitting applications to assess standards, went live this month.</p>

<p>End-point assessment organisations now have a single service to access all digital activities. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applying to assess an additional apprenticeship standard</li>
  <li>viewing a pipeline of upcoming assessments</li>
  <li>recording apprenticeship end-point assessment grades</li>
  <li>viewing completed assessments</li>
  <li>viewing the standards EPAOs are approved to assess</li>
  <li>viewing organisation details</li>
  <li>signing up to our API service</li>
</ul>

<p>Read <a href="https://sfadigital.blog.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">our blog</a> to learn more about the new service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Frameworks withdrawal</h2>

<p>On July 31 2020 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/removal-of-apprenticeship-frameworks">apprenticeship frameworks will be withdrawn</a>.This means there will be no more starts on frameworks from the 2020 to 2021 academic year onwards. All new starts will be on high-quality standards.</p>

<p>Employers have already developed over 400 standards and standards represented nearly 60 per cent of all starts reported in the first half of 2018 to 2019. This is fantastic progress towards the full transition to standards by August 2020, and we are confident that frameworks are increasingly covered by standards.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about which Apprenticeship standard is right for your business please contact the national apprenticeship service. If you cannot find a standard to meet your business need, please consult the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education website or contact them at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk">enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Maths and English in apprenticeships</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>DfE would like to hear from employers</h3>

<p>We are currently exploring the delivery of maths and English in apprenticeships as part of a DfE strategy project.</p>

<p>We would really like to talk with employers in all sectors for their views on maths and English in apprenticeships. Your views can help to shape future delivery.</p>

<p>Please drop a line to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:eve.oakley@education.gov.uk">eve.oakley@education.gov.uk</a> and we will contact you to arrange a short meeting or telephone call at a time to suit you.</p>

<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<h4>Background information on maths and English requirements in apprenticeships:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>English and maths are key elements of apprenticeships. Good numeracy and literacy is highly valuable for both the apprentice and the employer.</li>
  <li>Level 2 apprentices must achieve Level 1 maths and English (Functional Skills or GCSE qualifications grade D to G) as part of their apprenticeship, if they have not already achieved these levels. They must then continue to study and take the test for Level 2 maths and English before they complete their apprenticeship (but do not have to achieve this outcome).</li>
  <li>Level 3 apprentices (and above) must achieve Level 2 maths and English (Functional Skills or GCSE qualifications grade A* to C) as part of their apprenticeship, if they have not already achieved these levels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Reporting progress against the public sector apprenticeship target</h2>

<p>From 1 April 2019, public sector employers in scope of the target with 250 or more employees in England can report their progress for the second year through the Apprenticeship Service.</p>

<p>You can access the form by visiting the apprenticeships tab from the homepage of your Apprenticeship Service account.</p>

<p>For more information on who is in scope of the target and what you are required to report, please read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-sector-apprenticeship-target" class="govuk-link">guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Employers with queries about how to complete the Apprenticeship Service report can contact the National Contact Centre on 08000 150 600 or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk">helpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>The Apprenticeship Diversity Champions Network celebrates achievements</h2>

<p>From impacting positively on the uptake of apprenticeships in the Black Asian Minority Ethnics (BAME) community to supporting learners with learning difficulties and disabilities – including mental health – the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/apprenticeship-diversity-champions-network" class="govuk-link">Apprenticeship Diversity Champions Network (ADCN)</a> champions apprenticeships and diversity amongst employers, by encouraging more people from underrepresented groups to consider apprenticeships.</p>

<p>The ADCN is made up of over 70 committed apprentice employers, spanning in size and sector and representative of British business today and has recently celebrated its second birthday.</p>

<p>To celebrate all it has achieved, an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/apprenticeship-diversity-champions-network" class="govuk-link">addendum to the ADCN first year report has been published</a> to highlight some of the achievements from the past 12 months.</p>

<p>Employers interested in joining the Apprenticeship Diversity Champions Network, download the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/apprenticeship-diversity-champions-network" class="govuk-link">member information and application form</a>.</p>
