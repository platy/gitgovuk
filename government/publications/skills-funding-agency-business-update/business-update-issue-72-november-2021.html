<h2>Changes to reservations for apprenticeship funding from 1 November 2021</h2>

<p>From 1 November 2021, the reservation period for employers who do not pay the Apprenticeship Levy will be reduced from six months to three months. While we had previously extended the reservation window to six months, we found that very few employers needed to reserve funds more than three months ahead.</p>

<p>Employers can still plan ahead when recruiting apprentices. Employers can reserve funding three months before an apprentice’s expected start date and have a further two months after the planned reservation month to start their apprentice. As is the case now, if no commitment is made on the apprenticeship service by then, the reservation will expire.</p>

<p>Any reservations made before 1 November 2021 will not be affected.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://help.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360011550760-How-to-reserve-funding" class="govuk-link">Further information on how to reserve funding is available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>What’s new with the Apprenticeship Service</h2>

<p>In response to feedback from our users, we’ve introduced several new features to the Apprenticeship Service, to help make managing apprenticeships easier. Listed below is a summary of the recent changes.</p>

<h3>It’s easier to transfer unspent levy funds</h3>

<p>Our new service makes it simpler for levy paying employers to transfer unspent funds to support other businesses. Over £3 million has already been pledged for the 2021 to 2022 financial year. Check our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transferring-your-apprenticeship-levy-to-another-business?utm_source=businessupdate&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=summerreleases21" class="govuk-link">guidance page</a> and how to video to find out more.</p>

<h3>It’s easier to access additional apprenticeship funding</h3>

<p>You can now <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://transfers.manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk/?utm_source=businessupdate&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=summerreleases21">browse apprenticeship funding opportunities</a> and apply for a transfer of funds from another business. Check our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-a-levy-transfer-from-another-business-to-fund-an-apprenticeship?utm_source=businessupdate&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=summerreleases21">guidance page</a> and how to video to find out more.</p>

<h3>It’s easier to find apprenticeship training</h3>

<p>If you can’t find any training providers offering the apprenticeship training that’s right for your business, you can now complete a simple form to share your requirements with providers across England. Start your search with <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/?utm_source=businessupdate&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=summerreleases21" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Find apprenticeship training</a>.</p>

<h3>It’s easier to ensure apprentices’ skills meet industry standards</h3>

<p>New apprentices are now automatically assigned to the latest versions of their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/search-for-apprenticeship-standards?utm_source=businessupdate&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=summerreleases21" class="govuk-link">apprenticeship standards</a>. Existing apprentices can be moved onto the latest versions of their standards using your apprenticeship service account. The provider must approve any changes. Read our <a href="https://help.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/4407403333906-Check-your-apprentices-are-receiving-up-to-date-training?utm_source=businessupdate&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=summerreleases21" rel="external" class="govuk-link">help article</a> to find out more.</p>

<h3>It’s easier to onboard apprentices</h3>

<p>New apprentices will now receive an email invitation to create a ‘<a href="https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/apprentices/creating-a-my-apprenticeship-account?utm_source=businessupdate&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=summerreleases21" rel="external" class="govuk-link">My apprenticeship</a>’ account, where they can check their details are correct, learn more about their apprenticeship and access support. Almost 50,000 accounts have been created so far.</p>

<h3>£3000 for hiring a new apprentice</h3>

<p>You still have time to apply for a payment of £3000 for each new apprentice who has an employment start date from 1 April to 30 September 2021 and an apprenticeship start date from 1 April to 30 November 2021. Applications close 30 November 2021.</p>

<p>You will also be able to apply for apprentices with an employment start date from 1 October 2021 to 31 January 2022 once applications open from 11 January 2022.</p>

<h2>National Apprenticeship Awards – Regional Finals</h2>

<p>Regional Winners from the National Apprenticeship Awards 2021 have been announced.</p>

<p>Tuesday 19 October marked the start of the National Apprenticeship Awards 2021 regional finals, with virtual ceremonies taking place to recognise apprentice employers, apprentices, Rising Stars and Champions up and down the country.</p>

<p>Back for their 18th year, the National Apprenticeship Awards highlight the benefits apprenticeships bring to individuals, businesses, and local communities, and celebrate the successes of those that have gone above and beyond to make a difference.</p>

<p>Over 1,000 entries from apprentice employers, apprentices, and apprenticeship champions have been received this year from all over England. The breadth of industries and sectors recognised highlights the broad appeal of apprenticeships, and how employers and individuals are continuing to build business and career success through apprenticeships.</p>
