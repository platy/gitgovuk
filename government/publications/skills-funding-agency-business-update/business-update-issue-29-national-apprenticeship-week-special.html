<h3>National Apprenticeship Week 2018</h3>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>National Apprenticeship Week 2018 - #NAW2018 - takes place from 5 to 9 March 2018. The theme of the week is Apprenticeships Work to showcase how apprenticeships work for employers, individuals, local communities and the wider economy. We’ve put together a whole range of engaging resources to help you get involved with the week, visit our dedicated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.naw2018.co.uk/employers" rel="external">employer pages</a> to find out more.</p>

<h4>Apprenticeships Work</h4>

<p>87% of employers are satisfied with apprenticeships. Employers, like yourselves, tell us that apprenticeships help future-proof their business, improve their skills base, attract diverse talent, deliver improved productivity, increase employee retention and bring new ideas and ways of working into the workplace.</p>

<h4>What’s in it for you?</h4>

<p>Whatever the size of your business, the week is a fantastic opportunity to showcase your great work as a 
forward-thinking and successful apprenticeship employer. Helping to celebrate the impact of apprenticeships as part of this national movement underscores your own commitment to developing talent and unlocking opportunities - providing a boost to your own recruitment campaigns.</p>

<h4>How to get involved</h4>

<p>This is your week, whether you are a SME or a large employer a membership body or interest group - we are excited to work with you to tell the story of apprenticeships.</p>

<p>The easiest way to support the week is to do so on social media and encourage everyone you know to do the same with #NAW2018. There are 2 landmark activities during the week, with an opportunity for your involvement <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.naw2018.co.uk/worksforme">#WorksForMe</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.naw2018.co.uk/10ktalks" rel="external">#10kTalks</a>.</p>

<h4>WorksForMe</h4>

<p>Have apprenticeships widened the skills base of your organisation, improved productivity, enhanced employee retention, introduced new ideas and ways of working, or helped to diversify and future-proof your talent pipeline? Or have apprenticeships made a significant contribution to your local community?</p>

<p>Do you know an ambitious apprentice, or former apprentice, who has gained a successful career and changed their life through an apprenticeship? We want to hear about it. Tell your story on social media and share a post with #WorksForMe – we’ve put together a <a rel="external" href="https://cdn.website-editor.net/979bf9acecd0487eadcd7e3d5a36c992/files/uploaded/National%20Apprenticeship%20Week%20-%20Written%20Content%20Guide.pdf" class="govuk-link">range of resources</a> to help.</p>

<h4>10kTalks</h4>

<p>Join our 10,000 talks movement and be one of many apprentices, ex-apprentices, apprentice champions, employers, industry bodies, MPs and many more to deliver a talk on why Apprenticeships Work. Collectively, we aim to speak to 10,000 people over the course of the week about apprenticeships. We would like you to join us in delivering these talks to inspire more people to get involved with apprenticeships. Find out more and access resources to help you in the <a href="http://www.naw2018.co.uk/10ktalks" rel="external" class="govuk-link">#10kTalks section</a> of the stakeholder portal.</p>

<h4>Celebrate the Class of 2018</h4>

<p>Across the country there are apprentices doing amazing work – and we want to celebrate them! On Friday 9 March we want to celebrate all apprentices who have completed their apprenticeship in the past 12 months. We’re calling on employers to mark this occasion and share their success on social media using #NAW2018. We’ve put together some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.naw2018.co.uk/celebrate" rel="external">ideas for your celebration</a>.</p>

<h4>Events map</h4>
<p>You can also add your own event to the official <a href="https://nawevents.co.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">National Apprenticeship Week 2018 events map</a>.</p>

<h4>Get your business to the top of the news agenda</h4>

<p>Are you planning to make a big media splash during National Apprenticeship Week? We want to hear from you. We are working with a number of organisations and employers on PR plans for the week. With a central planning grid, we can ensure that together we keep apprenticeships at the top of the news agenda during the week. If you are planning a news story get in touch via email at <a href="mailto:The.WEEK@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">The.WEEK@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
