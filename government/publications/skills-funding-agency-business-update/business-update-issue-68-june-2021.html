<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>New publication: The road to a quality apprenticeship</h2>

<p>A new guide called the <a rel="external" href="https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/employers/the-road-to-a-quality-apprenticeship" class="govuk-link">road to a quality apprenticeship</a> has been published. It aims to help employers understand the steps involved in delivering high quality, successful apprenticeships in their businesses.</p>

<p>The guide provides links to information and tools at different stages of an apprenticeship journey that employers can use to help them ensure a quality experience for their apprentices aiding retention, achievement and therefore the returns that apprentices deliver.</p>

<p>The guide is a practical guide to aid employers of any size. It can also be used by providers to help them understand the role employers play in the apprenticeship journey.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/employers/the-road-to-a-quality-apprenticeship" class="govuk-link">The road to a quality apprenticeship</a> will be followed by similar guides for end-point assessment organisations and apprentices. Together with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/provider-guide-to-delivering-high-quality-apprenticeships" class="govuk-link">provider guide to delivering high quality apprenticeships</a>, they demonstrate the collaborative approach involved in delivering apprenticeships</p>

<p>Please share <a href="https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/employers/the-road-to-a-quality-apprenticeship" rel="external" class="govuk-link">The road to a quality apprenticeship</a> with your colleagues and contacts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>£1000 cash boost for employers to support T Level industry placements</h2>

<p>Employers will be able to claim £1000 for every T Level student they host on a high-quality industry placement, as part of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cash-boost-for-t-levels" class="govuk-link">new incentive scheme</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employer-incentive-payments-for-employers-offering-a-t-level-industry-placement">T Level employer incentive fund</a>, launched in recognition of the impact the pandemic has had on many businesses, is designed to help cover financial constraints employers may face as a barrier to hosting placements in the short term.</p>

<p>Employers will be able to claim £1000 for each T Level student they host on a 45-day (315 hour) industry placement, and offers businesses an excellent opportunity tap into the emerging talent pipeline, whilst supporting the skilled workforce of the future.</p>

<p>Uniquely combining classroom study with industry placements, T Levels generate the skilled workforce that businesses need for the future. Students undertaking a T Level course gain the skills and experience they need to progress into work, further study or an apprenticeship.  </p>

<p>Employers will be able to claim for up to 20 students, starting their T Level placements from now until July 2022 and those interested in accessing the incentive payments and offering T Level industry placements should contact: 08000 150 600 (choose option 4) or fill out an <a href="https://www.tlevels.gov.uk/employers/next-steps" class="govuk-link" rel="external">industry placement contact form online</a>: <a href="https://www.tlevels.gov.uk/employers/next-steps" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Next steps T Levels</a>.</p>

<p>Also announced, a procurement exercise, of up to £350,000, for an <a href="https://employerindustryplacements.co.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Employer Support Package</a>, will taking place in the summer, for an organisation to offer employers T Levels support. Such support will include delivering webinars, and support sessions across England.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>New T Levels employer guide</h2>

<p>A window for applications to the Institute’s new employer directory is due to open in June.</p>

<p>The Institute set up the directory of professional and employer-led organisations for Ofqual and the Office for Students (OfS) to draw on industry expertise as external quality assurance (EQA) responsibilities are transferred over to them.</p>

<p>Thousands of incredible employers already play a critical role in designing apprenticeships and end point assessment plans to meet the skills needs of their sectors, with support from the Institute.</p>

<p>Now, the Institute is looking for professional and employer led bodies to sit on our new employer directory. This directory will ensure industry voice remains at the centre of the EQA process for apprenticeship end point assessment, so that apprentices are best prepared for the real-life world of work.</p>

<p>You can see details about the employer directory, as well as how to apply, on the <a href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/quality/employer-directory/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Institute’s website</a>. No deadline for applications has been set yet.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Levy Transfers Update</h2>

<p>For levy-paying employers, your 2021/22 transfer allowance will now be showing in your Apprenticeship Service account.</p>

<p>Levy payers are able to transfer up to 25% of their levy funds to other employers of their choice.  A transfer can help support other employers within your sector, location or supply chain to take on an apprentice.</p>

<p>For more information on transfers please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transferring-apprenticeship-service-funds">Transfer Pages</a> on GOV.UK</p>

<p>In August, we will be launching a new online matching service (on GOV.UK) where levy employers can advertise their intent to transfer to other employers. This will give organisations further opportunity to reduce skills gaps within their sector/location by enabling them to easily identify other employers who wish to take on apprentices with transferred funds.</p>

<p>Other employers will be able to access the new service, this will enable them to see available transfer opportunities. Employers can then apply for a transfer from within their apprenticeship service account.</p>

<p>We will be share further information on the new matching service soon.</p>
