<span class="number">1. </span>	Apprenticeship service update</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<h3>Transfer of apprenticeship service funds – restrictions lifted</h3>

<p>The temporary restriction on how many employers a levy-payer can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/greater-flexibility-for-apprenticeship-levy-as-transfers-extended">transfer apprenticeship service funds</a> to will be lifted this month.</p>

<p>From early July, levy-paying employers will be allowed to transfer up to a maximum of 10% of their apprenticeship service annual funds to as many employers as they choose. By making a transfer to pay for an apprentice’s training and assessment, employers can support other employers who may not have considered apprenticeship training as a key part of developing their workforce.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://sfadigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/23/5-pointers-to-help-employers-prepare-for-transfers-on-the-apprenticeship-service/">Read more about transfers here</a>.</p>

<h3>A new funding projection tool</h3>

<p>We will also be releasing a new feature for employers on the apprenticeship service that will project funds over the next four years, helping employers to plan apprenticeship programme costs.</p>

<p>To keep up to date with news and information about the apprenticeship service please follow us on Twitter. Employers with queries about the apprenticeship service please call the National Contact Centre helpline on 08000 150 600 or email:
<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk">helpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	Exam results time approaching</h2>

<h3>Inform/action</h3>

<p>With exam results season drawing nearer, thousands of young people, influenced by their parents, will be making important decisions about their future. Over the summer we’re working on a series of communications activities to raise awareness about the opportunities available through apprenticeships – and to present apprenticeships as a real alternative to full-time university study and college. This will take place through social media and media relations.</p>

<p>We’re already working with a number of private and public sector employers and are looking for more employers to help with this work.</p>

<p>If you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have live apprenticeship vacancies in August</li>
  <li>have made apprenticeship offers to students who will be getting their exam results this August</li>
  <li>employ apprentices who have recently left school or college, and that have achieved something exceptional that may be of interest to media</li>
</ul>

<p>Then get in touch by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Marcomms.MAILBOX@education.gov.uk">Marcomms.MAILBOX@education.gov.uk</a> to find out how you can get involved.</p>
