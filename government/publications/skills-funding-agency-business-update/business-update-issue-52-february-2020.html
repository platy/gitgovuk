<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Frameworks withdrawal</h2>

<p>Apprenticeship standards are replacing apprenticeship frameworks, as a core part of our work to improve the quality of apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Apprenticeship standards are designed directly by employers to ensure apprenticeships meet the needs of their sector. The combination of employers identifying the key knowledge, skills and behaviours required, and the move to a holistic end-point assessment gives employers much greater assurance that their employee is fully occupationally competent at the end of their apprenticeship.</p>

<p>There are 6 months to go until all remaining frameworks before they will no longer be available for your new apprenticeship starts.</p>

<p>After 31 July 2020, all new apprenticeship starts will be on standards. But you donât need to wait that long! Over 500 standards are already available and now is a great opportunity for your business to plan ahead, and start offering these new, high quality apprenticeships.</p>

<p>West Sussex Council are already using apprenticeship standards and have found they âare providing our organisation with greater flexibility. We now have occupational training in a wider range of job roles and can easily able to tailor the training to suit our business needs.  As a result, our apprenticeship programme is growing at pace.â</p>

<p>Standards represented 63 per cent of all starts reported in the 2018 to 2019 academic year.</p>

<p>If a learner starts on an apprenticeship framework before 31 July 2020, they will still be able to complete it.</p>

<p>You can see all the standards available for delivery and in development on the <a href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Educationâs website</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Update on EU Exit</h2>

<p>The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">Check the latest Transition Period information</a>.</p>

<p>There will be no change to eligibility for apprenticeship funding in academic years 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 for citizens from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. They will need to ensure they have the right to live and work in the UK after 2020.</p>

<p>Employers should ensure that their employees, including apprentices, who are from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland and living in the UK are aware that they and their family members will need to apply for settled or pre-settled status through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families" class="govuk-link">EU Settlement Scheme</a> in order to secure their rights. Many of your employees will have already applied to the EU Settlement Scheme or be in the process of doing so. But if they have not, they still have until 30 June 2021 to do so.</p>

<p>Irish citizensâ right to live in the UK has not changed. This means they do not need to apply for the EU Settlement Scheme, but they can if they want to. Any family members who are not Irish or British citizens will need to do so.</p>

<p>Detailed eligibility requirements are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules">apprenticeship funding rules</a>.</p>

<p>Youâll need to continue to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/employing-eu-eea-and-swiss-citizens-and-their-family-members-after-brexit">check a job applicantsâ right to work</a>. This will not change.</p>

<p>UK nationals returning from living or studying in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/policy-paper-on-the-rights-of-uk-nationals-in-the-eu" class="govuk-link">will continue to be eligible to apply for an apprenticeship in England for a 7-year period</a>. The 7-year period will begin on 1 January 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Give us your views on apprenticeships</h2>

<p>The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (The Institute) has announced a new round of reviews that will start in the summer.</p>

<p>These route reviews will consider apprenticeships available to the Health and Science and Care Services sectors.
They will consider how well employers are served by some of the oldest apprenticeship standards and whether they need to be updated. The Institute will also consider wider quality issues.</p>

<p>Email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:IFA.HEALTHANDSCIENCEREVIEW@education.gov.uk">IFA.HEALTHANDSCIENCEREVIEW@education.gov.uk</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:IFA.CARESERVICESREVIEW@education.gov.uk">IFA.CARESERVICESREVIEW@education.gov.uk</a> to find out more.</p>

<p>We are also seeking further feedback, following the closure of the engineering and manufacturing route review, from the sector and arranging stakeholder meetings for those interested in taking part. To find out more email <a href="mailto:IFAREVIEW.ENGINEERINGANDMANUFACTURING@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">IFAREVIEW.ENGINEERINGANDMANUFACTURING@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>T Levels website launch</h2>

<p>On Monday 17 February a new section of the <a href="www.tlevels.gov.uk/employers" class="govuk-link">T Levels website aimed at employers</a> was launched and will sit alongside the existing student website.</p>

<p>The website will contain information about industry placements and employers. There will be strong call to action to the website through targeted social media advertising which also launches on Monday. This helps to support our engagement with employers and to increase the number of quality industry placements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>A helping hand for apprentices</h2>

<p>The NUS Apprentice extra card is one simple way and inexpensive way that apprentices can save money on the stuff they buy, thanks to the 250+ online and in-store discounts available.</p>

<p>Thousands of apprentices are already using it to save, on average, Â£13.50 per month on food, fashion, tech and travel. It is the only discount platform exclusively for apprentices in the UK. Take a look at the offers at www.apprenticeextra.co.uk from ASOS to Hotels.com and lots more.</p>

<p>The National Society of Apprentices (NSoA) works with more than 120 training providers and employers, representing over 150,000 apprentices across the UK. Sales of the NUS Apprentice extra fund the society: A society for apprentices, run by apprentices and paid for by apprentices.</p>

<p>If your apprentices are interested in making their money go further, please tell your apprentices about NUS Apprentice extra. Link is <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.apprenticeextra.co.uk/">NUS Apprentice extra</a>.</p>

<span class="number">9. </span>New for 2020: effective practice materials for embedding English and maths in apprenticeships</h2>

<p>A new package of learning materials is now available for providers and employers to support embedding of English and maths in workplace learning for apprentices.</p>

The materials comprise four online learning modules and an associated series of four interactive webinar sessions, available free of charge until 31 March 2020.</p>

<p>English and maths are essential to supporting longer-term career prospects. As part of our ambition for a world-class technical education system and in line with recommendations from independent experts, progression towards and attainment of approved level 2 English and maths qualifications is an important part of the apprenticeship programme.</p>
