<span class="number">1. </span>	Apprenticeship service update</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<h4>Employers invited to feedback</h4>

<p>We are introducing a new feature on the apprenticeship service - “what employers are saying”. We will be inviting employers who have registered apprentices on the apprenticeship service to feedback on specific aspects of their apprenticeship programmes.</p>

<p>The first beta version of the feature will ask for feedback on their training providers. We will publish the feedback on find apprenticeship training to help employers choose their training provider. All feedback will be anonymous.</p>

<p>For more information read the <a rel="external" href="https://sfadigital.blog.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">ESFA Digital Blog</a>.</p>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<p>The National Apprenticeship Awards 2018 regional winners have been <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/regional-winners-from-across-the-country-are-announced">announced</a>, following nine regional ceremonies taking place across the country in recent weeks.

<p>Nine regional ‘rising stars’ were recognised during the regional ceremonies. Winners are apprentices who have made impressive progress in their career to date and who show the potential, through their apprenticeship, to take their career path to the very top of their profession. Nominated by their employers, the 9 regional winners will receive votes from the public. The overall national winner will be announced during the national ceremony. Voting opens at 10am on 3 October and closes at 5pm on 17 October.

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Apprenticeships funding band review</h2>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>Over the summer, the Institute for Apprenticeships (IfA) has been reviewing the funding bands of 31 standards. The Department for Education (DfE) requested that existing standards be reviewed to assess where they should sit in the new 30 band funding structure, which was introduced for new starts from August 2018.</p>

<p>Ministers have now approved the first 12 recommendations from the review of standard prices, two standards will see their funding bands increased, 3 have stayed the same and 7 will see their funding bands reduced.</p>

<p>Increased funding bands will take effect for all new starts from 6 October 2018. Reduced funding bands will take effect after 3 months, from 1 January 2019. This is to give the market notice and time to respond to any changes in funding levels.</p>

<p>The IfA will make recommendations to DfE on the remaining standards in October. Further information will be available on the IfA’s website.</p>
