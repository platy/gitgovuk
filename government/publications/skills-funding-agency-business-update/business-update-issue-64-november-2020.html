<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers announced</h2>

<p>The Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers 2020 have been revealed, with the British Army securing the number one slot as the best apprenticeship employer in the country. Over 400 applications were received, with the results announced at a special online event broadcast on Wednesday 21 October.</p>

<p>New in 2020, the rankings showcase the very best of England’s large apprenticeship employers, with employers recognised for providing some of the most successful apprenticeship programmes over the previous 12 months.</p>

<p>The British Army achieved the top spot by helping over 8,000 apprentices gain new skills and progress in 2019 to 2020; with almost a fifth of its workforce currently completing apprenticeship programmes as part of their military training – in areas including engineering, telecommunications, logistics, construction, health and IT.</p>

<p>The new leader board of apprenticeship employers was independently developed, assessed and compiled in partnership with High Fliers Research.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Redundant apprentices: Statutory Instrument</h2>

<p>New legislation allowing more redundant apprentices to complete their apprenticeships came into force on Thursday 15 October.</p>

<p>Currently the Education and Skills Funding Agency continue to fund the apprentice to complete their programme if they are made redundant within six months of their final day of training. This allows apprentices that are close to the end of their apprenticeship to continue on programme while they look for another employer to complete their apprenticeship with, or, if they are unable to find one, allow them to complete their apprenticeship without an employer.</p>

<p>The amended legislation will help to support more redundant apprentices affected by Covid-19.  The amended legislation will extend this support to also fund to completion all apprentices who are at least 75% of their way through their apprenticeship at the point of redundancy. This will give apprentices who have made a substantial and long-term investment in their apprenticeship the opportunity to complete their training and achieve occupational competence.</p>

<p>These changes will mean more redundant apprentices can complete their apprenticeship, putting them in a stronger position to secure new employment. The change applies to apprentices undertaking both standards and frameworks.</p>

<p>The Redundancy Support Service for Apprentices continues, providing free advice and guidance to apprentices affected by redundancy, as well as helping them to identify new apprenticeship opportunities available across the country.</p>

<p>More information can be found on <a href="https://help.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360013970179-Funding-support-for-apprentices-who-have-been-made-redundant" rel="external" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a></p>
