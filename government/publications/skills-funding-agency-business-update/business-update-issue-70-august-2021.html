<h2>Cash boost to create new flexible approach to apprenticeships</h2>

<p>Sectors including the creative, agriculture and construction industries can now bid for a share of a £7 million fund to support the creation of new flexible apprenticeships, unlocking more opportunities for people to develop the skills they need to get good jobs.</p>

<p>The fund will establish a small number of agencies that will set up new flexi-job apprenticeships so an apprentice can work across a range of projects and with different employers to gain the knowledge, skills and behaviours they need to be occupationally competent.</p>

<p>The fund will make £7 million available in England across 2021-22 and 2022-23. Organisations can apply for funding between £100,000 and £1 million to set up new flexi-job apprenticeship agencies. The £7 million flexi-job apprenticeship fund will be a competed grant process and applicants will also have to apply to join the register of flexi-job apprenticeship agencies.</p>

<p>It may also support existing good quality apprenticeship training agencies (ATAs) to diversify as flexi-job apprenticeship agencies.</p>

<p>Applicants must meet a robust set of criteria as well as being able to provide details of how they will meet the needs of their chosen sector or region and ensure apprentices and placement employers receive a high-quality apprenticeship experience.</p>

<h2>The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical degree apprenticeship consultation</h2>

<p>The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (the Institute) has launched a consultation on degree apprenticeships. It sets out proposals to improve how degree apprenticeships are developed, approved, and work in practice for employers and apprentices.</p>

<p>The Institute are proposing five specific changes to the requirements of degree apprenticeships:</p>

<ol>
  <li>better supporting graduate-entry occupations</li>
  <li>integration of on-the-job and off-the-job training</li>
  <li>alignment between apprenticeship knowledge, skills and behaviours and degree learning outcomes</li>
  <li>integration of assessment</li>
  <li>participation of an independent assessor with occupational expertise</li>
</ol>

<p>To support the consultation, they are running a series of stakeholder events to provide an opportunity for people to ask questions about the proposals. You can sign up for these events on Eventbrite:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/degree-apprenticeships-consultation-information-session-for-employers-tickets-163495893619" rel="external" class="govuk-link">5 August 9:30am to 10:30am</a></li>

</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/reviews-and-consultations/consultations/degree-apprenticeships-consultation/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">find out more and take part in the consultation on the Institute’s website</a>. The consultation closes 16 September.</p>

<h2>Employer checklist – 7 steps to hiring an apprentice</h2>

<p><strong>Get apprenticeship ready this results day</strong></p>

<p>With A Level and GCSE results days taking place next week, many school and college leavers are starting to think about their career options.</p>

<p>If you’ve been considering making the most of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/incentive-payments-for-hiring-a-new-apprentice">£3,000 incentive payment</a> for hiring a new apprentice before 30 September, it’s the ideal time to take the next step.</p>

<p>We’ve created a checklist for employers who have a pay bill of less than £3 million each year. The guide outlines the steps you’ll need to take to employ an apprentice once you have found the right course and training provider to deliver your apprenticeship training.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://engage.apprenticeships.gov.uk/rs/868-OTP-740/images/PDF-7%20steps%20to%20hiring%20an%20apprentice.pdf">Download our checklist</a></p>

<h2>Updates to the apprenticeship service</h2>

<p>We’re making changes to ensure the apprenticeship service meets your needs.</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of the areas which we’re updating over the coming months – more details are outlined below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finding a training provider – updates now live</li>
  <li>Transfers of levy funds to pay for apprenticeships – updates coming soon</li>
  <li>Onboarding apprentices – updates coming soon</li>
</ul>

<h3>Finding a training provider – updates now live</h3>

<p>If there aren’t any providers offering the apprenticeship training you need, you can now fill out a simple online form to share your interest in a particular course with all providers.</p>

<p>Since the launch of this service many employers have registered their training needs and providers have been responding quickly.</p>

<p>To share your interest, search for a course using ‘<a rel="external" href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Find apprenticeship training</a>’, enter a town, city or postcode and select ‘View providers for this course’. If there are no results, look for ‘Can’t find a training provider?’ and select ‘Share your interest’.</p>

<h3>Transfers of levy funds to pay for apprenticeships – updates coming soon</h3>

<p>Employers who pay the apprenticeship levy (those with an annual pay bill of more than £3 million) will be able to pledge unspent levy funds (up to their 25% transfer allowance) to support apprenticeships in other businesses.</p>

<p>All businesses will be able to see these transfer opportunities on a gov.uk webpage and apply for funding to pay for 100% of their apprenticeship training and assessment costs (up to the funding band maximum).</p>

<h3>Onboarding apprentices – updates coming soon</h3>

<p>New apprentices added to your account will receive an email, asking them to create an account for the new ‘Confirm my apprenticeship details’ service, where they will be able to review and confirm the details of their apprenticeship. Apprentices will be able to refer back to these details during their apprenticeship and also access guidance on what is expected of them, their provider and you as their employer.</p>

<p>If apprentices do not confirm their details or access the guidance, this will not impact them starting their apprenticeship or funding being received by your provider. As part of onboarding your apprentices, you should encourage them to complete this task, as it will help to make their apprenticeship a quality experience.</p>

<p>You should now begin collecting a unique email address for each of your future apprentices, ready for the launch of this service.</p>

<h2>Incentive payment for hiring a new apprentice</h2>

<p>Employers will receive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/incentive-payments-for-hiring-a-new-apprentice?utm_source=BusinessUpdate&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=incentivesp2">£3,000 for new apprentices of any age</a> who join their organisation from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>Employers with apprentices who have an employment start date between 1 April 2021 and 30 September 2021 and who also have a practical period (training) start date between 1 April 2021 and 30 November 2021 are eligible for the incentive payment.</p>

<h3>How to apply</h3>

<p>You can apply for the incentive payment through the ‘Finances’ section in your <a href="https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/employers/create-apprenticeship-service-account?utm_source=BusinessUpdate&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=incentivesp2" rel="external" class="govuk-link">apprenticeship service account</a>, under ‘Your hire a new apprentice payments’.</p>
