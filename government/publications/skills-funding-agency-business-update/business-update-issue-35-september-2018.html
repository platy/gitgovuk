<span class="number">1. </span>	Apprenticeship service update</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<h4>A new funding projection tool</h4>

<p>A new feature for employers on the apprenticeship service was recently released. The feature will project funds over the next four years, helping employers to plan their apprenticeship programme costs.</p>

<p>This feature has now been extended to allow employers to estimate costs for apprenticeships they would like to fund in the future and to see the impact on their projected account balance.</p>

<p>Further enhancements to the projection tool are planned for later in the autumn including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inclusion of costs for approved apprentices who are waiting to start their programmes</li>
  <li>estimation of funds that are likely to expire from May 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>As this is a new feature that we are continually working to improve, we’re keen to gather employer feedback, so please use the survey on the funding projection page in your account.</p>

<h5>Notifications in apprenticeship service accounts</h5>

<p>Employers and training providers will now receive email notifications of tasks to be carried out for apprentices funded by a transfer of apprenticeship funds. This will help with managing transfers activity between employers sending and receiving a transfer and the training provider.</p>

<p>We are also making enhancements to the notifications that are visible in an employer’s apprenticeship service account.</p>

<p>On the home screen, employers will be able to see a list of tasks they need to complete and a link to take them to the relevant page in their account to complete the task. An additional tab will also display an activities list. This will allow employers to see the activities that have been carried out in their account and who actioned them.</p>

<h4>Setting up an apprenticeship service account</h4>

<p>If you are an employer who is setting up an apprenticeship service account for the first time please take a look at our <a rel="external" href="https://bit.ly/2wJ3WfK" class="govuk-link">support videos</a> that will guide you through the process step by step.</p>

<p>These videos will be particularly useful for employers who are setting up an account because they are sending or receiving a transfer of apprenticeship service funds.</p>

<p>The videos include information on how to obtain your organisation’s government gateway user ID and password, which you will need before you can register for an account.</p>

<h4>Top tip: have more than one super-user</h4>

<p>It is recommended that employers have more than one super-user assigned to their apprenticeship service account. This allows employers to access the account when someone is absent or leaves the organisation.</p>

<p>Employers with queries about the apprenticeship service, please call the National Contact Centre helpline on 08000 150 600 or email helpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	National Apprenticeship Awards regional finalists announced</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<p>We have announced the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-apprenticeship-awards-2018-regional-finalists-announced?utm_source=4eee5724-7eb6-482e-8891-0c87a626d864&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=immediate" class="govuk-link">National Apprenticeship Awards 2018 regional finalists</a>. Finalists from a wide range of industries and occupations are progressing to the next stage of the National Apprenticeship Awards.</p>

<p>The awards were open to apprentices, individuals who promote apprenticeships and employers of all sizes from all sectors. The refreshed categories for 2018 gave additional opportunities for entrants to demonstrate the impact apprenticeships has made to individual’s lives and their workplaces.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	National Apprenticeship Week 2019 date announced</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<p>The date of the 12th annual National Apprenticeship Week - to take place in 2019 – has been announced and will run from 4 to 8 March 2019. The annual week long celebration of apprenticeships will bring the whole apprenticeship community together to celebrate the impact of apprenticeships on individuals, employers and the economy.</p>

<p>Following the most successful National Apprenticeship Week ever that took place earlier this year, National Apprenticeship Week 2019 – which also coincides with National Careers Week - will look to involve more individuals, employers, partners and providers in activities that highlight the benefits apprenticeships bring to employers and the opportunities apprenticeships present to individuals.</p>

<p>More information on National Apprenticeship Week 2019 will be announced on GOV.UK and on social media channels. Follow @Apprenticeships on Twitter and National Apprenticeship Service on LinkedIn to keep up to date.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span>	Community activation content – please share</h2>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>Please take a few minutes to share some of the content below that is most relevant to your audiences and help support the apprenticeships movement. Please join us and share!</p>

<h4>Sector engagement</h4>

<p>We are keen to engage employers in shouting about how great apprenticeships are. Please share <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/738279/Supporting_apprenticeships_-_social_media_graphic.png" class="govuk-link" rel="external">this graphic</a> across social media channels, using the wording below:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>‘We are proud of our #apprentices who are vital for the future growth of our business. Search for information on how you can hire an apprentice at <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://bit.ly/2Cfne1r">https://bit.ly/2Cfne1r</a> #ApprenticeshipsWork’</p>
</div>

<p>Also this month, we will be sharing across key sector press how the new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/" rel="external">apprenticeship standards</a> are helping the construction, engineering, health and retail sector. For the construction sector, the new standards can help address skills shortages as outlined Karen Woodward, Deputy Director of the National Apprenticeship Service, in a recent article on <a rel="external" href="http://bit.ly/2NNTfyV" class="govuk-link">Construction News</a>.</p>

<p>Later this month, we will also be profiling how apprenticeships are helping the retail sector in a series of activities with Retail Week and in the engineering sector with The Engineer.</p>

<h4>Top marks on exam results</h4>

<p>As students up and down the country picked up their exam results last month, the National Apprenticeship Service made lots of noise in the media about apprenticeships and why they work. Working with the National Careers Service, who were responsible for the exam results helpline, apprenticeships got equal mention alongside other career options post A Levels and GCSEs.</p>

<p>Over 130 pieces of media coverage were secured, including The Sun, Daily Mirror, Sunday Times, and key broadcasters, BBC News and BBC 5Live. On social media, working with our apprentices, we created authentic and engaging content.</p>

<p>We want to take this opportunity to once again thank all the employers and apprentices that worked with us on this.</p>

<p>You can still support us with by sharing some content. Below are 3 of our favourite pieces of media coverage and social content. You can share these via your social channels. Do tag @Apprenticeships in on your post.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we worked with Huffington Post in pulling together this <a rel="external" href="http://bit.ly/2PBRuFy" class="govuk-link">parent focussed piece</a> together, featuring 4 fantastic apprentices from JP Morgan, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Lloyds Banking Group and Dentons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
