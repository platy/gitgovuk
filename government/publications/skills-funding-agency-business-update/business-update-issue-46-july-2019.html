<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Apprenticeship funding rules for 2019 to 2020 published</h2>

<p>The ESFA <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules">apprenticeship funding rules 2019 to 2020</a> were published on GOV.UK on 1 August in PDF, following feedback from the recent clarification exercise. The web-based rules went live on 1 August.</p>

<p>The changes we have made are set out in the summary of changes.</p>

<p>Following this publication, we will continue to work to improve the funding rules in line with your feedback. One of the rules we are reviewing is the restriction on transfers to young apprentices employed by SMEs. We will inform you should we make a change in the future.</p>

<p>The rules apply to all providers, employers and employers-providers receiving apprenticeship funding from ESFA.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>One year until apprenticeship frameworks are withdrawn</h2>

<p>There is now less than a year to go until all remaining <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/removal-of-apprenticeship-frameworks">apprenticeship frameworks are withdrawn</a>. After 31 July 2020, apprentices will no longer be able to start on a framework. Apprentices who have already started a framework will still be able to finish it, but from this point, all new starts will be on high-quality apprenticeship standards.</p>

<p>But you donât need to wait until then! Employers have already developed over 470 standards, and these represented over 60 per cent of all starts reported in the first three quarters of 2018 to 2019. This is fantastic progress towards the full transition to standards by the beginning of August 2020. If you are still using frameworks, this is the time to start planning your transition to standards.</p>

<p>You can see the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/">full list of standards on the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Educationâs (the Institute) website</a>. If you are unsure about which apprenticeship standard is right for your business please contact the National Apprenticeship Service on 08000 150 600.</p>

<p>If you cannot find a standard to meet your business need, please consult the <a href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Instituteâs website</a> or contact them via email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk">enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>In principle end-point assessment organisation</h2>

<p>On 28 June, ESFA announced a change to our end-point assessment (EPA) policy. From 1 October 2019, we will not fund apprentices to start on a new standard until an End-Point Assessment Organisation (EPAO) has given an âin principleâ commitment to deliver the EPA. You can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-end-point-assessments-change-to-starts-policy-for-new-standards-being-approved">full statement</a> for further information.</p>

<p>This is great news for apprentices, providers, employers and EPAOs, as it will give everyone a much clearer view of their options for end-point assessment right from the beginning of the apprenticeship. To support this change, the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (the Institute) will require trailblazers to engage with potential EPAOs earlier in the standard development process.</p>

<p>These EPAOs will be asked to complete a new form to share information about their intent and to commit to applying to the Register of End-point Assessment Organisations (the register) to deliver the assessment against the specific apprenticeship standard.</p>

<p>The change in policy will give ESFA greater confidence there will be an EPAO on the register for every apprenticeship standard as quickly as possible and as soon as they will be needed. The Institute and ESFA can offer support and guidance to both trailblazers and EPAOs to complete these forms, and can help you get in touch with the right EPAO.</p>

<p>ESFA continues to welcome applications to the register from existing and new EPAOs for standards that have already been approved. Trailblazers, providers or employers struggling to identify an EPAO to work with, or to deliver for a standard, should contact ESFA via email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:apprentice.assessment@education.gov.uk">apprentice.assessment@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span>SME apprenticeship employers and training providers lined up to help develop the apprenticeship service</h2>

<p>The Expression of Interest for Small and medium sized apprenticeship employers and supporting training providers to take part in testing the system functionality of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/esfa-calls-on-small-and-medium-sized-apprenticeship-employers-and-supporting-training-providers-to-help-develop-the-apprenticeship-service" class="govuk-link">apprenticeship service for employers who do not pay the levy closed</a> on 5 July 2019.  Successful applicants have been notified and invited to join online information webinars to run through the service features they will be testing.</p>

<p>Providers currently listed on the Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers will also very soon be invited to register for one of four roadshows that will be taking place in September. These roadshows will help providers prepare for the transition of smaller employers to the apprenticeship service and will give them an opportunity to talk to us about what they need and how ESFA can help support them.</p>

<p>A second window to submit an EOI for ESFA to select employers and supporting providers, who have starts in November and December 2019, will open later in the summer. You can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://plus-pages.com/page/YDsiqLcj/5817zJT5s/contract-position">find out more about what weâre doing to develop the service</a>.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education statutory digital review needs employer contribution</h2>

<p>On 20 May 2019, the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (the Institute) published the findings from its <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/reviews/statutory-review-report-digital-route/">statutory review into the following 12 digital apprenticeship standards</a>:</p>

<ul>

<p>The Institute is now seeking employers, especially from small and medium businesses, who have an interest in these occupations to contribute to improving these digital standards by joining Trailblazer Groups.</p>

<p>Jonathan Mitchell, Deputy Director of Standards Development at the Institute has written an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-funding-agency-business-update" class="govuk-link">open letter to all interested employers</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Getting ready to review</h2>

<p>Last week, the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (the Institute) launched two new Route Reviews: the Hair and Beauty review and the Creative and Design review.</p>

<p>Each Review starts with an eight-week consultation, closing on the 22 and 24 September 2019. These Reviews are all about ensuring high quality so our apprenticeships are fit for the future. Feedback is welcomed on how these apprenticeships are working (and where improvements can be made).</p>

<p>Anyone with an interest in the development of these apprenticeships â including employers, providers and apprentices â are encouraged to get involved in the consultation. We are aiming to share the recommendations from these Reviews in early 2020, and please feel free to share this information with any contacts you think might be interested in contributing.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/reviews" rel="external">Find out more</a>, and if you have any questions, there are two dedicated email addresses you can use to get in touch:</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Institute annual report</h2>

<p>On 17 July 2019, the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education published its second <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/817776/IFA-ARA-2019-final-web-report.pdf" rel="external">annual report and accounts for 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019</a>.</p>
