<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Apprenticeship service update and feedback</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<p>Since the launch of the apprenticeship service thousands of employers have successfully used it to plan and support their apprenticeship programmes.</p>

<p>If you are a levy-paying employer, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-apprenticeship-funds?utm_source=AS%20comms" class="govuk-link">set up an account</a> to manage your apprentices, choose a training provider and then make payments to them for the training they deliver.</p>

<p>We’re always looking at ways to improve the service so we encourage all employers to use the in-service feedback buttons, which you can find throughout the service. We have already delivered enhancements to the service from feedback we have received. For example, employers and providers are now able to search for apprentices in their account simply by inputting an apprentice’s name. Providers are also able to do a search by using an apprentice’s unique learner number.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Feedback from non-levy paying employers</h2>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>If you’re not a levy-paying employer, you won’t be able to register for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work#apprenticeship-service">apprenticeship service</a> account until April 2019 but you can use other parts of the service on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work#non-levy-paying-employers" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a> to help you plan your apprenticeship programme right now. All employers can use the service to <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://estimate-my-apprenticeship-funding.sfa.bis.gov.uk/?utm_source=AS%20comms">estimate</a> how much an apprenticeship may cost and to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.sfa.bis.gov.uk/" rel="external">find</a> the right apprenticeship training and training provider to deliver it.</p>

<p>We would like to gather views from employers that do not pay the levy, in particular, we want to find out about your needs for apprenticeship training and what services you would like to see in an online apprenticeship service. If you are an employer who doesn’t pay the apprenticeship levy, please let us have your views by completing our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/apprenticeshipsme" rel="external">short survey</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Register of apprenticeship training providers: deadline for applications extended</h2>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers">register of apprenticeship training providers</a> opened for applications on 25 September and was due to close on 27 October 2017. We have extended the deadline by a short period and the register will now close for applications at 5pm on Friday, 3 November 2017.</p>

<p>This will be the final time the register opens before we review the register to ensure that it continues to offer employers confidence that those listed can deliver the highest quality apprenticeship training. We have extended the deadline to ensure that all new providers that want to join have an opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>If you have already made an application to this third opening, your application will be unaffected by this extension, you can still review and make any changes up until the new closing date. If you are already listed on the apprenticeship register you do not need to take any action.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Oyster card for apprentices</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>
