<span class="number">1. </span> Apprenticeship service update</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">15,000 </span> employer accounts on the apprenticeship service</h3>

<p>More than 15,000 employer accounts have now been created on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk/">apprenticeship service</a> since the introduction of the apprenticeship levy last year. This means that employers who pay the apprenticeship levy can now use their apprenticeship service account to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive funds to spend on apprenticeships</li>
  <li>manage apprentices</li>
  <li>manage payments to training providers</li>
  <li>transfer apprenticeship funds to other employers</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are an employer that pays the apprenticeship levy or are receiving a transfer of apprenticeship service funds register for your <a rel="external" href="https://manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">apprenticeship service</a> account. Watch our <a href="http://bit.ly/YTOCTBUSUPDATE" class="govuk-link" rel="external">support videos</a> and read our <a href="http://bit.ly/RegisterBusUpdate" class="govuk-link" rel="external">online guidance</a> for more information.</p>

<p>New and enhanced functions to help employers are being added to the service all the time. For example, employers who have registered apprentices on the apprenticeship service will periodically be invited to feedback on specific aspects of their apprenticeship programmes. The first version of this feature asks for feedback on their training providers. The results of this are available on <a rel="external" href="http://bit.ly/FATOct18busupdate" class="govuk-link">Find apprenticeship training</a>.</p>

<p>From November 2018, levy paying employers with an apprenticeship service account will notice a new “Recruitment” link on their account home page. Levy paying employers now have the option to either advertise apprenticeship vacancies through their chosen training provider, or directly access the Recruit an apprentice tool, to create and post apprenticeship vacancies on Find an apprenticeship and manage applications themselves.</p>

<p>Employers that do not pay the apprenticeship levy and do not have an account on the apprenticeship service can still post their vacancies on Recruit an apprentice, either with the support of their training provider or by contacting the National Apprenticeship Service on 08000 150 600.</p>

<h4>Package of measures unveiled to boost apprenticeships</h4>

<p>The government has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/package-of-measures-unveiled-to-boost-apprenticeships" class="govuk-link">announced a package of reforms</a> to ensure the apprenticeship levy provides people with the skills they need to succeed.</p>

<p>The changes are aimed at providing flexibility for businesses so they can take full advantage of the benefits of employing apprentices whilst helping as many people as possible to find the right training to equip them for the new economy. The reforms include enabling employers to transfer up to a quarter of their apprenticeship funds to any other employer, boosting the number benefitting from high-quality apprenticeship training, and a further £5 million for the Institute for Apprenticeships to introduce new standards and update existing standards to ensure more courses can be offered.</p>

<p>Find out more about how <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transferring-apprenticeship-service-funds">transfers work</a> and watch a support video:</p>

<h3>Withdrawal of apprenticeship frameworks</h3>

<p>As part of the apprenticeship reform programme, we <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/removal-of-apprenticeship-frameworks" class="govuk-link">have published a list of apprenticeship frameworks</a> and the date when they will be withdrawn. Employers should visit this page to find out more about the withdrawal of frameworks relevant to their sector or job roles.</p>

<p>Please note that we will move from apprenticeship frameworks to standards by 2020 and all frameworks will be withdrawn by the 2020 to 2021 academic year.</p>
