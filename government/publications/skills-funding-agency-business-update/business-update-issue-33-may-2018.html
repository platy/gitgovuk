<span class="number">1. </span>	National Apprenticeship Awards 2018</h2>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>The National Apprenticeship Awards 2018 are open for entries from now, until 25th May. With a new look and feel for 2018, and a simplified application process, it’s a great opportunity to showcase apprenticeships in your business. The award categories open to apprentice employers and apprentices include:</p>

<h4>Employer of the Year categories:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>SME of the Year: 1 – 249 employees</li>
  <li>Large Employer of the Year: 250 – 4,999 employees</li>
  <li>Macro Employer of the Year: 5,000+ employees</li>
</ul>

<h4>Apprentice of the Year categories:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Intermediate Level (level 2)</li>
  <li>Advanced Level (level 3)</li>
  <li>Higher or Degree Level (level 4 or higher)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Apprenticeship Champion of the Year</h4>
<p>Recognises individuals who go ‘above and beyond’ to champion apprenticeships.</p>

<p>A new special award for 2018 is the Recruitment Excellence Award. The winner will be selected from Employer of the Year award entries, and will be given to an organisation that has recruited a diverse and high quality apprenticeship workforce.</p>

<p>A new award category, the Rising Star Award will recognise apprentices that have made impressive progress in their career to date, and have the potential to go even further. Apprentices will be nominated for this award by their employer, and the selection of the national winner will include a public vote. Another new award for 2018 is the Special Recognition Award, which will be awarded to an individual who has made a special contribution to the promotion and delivery of apprenticeships. The winner of this category will be selected by the National Apprenticeship Service.</p>

<h3>Inform/action</h3>

<h4>Transferring apprenticeship service funds to another employer</h4>

<p>From this month employers who pay the apprenticeship levy will have the option to fund apprentices in another organisation by making a transfer. Transfers are being introduced to give levy-paying employers more flexibility in how they spend their apprenticeship service funds and will help larger employers to support smaller employers in taking on apprentices. For the first phase, employers who have unused funds in their apprenticeship account will be able to transfer some of those funds to one other employer. The number of employers that an organisation can transfer funds to will increase over time and after user feedback from the first phase.</p>

<h4>Key information</h4>

<ul>
  <li>levy-paying employers who use the apprenticeship service will be able to see their transfer allowance at the end of April</li>
  <li>they will be able to make a transfer to one other organisation from May</li>
  <li>the receiving organisation will be able to start adding apprentices from May</li>
  <li>for these new apprenticeships, training providers can then be paid from June</li>
  <li>funds will be transferred monthly for the duration of the apprenticeship</li>
  <li>a new transfers estimator tool will help employers plan the apprenticeships they could fund with a transfer</li>
</ul>

<span class="number">3. </span>	Apprenticeship quality</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.fenews.co.uk/fevoices/16971-apprenticeship-reforms-to-ensure-the-highest-quality-skills-training" class="govuk-link">apprenticeship reforms</a>, which give employers a real stake in the apprenticeship system, are designed to make sure that all apprenticeships are of the highest quality and deliver the right skills and training for everyone. Quality is at the heart of the changes made to the apprenticeship system, with the aim to fundamentally reform what apprenticeships are, and the long-term opportunities they can provide.</p>

<p>Reforms, including the change from frameworks to standards, internationally benchmarking what an apprenticeship is and ensuring apprentices spend at least 20% of their time on off-the-job training have been important in driving up quality. The role of the employer and training provider is to decide how the off the-job training is delivered whilst ensuring on-the-job training helps an apprentice develop the specific skills for the workplace</p>

<p>You can find more information on the employer responsibilities in apprenticeship delivery in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-guide-for-employers" class="govuk-link">employer guide to apprenticeships</a> on GOV.UK.</p>
