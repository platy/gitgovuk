<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Apprenticeship Levy</h2>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>Over the last few years the government has embarked on a programme to increase the benefits that apprenticeships bring to all organisations. Reformed apprenticeships are more rigorous, better structured, independently assessed and more clearly aligned to your needs for skills to boost your organisation.</p>

<p>To support these changes a UK-wide <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work">apprenticeship levy</a> came into force on 6 April 2017.</p>

<p>Our online apprenticeship service, which we launched in February this year, already has many employers signed up to start using their money to invest in apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Once you’ve <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pay-apprenticeship-levy" class="govuk-link">declared your levy</a>, you will see the balance in your apprenticeship service account by the end of May 2017. But first, you need to ensure that you’ve set up your account on the apprenticeship service. It shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes – the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-apprenticeship-funds">register to manage your apprenticeship funds page</a> tells you everything you need.</p>

<p>On the apprenticeship service you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>search for apprenticeships and see details of the approved providers who can deliver that training through <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.sfa.bis.gov.uk/">find apprenticeship training</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sign an agreement for each of your organisations that will contract with training providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add apprentices and set up payments to training providers - here are some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://sfadigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/20/preview-how-to-add-apprentices-and-set-up-payments/" rel="external">common questions from employers</a> about this part of the service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>soon view your English percentage in your account</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The funds available to spend on apprenticeships depend on the percentage of your pay bill that’s paid to employees who live in England. HMRC works out the English percentage for each PAYE scheme by dividing the total year-to-date pay bill of employees who live in England by the total year-to-date pay bill of all employees.</p>

<p>Sign up to our blog and follow @SFAdigital on Twitter for updates and useful advice on getting ready for the levy. We are putting helpful hints and tips on the blog as we learn where employers have questions. We will also be publishing a series of videos over the next few weeks to walk through the next few features that you will be able to use, including viewing the levy balance and payment activity in your account.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Procurement for apprenticeship training in smaller employers</h2>

<p>Inform</p>

<p>We have announced a pause to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/procurement-for-apprenticeship-training-in-smaller-employers" class="govuk-link">current procurement for apprenticeship training provision</a> for non-levy-paying employers. This will allow us to review our approach to ensure that we achieve the right balance between stability of supply and promoting competition and choice for employers. The procurement was significantly oversubscribed. It is therefore important that we fully consider how best to achieve these outcomes in a way that achieves the best value for employers and apprentices as we move to a fully employer-led system.</p>

<p>In order to maintain stability in the system we will be extending existing contracts held by all current providers until the end of December 2017. To maintain our quality standards, current providers with extended contracts will be able to undertake new starts on those contracts provided they are on the Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers. We will notify providers of specific arrangements shortly so that amended contracts are in place ahead of 1 May.</p>
