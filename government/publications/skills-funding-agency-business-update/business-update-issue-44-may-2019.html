<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>All employers in England to have better access to buy high quality apprenticeships</h2>

<p>Small and medium sized businesses, who do not pay the apprenticeship levy, will take full control over apprenticeships in their business as they come on board the Education and Skills Funding Agency’s (ESFA) award-winning <a rel="external" href="https://accounts.manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk/service/index" class="govuk-link">apprenticeship service</a>.</p>

<p>Every apprenticeship employer in England will soon have access to the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://sfadigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/04/23/how-the-apprenticeship-service-is-leading-the-way-in-digital-innovation/">full benefits of the ESFA’s apprenticeship service</a>, with the first employers and providers commencing their use from summer 2019.</p>

<p>Currently, only apprenticeship <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work/apprenticeship-levy-how-it-will-work#pay-apprenticeship-levy" class="govuk-link">levy-paying employers</a> - those with an annual total pay bill of over £3m - or those in receipt of a transfer of apprenticeship funds - are able to use the full benefits that the apprenticeship service brings.</p>

<p>Whilst all other employers (those who do not pay the levy) have had access to some of the functions, such as ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-apprenticeship" class="govuk-link">find an apprenticeship</a>’, ESFA is opening up the apprenticeship service to employers of all size, regardless of whether they pay the levy or not. This will provide employers with the choice over how they want to control the use of apprenticeships and make them work for their business.</p>

<p>Over the course of the next year, all employers will be able to control how they pay for their apprenticeship training and assess and recruit their apprentices. They will also have access to a larger pool of training providers to deliver more relevant training for them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Recognised prior learning feedback and webinar</h2>

<p>In March, we published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-recognition-of-prior-learning">guidance providing more detail on how providers, employers and apprentices should account for prior learning</a>, and why this an important aspect of delivering high quality apprenticeships.</p>

<p>We are now seeking feedback to understand the impact of the guidance as this will help us to refine our guidance and future publications.</p>

<p>Please complete our <a href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/RecognitionofPriorLearning/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">short survey</a> to make your feedback count, the survey closes on 16 June.</p>

<p>We will hold a webinar discussing initial assessment and the recognition of prior learning on Wednesday 26 June 2019.</p>

<p>The webinar will start at 14:00 and will last for around 45 minutes including time for questions. For more information and to register, please see our <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/o/apprenticeship-service-18113241310" class="govuk-link" rel="external">webinar registration page</a>.</p>

<p>Please share the survey and webinar details with any interested stakeholders.</p>
