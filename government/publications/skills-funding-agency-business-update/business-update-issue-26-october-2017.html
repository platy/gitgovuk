<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Non-levy paying employers set to manage their apprenticeship programme online by 2019</h2>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>From April 2019, we aim to bring all employers onto the apprenticeship service to manage their apprenticeship programme. Over the next 18 months, this part of the service will be designed and developed. During this time, we will be in contact with non-levy paying employers to make sure the service meets their needs.</p>

<p>In the meantime, non-levy paying employers can continue to use <a rel="external" href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.sfa.bis.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">find apprenticeship training</a> to search for suitable apprenticeships and see details of approved providers who can deliver the training. Employers can also work with their training providers to post apprenticeship vacancies online and find the right candidates using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/recruit-apprentice?utm_source=Intermediary%20web%20page&amp;utm_campaign=Intermediary" class="govuk-link">recruit an apprentice</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a non-levy paying employer that would be willing to help us to test the new features of the service (likely to take no more than an hour of your time), please get in touch by emailing <a href="mailto:DigitalApprenticeshipService@sfa.bis.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">DigitalApprenticeshipService@sfa.bis.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	Using the apprenticeship service as an employer</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<p>We have updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-apprenticeship-funds?utm_source=AS%20comms">how to register and use the apprenticeship service as an employer</a> page on GOV.UK. This now includes information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who you need to talk to before you set up an account</li>
  <li>what you need to think about if setting up multiple connected organisations</li>
  <li>what to do after you’ve set-up your account</li>
  <li>how your funding will be received and the deadlines you need to be aware of</li>
  <li>changing apprentice details once you have added a cohort</li>
  <li>managing payments to your training provider by using stop, pause and resume</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve also published information for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/education/further-education-funding#/education/apprenticeships-funding" class="govuk-link">apprenticeship training providers</a> detailing how they use the service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	Apprenticeship service payments to training providers</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<p>It’s important that any apprentice’s details added to an employer’s account match the data that training providers send us each month. If the data does not match an employer’s account, funds will not be debited and your training provider will not be paid.</p>

<p>If an employer or the training provider amends any apprentice details these need to be approved in an employer’s account before the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-apprenticeship-funds?utm_source=AS%20comms#using-your-account">4th working day</a> of the month.</p>

<p>Please work with your training provider closely to ensure all changes are approved on time.</p>

<h3>Help and support for all employers</h3>

<p>Call the National Contact Centre helpline on 08000 150 600 or email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@manageapprenticeships.service.gov.uk">helpdesk@manageapprenticeships.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>	Changes to the minimum requirements in English and maths for apprenticeships</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<p>New legislation has come into effect which changes the minimum English and maths requirements needed to complete an apprenticeship for people with a learning difficulties or disabilities.</p>

<p>Previously, all apprentices achieved a minimum level 1 English and maths qualification to complete a level 2 apprenticeship, and a minimum level 2 English and maths qualification to complete an apprenticeship at level 3 and above.</p>

<p>The changes will lower English and maths requirements for apprentices to entry level 3 functional skills and will make completing an apprenticeship more achievable for those who are able to meet all occupational requirements but who may struggle to achieve English and maths qualifications at the level required.</p>

<p>For more information on the changes, visit <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/648496/English_and_maths_addendum.pdf" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:nationalhelpdesk@apprenticeships.gov.uk">nationalhelpdesk@apprenticeships.gov.uk</a> or telephone: 0800 015 0400.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Survey on apprenticeship reforms – closing soon</h2>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>A <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/apprenticeships/657f20aa/">short survey</a> on how reforms to apprenticeship funding, including the apprenticeship levy, have affected employers and training providers, will close on Tuesday, 3 October.</p>

<p>Throughout the reforms to apprenticeships we have regularly gathered feedback from employers, providers and their representative bodies. This survey offers a further opportunity to comment on apprenticeship funding policy and how it is working for you and your organisation. Please do complete the survey if you can.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>	Latest batch of apprenticeship withdrawals</h2>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>We are <a rel="external" href="http://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/batch5/" class="govuk-link">asking for feedback</a> on withdrawing the fifth batch of frameworks in a survey, open from Wednesday 13 September to Wednesday 18 October.</p>

<p>A full list of frameworks included in this proposal is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/removal-of-apprenticeship-frameworks" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a>. We will review the feedback and announce the final list for withdrawal next year.</p>

<p>We will also announce the outcome of the fourth batch of apprenticeship framework withdrawals, that we consulted on earlier this year, at the same time as we communicate the outcome of the fifth batch. The frameworks we plan to withdraw from both batches will be withdrawn to new starts no earlier than 1 January 2019.</p>
