<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Skills for Jobs White Paper and interim response to Augar Review</h2>

<p>On Thursday 21 January, the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson launched the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-for-jobs-lifelong-learning-for-opportunity-and-growth" class="govuk-link">Skills for Jobs White Paper</a> that sets out reforms for post-16 education in England, reshaping the training landscape and helping the nation to build back better.</p>

<p>These measures include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>business groups, including Chambers of Commerce, working alongside colleges to develop tailored skills plans to meet local training needs; supported by a £65 million Strategic Development Fund to put the plans into action and establish new College Business Centres to drive innovation and enhanced collaboration with employers.</li>
  <li>giving employers a central role in designing almost all technical courses by 2030, to ensure that the education and training people receive is directly linked to the skills needed for real jobs.</li>
  <li>boosting the quality and uptake of Higher Technical Qualifications - that provide the skills that many employers say they need and that can lead to higher wages – by introducing newly approved qualifications from September 2022 supported by a government-backed brand and quality mark.</li>
  <li>launching a nationwide recruitment campaign to get more talented individuals to teach in further education and investing in high quality professional development including a new Workforce Industry Exchange Programme.</li>
</ul>

<p>It enshrines the Prime Minister’s new Lifetime Skills Guarantee, setting out a blueprint for a post-16 education system that will ensure everyone, no matter where they live or their background, can gain the skills they need to progress in work at any stage of their lives.</p>

<p>To coincide with the publication of the White Paper, the government has also published its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/post-18-education-and-funding-review-interim-conclusion" class="govuk-link">interim response to the review of Post-18 Education and Funding</a> (Augar review). The interim response details immediate plans to rebalance technical and academic education and future reforms with the higher education Teaching Grant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Apprenticeship workforce development programme – new training offer</h2>

<p>As announced in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skills-for-jobs-lifelong-learning-for-opportunity-and-growth" class="govuk-link">Skills for Jobs White Paper</a>, a new comprehensive package of professional development, fully-funded by the Department for Education, will be available to all apprenticeship providers and their workforce.</p>

<p>Apprenticeship Workforce Development programme, offered by the Education and Training Foundation (ETF), provides trainers and leaders with the teaching skills, subject knowledge and confidence needed to deliver successful apprenticeships for the benefit of learners. It is available free of charge and you can access the training when it is suitable for you.</p>

<p>The first four training courses will be available through the ETF’s <a rel="external" href="https://pdp.etfoundation.co.uk/" class="govuk-link">Professional Development Platform (PDP)</a> from Friday 22 January:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assessor to Teacher; Understanding How We Learn</li>
  <li>Assessor to Teacher; Deciding How to Teach</li>
  <li>Effective Technical Teaching; Enhancing Pedagogy and Professional Practice</li>
  <li>Apprenticeship Leadership; Developing Your Team</li>
</ul>

<p>The final four training courses will be made available in February.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Apprenticeship Programme response to COVID-19</h2>

<p>Following the Prime Minister’s announcement on 4 January confirming a new national lockdown, an updated version of the Apprenticeship Programme response to COVID-19 has been published. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-apprenticeship-programme-response">The guidance is available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Updates include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>training providers, employers and end-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) must ensure that training and assessment takes place remotely wherever possible.</li>
  <li>face-to-face training and assessment can continue in colleges and training providers’ premises for vulnerable young apprentices and the children of key workers who need it.</li>
  <li>face-to-face training and assessment can also continue in employers’ Covid-secure settings where it is essential for workers to attend their workplace, and where it is safe and practical to do so.</li>
  <li>end-point assessment (EPA) and Functional Skills (FSQ) assessments can continue in colleges, training providers’ premises, assessment venues and workplaces where it cannot be conducted remotely and where providers and EPAOs judge it right to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p>The guidance will continue to be updated regularly.</p>

<h2>

<p><strong>The transition period has ended, and new rules are here. Act now to keep your business moving</strong>.</p>

<p>The transition period has ended, and the UK has left the EU customs union and single market and now enjoys a zero tariffs, zero quotas relationship with the EU as an independent trading nation.</p>

Your business needs to act now to comply with these new rules. If you do not take action, there is a risk your business operations will be interrupted.</p>

<p>These documents cover actions that businesses must take to ensure they are compliant with the new rules which have come into force. Part A provides an overview of key actions for businesses as well as supporting guidance, helpline numbers and FAQs. Part B lists the top five actions for businesses in each of the following sectors: Aerospace, automotive, chemicals, construction, consumer goods, electronics and machinery, life sciences, metals and materials, professional business services and retail.</p>
