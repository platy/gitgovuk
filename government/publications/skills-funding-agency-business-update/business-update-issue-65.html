<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>National Apprenticeship Week – Theme Announced</h2>

<p>The theme for the National Apprenticeship Week 2021, which will take place between 8 and 14 February 2021, is “Build the Future” and aims to encourage everyone to consider how apprenticeships help individuals to build the skills and knowledge required for a rewarding career.</p>

<p>We are asking employers to help the nation Build the Future by encouraging everyone to consider how apprenticeships can help build organisations for years to come; whilst showing the clear return on investment realised when apprentices are brought into the business.</p>

<p>As a result of the pandemic and many individuals relying on technology and virtual meetings more than ever, National Apprenticeship Week 2021 will be different, but just as exciting. NAW2021 will celebrate the motivating stories of how apprentices have helped business adapt and build during a difficult year.</p>

<p>To support National Apprenticeship Week 2021, individuals, employers, training providers and communities are being encouraged to get involved, to celebrate apprenticeships and how they:</p>

<p><strong>TRAIN apprentices</strong>, and future proof their workforce and careers though apprenticeships;</p>

<p><strong>RETAIN apprentices</strong>, gaining the skills and knowledge needed by the business, and seeing apprentices thrive, whilst having impact;</p>

<p><strong>ACHIEVE a real return on investment from apprentices</strong>; realising the business benefits of apprenticeships, with apprentices progressing in their chosen careers.</p>

<p>A toolkit is available now to support the apprenticeship community with planning their activity for National Apprenticeship Week 2021. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/using-the-apprenticeship-brand">Download the toolkit from GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Keep up to date with National Apprenticeship Week 2021 updates by following @Apprenticeships on Twitter, and National Apprenticeship Service on LinkedIn and use the hashtags #NAW2021 #BuildTheFuture in social media activity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>National Apprenticeship Awards – Live Broadcast</h2>

<p>The 17th annual National Apprenticeship Awards took place on 25 November. This year’s award winners were recognised via a virtual ceremony, for the first time ever, in an event that celebrated employers, apprentices and apprenticeship champions from a range of regions and sectors. BBC’s Dan Walker hosted the event that was supported by 9 national sponsors.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>The Association of Apprentices: Survey Launched</h2>

<p>The Association of Apprentices is an independent membership organisation for apprentices providing support, information and guidance beyond what apprentices may receive from an employer and/or training provider. The goal is for this to be a user-led community - it is for apprentices but also by apprentices.</p>

<p>The Association of Apprentices is gathering the views of as many apprentices as possible to ensure the organisation works for apprentices. They would like to know the type of content that would be helpful and what would encourage apprentices to join. The survey shouldn’t take more than 5-7 minutes to complete and there is also the chance to win one of 35 Amazon vouchers by completing it.</p>

<p>The survey can be accessed from <a rel="external" href="https://www.associationofapprentices.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">the Association of Apprentices’ website</a>. For further information, please contact <a href="mailto:director@associationofapprentices.org.uk" class="govuk-link">Fiona Burford, Project Director</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Find Apprenticeship Training - Redesign</h2>

<p>We have redesigned the find apprenticeship training function in the apprenticeship service to make it easier for employers to find the information they need.</p>

<p>Our improvements will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make it easier for employers to compare training providers by displaying their overall ratings in a list.</li>
  <li>Show information on a providers ‘strengths’ and ‘things to improve’, listing (up to) the top 3 for each section.</li>
  <li>Order training provider results by considering employer reviews, achievement rates and distance.</li>
</ol>
