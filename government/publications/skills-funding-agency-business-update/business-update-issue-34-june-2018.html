<span class="number">1. </span>	Apprenticeship funding</h2>

<h3>Inform</h3>

<p>On 17 May, government published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-funding-from-may-2017">new apprenticeships funding policy</a>, to come into effect on 1 August 2018.</p>

<p>It updates the policy that has been in place since May 2017. The policy explains how government will fund apprenticeship training in England from August 2018 and will apply to all employers, both those paying the levy and those who do not. The following sections of the policy document contain changes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Funding bands</li>
  <li>Transitional support for providers training 16 to 18 year olds on frameworks</li>
  <li>Additional payments for individuals</li>
  <li>Transfers</li>
</ol>

<p>We will shortly publish new funding rules, reflecting the updated policy, which will apply to 2018 to 2019.</p>

<h3>Apprenticeship funding band structure</h3>

<p>Following our consideration of the current funding band structure, we have decided to move to a new 30 band structure for new starts from August 2018. This new structure will include more bands, with fewer levels between bands. The upper limit of the highest funding band will remain at £27,000. These changes will not affect the funding bands for any apprentices who start before 1 August 2018.</p>

<p>We are working with the Institute for Apprenticeships (IfA) to ensure that any new standards that are approved for delivery are allocated to one of the 15 current funding bands, which will apply until August, and to one of the new 30 funding bands, to take effect from August. For more information, read the new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-funding-from-may-2017">apprenticeships funding</a> policy paper.</p>

<h3>Inform/action</h3>

<h3>Transferring levy funds to another employer</h3>

<p>If an employer who pays the apprenticeship levy doesn’t plan to use all of the funds in their apprenticeship service account, they can now make a transfer to another employer to support them in taking on apprentices.</p>

<p>Transfers are the first big flexibility we are offering to employers to help make apprenticeships work better for everyone, enabling larger employers to support other employers in their supply chain, sector or local area.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	Dress codes guidance</h2>

<h3>Inform/action</h3>

<p>New guidance has been published on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dress-codes-and-sex-discrimination-what-you-need-to-know" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a> for employers who set dress codes, for employees and job applicants who may have to abide by them. This guidance was written following recommendation from the Parliamentary Women and Equalities Select Committee and the Petitions Committee. The guidance sets out how the law might apply in cases of sex discrimination where an employer may require, for example, a female member of staff to wear high heels, make-up or hair at particular length or style.</p>

These apprenticeships are available at over 80 universities.</p>
