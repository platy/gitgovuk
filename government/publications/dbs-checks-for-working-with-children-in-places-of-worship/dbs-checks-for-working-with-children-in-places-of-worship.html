<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This leaflet explains eligibility for Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks within various faith groups. This guidance applies whether the individuals are paid or unpaid.</p>

<p>If your organisation employs people in these roles who have additional duties to those outlined in this leaflet, they may be eligible for a different level of check. You will need to refer to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-out-dbs-check">online eligibility tool</a> and guidance to check this out. If your organisation employs people in different roles who perform similar duties to those in this leaflet, you should refer to our online guidance as they may be eligible for the same level of check.</p>

<p>Any changes to a role or the activities that a person carries out can affect the level of check that is applicable. For more information please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/%20collections/dbs-eligibility-guidance">eligibility guidance</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to criminal record checks in England, Wales, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>Information on checks available in Scotland can be obtained from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mygov.scot/working-jobs/finding-a-job/disclosure" rel="external">Disclosure Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>Information on checks available in Northern Ireland can be obtained from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/information-and-services/accessni-criminal-record-checks/apply-accessni-check" rel="external">Access NI</a>.</p>

<p>We have used some scenarios in this leaflet to help you understand how the guidance works in practice.</p>

<h2>Eligibility when working with children</h2>

<p>The main activities that are likely to occur in faith settings which will make a role eligible for a DBS check when working with children are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>teaching, training or instructing children</li>
  <li>care of children</li>
  <li>providing advice and guidance wholly or mainly to children in relation to their emotional, physical or educational wellbeing – e.g. advice on staying healthy while fasting, educational advice when considering a life of faith or emotional guidance when going through difficult times in life such as bereavement</li>
  <li>driving children</li>
  <li>day-to-day management of people undertaking these activities</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone undertaking these activities on more than 3 days in any 30-day period will be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List.</p>

<p>Anyone undertaking these activities overnight between 2am and 6am with contact with the children would also be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List. If someone does these activities but less often they will be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check without the Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<h2>Faith leaders</h2>

<p>Where a faith leader’s only role is to lead prayer sessions they can apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/basic-dbs-checks-guidance">Basic DBS check</a>.</p>

<p>If it is part of their role to provide pastoral care, which involves giving advice and guidance on emotional, physical or educational wellbeing to children and they do this on more than 3 days in a 30- day period they can be asked to apply for an Enhanced DBS check with a Children’s Barred List check. If, however, they do this less often but on more than one occasion they can apply for an Enhanced DBS check without a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<h3>Scenario one</h3>

<p>John runs a group for children dealing with family bereavement. His role is to provide advice and guidance on emotional wellbeing and help them deal with their feelings. The group meets each Tuesday. John would be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List. This is because he is providing advice and guidance wholly or mainly to children in relation to their emotional, physical or educational wellbeing on more than 3 days in a 30-day period.</p>

<h2>Drivers</h2>

<p>Anyone who drives children or youth groups on more than 3 days in a 30-day period can get an Enhanced DBS check with a Children’s Barred List check (regulated activity). If they do it less often they can get an Enhanced DBS check without a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<h3>Scenario two</h3>

<p>Hadir drives a youth group to and from various events for his place of worship. He does this on one day per month. Hadir would be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check without a check of the Children’s Barred List. This is because he is driving children less often than would be required for the Barred List check.</p>

<p>Anyone who teaches children on more than 3 days in a 30-day period can get an Enhanced DBS check with a Children’s Barred List check. If they do it less often they can get an Enhanced DBS check without a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<p>If an individual does not teach the children but is responsible for their care or supervision on more than 3 days in a 30-day period can get an Enhanced DBS check with a children’s Barred List check. If they do it less often they can get an Enhanced DBS check without a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<h2>A teacher or children’s leader</h2>

<p>Anyone who teaches children on more than 3 days in a 30-day period can get an Enhanced DBS check with a Children’s Barred List check. If they do it less often they can get an Enhanced DBS check without a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<p>If an individual does not teach the children but is responsible for their care or supervision on more than 3 days in a 30-day period can get an Enhanced DBS check with a Children’s Barred List check. If they do it less often they can get an Enhanced DBS check without a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<h3>Scenario three</h3>

<p>Talisha cares for and supervises young children in the faith centre while their parents and guardians attend services on weekends and during certain religious festivals. Talisha would be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List. This is because she is caring for and supervising children on more than 3 days in a 30-day period.</p>

<h2>Management staff</h2>

<p>An individual whose role is limited to leadership, strategy, policy or caretaking can get a Basic DBS check.</p>

<p>If they have responsibility for the day-to-day management of staff or volunteers who are eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a Children’s Barred List check they can get the same level of check as the people they are responsible for.</p>

<h3>Scenario four</h3>

<p>Mary manages the volunteers at her place of worship. Some of the volunteers she manages are responsible for providing care and supervision for children on more than 3 days in a 30-day period.  As their manager she is eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List. This is because the volunteers she manages on a day-to-day basis would be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List.</p>

<h2>Caretakers</h2>

<p>Anyone whose work is limited to cleaning, locking up or building maintenance can get a Basic DBS check.</p>

<h2>A member of the kitchen staff</h2>

<p>If their only role is to cook and serve food they can get a Basic DBS check.</p>

<p>If they have responsibility for supervising children during breaks or mealtimes on more than 3 days in a 30-day period they can get an Enhanced DBS check with a Children’s Barred List check. If they do this but less often they can get an Enhanced DBS check without a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<h2>Volunteer security guard</h2>

<p>The role of a volunteer security guard only allows for a Basic DBS check. If the volunteer is licenced by the SIA (Security Industry Authority) they will have had a Standard DBS check to obtain that licence.</p>

<h2>Youth activity workers</h2>

<p>Where they are responsible for teaching, caring for or supervising children on more than 3 days in a 30-day period and are not supervised, they can get an Enhanced DBS check with a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<p>If they are sufficiently supervised by someone with an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List then they can get an Enhanced DBS check without a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<p>A youth activity worker who is responsible for providing advice and guidance on emotional, physical and educational wellbeing to children on more than 3 days in a 30-day period can get an Enhanced DBS check with a Children’s Barred List check. If they do this less often they can get an Enhanced DBS check without a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<h3>Scenario five</h3>

<p>Mubarak runs a youth group which helps children to live the values of their faith through supporting the local community. Mubarak is responsible for the care and supervision of the children while they are attending the youth group activities. They meet once a week.</p>

<p>Mubarak would be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List. This is because 
he is caring for and supervising children on more than 3 days in a 30-day period.</p>

<h2>Overnight and residential stays</h2>

<p>Where children stay overnight, at a youth camp or religious festival for example, without their parents or legal guardians caring for them, the staff or volunteers responsible for the children will be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List if they are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the care or supervision of children other than their own overnight between 2am and 6am, with the opportunity for face-to-face contact – even if this is done only once</li>
  <li>teaching, training or instructing children other than their own during this time or providing them with advice and guidance on their physical, emotional or educational wellbeing between 2am and 6am</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be staff or volunteers at youth camps or festivals who have responsibility for the children during the day rather than overnight who would be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with or without a Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<p>If they are responsible for the care or supervision of children on more than 3 days in a 30-day period they will be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List. If they do this less often they will be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check without the Children’s Barred List check.</p>

<p>If they are responsible for teaching, training or instructing children on more than 3 days in a 30-day period they will be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check with a check of the Children’s Barred List. If they do this less often, they will be eligible for an Enhanced DBS check without a check of the Children’s Barred List.</p>
