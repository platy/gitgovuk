<h2>Who is likely to be affected</h2>

<p>Those that are likely to be affected are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>businesses that make distance sales of goods between Northern Ireland and the European Union (EU) or import goods into Northern Ireland and the EU from non-EU countries, including Great Britain</li>
  <li>businesses involved in the import of goods into Northern Ireland from the rest of the world (RoW) via Great Britain</li>
  <li>businesses and individuals seeking repayment of overpaid import VAT in Great Britain and Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h2>General description of the measure</h2>

<p>This statutory instrument (<abbr title="statutory instrument">SI</abbr>) addresses issues identified in amendments made to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (VATA) by the Finance Act 2021 to implement the VAT e-commerce package. The <abbr title="statutory instrument">SI</abbr> also amends legislation to remove the potential for double taxation of certain goods that move from the rest of the world to Northern Ireland via Great Britain. It also provides legal certainty for businesses and individuals in Great Britain and Northern Ireland for claiming a repayment of overpaid import VAT.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <abbr title="statutory instrument">SI</abbr> makes a minor amendment to remove the potential for ambiguity.</p>

<h2>Policy objective</h2>

<p>On 1 July 2021 the EU VAT e-commerce package was introduced and provided for 2 new simplified VAT accounting schemes: the One Stop Shop (<abbr title="One Stop Shop">OSS</abbr>) and the Import One Stop Shop (<abbr title="Import One Stop Shop">IOSS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Both accounting schemes are optional for businesses and are designed to reduce the administrative burdens of paying VAT on sales of goods and imports into Northern Ireland and the EU. The <abbr title="One Stop Shop">OSS</abbr> scheme allows businesses established in Northern Ireland or the EU to both register and account for the VAT on supplies of goods to customers in Northern Ireland or the EU through one simplified system, where those supplies exceed the threshold of £8,818. The <abbr title="Import One Stop Shop">IOSS</abbr> scheme is a simplified accounting scheme to be made available to those businesses who wish to use it to facilitate the collection of VAT on imports of non-excise goods in consignments valued up to £135 in value to customers in Northern Ireland and the EU.</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="One Stop Shop">OSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Import One Stop Shop">IOSS</abbr> schemes were provided for, existing legislation was amended to make sure that <abbr title="One Stop Shop">OSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Import One Stop Shop">IOSS</abbr> returns were included in the list of returns on which penalties for inaccuracies may be applied. The current wording only applies to returns submitted to HMRC and therefore excludes returns submitted in the EU for VAT on sales to Northern Ireland consumers. The measure amends legislation to make sure that penalties apply to all <abbr title="One Stop Shop">OSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Import One Stop Shop">IOSS</abbr> scheme users that make supplies in Northern Ireland whether registered in the UK or in the EU.</p>

<p>The measure also makes minor amendments to align the provision that currently applies to non-UK <abbr title="One Stop Shop">OSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Import One Stop Shop">IOSS</abbr> users with that which applies to UK <abbr title="One Stop Shop">OSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Import One Stop Shop">IOSS</abbr> users. These changes are in relation to penalties, interest, and adjustments to assessments and overpayments.</p>

<p>Where any import VAT paid on goods is no longer due, the person who has paid it is entitled to claim a repayment. Existing legislation provides both the right to, and mechanism for, the repayment of overpaid import VAT in Great Britain in the majority of cases. However, domestic legislation does not provide for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VAT registered businesses to be able to reclaim overpaid import VAT through their VAT return where they did not originally account for the import VAT on a return</li>
  <li>either the right to, or mechanism for, repayment of overpaid import VAT to businesses and individuals in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>The measure amends legislation to address these deficiencies and provides legal certainty in relation to repayment of overpaid import VAT.</p>

<p>There is the potential for 2 charges to import VAT to arise on goods sent in consignments valued above £135 (and consignments of any value containing excise and non-commercial goods) imported into Northern Ireland from rest of the world via Great Britain. Where rest of the world goods are imported directly into Northern Ireland, import VAT is chargeable when the goods are declared to Customs in Northern Ireland. However, in some cases goods are declared in Great Britain before they are transported to Northern Ireland which creates a charge to import VAT in Great Britain. Under the terms of the Protocol goods moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are subject to import VAT on entry to Northern Ireland, so under current VAT legislation, a second charge to VAT occurs when the goods enter Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>In practice the second charge to import VAT in Northern Ireland is not levied because the goods are either moved without a declaration (through a declaration waiver) or are declared as domestic goods. However, to address the potential for double taxation on these goods this measure introduces a provision to offset any import VAT paid in Great Britain against the VAT due on the goods on entry to Northern Ireland. The measure also provides a power for the Commissioners for HM Revenue and Customs (the Commissioners) to specify how any amount of VAT in Northern Ireland, which exceeds the amount of credit, must be accounted for and paid in a public notice.</p>

<p>It also makes a minor amendment to legislation to make sure clarity for the reader.</p>

<h2>Background to the measure</h2>

<p>The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and the transition period after EU exit ended at 11pm on 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Together, these amendments provide legal certainty and to make sure that the VAT system operates as required and intended.</p>

<h4>Other Changes</h4>

<p>A new regulation 121E is inserted into the VAT Regulations to provide that, where a person that is registered, or required to be registered, for VAT in Great Britain has not accounted for import VAT on the VAT return, and the import VAT has been overpaid, the repayment can be claimed on the VAT return.</p>

<p>New regulations 133AN, 133AO and 133AP are inserted into the VAT Regulations. Regulation 133AN sets out when a person in Northern Ireland is entitled to a repayment of overpaid import VAT for the purposes of new regulations 133AO and 133AP.</p>

<p>Regulation 133AO provides that where a person that is not registered, or required to be registered, for VAT or a person acting on behalf of that person, has overpaid import VAT they may make an application for a repayment of the import VAT as if they fall within the Import Duty Regulations. Regulation 133AP replicates the provisions in new regulation 121E for a person that is registered, or required to be registered, for VAT in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Paragraph (1) of regulation 133E of the VAT Regulations is substituted to remove the potential for ambiguity created by a previous amendment by regulation 45 of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2021 (<abbr title="statutory instrument">SI</abbr> 2021/715).</p>

<p>A new regulation 19A is inserted into the Value Added Tax (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. The regulation provides that, subject to certain conditions being met, a credit is provided for import VAT paid on goods when they are imported into Great Britain when those goods are moved to Northern Ireland for delivery there. It also provides a power for the Commissioners to specify how any amount of VAT in Northern Ireland, which exceeds the amount of credit, must be accounted for and paid in a public notice.</p>

<p>The measure is not expected to have an Exchequer impact.</p>

<h3>Economic impact</h3>

<p>The measure is not expected to have any significant economic impacts.</p>

<h3>Impact on individuals, households and families</h3>

<p>There is expected to be no impact on individuals. The measure provides legal certainty for individuals (and businesses) of the entitlement to, and mechanism for, the repayment of overpaid import VAT. Individuals that are entitled to make a claim will continue to follow the existing established process.</p>

<p>There is expected to be no impact on family formation, stability or breakdown.</p>

<h3>Equalities impacts</h3>

<p>It is not anticipated that there will be impacts for those in groups sharing protected characteristics.</p>

<p>A full equality impact assessment is not recommended</p>

<h3>Impact on business including civil society organisations</h3>

<p>The measure is expected to have a negligible impact on businesses and civil society organisations as it merely seeks make sure that the VAT system operates as required. Not addressing these issues could result in uncertainty for businesses and the inability to apply sanctions to defaulting businesses accounting for UK VAT in the <abbr title="One Stop Shop">OSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Import One Stop Shop">IOSS</abbr> schemes administered in EU member states.</p>

<p>One-off costs will include familiarisation with the rules to make sure businesses are compliant. There are not expected to be any further one off or continuing costs. Customer experience of dealing with HMRC as a result of this measure is expected to remain broadly the same as the changes do not change any processes or tax administration obligations.</p>

<h3>Operational impact (£million) (HMRC or other)</h3>

<p>It is not anticipated that implementing this change will incur any additional costs/savings for HMRC.</p>

<h3>Other impacts</h3>

<p>Other impacts have been considered and none has been identified.</p>

<h2>Monitoring and evaluation</h2>

<p>The measure will be kept under review through communication with affected taxpayer groups.</p>

<h2>Further advice</h2>

<h2>Declaration</h2>

<p>The Right Honourable Lucy Frazer QC MP, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has read this tax information and impact note and is satisfied that, given the available evidence, it represents a reasonable view of the likely costs, benefits and impacts of the measure.</p>
