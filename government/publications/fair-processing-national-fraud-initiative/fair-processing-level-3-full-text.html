<p>This notice sets out how we will use your personal data, and your rights. It is made under Article 14 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<h2>Your data</h2>

<h3>The data</h3>

<p>We process information that you provide when making a claim or applying for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pension</li>
  <li>taxi driver licence</li>
  <li>market trader license - voluntary</li>
  <li>personal alcohol licence - voluntary</li>
  <li>social housing (current tenants and individuals on a housing waiting list)</li>

  <li>COVID-19 financial support</li>

</ul>

<p>We process information that you provide when seeking payment of an invoice from an organisation that takes part in the NFI. This is referred to as trade creditor standing and payment history data.</p>

<p>We process information that you provide when seeking payment for employment from an organisation that takes part in the NFI. This is referred to as payroll data.</p>

<p>We process information that you provide when registering to vote. This is referred to as Electoral Register data.</p>

<p>We process information that you provide in relation to your council tax. We process information that you provide in relation to your business rates.</p>

<p>Data specifications setting out exactly what data we process in the above areas can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-fraud-initiative-public-sector-data-specifications">National Fraud Initiative: public sector data specifications page</a></p>

<h3>Criminal convictions</h3>

<p>Should data matching through the NFI result in a prosecution, then this may also be recorded by participating organisations. This information is for recording outcomes purposes only and the data won’t be shared further.</p>

<h3>Special categories of personal information (Article 9 of UK GDPR &amp; Chapter 2 Section 10 of the DPA 2018).</h3>
<p>Included in the above are certain special categories of personal information:</p>

<p>Housing benefit and student loan data includes an indicator of physical or mental health or condition. This disability flag, which does not identify the specific condition, is required as disability has an impact upon a student’s entitlement to claim housing benefit.</p>

<p>We collect information on blue badge holders (and applicants). While we do not hold information on the medical condition that entitles the individual to a badge we do know who has a badge.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose(s) for which we are processing your personal data is:</p>

<p>The Cabinet Office conducts data matching exercises to assist in the prevention and detection of fraud. This is one of the ways in which the Minister for the Cabinet Office takes responsibility within government for public sector efficiency and reform.</p>

<p>The NFI also conducts regular data sharing and analytics pilots to evaluate and improve data matching methodology. In this way the NFI can continue to help detect and prevent fraud in the most efficient and effective way possible.</p>

<h3>Automated profiling</h3>

<p>Your personal data will be subject to the following automated profiling (as defined in Article 4, paragraph 4 UK GDPR):</p>

<p>Data matching involves comparing sets of data, such as the payroll or benefits records of a body, against other records held by the same or another body to see how far they match. The data is usually personal information. The data matching allows potentially fraudulent claims and payments to be identified. Where a match is found it may indicate that there is an inconsistency that requires further investigation. ​No assumption can be made as to whether there is fraud, error or other explanation until an investigation is carried out.</p>

<p>The processing of data by the Cabinet Office in a data matching exercise is carried out with statutory authority under its powers in Part 6 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014. It does not require the consent of the individuals concerned under data protection legislation or the UK GDPR.</p>

<p>All bodies participating in the Cabinet Office’s data matching exercises receive a report of matches that they should investigate, so as to detect instances of fraud, over or under payments and other errors, to take remedial action and update their records accordingly.</p>

<h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is that processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller.					
The National Fraud Initiative is conducted using the data matching powers bestowed on the Minister for the Cabinet Office by Part 6 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 (LAAA).</p>

<p>Under the LAAA legislation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Cabinet Office may carry out data matching exercises for the purpose of assisting in the prevention and detection of fraud.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Cabinet Office may require certain bodies (as set out in the Act) to provide data for data matching exercises</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bodies may participate in its data matching exercises on a voluntary basis where the Cabinet Office considers it appropriate. Where they do so, the Act states that there is no breach of confidentiality and generally removes other restrictions in providing the data to the Cabinet Office. The requirements of the data protection legislation, however, continue to apply, so data cannot be voluntarily provided if to do so would be a breach of data protection legislation. In addition, sharing of patient data on a voluntary basis is prohibited.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Cabinet Office may disclose the results of data matching exercises where this assists in the prevention and detection of fraud, including disclosure to bodies that have provided the data and to auditors that it appoints as well as in pursuance of a duty under an enactment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Cabinet Office may disclose both data provided for data matching and the results of data matching to the Auditor General for Wales, the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland, the Auditor General for Scotland, the Accounts Commission for Scotland and Audit Scotland, for the purposes of preventing and detecting fraud.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wrongful disclosure of data obtained for the purposes of data matching by any person is a criminal offence. A person found guilty of the offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Cabinet Office may charge a fee to a body participating in a data matching exercise and must set a scale of fees for bodies required to participate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Cabinet Office must prepare and publish a ​<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-data-matching-practice-for-national-fraud-initiative">Code of Practice</a>​. All bodies conducting or participating in its data matching exercises, including the Cabinet Office itself, must have regard to the Code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Cabinet Office may report publicly on its data matching activities.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Special category data is personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. The legal basis for processing your special category personal data is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Article 9(g) UK GDPR: processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;</li>
</ul>

<p>The Cabinet Office conducts data matching exercises to assist in the prevention and detection of fraud. The processing of data by the Cabinet Office in a data matching exercise is carried out with statutory authority under its powers in Part 6 of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014.</p>

<p>Our legal basis for processing your criminal convictions data is paragraphs 6 and 10 of ​<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/schedule/1/enacted" rel="external">schedule 1​ to the Data Protection Act 2018</a>.</p>

<h3>The data that is matched and the reasons for matching it is for fraud prevention and detection:</h3>

<p>For information summarising the various match types for each particular type of participating organisation and the purpose of the matching please refer to the document​ ​<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-data-matching-practice-for-national-fraud-initiative">NFI match types per participating body</a>​.
We also provide the following services:</p>

<p>ReCheck</p>

<p>ReCheck is a flexible data matching service which complements the national exercise. This service allows NFI participant bodies to re-perform existing data matching, at a time that suits them, by uploading their organisation’s datasets for internal matching.</p>

<p>AppCheck</p>

<p>NFI participants can use this service at the point of application to check against NFI data to help verify people’s identity or if they have left out relevant information that might affect their entitlement to a benefit, service or employment.</p>

<p>FraudHub</p>

<p>Allows NFI participant bodies, who want to work together, to regularly and effectively screen their collective data in order to prevent errors in processing payments and to reduce fraud.</p>
