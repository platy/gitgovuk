<p>Losing someone close to you, whether it’s a family member, friend or colleague, can be devastating. This loss may be especially difficult during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic because you may not have been able to spend time with your loved one due to infection risks or may have been unable to say goodbye in the way you would have wanted.</p>

<p>Working in the social care sector, you may also grieve the loss of residents or care users, particularly those with whom you had a longstanding and meaningful relationship. This may be made more difficult if you cannot share details about work with your friends and family.</p>

<p>People grieve in different ways and there is no right or wrong way to react. When you’re grieving for someone, you may experience a range of emotions, including sadness, anger and guilt. You may also find it difficult to concentrate or experience a lack of motivation. You may experience these emotions immediately, or they may occur at a later stage. Many people find it helpful to reach out and talk to someone about their feelings, others may wish to deal with the loss in private.</p>

<p>We hope that the resources gathered here may help you during this very difficult time.</p>
