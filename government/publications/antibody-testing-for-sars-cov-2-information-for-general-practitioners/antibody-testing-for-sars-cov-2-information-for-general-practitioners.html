<h2>Context</h2>

<p>People are increasingly accessing antibody testing, either through various different surveillance studies, private providers, or directly through government-supported services. As more people access antibody tests there is an increasing chance that people approach health care professionals for advice, particularly after vaccination.</p>

<p>This guidance is intended to give healthcare professionals key information on how antibody tests should be interpreted.</p>

<h2>Antibody response against SARS-CoV-2</h2>

<p>Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 generate antibodies against the structural proteins of the virus. Most antibodies are made against parts of the spike (<abbr title="spike">S</abbr>) and nucleocapsid (<abbr title="nucleocapsid">N</abbr>) proteins. Tests available to NHS clinicians are lab-based and measure antibodies made against these proteins: anti-<abbr title="spike">S</abbr> or anti-<abbr title="nucleocapsid">N</abbr> antibodies. All SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently licensed in the UK, USA and EU contain only the <abbr title="spike">S</abbr> protein or gene. Therefore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anti-<abbr title="nucleocapsid">N</abbr> positive confirms previous infection</li>
  <li>anti-<abbr title="spike">S</abbr> positive confirms previous infection and/or response to vaccination</li>
</ul>

<p>In immune naive people, antibodies are made from 4 days post infection or immunisation (exposure) and become reliably detectable within 20 days of symptom onset, but can take longer.</p>

<p>It is not yet known what level of antibodies are protective against infection. It is highly likely that higher antibody levels are more protective than lower antibody levels; however, the ‘correlate of antibody derived protection from infection’ – that is the titre of anti-<abbr title="spike">S</abbr> neutralising antibody to prevent viral infection (sterilising protection) – for SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Therefore it is not possible to give individuals a binary answer as to whether they are fully protected from COVID-19, merely that they are better protected than if they had no antibodies. A person with antibodies is highly likely to be protected against severe disease.</p>

<h2>Antibody testing capability and uses</h2>

<p>Testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has several uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to determine if a patient is likely to benefit from monoclonal antibody (laboratory-made antibodies that attack the virus) treatments in hospital</li>
  <li>to distinguish active infections from persistent <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>-positivity, where dead parts of the virus are still detectable on a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> even though these cannot infect anyone</li>
  <li>to understand vaccine effectiveness, monitor the impact of variants of concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr>) and estimate prevalence of infection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 – current understanding</h2>

<p>Previous infection or immunisation are highly likely to provide effective protection from death and severe disease in those who are subsequently infected. This protection is highly likely to be similar across age groups.</p>

<p>It is almost certain that variants will continue to emerge and that the protective effect of prior exposure or vaccination will be reduced against at least some of these variants. For example, data suggests a full vaccination course is approximately 10% less protective against infection by Delta variant viruses than Alpha. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> regularly publishes technical information on variant and vaccine surveillance, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-surveillance-reports">vaccine surveillance reports (weeks 39 to 49)</a>.</p>

<p>T-cells (a type of immune cell) also play an important role in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection, but are much harder to measure than antibodies. A wholly T-cell driven response to SARS-CoV-2 is rare, and antibody testing remains the most accessible marker of immune response.</p>

<h2>Result interpretation and SARS-CoV-2 antibody mechanics</h2>

<p>The levels of antibody (antibody titre) produced after vaccination or infection vary. In general, more severe disease tends to lead to higher antibody titres once the patient has recovered from their first infection. Anti-<abbr title="spike">S</abbr> antibodies are present in the vast majority (greater than 99%) of individuals<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> 28 days after a full SARS-CoV-2 vaccination schedule.</p>

<p>Anti-<abbr title="spike">S</abbr> antibodies are detectable for at least 10 months following infection in most individuals, while anti-<abbr title="nucleocapsid">N</abbr> antibodies tend to decline faster. Waning of antibodies, even to levels below the detectable range, will likely not significantly reduce protection from severe disease due to the role of T and B cell driven immunological memory, although mild-transient or asymptomatic infections are highly likely to be possible. Anti-<abbr title="nucleocapsid">N</abbr> response after infection, in general, decays faster than anti-<abbr title="spike">S</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Assay types</h2>

<h3>Lab-based assays</h3>

<p>Lab-based assays are considered ‘gold-standard’. UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), NHS labs and certain private providers offer lab-based assays of blood samples against the anti-<abbr title="spike">S</abbr> or anti-<abbr title="nucleocapsid">N</abbr> response. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> regularly reviews the performance of antibody assays and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-laboratory-evaluations-of-serological-assays">you can find more information on these reviews on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h3>Point of care assays</h3>

<p>Point of care (<abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>) assays are, generally, less sensitive than lab-based assays. Clinical specificity varies between assays. These tests are routinely used in surveillance studies where results can be adjusted relative to performance of the assay of choice. <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> assays are not recommended for individual use but are a useful tool for surveillance and research studies.</p>

<h2>Evidence base</h2>

<p>Longitudinal surveys of reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and the antibody response over time are extensive in the UK. These include general population studies such as the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> COVID-19 Infection Survey and priority cohort surveillances such as healthcare workers (SIREN) and care home staff and residents (Vivaldi).</p>

<p>These studies have contributed to an emerging research picture underpinning the key observations outlined above. Read more on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-surveillance/covid-19-surveillance" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 surveillance and immunity studies</a>.</p>

<h2>Probabilistic language</h2>

<ul>
  <li>~0% to 8%: remote chance</li>
  <li>~10% to 20%: highly unlikely</li>
  <li>~25% to 35%: unlikely</li>
  <li>~40% to 50%: realistic possibility</li>
  <li>~55% to 75%: likely or probably</li>
  <li>~80% to 90%: highly likely</li>
  <li>~95% to 100%: almost certain</li>
