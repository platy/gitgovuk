<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>A Representative should only be declared to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> where, the Representative (party who will be responsible for the customs formalities), differs from the Declarant declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18.</p>

<p>For example, where the Representative contracts with a sub-agent to submit the customs declaration.  The sub-agent’s details are to be entered in the Declarant’s data elements, the Representative (who holds the contract with the Exporter to complete the customs formalities) will be entered in the Representative’s data elements.</p>

<p>Where a Representative’s details are required, the identification number (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) of the Representative should be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/20 where held.</p>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/19 is used to declare the Representative’s name and address and postcode.   This <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> should only be completed where a recognised <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is not held and declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/20.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Any person may appoint a representative (agent) to perform the acts and formalities laid down by customs rules.</p>

<p>Where self-representation is used, the details entered in the Declarant (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18) and Exporter (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/2) data elements should be the same and <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code 00400 must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 (Additional Information). <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/19, 3/20 and 3/21 (Representative) should be left blank.</p>

<h4>Use of Representatives or Agents to submit the declaration on the Exporter’s/ legal declarant’s behalf:</h4>

<p>Article 5(15) of Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013 (Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines the legal declarant as:</p>

<p>The person lodging a customs declaration in his or her own name or the person in whose name such a declaration is lodged.</p>

<p>Where the legal declarant (for example, Exporter) is completing the declaration themselves under ‘self-representation’, they shall be liable for the content of all declarations so completed and submitted.</p>

<p>Article 18 of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) permits customs representatives to be appointed to act on another person’s behalf. This representation may be:</p>

<p>Direct: The Representative acts in the name and of behalf of the other person.  The liability rests with the original party (usually the Exporter). This is dependent on the representative holding appropriate evidence of their empowerment to act on behalf of the original party and can demonstrate that the original party’s instructions have been followed.</p>

<p>Indirect: The Representative acts in their own name but on behalf of another person. The liability is held jointly and severally between both parties.</p>

<p>Article 5(6) of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines a representative as:</p>

<p>Any person appointed by another person to carry out the acts and formalities required under the customs legislation in his or her dealings with customs authorities.</p>

<h4>Direct Representation:</h4>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as a ‘direct’ representative, in the name of and on behalf of another person and is transmitting the declaration under the representative’s/ agent’s own user identity, the representative/ agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority of their powers to act. Failure to do so will result in liability resting with the representative.</p>

<p>In this example, the Representative’s details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarant’s identity). The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Direct, code ‘2’.</p>

<h4>Direct representation and sub-agents:</h4>

<p>Where a representative/ agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub-agent, and the sub-agent submits the declaration on behalf of the first agent but using the sub-agent’s user identity as the authentication credential; the sub-agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority to act and the instructions provided for the completion of the declaration’s particulars. Failure to produce written authority will result in liability resting with the sub-agent. The sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (Declarant’s identity).</p>

<p>The Representative, originally contracted to complete the customs declaration and formalities on behalf of the Exporter, must be declared as the Representative on the declaration and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/19 or 3/20 (Representative’s identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the Representative and the Exporter, not the sub-agent and any other party. The Representative retains responsibility for ensuring the declaration is made in accordance with the instructions provided by the Exporter.</p>

<h4>Indirect Representation:</h4>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as an ‘indirect’ representative in his/ her own name, but on behalf of another person, both parties accept joint liability for all data transmitted under the user identity. A representative or agent failing to state the level of representation on the electronic declaration will be deemed to be acting in his/ her own name and on his/ her own behalf.</p>

<p>In this example, the representative’s details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarant’s identity). The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Indirect, code ‘3’.</p>

<h4>Indirect representation and sub-agents:</h4>

<p>Where a representative/ agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub-agent, in an ‘indirect’ capacity on behalf of the first agent (but using the sub-agent’s user identity as the authentication credential), then the sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarant’s identity).</p>

<p>The Representative, originally contracted to complete the customs declaration and formalities on behalf of the Exporter, must be declared as the Representative on the declaration and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/19 or 3/20 (representative’s identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the Representative and the Exporter, not the sub-agent and any other party.</p>

<p>The Representative retains joint and several liability with the Exporter for the customs debt.</p>
