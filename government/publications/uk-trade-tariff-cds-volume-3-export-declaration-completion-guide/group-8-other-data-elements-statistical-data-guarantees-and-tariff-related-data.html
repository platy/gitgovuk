<p>*Financial leasing covers operations where the lease instalments are calculated in such a way as to cover all or virtually all of the value of the goods. The risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. At the end of the contract the lessee becomes the legal owner of the goods.</p>

<p>**Processing covers operations (transformation, construction, assembling, enhancement, renovation …) with the objective of producing a new or really improved item. This does not necessarily involve a change in the product classification. Processing activities on a processor’s own account are not covered by this item and should be registered under item 1 of column A.</p>

<h3>For Declaration Categories B1 and B4:</h3>

<p>This data element is not required where the commercial transaction for outward processing is a sales contract.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter the statistical value for the goods item in GBP (£ sterling), irrespective of the currency used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/11 (Total Amount Invoiced).</p>

<p>This data element must be completed as required by the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code completion notes (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> for details) or</li>

</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The statistical value is the approximate theoretical value of the goods at the time and place where they leave the territory of the Member State in which they were located at the time of release into the customs procedure (‘exporting Member State’). The statistical value is to relate to this Member State.</p>

<p>Therefore, the statistical value consists of the (intrinsic) value of the goods and the incurred or calculated cost for transport and insurance from their point of the transport related departure to the point of exit from this Member State.</p>

<p>To provide compatibility with the Export Control System (<abbr title="Export Control System">ECS</abbr>), this data element is restricted to ‘n..15,2’.</p>

<h4>Value of the goods</h4>

<h4>Statistical value is based on the value of the goods:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Value of the goods shall be the customs value, where it is determined (Title II, Chapter 3 of <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> “VALUE OF GOODS FOR CUSTOMS PURPOSES”)</li>
  <li>Where a customs value is not determined, the value of the goods shall be:
    <ul>
      <li>the cost of the goods to the purchaser abroad or</li>
      <li>if there is no sale, the price the goods would reasonably have fetched if sold to a non-related buyer and seller abroad.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It should include packing, inland and coastal transport in the UK, dock dues, loading charges and all other costs, profits, charges and expenses.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>To be included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Insurance and commission accrued up to the point where the goods are deposited on board the exporting vessel or aircraft.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be excluded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Outward sea/air freight and marine/air insurance.</li>
  <li>Any cash or trade discounts to the purchaser abroad should be deducted.</li>
  <li>Any national taxes e.g., VAT, Excise and similar levies where they are not included in the price actually paid or payable or not borne by the trading partner/ purchaser.</li>
  <li>Agricultural export refunds.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other costs</h4>

<p>The statistical value must include only ancillary charges. These are the actual or calculated costs for transport and, if they are incurred, for insurance, but covering only that part of the journey which is within the statistical territory of the exporting Member State. If transport or insurance costs are not known, they are to be assessed reasonably on the basis of costs usually incurred or payable for such services (considering especially, if known the different modes of transport).</p>

<h4>Other costs beyond the exporting Member State</h4>

<p>If the total overall ancillary charges cover a transport journey beyond the border of the exporting Member State, (e.g. under ‘CIF final destination’) these costs must be split up accordingly e.g. on a kilometre pro rata basis.</p>

<h4>Other costs relating to more than one item on the export declaration</h4>

<p>If the ancillary charges relate to several items on an export declaration, the respective ancillary costs for each individual item must be calculated on a relevant pro rata basis, e.g. kg or volume.</p>

<h3>Statistical Value in the Case of Processing (Export)</h3>

<h4>Exports for outward processing</h4>

<p>For goods which are to temporarily leave the Union for processing, the statistical value is only required where the commercial transaction is not a sales contract, but a contract for services (a ‘processing’ contract):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The statistical value must be established by taking the value at the time of export of the unprocessed goods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to the specific Procedure Code completion notes in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Note: Do not complete <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/6 for Outward Processing on a B2 declaration category where the commercial transaction is a sales contract.</p>

<h4>Re-exports after inward processing</h4>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/6 (statistical value) should only be completed in circumstances where there was no sales contract for the original importation of the unprocessed products.</p>

<p>For goods which leave the Union after having undergone processing, the statistical value must be established by taking the value of the previously imported unprocessed goods plus the value added in the Union during the processing.</p>

<h4>Currency conversion</h4>

<p>The Statistical Value must be expressed in the national currency of the Member State where the customs declaration is lodged. Values which are, for example, on documents, expressed in another currency (for example, invoiced currency of the goods), need to be converted.</p>

<p>The rate of exchange to be used is the rate applicable at the time the customs declaration is accepted, and according to Union customs provisions on currency conversion relating to the determination of the customs value (Article 146 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>-IA).</p>
