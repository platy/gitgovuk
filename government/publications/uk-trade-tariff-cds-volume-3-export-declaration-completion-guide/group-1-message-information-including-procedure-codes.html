<p>This data element is only required on paper declarations.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Where, as a result of declaration processing, it is determined that customs will accept a declaration without the need for the presentation of the paper copy, the user identity used to lodge a declaration with <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will replace the hand-written signature as the authentication credential for that declaration.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> role identified by the user identity will determine the liability for all data transmitted in that declaration. In a paperless environment the user identity will have the same legal status as the hand-written signature on the paper declaration.</p>

<p>Individual liability will rest with the signatory within the company for the use of that credential (for instance, the user identity). If there is to be a change of person who will act as signatory, this must be notified immediately to HMRC in writing, whereupon its records will be updated.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<h4>Authorised Signatories:</h4>

<p>The declaration must be signed according to the following rules. If the Exporter is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An individual, by that individual or an employee who has been authorised in writing</li>
  <li>A partnership, by one of the partners, or one of their employees authorised in writing by a partner</li>
  <li>A company incorporated in the UK under the companies acts, by a director or the company secretary, or an employee of the company authorised in writing by a director or the company secretary</li>
  <li>A corporation incorporated in the UK by statute, by a person authorised by law to sign for the corporation, or an employee of the corporation authorised in writing by such a person</li>
  <li>A foreign firm or company, or a corporation incorporated abroad by statute, by a person authorised by the law of the country in which the firm or company, is established</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, the declaration may be signed on behalf of the Exporter by any firm, company or individual to whom the Exporter has given the authority to act as a declarant for customs purposes. The manner of authorisation is a matter of arrangement between exporters and their declarant but, in giving authority to a Declarant, the Exporter will be assumed to have given authority to the clerks and servants authorised by the agent to carry out all of the Exporterâs customs business. Customs may at any time require evidence that a declarant has been authorised by an Exporter to sign declarations on the Exporterâs behalf.</p>

<h4>Paper Declarations:</h4>

<p>Where paper-based declarations are concerned, the original of the handwritten signature of the person concerned must be given on the copy of the declaration, which is to remain at the office of export, followed by the full name of that person. Where that person is not a natural person, the signatory should add his capacity after his signature and full name.</p>

<p>In signing <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/8, a legal declaration is being made that the details shown on the form and any continuation sheets are true and complete and that the requirements of any national or Union legislation have been met.</p>

<p>When a declaration partly completed in another member state is being used as the export declaration, the person signing <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/8 is committing themselves to the accuracy of all the information on the form, including that which was already completed when they received the document.</p>

<h4>Use of Representatives or Agents to submit the declaration on the Exporterâs/ legal declarantâs behalf:</h4>

<p>Article 5(15) of Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013 (Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines the legal declarant as:</p>

<p>The person lodging a customs declaration in his or her own name or the person in whose name such a declaration is lodged.</p>

<p>Where the legal declarant (for example, Exporter) is completing the declaration themselves under âself-representationâ, they shall be liable for the content of all declarations so completed and submitted.</p>

<p>Article 18 of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) permits customs representatives to be appointed to act on another personâs behalf.  This representation may be:</p>

<p>Direct: the representative acts in the name and of behalf of the other person. The liability rests with the original party (usually the Exporter). This is dependent on the representative holding appropriate evidence of their empowerment to act on behalf of the original party and can demonstrate that the original partyâs instructions have been followed.</p>

<p>Indirect: The Representative acts in their own name but on behalf of another person. The liability is held jointly and severally between both parties.</p>

<p>Article 5(6) of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines a representative as:</p>

<p>Any person appointed by another person to carry out the acts and formalities required under the customs legislation in his or her dealings with customs authorities.</p>

<h4>Direct Representation:</h4>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as a âdirectâ representative, in the name of and on behalf of another person and is transmitting the declaration under the representativeâs/ agentâs own user identity, the representative/ agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority of their powers to act. Failure to do so will result in liability resting with the representative.</p>

<p>In this example, the representativeâs details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarantâs identity). The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Direct, code â2â.</p>

<h4>Direct representation and sub-agents:</h4>

<p>Where a representative/ agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub-agent, and the sub-agent submits the declaration on behalf of the first agent but using the sub-agentâs user identity as the authentication credential; the sub-agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority to act and the instructions provided for the completion of the declarationâs particulars. Failure to produce written authority will result in liability resting with the sub-agent. The sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18  (Declarantâs identity).</p>

<p>The Representative, originally contracted to complete the customs declaration and formalities on behalf of the Exporter, must be declared as the Representative on the declaration and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/19 or 3/20 (Representativeâs identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the Representative and the Exporter, not the sub-agent and any other party. The Representative retains responsibility for ensuring the declaration is made in accordance with the instructions provided by the Exporter.</p>

<h4>Indirect Representation:</h4>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as an âindirectâ representative in his/ her own name, but on behalf of another person, both parties accept joint liability for all data transmitted under the user identity. A representative or agent failing to state the level of representation on the electronic declaration will be deemed to be acting in his/ her own name and on his/ her own behalf.</p>

<p>In this example, the representativeâs details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarantâs identity). The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Indirect, code â3â.</p>

<h4>Indirect representation and sub-agents:</h4>

<p>Where a representative/ agent delegates the making of a declaration to a sub-agent, in an âindirectâ capacity on behalf of the first agent (but using the sub-agentâs user identity as the authentication credential), then the sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarantâs identity).</p>

<p>The Representative, originally contracted to complete the customs declaration and formalities on behalf of the Exporter, must be declared as the Representative on the declaration and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/19 or 3/20 (representativeâs identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the Representative and the Exporter, not the sub-agent and any other party.</p>

<p>The Representative retains joint and several liability with the Exporter for the customs debt.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter the total number of items declared on the customs declaration. The number of items must correspond to the total number of âdescription of goodsâ (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/8) completed.</p>

<p>The maximum number of items that is to be entered is 999. If there are more than 999 items, then further declarations must be submitted for the balance of the items.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>If a declaration is amended and a goods item is removed, the âtotal number of itemsâ data element must be amended to declare the new total.</p>

<p>For example, if on a 12-item declaration, item number 11 is removed in an amendment, then the total number of items must be updated to declare 11. However, as explained under <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/6 item 12 must not be re-numbered.</p>

<p>For paper declarations: Any âdescription of goodsâ (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/8) data elements on the declaration continuation sheets which are not used must be crossed through.</p>
