<p>This data element is mandatory.</p>

<p>This data element must always be completed to identify a previous declaration or previous document(s).</p>

<h3>Additional Declaration Type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2) Z</h3>

<p>Where Previous Document Type CLE is declared at item level, it must not be declared at header level.</p>

<h3>Master Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>) and Declaration Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>)</h3>

<p>For exports the Master Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>) must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 using the Previous Document Type code ‘MCR’.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and any <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> part numbers must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 using the Previous Document Type codes ‘DCR’ and ‘DCS’ respectively.</p>

<p>For exports, the <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>, <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> part numbers (DCS) must always be declared at header level.</p>

<h3>For removals from warehouse and <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>):</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to be declared on the re-export declaration, is the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> associated with the stock record for the re-export of the goods. It is not the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> used to originally enter the goods to warehousing or <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>A previous declaration, or document, is identified by class, type, reference and the goods item number. The goods item number element in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 may be omitted where the previous document comprised a single goods item.</p>

<p>Previous document types, other than MCR and DCR, should only be declared at header level where they apply to every goods item on the declaration.</p>

<p>The Procedure Code completion notes in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> give guidance on the codes expected to be used in specific circumstances for the procedure concerned.</p>

<p>They are not a definitive guide however and should be read in conjunction with the full list provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/previous-document-codes-for-data-element-21-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 3: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1: Previous Document Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Each previous document entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1, is declared as an alpha numeric code (an..42), made up of four components:</p>

<h4>First component: Document Category (a1)</h4>

<p>The first component (a1) consists of a letter and is used to distinguish between the two categories mentioned below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The simplified declaration (regular use) or the entry in the declarant’s records, represented by ‘Y’</li>
  <li>The previous document, represented by ‘Z’.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: Y (used on supplementary declarations to represent simplified procedures (regular use)).</p>

<h4>Second component: Previous document type (an..3)</h4>

<p>The second component (an..3), consists of a combination of digits and/ or letters, serves to identify the type of document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose the appropriate code from the list in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/previous-document-codes-for-data-element-21-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 3: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1: Previous Document Codes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, code: SDE (to represent the export simplified declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2: codes C&amp;F)</p>

<h4>Third component: Previous document reference (an..35)</h4>

<p>The third component (an..35) represents the data needed to recognise the document.  Enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The identification number or another recognisable reference of the document.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the MRN of the previous simplified declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2: codes C&amp;F).</p>

<h4>Fourth component: Goods item identifier (n..3)</h4>

<p>The fourth component (n..3) is used to identify which item of the previous document is being referred to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The goods item number on the exit summary declaration (<abbr title="Exit Summary Declaration">EXS</abbr>), simplified declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2: codes C&amp;F), entry in records or other previous document.</li>
  <li>This should be separated from the document reference number by ‘-‘.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: 2 (to identify that this reference refers to the second item on the previous document).</p>

<p>Where the previous document referred to contained only a single goods item, this component may be left blank.</p>

<p>Please note that the item number to be declared in this component is the item number from the previous document. It is not the item number from the current declaration.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>On paper declarations: the details are separated with a dash in the format &lt;class &gt; - &lt; type &gt; - &lt; reference &gt; - &lt;goods item number&gt; (for example, Z-380-12345-1).</p>

<p>References applicable to all items must be entered at header level, with a maximum number of 9,999 instances, with the exception of the <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> and <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> which must always be declared at header level for exports.</p>

<p>References not applicable to all items should be declared at item level, with a maximum number of 99 instances.</p>

<p>Please note that, due to compatibility with the Export Control System (<abbr title="Export Control System">ECS</abbr>), only the first 9 instances will be submitted to <abbr title="Export Control System">ECS</abbr> (where applicable).</p>

<h4>Electronic Licences:</h4>

<p>Where an electronic licence quotes a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, to ensure successful matching, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> must be the same as the one quoted on the electronic licence.</p>

<h4>Master Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>) consolidation</h4>

<p>The Master UCR or <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> must be declared at header level using Previous Document Type code MCR.</p>

<p>Whereas a declaration UCR directly relates to an individual <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> declaration, master UCRs are normally used to associate or link several declaration UCRs. For example, when a container holds a number of consignments from different exporters, each of whom has a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Rather than quoting many individual DUCRs for each consignment or consolidators, the inventory systems can advise <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> that each of the Declaration UCRs in the container is associated with a single Master UCR.</p>

<p>Master UCRs can be associated with other Master UCRs. Although a Master UCR can be associated with one or many Declaration UCRs a Declaration UCR can only belong to one Master UCR.</p>

<p>Association can be done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at the time of declaration by advising the declaration UCR and master UCR on the declaration</li>
  <li>by an explicit association transaction through which one can also:
    <ul>
      <li>dis-associate a UCR from a Master UCR</li>
      <li>associate a Master UCR or Declaration UCR with a (higher level)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>by authorised traders (such as loaders and inventory systems) on arrival (anticipated and/or actual) at a border location-by providing the Declaration UCR and Master UCR in the arrival message</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> should only be completed according to the commercial rules for that type of traffic and/or location. For example, in the air environment would normally be the Master/Simple Air Waybill number or for approved courier traffic the Courier Baggage Voucher (<abbr title="Courier Baggage Voucher">CBV</abbr>) reference.</p>

<h4>Format of the <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Master UCR (MUCRs) have one of the formats listed below</p>

<h4>For Air</h4>

<p>Use A:</p>

<ul>
  <li>either 3 alpha characters</li>
  <li>a maximum of 8 numbers</li>
  <li>a maximum length of 13 characters overall</li>
</ul>

<h4>For courier traffic</h4>

<p>Use C:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 alpha characters</li>
  <li>at least 4 more alphanumeric</li>
</ul>

<p>The courier <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> must be at least 8 numbers long.</p>

<h4>Other <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> formats</h4>

<ul>
  <li>GB/iii-s…s - GB = country, then followed by 3 characters identifying the inventory system and then at least another 5 alpha/numeric characters (minimum 12 characters in total)</li>
  <li>GB/iiii-s…s - same as above yet with 4-character inventory reference (minimum 13 characters in total)</li>
  <li>GB/<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>-s…s - GB, followed by the slash, then a valid <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>, hyphen and then at least one alpha or numeric character</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules about what other characters are allowed in a <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> are the same as for <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, for example restricted to numbers, upper case letters and certain special characters viz. 0 to 9, A to Z, -, (and).</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> is entered, then a <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> message must also be submitted to shut the consolidation once all the declarations have been associated with the <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Completion Rules:</h4>

<h4>For removals from warehouse and <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>:</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to be declared on the re-export declaration, is the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> associated with the stock record for the re-export of the goods. It is not the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> used to originally enter the goods to warehousing or <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Declaration UCR or <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be declared at header level using Previous Document Type code DCR.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and an optional part reference must be unique and should comply with the rules and format as detailed in the ‘Recommended Format of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>’ section below.</p>

<p>The declaration of a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is mandatory for all declarations. The same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be supplied on all linked declarations, for example a simplified declaration (regular use) with its supplementary declaration.</p>

<p>It is important that simplified procedure (regular use) traders enter their own declaration UCR numbers (DUCRs) into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 Simplified Declaration/ Previous Document (third component using previous document type code ‘DCR’) as these are used to provide the audit trail between the initial declarations (simplified declaration and <abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr> entry), the linked supplementary declarations and any commercial documents.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/ Part is the main reference to the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> declaration for simplified procedures (regular use) purposes and can incorporate commercial references so that there is a single reference for accessing all related information in trade and customs computer systems. The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must contain the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number of the simplified procedures (regular use) authorised trader.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part Numbers:</h4>

<p>On supplementary declarations enter the related <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/ Part(s) for the linked simplified declarations (regular use) and <abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr> entries (initial declarations) using previous document type code ‘DCS’. If a supplementary declaration covers more than one initial declaration, use the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/ Part of the first initial declaration as the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/Part for the supplementary declaration at header level. The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>/ Parts of each of the other initial declarations are to be declared as separate ‘DCS’ previous documents in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 at header level.</p>

<h4>Recommended Format of <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The recommended format of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> reference number in the UK is the WCO format, which is created from the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Year’ - is the year in which the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated. For example, ‘9’ if allocated in 2019, ‘0’ if allocated in 2020 and ‘1’ if allocated in 2021. Therefore, for the year 2019, ensure the year component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> contains the single ‘9’ digit and not ‘19’. In 2020, enter the year as a single ‘0’ digit and not ‘20’</li>
  <li>‘Country’ - is the country where the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated</li>
  <li>‘<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>’ - is the identity of the trader as known to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). In the UK this is the 12-character <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number.  This must be the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number of the simplified procedures (regular use) authorised trader</li>
  <li>’-‘ - is a dash</li>
  <li>‘Reference’ - is a unique series of characters that the trader, whose <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is included in the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, devises and which provides an audit trail within traders’ commercial records. This component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is restricted to numbers, upper case letters and certain special characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is as follows: ‘9GB000000000000-12345’</p>

<p>This example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> would have been issued in 2019, in the UK, for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number ‘000000000000’, and with a trader reference number of ‘12345’.</p>

<h3>Notes on specific Union Additional Information Codes</h3>

<h3>Single Transport Contract (Union <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code ‘30500’)</h3>

<p>EU law allows indirect export movements to be processed outside of the Export Control System (<abbr title="Export Control System">ECS</abbr>) messaging system under a Single Transport Contract (<abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>).</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr> is a contract of carriage of goods cut from where the export starts to where the export ends (for example from Dublin to Shanghai). The fact that it may move through Other Member States (<abbr title="Other Member States">OMS</abbr>) on a number of different transport modes to make this journey and exit in, for example, the UK does not matter.</p>

<p>The only condition attached to a <abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr> is that it cannot exit the EU by road.</p>

<p>Exporters are required to specify that their goods are travelling under <abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>. The Export Declaration must include the Additional Information (<abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr>) code: ‘30500’ in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 and D/E 5/12 Office of Exit should show the office of exit as the customs office competent for supervising the goods at the time they were placed under the <abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>. For instance, the customs office of where the goods were placed under the <abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>, as per Article 329(7), Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447.</p>

<p>If the Customs authority at the point of exit in another Member State requests information on the <abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr> consignment, the carrier must provide one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the MRN of the export declaration</li>
  <li>a copy of the Single Transport Contract for the goods concerned</li>
  <li>the unique consignment reference number or the transport document reference number. (Where goods are presented in packages the number of packages must be provided. Where goods are presented in containers the container identification number must be provided.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on specific National Additional Information Codes</h3>

<p>The following declaration elements, previously declared as free text in box-44 of the SAD should be declared to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> using an <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement code and be declared, as required, in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2.</p>

<h3>Premises (National <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code ‘PREMS’)</h3>

<p>If the premises code in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) is that of a UK allocated warehouse, do not complete a <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 using the code: PREMS unless specifically instructed to do so by the Procedure Code completion notes, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> or details.</p>

<p>Insert the full name and address of the premises when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse) does not identify a UK allocated warehouse or</li>
  <li>Where otherwise directed by customs (see Procedure Code completion notes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Enter the Premises Country Code as a suffix to the Premises Name and Address separated by a ‘-‘.</p>

<h3>Export process where Transit procedure follows the export procedure (National <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code ‘TRANS’)</h3>

<p>All goods for export must obtain Customs clearance or “Permission to Progress” (P2P) from <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>. Where it is required that the goods must remain under Customs control on one of the transit procedures, they must subsequently be declared to the Transit (NCTS) system.</p>

<p>When using Transit to move exported goods, the Exporter/declarant should input the <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code: ‘TRANS’ into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 of the export declaration and D/E 5/12 Office of Exit should show the office of exit as the customs office of departure of the transit operation, as per Article 329(5), Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447, except for goods moving in excise duty suspense.</p>

<p>For excise suspense goods, the office of exit must be shown as the office where it is intended the goods will leave the territory of the EU, as per article 329(8) of Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447.</p>

<h3>Excise Registered Consignor (National <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code ‘<abbr title="Excise Registered Consignor">ECONR</abbr>’)</h3>

<p>Enter the Excise Registered Consignor’s identification number (for example, <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> or other identifier) as an <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> Statement using the code <abbr title="Excise Registered Consignor">ECONR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Please note: The e-AD (ARC) should be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (with the exception of Customs Supervised Exports using a standard declaration for direct exports only) as a document code reference using code C651. Document Code C658 may be used in place of C651 where <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> fallback is being used.</p>

<p>When the excise suspense goods are moving under transit, the TRANS Code should also be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 as an <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement.</p>

<p>Where goods are under duty suspension (including goods in excise suspension) and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 TRANS code is used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For excise suspense goods: the office of exit must be shown as the office where it is intended the goods will leave the territory of the EU, as per article 329(8) of Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447.</li>
  <li>For excise duty paid goods: the customs office of exit should be declared in accordance with the standard completion rules outlined in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/12 Customs office of exit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registered consignor (National <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code ‘<abbr title="Registered consignor">RCONR</abbr>’)</h3>

<p>Enter the UK trader’s <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> no. as an <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> Statement using the code <abbr title="Registered consignor">RCONR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where a foreign company (for example, one not registered in the UK) takes ownership of goods before export, although the foreign company will be responsible for the export (including obtaining customs clearance of the goods) it is the UK company who has to provide evidence of export to justify zero rating the supply for VAT purposes.</p>

<p>In these situations, to help the UK trader in obtaining this evidence of export, enter the UK traders <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number (without any GB prefix) in this data element.</p>

They are not a definitive guide however and should be read in conjunction with the full list provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Where the document code completion rules in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes">Appendix 2: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes</a> specify different rules to the main document code guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>, the rules specified in Appendices 1 and 2 take precedence.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires both Union and National document codes to be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, any Union Codes (beginning with a letter) must be declared first.</p>

<p>Each document type code has eight components: not all components are mandatory for all document codes.</p>

<h4>First Component: Document Type Code (an4) mandatory for all document codes declared</h4>

<p>The first component is a 4 character Document Type Code. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a> for a list of document codes which should be declared in specific circumstances. The Document Code appendix should be read in conjunction with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/find_commodity" rel="external">UK Integrated Online Tariff</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/find_commodity" rel="external">Northern Ireland Online Tariff</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes">Appendix 2: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes</a> for information on which Document Codes should be declared in order declare specific commodities or to use specific customs procedures.</p>

<h4>Second Component: Document Identifier and Part (an..35), see additional notes on the second component’s format for licences in the section below</h4>

<p>The second component comprises of two sub-components.</p>

<h4>Sub-component 1: Document Identifier (an..30)</h4>

<p>This sub-component is the document identifier. This is the reference number, as specified against the document type code in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>. This must identify the unique document, authorisation, licence or certificate being declared.</p>

<h4>Sub-component 2: Multi Line Document (Document Part) (an..5) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>Enter the line item (part) as required for the particular document.</p>

<p>For example, some licences cover many products with each defined as a line. The document part sub-component is used to identify the line number when required.</p>

<p>If omitted, it defaults to 1 and the attribution applies to the first (or only) line of the licence.</p>

<p>The line item number of the document is to be appended to the document identifier (completed in the first sub-component) separated by a dash (-).</p>

<p>For example: X0021234/16-3.</p>

<h4>Third Component: Document Status Code (a2) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>The third component is a Document Status Code (a2).  A full list of the document status codes may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-element-23-document-status-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5B: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document Status Codes</a>.</p>

<p>The document status code should be declared, as specified, by each document code.</p>

<p>The specific document status codes which may be used with each document code is specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Certain document type codes (for example, authorisation numbers) will not usually require a status code to be declared and where applicable this is specified against the document code in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Other document codes may be restricted in the document status codes which may be used, these are specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>A ‘Document identifier’ and ‘Reason’ must still be input when a waiver status code is used.  When declaring a waiver this can be entered as, for example, ‘Exempt’ in each field.</p>

<h4>Fourth component: Reason (an..35) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>Enter a free text description of the Reason where required by the Document Status Code.</p>

<p>Where the export goods are subject to specific measures, a Reason description should be entered in the fourth component of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>A reason must be supplied for some status values. For example: Status code UP, reason entered ‘eaten by dog, replacement in post’.</p>

<h4>Fifth Component: Issuing Authority (an..70) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>Enter a free text description of the Issuing Authority. This should be specific enough to identify the governing body responsible for issuing the licence or certificate.</p>

<h4>Sixth Component: Date of Validity, if required (n8) conditional</h4>

<p>The date of validity, if required, must be entered in the following date format: yyyymmdd.</p>

<h4>Licences and non-preference certificates:</h4>

<p>The date to be declared is the expiry date for the licence or certificate. Where the Document Code for the licence or certificate is listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-element-23-document-and-other-reference-codes-licence-types-imports-and-exports-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5C: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document and Other Reference Codes: Licence Types</a>, a date of validity must always be declared.</p>

<h4>Electronic Licences:</h4>

<p>Where an electronic licence is associated with a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> (for example DEFRA licences such as CHEDs),to ensure successful matching, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> should be the same as the one entered on the electronic licence.</p>

<h4>Write-off amounts:</h4>

<p>When declaring a waiver status code (XX or XW as appropriate) for the following document codes: <br>
9005; 9104; 9105; 9106<br>
a write off amount must be included in the seventh and eighth components of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 with an amount of ‘0’ after a recognised measurement unit (for example, ‘KGM0’).</p>

<h4>Open licence types</h4>

<p>Please note that when declaring an open licence, a write off amount must be included in the seventh and eighth components of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 for open licences.  The amount entered should be shown as ‘0’ after a recognised measurement unit (for example, ‘KGM0’).  This is required on border releases and supplementary declarations.</p>

<h4>Preferential Proofs of Origin</h4>

<p>For preferential proofs of origin (for example, EUR.1, GSP, Invoice Declarations, Statements of Origin), the date, if required to be declared by the specific document code, is the date of issue.</p>

<h4>Seventh component: Measurement unit and qualifier, if applicable: an..4 + conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>This is only required where a specific quantity and measurement type has to be decremented against a specific document. For example, a licence has been issued for a total quantity of liquids in litres.</p>

<p>Where the specific document requires a measurement unit and/ or qualifier to be declared, enter the appropriate code for the commodity’s/ document’s measurement unit type using the list provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measurement-unit-codes-for-data-elements-23-and-44-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 20: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/7 and 4/4: Measurement Unit Codes</a>.</p>

<p>For example, if the document requires a quantity in litres, enter the measurement unit code of LTR. The quantity of litres being declared should be entered against the eighth component: quantity.</p>

<p>If no quantity or measurement unit/ qualifier is required, this data element should be omitted.</p>

<h4>Eighth component: Quantity (n..16,6)</h4>

<p>Enter the quantity being attributed to the specific document identifier (second component).</p>

<p>Any decimal places declared (up to a maximum of 6 places) must be deducted from the total number of characters available for this component. For example, if 3 decimal places are used, then only 13 whole numbers may be used in front of the decimal place.</p>

<p>For example, if the document requires a quantity in litres, the measurement unit code of LTR will have been entered in the seventh component (measurement unit), followed by the quantity of litres being declared as a value here, in the eighth component, for example, 12.05.</p>

<h3>Authorisation for customs procedures</h3>

<p>If two or more procedures apply (for example OP and <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) the details for each should be entered as separate document references.</p>

<p>Authorisations are declared as a document reference in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, using a document code from the list in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>. The authorisation should be declared in the format outlined in the example below.</p>

<p>For example, Customs Supervised Exports (<abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Document code</th>
      <th scope="col">Document identifier: country code</th>
      <th scope="col">Document identifier: authorisation type code</th>
      <th scope="col">Document identifier: authorisation number</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>C676</td>
      <td>GB</td>
      <td><abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr></td>
      <td>The <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> approval number</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Enter the authorisation document reference held to use a customs procedure. This code consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Document Code an4</li>
  <li>Country Code a2;</li>
  <li>Decision type an..4;</li>
  <li>Unique identifier for the decision an..29</li>

<p>*Status Code EP</p>

<p>Status code EP, dependent on the quantities declared against the goods item and available quantities remaining on the licence will also exhaust the licence, preventing its further usage.</p>

<p>**Status Code EE</p>

<p>Please be aware that this will exhaust the licence. This should only be used where the specific goods item being declared will exhaust the licence in its entirety.</p>

<p>Using status code EE will prevent the licence from being available for use on any subsequent goods items or declarations.  Status code EE should only be used in instances where the specific goods item being declared will exhaust the licence in its entirety.</p>

<p>***Status Codes XX and XW</p>

<p>Where a document code permits the use of status codes ‘XX’ or ‘XW’, a statement supporting the use of those status codes must be provided in the fourth component: Reason (an..35) of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>LIC99 is not permitted in <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> and the specific licence or waiver document code with the appropriate statement supporting the claim to the waiver must be declared.</p>

<h3>Department for International Trade</h3>

<p>The declaration that the goods are subject to the Open General Export Licence is not required except for sensitive goods. All licences should be declared regardless if goods are sensitive. There is no longer a requirement to declare RPTID as an <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 for these types of licences.</p>

<h3>Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) export licences</h3>

<p>It is necessary to declare separately the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> authorisation and the licence/ certificate numbers.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 (Additional Information) enter the authorisation code ‘RPTID’ followed by the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> Registration Number.</p>

<p>The appropriate document code for the licence/certificate from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a> must be declared with its associated reference number. This will need to be declared as a separate item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<h3>Document Reference/Identifier and Part for licences (second component)</h3>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter the Document Reference/Identifier and Part, format: an..35.</p>

<p>The Document Reference for a licence is formatted: &lt; country code &gt; &lt; licence type &gt; &lt; licence identifier &gt; - &lt;Part&gt;.</p>

<p>Only enter a separator between the licence identifier and the part number. The licence identifier is not supplied when the status identifies that a particular licence is not being declared.</p>

<p>&lt; country code &gt; For all UK government department/agency issued licences/AFCs/ permits (including those which were originally issued in another member state, but which were subsequently re-issued - including any ‘extracts’ - by a UK government department/agency) enter ‘GB’.</p>

<p>For licences issued in another member state enter the relevant country code, for example for France enter ‘FR’.</p>

<p>&lt; licence type &gt; as identified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>&lt; licence identifier &gt; enter the licence identifier allocated by the issuing authority. If the licence does not have a reference enter the title of the licence. A licence identifier is not supplied when the status identifies that a particular licence is not being declared (for instance, status code is in the x-series).</p>

<p>For exports, the <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> and <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, using Previous Document Type codes MCR and DCR respectively, must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1, Previous Documents.  Please refer to that data element for completion rules.</p>

<p>This data element is optional and may be left blank.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>This data element is available for use by the declarant to record a commercial reference for their own purposes.</p>

<p>The format of the reference number may take the form of the WCO <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, which is created from the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Year’ - is the year in which the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated. For example, ‘9’ if allocated in 2019, ‘0’ if allocated in 2020 and ‘1’ if allocated in 2021</li>
  <li>‘Country’ - is the country where the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated</li>
  <li>‘<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>’ - is the identity of the trader as known to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). In the UK this is the 12-character <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number</li>
  <li>’-‘ - is a dash</li>
  <li>‘Reference’ - is a unique series of characters that the trader, whose <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is included in the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, devises and which provides an audit trail within traders’ commercial records. This component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is restricted to numbers, upper case letters and certain special characters</li>
</ul>

<p>An example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is as follows: ‘9GB000000000000-12345’</p>

<p>This example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> would have been issued in 2019, in the UK, for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number ‘GB000000000000’, and with a trader reference number of ‘12345’.</p>

<ul>
  <li>customs warehouse, or</li>
  <li>excise warehouse</li>
</ul>

<p>The premises declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 must have been approved by one of the EU Member States.</p>

<p>Separate declarations are required for goods being removed from different warehouses. The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code notes explain these restrictions in more detail.</p>

<p>Enter the ‘Identity of the warehouse’, which is in two components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type</li>
  <li>Warehouse identifier including Country Code</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not enter any separator or space between the two parts.</p>

<h4>First Component: Type (a1)</h4>

<p>*Type codes S and T may not be used with any warehouse identifier with a Country Code of GB.</p>

<h4>Second Component: Warehouse Identifier (including Country Code) (an..35)</h4>

<p>The warehouse identifier consists of two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The identification number for the warehouse issued by the authorising member state</li>
  <li>The Country Code for the authorising member state</li>
</ul>

<p>In the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>customs warehouses have a 7-digit reference</li>
  <li>excise warehouses have a 13-digit reference</li>
</ul>

<p>If the warehouse identity is not a UK allocated code (suffixed by ‘GB’), the premises name and address must be supplied as an <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> Statement in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 Additional Information, using <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code ‘PREMS’.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>An example of a Customs Warehouse Identification reference number is R1234567GB:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where R denotes a Type I public warehouse</li>
  <li>1234567 denotes the authorisation number for the warehouse</li>
  <li>GB denotes the authorising Member State</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of an Excise warehouse identity is YGB00001234567GB:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where Y denotes a non-customs warehouse</li>
  <li>GB00001234567 is the 13-character excise warehouse identifier</li>
  <li>GB denotes the authorising Member State</li>
</ul>

<h3>For goods being removed from a customs warehouse:</h3>

<p>All the items on a declaration being removed from a customs warehouse must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removed from the same dispatching customs warehouse (declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse)) and</li>
  <li>Have the previous procedure code of 71 (as the third and fourth digit) in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 (Procedure Code).</li>
