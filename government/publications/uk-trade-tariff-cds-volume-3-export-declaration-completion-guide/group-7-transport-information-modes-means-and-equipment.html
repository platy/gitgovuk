<p>If exact details are not available when the declaration is lodged, unknown may be entered, but details must be entered later. This can be done prior to re-arrival at the border using standard amendment procedures or use of the C81 procedure as appropriate if the goods have already been departed from the EU.</p>

<p>The identity of the means of transport must not be declared if <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/4 (Mode of Transport at the Border) is completed with 5 (Postal Consignments) or 7 (Fixed Transport Installation).</p>

<p>Leave this data element blank if the goods are not containerised or if it is not known whether they are containerised.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter the marks (letters and/or numbers) which identify the transport container.</p>

<p>Complete this data element if the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will be in a container at the point of leaving the EU, enter the container number(s).</li>
  <li>Are containerised but the container number(s) are not yet known (for example on a pre-lodged declaration), then enter ‘number(s) unknown’.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the exact details are not available when the declaration is lodged, unknown may be entered, but the details must be entered later. This can be done prior to arrival at the border using standard amendment procedures.</p>

<p>To avoid duplication, the container number need only be declared at header level where all items are to be shipped in a single container.</p>

<h4>Header versus item level:</h4>

<p>Where items on the declaration are packed into different containers, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/10 will need to show individual container numbers at item level.</p>

<p>Where the seal numbers declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/18 require alignment with container numbers, the container numbers must also be declared at header level.</p>

<h3>Air Transport:</h3>

<p>In the air mode, containers are special boxes to carry freight, strengthened and allowing horizontal or vertical transfers.</p>

<h3>Swap bodies and semi-trailers:</h3>

<p>In the context of this data element, the swap bodies and semi-trailers used for road and rail transport shall be considered as containers.</p>

<p>If applicable, for containers covered by the standard ISO 6346, the identifier (prefix) allocated by the International Bureau of Containers and Intermodal Transport (BIC) shall also be provided in addition to the container identification number.</p>

<p>For swap bodies and semi-trailers, the ILU (Intermodal Loading Units) code as introduced by the European EN 13044 standard shall be used.</p>

<h3>Modes of transport other than air:</h3>

<p>For modes of transport other than air, a container is a special box to carry freight, strengthened and stackable and allowing horizontal or vertical transfers.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Please refer to <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/9 for package type codes and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/cefact/recommendations/rec21/rec21rev1_ecetrd195e.pdf" rel="external">UN/ECE recommendation 21</a> on package types which includes the definition for containers.</p>

<p>The term container covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large, re-usable containers, for example, ISO types designed to be transported by road, rail, sea, or air</li>
  <li>Smaller re-usable types of containers of an internal volume of a cubic metre or more designed to be transported by road, rail, sea or air and capable of specialized handling without unloading</li>
  <li>Specialized re-usable containers designed to be used for the particular goods and transported by road, rail, sea or air</li>
  <li>Goods are to be regarded as containerised even when a container is mounted on a road vehicle or rail wagon</li>
</ul>

<p>On paper declarations precede the (list of) container numbers by CN% or, for part containers, by Part Container%, and separate each container number by a comma, for example Part Container%ABCU12345, BCDU234567, WXYU98765.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>In the case of combined transport or where several means of transport are used, the active means of transport is the one which propels the whole combination.</p>

<p>For example, in the case of a lorry on a seagoing vessel, the active means of transport is the ship. In the case of a tractor and trailer, the active means of transport is the tractor.</p>

<p>If exact details are not available when the declaration is lodged, unknown may be entered, but details must be entered later.</p>

<p>The nationality of the means of transport must not be declared if <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/4 (Mode of Transport at the Border) is completed with 2 (Rail Transport), 5 (Postal Consignments) or 7 (Fixed Transport Installation).</p>

<p>This can be done prior to re-arrival at the frontier using standard amendment procedures or use of the C81 procedure as appropriate if the goods have already finally departed from the EU.</p>

<p>On paper declarations: enter the transport identity followed, if required, by the transport nationality, separated by a dash (-).</p>
