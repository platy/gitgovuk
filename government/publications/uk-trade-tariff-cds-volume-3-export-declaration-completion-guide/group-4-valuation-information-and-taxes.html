<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/10 Invoice Currency (Box 22: Invoice Currency and Total Amount Invoiced)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/10 (invoice currency) is not declared to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> as a data element in its own right.</p>

<p>Wherever a monetary amount is declared, a currency code must also be provided for that same data element, for example USD500 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/11 (Total Amount Invoiced).</p>

<p>The currency declared must relate to each specific monetary amount being declared.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Goods are invoiced in US dollars, the currency declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/11 (Total Amount Invoiced) would therefore be USD</li>
  <li>Statistical value must be declared in Sterling, therefore the currency declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/6 would be GBP</li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/currency-codes-for-data-element-410-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 11: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/10: Currency Codes</a> for the list of codes to be used for each currency accepted by <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> converts foreign currency amounts into sterling using stored rates of exchange. The rate of exchange used for this purpose is the rate in force on the day the declaration is accepted.</p>

<p>Rates of exchange for most foreign currencies used for customs purposes are published by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) monthly and apply from midnight on the last day of the month for use during the following month. Information can be found on rates of exchange here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exchange-rates-for-customs-and-vat">rates of exchange to be used for customs purposes, including any changes in published rates</a>.</p>

<p>Where the goods are invoiced in multiple currencies, please follow the instructions below.</p>

<h3>Multiple Invoice Currencies:</h3>

<p>Where the goods have been invoiced in more than one currency, the invoice value must be converted and entered in Sterling (GBP).</p>

<p>Evidence to support the use of multiple invoice currencies must be held and made available to Customs on request.</p>

<h3>Fixed Rates of Exchange:</h3>

<p>Where a fixed rate of exchange is stipulated in the contract of sale and is being used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the fixed rate of exchange used for the currency conversion, for evidence purposes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/15 (Fixed Rate of Exchange)</li>
  <li>Where declared, enter the Total Amount Invoiced (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/11) in Sterling (GBP)</li>
