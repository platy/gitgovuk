<ul>
  <li>the goods were brought from there only for the purpose of export; and</li>
  <li>the Exporter is not established in the UK at the time of their release into the customs procedure; and</li>
  <li>the entry into the UK was not an intra-Union acquisition of goods or transaction treated as such as referred to in Council Directive 2006//112/EC.</li>
