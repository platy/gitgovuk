<h2>General</h2>

<p>1. Record relevant information only as this will help us and make it much easier for you.</p>

<p>2. Write down facts rather than opinion.</p>

<p>3. Remember your patient may have a copy of the report and read what you have written.</p>

<p>4. Your report should be based upon your knowledge of the patient and the medical records. It is not necessary to interview the patient, as any information they provide, especially with regard to mobility and self care may not necessarily be objective.</p>

<h2>Specific</h2>

<p>1. Date you last saw the patient. If no recent contact with patient please include where and when seen by other health care professional if relevant in your report.</p>

<p>2. Diagnosis – relevant diagnoses only needed and it is helpful to number the conditions if there are several.</p>

<p>3. Severity – mild, moderate or severe according to numbered conditions at 2. State also if well-controlled if appropriate, for example Diabetes.</p>

<p>4. Variability – this is helpful in very variable conditions, for example 3 courses of prednisolone in last 12 months.</p>

<p>5. Examination findings – facts are very helpful, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>peak flow/spirometry in asthma or <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>results of exercise test in angina (Bruce Protocol)</li>
  <li>normal or abnormal joint movements, extent of any joint swelling/deformity</li>
  <li>summary of any relevant information in hospital letters</li>
</ul>

<p>6. Medication – level of painkillers and inhalers very useful.</p>

<p>7. Self-care – write what you know, for example rose unaided from a chair in the surgery, no bending difficulty noted, had an <abbr title="occupational therapist">OT</abbr> assessment recently.</p>

<p>8. Ability to get around – write fact not opinion. Good examples would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>walks slowly with marked right-sided limp using walking stick</li>
  <li>not breathless or very breathless when attends surgery for routine check</li>
  <li>normal balance and gait on (date)</li>
</ul>

<p>9. Conclusion – this section is not asking for an opinion but rather to add something relevant, for example in severe depression has suicidal ideas or psychotic features. If there is treatment planned such as a hip replacement this is useful information here.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Childhood problems</h3>

<p>It is very important to remember that when children’s claims are assessed it is based on the facts that the need for attention and / or supervision should
be in excess of what one would normally expect in another child of similar age without claimed medical conditions.</p>

<p>What we need to know most of the time is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>diagnosis</li>
  <li>if it is related to behavioural problems for example <abbr title="attention deficit hyperactivity disorder">ADHD</abbr> / autism / Aspergers syndrome / learning difficulties etc then who made the diagnosis?</li>

  <li>is he/she at a normal school or at a special needs school?</li>
  <li>is he/she on medications? If yes then is it effective?</li>
  <li>are there any reported behavioural problems? If yes give details</li>
  <li>any injuries related to the conditions claimed?</li>
  <li>any hospitalisations?</li>
  <li>any other conditions such as incontinence (if dry before) / any known night time medications such as creams etc</li>
  <li>anything else you may consider useful which may be relevant to the claim?</li>
</ul>
