<h2><span class="number">1 Introduction </span></h2>

<p>This guidance is for all healthcare professionals who complete medical (factual) reports for the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) or one of their Assessment Providers. It gives advice on how patients can be supported through the sharing of information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Background</h3>

<h4>1.1.1 Why does the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> request reports?</h4>

<p>When deciding benefit entitlement it is essential that the right decision is reached. Up to date and relevant information is central to this process. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may seek information from a number of sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the patient</li>
  <li>carers, relatives and friends</li>
  <li>professionals involved in the patient’s care</li>
</ul>

<p>Wherever possible, information collection is kept to a minimum but at times professional reports to substantiate claims are needed. This information is invaluable to ensure your patients get their correct entitlement with the minimum of disruption.</p>

<h4>1.1.2 Who uses the report?</h4>

<p>Decisions on benefit entitlement are made by non medical decision makers. Decision makers will use your report and will seek the advice of an experienced healthcare professional trained in disability assessment to review and interpret the report where needed. Your report may also be used if your patient appeals against a benefit decision.</p>

<h4>1.1.3 Will the information be used?</h4>

<p>Absolutely. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and their assessment providers only request a report where it is needed and not in every case.  The medical report you provide will then be considered when producing an assessment report.  Departmental decision makers are required to consider all the available evidence before deciding on benefit entitlement.</p>

<h4>1.1.4 Relevant forms</h4>

<p>A list of each form and its purpose can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2 Report </span> completion</h2>

<p>This section explains the type of information that is useful to us and will help support your patients.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> General points</h3>

<h4>2.1.1 All medical reports</h4>

<p>Please complete the forms as fully as you can from your medical records and your knowledge of the patient.  It is not necessary to interview or examine the patient in order to complete the report.</p>

<p>In the reports, we are looking for evidence based on clinical facts. If you would like to offer your opinion, please make sure it is supported by factual evidence.</p>

<p>A summary of any relevant information in hospital letters can be helpful.</p>

<p>Examples of useful information for specific conditions are contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-b">Appendix B</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) and Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) form <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>/ESA113</h3>

<h4>2.2.1 Background</h4>

<p>Most information requests regarding Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) and Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) claims will be on the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>/ESA113.</p>

<p>We ask you to complete this form if we think that the patient may have a severe health condition or disability but do not have enough information to be sure.</p>

<p>The forms should be returned within 5 working days from the date of receipt.</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Computer printouts</h4>

<p>You can send us a computer printout of the appropriate part of the patient record if you wish, but you will still have to complete any sections of the form where the answer is not clear from the printout.  The printout should contain active problems; current medication with date last prescribed; details of the last three consultations.  Please remove third party data or other information not relevant to your patient’s benefit claim.</p>

<h4>2.2.3 Specific questions</h4>

<h5>Question 4 – Functional difficulties</h5>

<p>The question is trying to identify patients with the most severe disabilities, for example, those who have difficulty walking short distances, etc. Identification of these patients may avoid the need to bring them to an unnecessary face-to-face assessment.</p>

<h5>Question 5 – History of threatening or violent behaviour</h5>

<p>The purpose of this section is to identify those patients who may pose a threat to a healthcare professional if invited to a face-to-face assessment.</p>

<h5>Question 6 – Public transportation</h5>

<p>A small number of patients are unable to travel to an examination centre, and may be offered a taxi or assessment in their own home if required.  Patients who travel to an examination centre are entitled to claim travelling expenses.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>/<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> form FRR2</h3>

<h4>2.3.1 Background</h4>

<p>Form FRR2 allows healthcare professionals to ask one or more specific questions. For example, “This patient is known to have epilepsy, please could you let us know how many recorded seizures they have had in the last 3 years?”</p>

<p>Healthcare professionals can also use the form to request information about patients who are being treated for cancer. This is because, under certain circumstances, patients receiving, about to receive or recovering from chemotherapy or radiotherapy for cancer can be placed in the Support Group of Employment and Support Allowance without having to undergo a face to face assessment and the information can be helpful to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> decision maker in&nbsp; making that decision. The questions relate to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>diagnoses and clinical features</li>
  <li>treatment, likely duration and estimated recovery time</li>
  <li>whether the claimant is likely to be able to work – please answer this question only this if you feel confident to do so</li>
</ul>

<p>Please return the form&nbsp;within 7 days from the date of receipt.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>) factual report</h3>

<h4>2.4.1 Background</h4>

<p>Factual reports for patients claiming Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>) may be requested where the Assessment Provider believes that further evidence will help inform their advice to the department.</p>

<p>The assessment for <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> considers the claimant’s ability to carry out a series of everyday activities. The relevant activities are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>preparing food</li>
  <li>taking nutrition</li>
  <li>managing therapy or monitoring a health condition</li>
  <li>washing and bathing</li>
  <li>managing toilet needs or incontinence</li>
  <li>dressing and undressing</li>
  <li>communicating verbally</li>
  <li>reading and understanding signs, symbols and words</li>
  <li>engaging with other people face to face</li>
  <li>making budgeting decisions</li>
  <li>planning and following journeys</li>
  <li>moving around</li>
</ul>

<p>The completed report should be returned within 5 working days from the date of receipt.</p>

<h4>2.4.2 Specific questions</h4>

<h5>Date when last seen</h5>

<p>If your patient has not been seen recently by you, please tell us when and where the patient was last seen by another healthcare professional.</p>

<h5>Question 1 – Disabling conditions</h5>

<p>List all the health conditions or impairments which may affect the patient’s current functional ability and the dates of when these conditions first presented.</p>

<h5>Question 2 – History of conditions</h5>

<p>Please detail the patients past and present history. Details of the past history can be very useful, especially when it demonstrates a change in condition over a period of time, rather than simple statements such as “suffered since 1999”.</p>

<p>It is helpful to state whether the conditions are mild, moderate or severe although it is accepted that this is subject to individual interpretation, and if appropriate, whether they are well controlled or not (diabetes, asthma, epilepsy etc). Include details of any relevant special investigations or tests for each condition and the results.</p>

<h5>Question 3 – Symptoms and variability</h5>

<p>Information should be based on the patient’s clinical record and include both day-to-day and longer-term fluctuations. Include the frequency and duration of exacerbations and specify if the condition is well controlled.</p>

<h5>Question 4 – Relevant clinical findings</h5>

<p>Entitlement to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> is based on the impact of the individual’s impairment or health condition(s) on their everyday life. Please provide details of examination findings related to the severity or impact of any health conditions or impairments.</p>

<h5>Question 5 – Treatment: current, planned, response and diagnosis</h5>

<p>Information could include details of drug and non-drug treatment, aids and appliances used (prescribed or, if known, non-prescribed), specify frequency of treatment and, for medication, dose as relevant.</p>

<h5>Question 6 – Effects of the disabling condition(s) on day-to-day life</h5>

<p>If known, it would be helpful to have information on the patient’s ability to carry out the relevant activities at 2.4.1.</p>

<p>We are looking for facts, not opinion, with the date of the observation.  If you would like to offer your opinion, please make sure it is supported by factual evidence.</p>

<h5>Question 7 – History of threatening or violent behaviour</h5>

<p>The purpose of this section is to identify those patients who may pose a threat to a healthcare professional if invited to a face-to-face assessment.</p>

<h5>Question 8 – Patient travel to an assessment centre</h5>

<p>A small number of patients are unable to travel to an examination centre and may be offered a taxi or assessment in their own home if required.  Patients who travel to an examination centre are entitled to claim travelling expenses.</p>

<h5>Question 9 – Additional Information</h5>

<p>This section is not asking for opinion but provides space to answer any specific questions raised and an opportunity to add any other relevant information.  For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in patients with severe depression, do they have suicidal ideas or psychotic features?</li>
  <li>planned treatment, for example hip replacement surgery.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>) &amp; Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>) claim pack statement</h3>

<h4>2.5.1 Background</h4>

<p>Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>) and Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>) claim forms contain a statement section which patients or their representative may ask you to complete.  There is no requirement to provide statements for other benefit claims such as <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> as those forms do not include a statement section.</p>

<p>The form requires a brief description of your patient’s illness and disabilities and how they are affected by them. Patients are advised that the best person to complete this section is the person most involved with their treatment or care, not necessarily their doctor.</p>

<p>NHS hospitals and Trusts are obliged to provide the information free of charge.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>/<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> factual report</h3>

<h4>2.6.1 Background</h4>

<p>Factual reports for patients claiming <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> or <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> may be requested when there is insufficient clinical information to make a decision.</p>

<p>The completed report should be returned within 10 working days from the date of receipt.</p>

<h4>2.6.2 Specific questions</h4>

<h5>Page 1</h5>

<p>Contains information about the medical condition claimed by the patient and a specific question or questions that the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> decision maker would like you to answer in the report.</p>

<h5>Date when last seen</h5>

<p>If your patient has not been seen recently by a <abbr title="General Practitioner">GP</abbr>, if relevant, please tell us when and where the patient was seen by another healthcare professional (Include in Part 7 further details).</p>

<h5>Question 2 – Details of conditions</h5>

<p>Details of the past history can be very helpful, especially when it demonstrates a change in the condition over a period of time, rather than simple statements such as “suffered since 1999”.</p>

<p>It is helpful to state whether the conditions are mild, moderate or severe, although it is accepted that this is subject to individual interpretation, and, if appropriate, whether they are well controlled or not (diabetes, asthma, epilepsy etc).</p>

<p>Relevant test results for example the result of exercise testing in coronary artery disease (Bruce Protocol).</p>

<h5>Question 3 – Variability</h5>

<p>For those conditions that vary on a day to day basis, information about how they vary can be very useful.</p>

<h5>Question 4 – Relevant clinical findings</h5>

<p>Main findings such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>peak flow or spirometry results in asthma or <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>joint examination findings (range of movements, swelling, deformity)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Question 5 – Treatment</h5>

<p>The level of medication (dose, frequency and compliance) is very helpful, especially for analgesics and inhalers.</p>

<p>Details of prognosis help the decision maker determine how long to award benefit for.</p>

<h5>Question 6 – Disabling effects</h5>

<p>We are looking for facts, not opinion, with the date of the observation.  If you would like to offer your opinion, please make sure it is supported by factual evidence.  Good examples of facts might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“walks slowly with marked right sided limp using walking stick”</li>
  <li>“not breathless when attends surgery for routine check”</li>
  <li>“normal balance and gait”</li>
</ul>

<h5>Question 7 – Further details</h5>

<p>Again, this section is not asking for opinion but provides opportunity to add any other relevant information.  For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in patients with severe depression, do they have suicidal ideas or psychotic features?</li>
  <li>planned treatment, for example hip replacement surgery</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span> BI205</h3>

<h4>2.8.1 Background</h4>

<p>This form requests factual information about an individual’s medical condition in relations to claims for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (<abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>).</p>

<p>The completed report should be returned within 7 days from the date of receipt.</p>

<h4>2.8.2 Specific Questions</h4>

<p>This should include any reference to industrial causation if known.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span> BI127</h3>

<h4>2.9.1 Background</h4>

<p>This form is sent to Hospital Medical Record Departments.  The BI127 requests photocopies of the relevant case notes, including any X ray reports.</p>

<p>Under a long-standing agreement, NHS hospitals and Trusts are obliged to provide information (factual reports, hospital case notes and X rays) free of charge and within 10 working days.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3 Essential </span> details</h2>

<p>This section contains important considerations when completing medical reports for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Contractual obligations</h3>

<h4>3.1.1 General practitioners</h4>

<p>There is a contractual obligation for any <abbr title="General Practitioner">GP</abbr> who has issued a Med3 (fit note) to provide medical reports in relation to Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance on an ESA113 or FRR2. This should be done free of charge as covered by the contractual arrangements between GPs and the relevant Primary Care Trust.</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Hospital trusts</h4>

<p>Under a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+tf_/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Lettersandcirculars/Healthservicecirculars/DH_4004381?PageOperation=email" rel="external">longstanding agreement</a>, NHS trusts are required to provide hospital case notes, X rays and medical reports without charge and within 10 working days of receipt of the request. For the provision of hospital case notes and X rays, photocopies or originals, CDs or transfer by portal is acceptable with CD or portal being preferable. If original hospital case notes or X rays are provided, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> aims to return them to the NHS Trust who sent them within 10 working days of receipt from the Trust.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Information provision</h3>

<h4>3.2.1 Consent</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> obtain consent<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> from the patient<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> to approach you for the release of clinical information.  Therefore you can rely on an assurance from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or a healthcare professional working for Atos Healthcare, Centre for Health and Disability Assessments (CHDA) or Capita Health and Wellbeing that consent has been provided and there is no requirement for you to ask to see a copy of the patient’s consent.</p>

<p>In addition, the Access to Medical Reports Act 1988 does not apply to reports for benefit purposes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> and you do not have to discuss with or show the information to the patient before you send it.</p>

<h4>3.2.2 Release of information</h4>

<p>Information (including medical reports) will be made available to patients on request or if they appeal against an unfavourable benefit entitlement decision. Harmful information (see below) is the only exception.</p>

<h4>3.2.3 Harmful information</h4>

<p>Harmful information is anything that would be considered harmful to a patient’s health, if they were to become aware of it, (for example a diagnosis of a malignancy). This may be legally withheld from a patient and would not be released by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Please put any harmful information either in the relevant section of the report or on a separate sheet of paper.</p>

<p>Please identify any such information clearly in your report.</p>

<h4>3.2.4 Embarrassing information</h4>

<p>Under data protection legislation, information which would simply embarrass the author, or someone else, cannot be withheld. Any reports which you provide should not contain inappropriate personal remarks or suspicions of malingering which cannot be substantiated and which you would not want your patient to see.</p>

<h4>3.2.5 Letters and reports from other healthcare professionals</h4>

<p>Please include in your report any relevant information contained in letters or reports from other healthcare professionals.</p>

<h4>3.2.6 Rehabilitation of Offenders Act</h4>

<p>To ensure compliance with the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 your report should not contain any reference to criminal convictions whether spent or not unless the information is directly relevant to the patient’s condition or disability.</p>

<h4>3.2.7 Delegation of completion of reports</h4>

<p>It is acceptable for GPs to delegate completion of the ESA113, FRR2, <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> or <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>/<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> factual report to your practice nurse.  However, you must confirm your authorisation by signing at the end.</p>

<p>No fee is payable to NHS doctors working in hospital for completion of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> or <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>/<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> factual reports.</p>

<p>MacMillan nurses, Nurse Specialists and practice nurses can complete the DS1500 and SR1, but only GPs and <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> registered consultants may claim a fee.</p>
