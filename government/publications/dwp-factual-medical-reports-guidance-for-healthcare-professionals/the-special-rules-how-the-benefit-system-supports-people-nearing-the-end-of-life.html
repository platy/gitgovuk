<p>The ‘Special Rules’ allow people nearing the end of life to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get faster, easier access to some benefits</li>
  <li>get higher payments for some benefits</li>
  <li>avoid a medical assessment</li>
</ul>

<p>Clinicians, such as a GP, hospital consultant, hospice doctor or registered nurse, can be asked to provide medical evidence (currently a DS1500) for a benefit claim under the ‘Special Rules’ process.</p>

<h2>Improvements occurring to the ‘Special Rules’ process in 2022</h2>

<p>The rules are currently called the ‘Special Rules for Terminal Illness’ (<abbr title="Special Rules for Terminal Illness">SRTI</abbr>) and apply to people who have 6 months or less to live.</p>

<p>These are changing to the ‘Special Rules for End of Life’ (<abbr title="Special Rules for End of Life">SREL</abbr>), which apply to people who have 12 months or less to live.</p>

<p>Due to parliamentary constraints, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> can only change the rules for 2 out of 5 benefits from April 2022.</p>

<p>This means that from 4 April 2022 there will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 sets of ‘Special Rules’ criteria to consider</li>
  <li>a new medical evidence form, the SR1, which will operate alongside the DS1500 form</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a transitional period until the new rules are extended to all 5 benefits. When this occurs, the DS1500 form will be withdrawn and the SR1 form will remain as the medical evidence form that can be provided to support a ‘Special Rules’ claim.</p>

<h2>Patients with an estimated prognosis of less than 6 months to live – use the DS1500 form</h2>

<p>You should complete the DS1500 form promptly if you believe that your patient:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has a progressive disease, and</li>
  <li>as a consequence of that disease you would not be surprised if your patient were to die within 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>When you provide a DS1500 to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, it is shared across all necessary benefits.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>You do not need to complete a SR1 form as well.</p>
</div>

<h2>Patients with an estimated prognosis of 6 to 12 months to live – use the SR1 form</h2>

<p>You should complete the SR1 form promptly if you believe that your patient:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has a progressive disease, and</li>
  <li>as a consequence of that disease you would not be surprised if your patient were to die within 12 months</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, providing a SR1 form will only support your patient’s claim to the 2 benefits with the 12 months ‘Special Rules’ criteria. These are Employment Support Allowance and Universal Credit, which can be claimed by individuals under the State Pension Age.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you think that your patient has a shorter prognosis, for example, less than 6 months to live, please complete a DS1500 instead.</p>
</div>

<h2>Why <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is making this change to the ‘Special Rules’</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> recognises that an increasing number of people are living with chronic illness and co-morbidities and that people need more support at an earlier stage when approaching the end of life. Therefore, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is changing the current 6-month ‘Special Rules’ criteria to a model which considers whether an individual is likely to be in their final year of life, that is with a 12-month time-frame.</p>

<p>The intent of this change to the ‘Special Rules’ process is to align with the current NHS/<abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> definition of ‘end of life’ which states that ‘patients are approaching the end of life when they are likely to die within the next 12 months’. One of the aims of this alignment is to bring conversations about financial support into mind when taking a holistic approach to supporting patients with advanced progressive illness, poor prognoses or terminal conditions.</p>

<h2>Which benefits this change will affect</h2>

<p>There is no expectation that clinicians will know which benefit their patient is claiming.</p>

<p>Initially, the change will affect 2 benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit">Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>)</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance">Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually, the change will affect 3 other benefits as well:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pip">Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>)</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/disability-living-allowance-children">Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/attendance-allowance">Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using forms SR1 and DS1500 to provide medical evidence</h2>

<p>You should complete a DS1500 or SR1 form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if requested by your patient or their representative</li>
  <li>if you would like to encourage your patient to see what financial support they may be entitled to as part of a conversation about advance care planning</li>
</ul>

<p>It will not normally be necessary for you to examine the patient. You may use your own knowledge and the patient’s records to get the information you need.</p>

<p>These forms are not benefit claim forms. They are used as supporting medical evidence for a claim for benefits under the ‘Special Rules’ process.</p>

<h3>Who can complete the forms</h3>

<p>These forms can be completed by a registered clinician such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a GP</li>
  <li>a hospital consultant</li>
  <li>a hospice doctor</li>
  <li>a registered nurse</li>
</ul>

<p>A registered nurse needs to have acquired the expert knowledge and clinical competencies to undertake the assessment. They may be working in a role such as an advanced nurse practitioner, Macmillan nurse, clinical nurse specialist or practice nurse with expertise in the management of long term conditions.</p>

<h3>Patients who may not know the true nature of their illness</h3>

<p>When a patient asks you for a DS1500 or SR1 form, please do not assume that they understand the ‘Special Rules’ criteria or that these criteria may apply to them. It may be an opportunity to initiate a conversation about advance care planning.</p>

<h3>Third party claims</h3>

<p>For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, only an appointee or a person who has power of attorney can make a third party claim on the patient’s behalf.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>, <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> and <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>, any person representing the patient can make a third party claim on their behalf, even if the patient is unaware that a claim is being made. In this circumstance the form should be issued to the person that requested it.</p>

<h3>We might call you if we need more information</h3>

<p>You may be contacted by a healthcare professional working for one of our clinical assessment providers if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we need clarification of some of the information on the DS1500 or SR1 form to help with our decision about the claim, or</li>
  <li>the patient has made a claim under the ‘Special Rules’ process but has not submitted a DS1500 or SR1 form and we need clinical information to support the claim</li>
</ul>

<p>Because we need to deal with these claims urgently, the healthcare professional will usually make contact by telephone.</p>

<p>The purpose of the call is to gather more information on the patient’s prognosis and not to challenge the clinical judgement of clinicians.</p>

<h2>Guidance for completing DS1500 and SR1 forms</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> acknowledges that prognostication can be very challenging. This guidance therefore serves to assist clinicians in considering whether their patients may be eligible for benefits under the ‘Special Rules’ process.</p>

<p>The DS1500 and SR1 forms ask for factual information and should contain details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>diagnosis and other relevant conditions</li>
  <li>whether the patient is aware of their diagnosis and prognosis</li>
  <li>clinical features that indicate a severe progressive condition (for example, investigation results, staging if appropriate)</li>
  <li>information about treatment that has been received or is ongoing</li>
</ul>

<p>The forms do not require you to give a specific prognosis. Please use language that you would normally use when communicating with other clinicians.</p>

<p>You will not face any negative consequences, for example, if a patient who claims under the ‘Special Rules’ was to live longer than expected.</p>

<h3>Clinical indicators</h3>

<p>Determining life expectancy in these circumstances is not an exact science. The following indicators may suggest that a patient is eligible under the ‘Special Rules’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advanced, progressive illness</li>
  <li>worsening symptoms despite optimal treatment or management</li>
  <li>(severe) degenerative condition</li>
  <li>deterioration of incurable condition</li>
  <li>rapid decline</li>
  <li>metastatic disease</li>
  <li>inoperable cancer</li>
  <li>severe frailty</li>
  <li>death is imminent, death is inevitable</li>
  <li>a high risk of sudden death with an underlying deteriorating condition</li>
</ul>

<p>Some patients may be eligible for ‘Special Rules’ whilst receiving treatment, be it ongoing or palliative treatment. In some circumstances, there may not be any treatment options available that would significantly alter prognosis. Inclusion of the relevant information on the DS1500 or SR1 form is likely to help your patient’s claim. Some examples can be found below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no or poor response to treatment</li>
  <li>best supportive care, supportive care only</li>
  <li>palliative treatment or palliative care in any form including palliative chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy</li>
  <li>symptom control only</li>
  <li>no further treatment planned/available</li>
  <li>not amenable to curative treatment, leading to increased need for additional care and support plus decreased function and activity</li>
  <li>treatment is declined</li>
  <li>treatment ongoing but unlikely to alter prognosis</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘Special Rules’ criteria do not only apply to patients with cancer. They also apply to other severe, life-limiting conditions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>end stage respiratory disease (for example, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis)</li>
  <li>end stage heart disease</li>
  <li>end stage dementia</li>
  <li>severe frailty</li>
  <li>end stage liver disease</li>
  <li>end stage renal failure</li>
  <li>advanced Motor Neurone disease</li>
  <li>advanced Huntington’s disease</li>
  <li>end stage cystic fibrosis</li>
</ul>
