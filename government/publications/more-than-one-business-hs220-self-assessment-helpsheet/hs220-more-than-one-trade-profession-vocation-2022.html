<h2>Class 4 National Insurance contributions</h2>

<p>If you have more than one trade, you will normally pay Class 4 National Insurance contributions on your total taxable profits.</p>

<p>However, you may need to work out an adjustment if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>profits that you’ve paid Class 1 National Insurance contributions on</li>
  <li>trade losses (not losses from furnished holiday lettings) that have not been taken off when working out your Class 4 National Insurance profits</li>
  <li>any interest from a loan used to invest in a partnership or to provide plant and machinery for partnership use, that you have not already taken off when working out your profits — not all loans or partnerships can qualify; contact your tax adviser if you need more information</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to fill in the working sheets</h2>

<h3>Section 1</h3>

<p>Photocopy or print extra copies of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/more-than-one-business-hs220-self-assessment-helpsheet">working sheet</a> if you’ve more than 2 trades.</p>

<p>Fill in one column for each trade you carried on during 2021 to 2022 (whether on your own or in partnership). Do not move amounts from one column to another.</p>

<p>You can only use the adjustments you put in boxes 3, 5 and 6 for the same trade, you cannot set them against other trades.</p>

<h4>Box 1</h4>

<p>Put the name of the trade that the profit and adjustments are for.</p>

<h4>Box 3</h4>

<p>If you changed your accounting practice in 2021 to 2022, put the adjustment that’s taxable in box 3.</p>

<h4>Box 4</h4>

<p>Deduct the adjustment you put in box 3 from the profits you put in box 2.</p>

<p>The adjustment for change of accounting practice is not taken into account for Class 4 National Insurance.</p>

<h4>Box 5</h4>

<p>Include any amount you earned as an employee or office holder that you included when you worked out your taxable profit for box 2. Class 1 National Insurance contributions are payable on this.</p>

<h4>Box 6</h4>

<p>You should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any losses you had before 2021 to 2022 that you have not used against previous Class 4 National Insurance profits — see the notes for box C</li>
  <li>any interest you had to pay in 2021 to 2022 or earlier years, on a loan to invest in a partnership or to provide plant and machinery for partnership use, that you have not already taken off when working out your Class 4 National Insurance profits</li>
</ul>

<h4>Box 8</h4>

<p>This is the adjustment that you can use for the trade. It must not be more than the adjusted profit figure (box 4) for that trade.</p>

<h3>Section 2</h3>

<p>This working sheet brings together the adjustments from all your trades into a single figure. Add together all the figures into one working sheet and continue.</p>

<h4>Box B</h4>

<p>The figure in box B cannot be more than the figure in box A.</p>

<h4>Box C</h4>

<p>Put any trade losses you had in 2021 to 2022 that you wish to claim against Class 4 National Insurance contributions. This figure may be more than the losses that you can use in 2021 to 2022. If it is, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work out the amount of any unused losses after you’ve filled in box D</li>
  <li>carry forward those losses and use them against profits for the same trade in later years</li>
</ul>

<h4>Box E</h4>

<p>Put the lowest figure from box A or box D in box E.</p>
