<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Vivaldi is one of the national surveillance studies that have been commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) to generate evidence on the burden of COVID-19 infection across healthcare and community settings.</p>

<p>Vivaldi focuses on care homes in England, and is a collaboration between the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, University College London (<abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr>), University of Birmingham, Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) and the Francis Crick Institute.</p>

<p>The main aims of the study are to measure the proportion of care home staff and residents who have been infected with COVID-19, and to investigate immunity and its duration. The study will also be used to estimate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in care home staff and residents.</p>

<h2>Data controllers</h2>

<p><abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> and the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> are joint data controllers for this study.</p>

<h2>What personal data we collect</h2>

<p>We are collecting personal data (ethnicity and health data including records of vaccination against COVID-19 and influenza and ethnicity) from staff and residents of care homes participating in the Vivaldi study in England. This includes residents and staff in care homes run by Four Seasons Healthcare, The Orders of St John Care Trust, HC One and up to 60 independently run care homes.</p>

<h2>How we use your data (purposes)</h2>

<p>The information we collect will be used to investigate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the burden of infection in care home staff and residents</li>
  <li>evidence of immunity to infection</li>
  <li>effectiveness of vaccination</li>
  <li>how infection spreads in the care home setting</li>
</ul>

<p>Our aim is to use this data to inform the national pandemic response to COVID-19 in care homes, so we can protect staff and residents from current and future waves of infection.</p>

<h2>Legal basis for processing personal data</h2>

<p>The lawful basis for this work is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“legal obligation” under the Coronavirus (COVID-19): notice under regulation 3(4) of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information Regulations) 2002</li>
  <li>“performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller”</li>
</ul>

<p>The parties’ condition for processing special category data with regard to GDPR is Article 9(2)(h) “health or social care”, as processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest to protect care home residents and staff from becoming infected with COVID-19.</p>

<p>Participating care homes are providing identifiable information on all their residents, and for staff who have consented to take part in the Vivaldi study to NHS England. NHS England will also use information collected through the care home testing programme to identify results from staff and residents in care homes that are participating in the VIVALDI study.</p>

<p>NHS England is acting as data processor on behalf of the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> (who are joint data controllers for the study). NHS England will link individual-level records from residents and staff to data on hospital admissions, vaccination history (influenza and COVID-19 only), mortality and COVID-19 test results, creating a detailed record which will allow us to compare outcomes in people who have and have not been infected with or vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>

<p>The linked dataset will be pseudo-anonymised to remove direct identifiers such as name, address or date of birth before being transferred to the research team.</p>

<h2>Data processors and other recipients of personal data</h2>

<h3>The Doctors Laboratory (<abbr title="The Doctors Laboratory">TDL</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="The Doctors Laboratory">TDL</abbr> will receive blood samples with identifiers attached from staff and residents who consent to participate in the study. Blood samples will be tested for antibodies to COVID-19. <abbr title="The Doctors Laboratory">TDL</abbr> will send the test results to NHS England.</p>

<h3>The University of Birmingham (<abbr title="University of Birmingham">UoB</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="University of Birmingham">UoB</abbr> will receive blood samples with identifiers attached from staff and residents who consent to participate in the study. <abbr title="University of Birmingham">UoB</abbr> will also receive antibody test results from <abbr title="The Doctors Laboratory">TDL</abbr> to inform its testing protocols. <abbr title="University of Birmingham">UoB</abbr> will test blood samples for markers of immunity to COVID-19 and will send its pseudonymised test results (all identifiers removed) to the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> research team.</p>

<h3>NHS England (<abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> will receive identifiable data (name, address, date of birth, registered GP, NHS Number) from each participating care home and from each of the laboratories that is testing blood samples as part of the study. 
It will link this information together and link it to medical records including hospital admissions and cause of death.</p>

<p>Once the dataset has been linked, <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> will pseudonymise the dataset by removing names, dates of birth and addresses.</p>

<h3>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> will process pseudonymised data (names, dates of birth and addresses removed) and receive residual blood samples (after antibody testing has been performed) from <abbr title="The Doctors Laboratory">TDL</abbr>. These samples will be used to investigate the immune response following vaccination. Pseudonymised results will be sent to the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> research team.</p>

<h3>The Francis Crick Institute</h3>

<p>The Crick will receive residual blood samples (after antibody testing has been performed) and pseudonymised data (names, date of birth and addresses removed) from <abbr title="The Doctors Laboratory">TDL</abbr>. It will use these samples to investigate the immune response to COVID-19. Pseudonymised results will be sent to the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> research team.</p>

<h2>International data transfers and storage locations</h2>

<p>Anonymised information collected through this project may be shared with researchers in the UK or EU who are undertaking research on COVID-19, subject to appropriate research, ethical and information governance approvals. The dataset will be stored in the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> data safe haven which is housed in the UK.</p>

<h2>Retention and disposal policy</h2>

<p>Personal information will be stored for 3 years after the end of the study. The anonymised research dataset will be stored for 10 years after the study, in line with <a rel="external" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/sites/library/files/retention-schedule.pdf" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> policy on data retention</a>.</p>

<h2>How we keep your data secure</h2>

<p>The linked, pseudonymised dataset will be stored securely in the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> data safe haven. Secure deletion of data will be undertaken within the <abbr title="University College London">UCL</abbr> data safe haven using a software-based data erasure method.</p>

<h2>Your rights as a data subject</h2>

<p>By law, data subjects have a number of rights and this processing does not take away or reduce these rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 applies.</p>

<p>These rights are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The right to get copies of information: individuals have the right to ask for a copy of any information about them that is used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right to get information corrected: individuals have the right to ask for any information held about them that they think is inaccurate to be corrected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right to limit how the information is used: individuals have the right to ask for any of the information held about them to be restricted – for example, if they think inaccurate information is being used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right to object to the information being used: individuals can ask for any information held about them to not be used – however, this is not an absolute right, and continued use of the information may be necessary, with individuals being advised if this is the case</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right to get information deleted: this is not an absolute right, and continued use of the information may be necessary, with individuals being advised if this is the case</p>
  </li>
</ol>
