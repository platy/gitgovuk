<p><strong>Role title:</strong> Commercial Intelligence Coordinator</p>

<p><strong>Salary range:</strong> competitive</p>

<p><strong>Function:</strong> Commercial &amp; Business Development</p>

<p><strong>Role level range:</strong> 3-4</p>

<p><strong>Role type:</strong> permanent or secondment</p>

<p><strong>Base location:</strong> flexible</p>

<p><strong>Reports to:</strong> Commercial Systems, Data and Analytics Manager</p>

<p><strong>Closing date:</strong> 16 September 2022</p>

<p><strong>The role:</strong></p>

<p>The NDA Commercial Standards Team is delivering an NDA group-wide project to replace and enhance our commercial IT systems capability and associated ways of working. This includes the commercial IT systems we use to manage our procurement pipelines, for sourcing, for managing our contracts with our supply chain (and customers), for tracking commercial benefits and savings, for identifying and managing supply chain risk, and for strategic supplier relationship management.</p>

<p>Procurement of the new systems suite is divided into five “Lots” which will share data via APIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lot A: Source-to-Contract System</li>
  <li>Lot B: Supplier and Market Intelligence</li>
  <li>Lot C: Contract Management System for End-to-End Project Management Contracts (typically “Works” contracts)</li>
  <li>Lot D: Supply Chain Risk Management System</li>
  <li>Lot E: Reporting, Analytics and Dashboarding System.</li>
</ul>

<p>The systems suite will fulfil the requirements of the procurement lifecycle, ensuring commercial activity is planned, controlled, and complies with procurement legislation (currently the Public Contracts Regulations 2015). The systems will also ensure risks are identified early e.g. contract expiry and supplier financial distress; enable senior level oversight and confidence in processes and reporting; and fulfil the requirements of the NDA’s Commercial Capability Blueprint and performance against the Government’s Commercial Operating Standards (“GCOS” / CCIAF).</p>

<p><strong>Hear from the Hiring Manager:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an exciting opportunity to join a high-performing team, at the heart of NDA’s commercial directorate. Some of our systems are now live and you’ll have the chance to shape the impact they have across NDA group. Other systems are currently being developed, so you’ll join the team at a great time to advise on the impact they’re having. The post holder will have flexibility to shape the role in their image, and to interact with stakeholders of varying degrees of seniority across NDA group.</p>

  <p>For me, interest in developing skills and abilities is key – you don’t need to be a ‘data expert’ to succeed in the role. This role is a great opportunity for someone looking to step-up from an administrative position, and similarly if you’re looking to further develop your data and analytics interest in a commercial setting. I’m looking for someone who is interested in data and reporting and has an ability to translate this information into actionable insights for colleagues.</p>

  <p>Data and reporting in a commercial context are sought-after skills. We can support you with training, including CIPS, data analytics, or supply chain risk-oriented courses if desired.</p>

  <p class="last-child">We’re a friendly, delivery-focused team of c. 11 people, located across the UK. We’re all different personalities but we have a strong sense of team spirit and work together to deliver quality outputs for NDA group. I’m sure you’ll really enjoy being part of the team.</p>
