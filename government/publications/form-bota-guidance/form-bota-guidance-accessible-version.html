<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide summarises the legal requirements to apply for registration based on residence in the UK, some of which have changed under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/contents/enacted" rel="external">The Nationality and Borders Act 2022</a>. In particular, the requirements for lawful residence are now easier to demonstrate. It is not a complete statement of the law or policy but should answer routine questions you may have on the requirements and our processes.</p>

<p>Becoming a British citizen is a significant life event. Apart from allowing you to apply for a British citizen passport, British citizenship gives you the opportunity to participate more fully in the life of your local community.</p>

<p>Your right to registration is a matter of law as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=british+nationality+act+1981&amp;qs=HS&amp;pq=brit&amp;sc=8-4&amp;cvid=9ED888A45F88452F8713FA168C7BAE3C&amp;FORM=QBRE&amp;sp=1" rel="external">British Nationality Act 1981</a>. The Home Secretary may only register you if you satisfy a number of statutory requirements. This guide helps you to understand them. It may be possible to grant your application even if you are not able to meet all of the requirements, but this cannot be done in all cases. The way that discretion is exercised is described throughout this booklet. More information on how applications may still be granted even though you may not meet all the requirements can be found in the nationality casework guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948234/registration-as-british-citizen-other-british-nationals-v4.0ext.pdf" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Before applying</h3>

<p>If you hold an additional nationality aside from your existing British one, you should check whether your other country of nationality allows multiple citizenship. Some countries do not allow dual or multiple citizenship and you may therefore lose, or have to give up, your existing nationality in order to become a British citizen. If you have any questions about this, you should seek advice from the country of which you are a citizen before making your application. If the country of which you are currently a citizen continues to recognise you as one of its citizens, you may continue to be subject to the duties of citizens of that country when you are in its territory. This may include obligations to undergo military service.</p>

<p>If you are a British Overseas Territories citizen, a British National (Overseas), a British Overseas citizen, or a British subject from Ireland (under section 31 of the British Nationality Act 1981), registration as a British citizen will not cause you to lose that status.</p>

<p>However, if you are a British subject from a location other than Ireland, or a British protected person, you will automatically lose that status on being registered as a British citizen.</p>

<p>Please note, a nationality application does not provide any immigration status while it is being considered. You must ensure you have valid permission to stay in the UK until you have had a decision on your application and attended your citizenship ceremony.</p>

<h3>The Windrush Scheme</h3>

<p>The Windrush Scheme is for people who arrived in the UK many years ago and do not have documentation confirming their immigration status. If you are eligible under the Windrush Scheme you should not use form BOTA. You should instead use the form available from GOV.UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/windrush-prove-your-right-to-be-in-the-uk">Windrush Scheme: get a document showing your right to be in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>There is no charge for applications made under the Windrush Scheme.</p>

<h3>OISC and Immigration Advice</h3>

<p>You may, if you wish, use the services of an agent such as a solicitor or other competent adviser to help you with your application.</p>

<p>Nationality advice should only be provided by a person who works for an organisation registered with, or exempted by, the OISC or who is authorised to practise (like solicitors and barristers) by a designated professional body. Certain categories (for example public health bodies) are exempted from the regulatory scheme by Ministerial Order.</p>

<p>It is a criminal offence to provide advice or services in contravention of the regulatory scheme. Further information about the regulatory scheme and a full list of OISC regulated advisers is available on its website at <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.oisc.gov.uk" rel="external">www.oisc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Do you qualify?</h2>

<p>Adults and children under the age of 18 may be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1009695/registration-as-a-british-citizen-children-v7.0ext.pdf" rel="external">registered as a British citizen</a> if they meet the relevant criteria.</p>

<p>You must be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a British Overseas Territories citizen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a British National (Overseas)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a British Overseas citizen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a British subject</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a British protected person</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our guidance on who is or is not one of these nationalities can be found here:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">Types of British nationality: Overview - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a></p>

<p>You must also be of ‘sound mind’. This is to ensure that you have the capacity to understand the implications of the decision to register as a British citizen. There is discretion to overlook this requirement in certain circumstances, where it is in the applicant’s best interests to do so. If you are applying on behalf of someone who is not of sound mind and for whom you are responsible, relevant details of that person’s medical condition and of your role as their caregiver, can be provided when you apply.</p>

<p>Parents or others with parental responsibility may apply on behalf of their children.</p>

<h3>The requirements</h3>

<p>The legal requirements you should meet before you apply are that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Are a British Overseas Territories citizen; a British National (Overseas); a British Overseas citizen; a British subject; or a British protected person</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are of sound mind, so that you understand the step you are taking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have lived in the UK for a minimum of 5 years before you apply</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Must have been physically present in the UK (including the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands) <a class="govuk-link" href="#Requirement_to_have">on the day 5 years before</a> the application is received by the Home Office</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Must not have been in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Lawful_Residence">breach of the immigration laws</a> in the 5-year period before making your application. We may assume you meet this requirement without making further enquiries if you have been granted indefinite leave to enter or remain in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Must be <a class="govuk-link" href="#Immigration_time_restrictions">free from immigration time restrictions</a> on the date of application and for the 12-month period before making the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Must not have had more than 450 days outside the UK in the 5-year period before making the application (but see the section on Absences from the UK)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Must not have had more than 90 days outside the UK in the 12-month period before making the application (but see the section on Absences from the UK)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In special circumstances, some discretion may be exercised over absences, presence in the UK on the first day of the qualifying period, and immigration time restrictions in the last 12 months. You should explain any special circumstances when you apply based upon <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948234/registration-as-british-citizen-other-british-nationals-v4.0ext.pdf" rel="external">guidance</a> on how they might be considered.</p>

<p>The section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#Registration_on_grounds_1">Crown and Designated Service</a> shows alternative ways such people might qualify.</p>

<p>If you are a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Additional_provision_for_1">British Overseas Territories citizen</a>, you may also be registered as a British citizen by discretion.</p>

<p>The remainder of this guidance sets out in more detail out each of the requirements, how you may satisfy them, and answers some questions you may have about the process.</p>

<h3>Requirement to have been in the UK on the first day of the qualifying period</h3>

<p>You must have been in the UK exactly 5 years before your application was received. For example, if your application is received on 05/01/2022 you should have been physically present in the UK on 06/01/2017.</p>

<p>If you cannot meet this requirement, your application is likely to be refused. If you believe there were exceptional circumstances which prevented you from being in the UK on the first day of the qualifying period, please provide details when you apply.</p>

<p>We recognise that occasionally someone might apply without realising that they were not in the UK at the start of the qualifying period. If you did not meet the requirement when you applied, we may see if there is another, later date we can use to allow you to meet the requirement and will consider your application on, or after, that date.</p>

<p>However, please be aware the requirements remain unchanged, and this does not guarantee that the application will be successful if an alternative date cannot be found. It may also result in delays to your application until you can meet the statutory requirements. You must pay the full fee that is in force on any date we use.</p>

<p>You are strongly recommended to make sure you meet the requirement before applying.</p>

<h2>Absences from the UK</h2>

<h3>Overall absences in your qualifying period</h3>

<p>You should not have been absent for more than 450 days during the 5 years before making your application.</p>

<p>When you submit your application, you will be asked to tell us all absences during the relevant period. This will help you decide whether you meet the requirement.</p>

<p>There is discretion to disregard absences in excess of the limits in some circumstances. This discretion is outlined in the following tables.</p>

<h4>Absences from the UK during your residential qualifying period will be considered in the following way:</h4>

<p>Normal permitted absences in qualifying period: 450 days</p>

<p>Total number of absences normally disregarded: 480 days</p>

<p>Absences normally disregarded only if you meet all other requirements  and you have established your home, family and a substantial part of your estate here: 900 days (please   note: if your absences are up to 730 days we would expect you to have been   resident in the UK for the last 7 years. For absences exceeding 730 days we would expect you to have been resident in the   UK for the last 8 years unless the absences were a result of one of the   reasons given below.</p>

<p>For absences exceeding 730 days, please explain if your absences were a result of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A posting abroad in Crown or designated service For example, as a member of HM Forces, or as the husband, wife or civil partner of a British citizen serving abroad in Crown or designated service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An unavoidable consequence of the nature of your work. For example, if you are a merchant seaman or someone working for a UK based business which requires frequent travel abroad</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exceptional or compelling reasons of an occupational or compassionate nature such as having a firm job offer for which British citizenship is a genuine requirement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The excess absences were because you were unable to return to the UK because of global pandemic</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Only very rarely would we disregard absences in excess of 900 days. If your absences are more than this limit your application is likely to fail and your fee will not be fully refunded.</p>

<h3>Absences in the 12 months prior to applying</h3>

<p>In addition to the overall number of absences, you should not have been absent for more than 90 days during the final 12 months of the qualifying period.</p>

<h4>Absences from the UK during the last 12 months of your qualifying period will be considered in the following way:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Normal permitted absences in final 12 months of your qualifying period: 90 days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Total number of absences normally disregarded: 100 days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Total number of absences normally disregarded only if all other requirements are met and you have demonstrated links with the UK through presence of family, and established home and a substantial part of your estate: 101 – 179 days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Total number of absences that may be disregarded if you do not meet all the other requirements providing the following criteria are met: 101 – 179 days</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you have demonstrated links with the UK through presence of family, and established home and a substantial part of your estate; and</li>
      <li>the absence is justified by Crown service or by compelling occupational or compassionate reasons taking account of the criteria listed on page 10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: Only in the most exceptional circumstances would total absences exceeding 180 days in the final 12 months of the qualifying period be disregarded if all other requirements were not met.</p>

<p>If you were in the UK armed forces and want us to overlook some of the residence requirements on that basis, you must provide confirmation from your employer of your dates of service.</p>

<p>Examples of documents that can be used to show you have been in the UK for the required time period, can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="#Residence_Requirements">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please note, you do not need to submit documents that have been uploaded as part of previous immigration applications – we will have a record of these and will consider them in support of your application.</p>

<h2>Lawful Residence</h2>

<p>You should have been in the UK lawfully during the 5 years before making your application.</p>

<p>Under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/contents/enacted" rel="external">The Nationality and Borders Act 2022</a>, you will normally meet this requirement where you have been granted indefinite leave to enter or remain in the UK. This means that, in most cases, you will only need to demonstrate that you hold valid indefinite leave in the UK in order to meet the lawful residence requirement. You will not normally need to provide evidence of your immigration status during the 5-year period.</p>

<p>If you are a dual EEA national, supplying evidence of your settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) will also normally meet this requirement. That also means you will not need to send evidence of what you were doing in the UK prior to being granted settled status.</p>

<p>This includes people who did not hold comprehensive sickness insurance under the EEA regulations whilst either a student or a self-sufficient person. You can now meet the lawful residence requirement simply by showing you have been granted settled status under the EUSS. You also no longer need to explain why you did not hold comprehensive sickness insurance.</p>

<h3>Right of abode</h3>

<p>Certain Commonwealth nationals, including those with dual nationality, have the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/right-of-abode-roa/right-of-abode-roa">right of abode</a> in the UK. A person with the right of abode is not subject to immigration control and so will have also been in the UK lawfully during the qualifying period.</p>

<h3>Irish nationals</h3>

<p>Irish citizens, including those with dual nationality, can enter and stay in the UK without requiring <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1061547/Common_travel_area.pdf" rel="external">permission</a>. (There are some limited exceptions to this, where the person is subject to a deportation order, exclusion decision or exclusion order, or travel ban.) If you are an Irish national as well as a British national, you will, therefore, have been in the UK lawfully during the qualifying period.</p>

<h2>Immigration time restrictions</h2>

<p>All applicants are required to show that, at the time of application, they are free from immigration time restrictions. You should also have been free from immigration time restrictions for 12 months before applying for citizenship. This means that you may need to wait until you have been in the UK for at least 6 years before you apply to register.</p>

<h3>Showing you are free from immigration time restrictions</h3>

<p>People who are free from immigration time restrictions will usually hold a status such as indefinite leave to remain (ILR), including ILR issued under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS), which is also known as settled status. You will also meet this condition if you have the right of abode in the UK. Irish citizens, including dual Irish and British nationals, are considered settled from their date of arrival in the UK, meaning they are free from immigration time restrictions for naturalisation purposes without having to hold leave under the immigration rules.</p>

<p>When applying, you can provide us with one of the following to show you are free from immigration time restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your 16-digit unique application number (UAN) (if you have been granted indefinite leave (also known as settled status) under the EUSS)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your biometric residence permit or any other documents confirming your right to remain permanently in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your passport showing permission to remain permanently in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Home Office letter by which you were given permission to remain permanently in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence of being freely landed, if you did not receive specific permission because you were freely landed as a Commonwealth citizen before 1971 or arrived as a child on your parent’s passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Valid certificate of entitlement to the right of abode</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are a dual Irish national, you must provide your Irish passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you believe you are free from immigration time restrictions for another reason, please give details on the form and provide relevant evidence of this.</p>

<p>If you are not free from immigration time restrictions, you should apply  for permission to stay permanently in the UK, and then wait a further 12 months, before you apply to register.</p>

<p>If you are an EEA or Swiss national (or their family member), please be aware the deadline for the EUSS was 30 June 2021, but <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-settlement-scheme-information-for-late-applicants/eu-settlement-scheme-information-for-late-applicants?msclkid=27235865ba4d11ec97905e572e1dcf03">applications can be made later</a> in certain circumstances where there are reasonable grounds to do so. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-inside-outside-uk/y/inside-the-uk/applying-to-continue-living-in-the-uk-including-settled-and-pre-settled-status/using-the-eu-exit-id-document-check-app">get help online or over the phone</a> if you require assistance making an EUSS application. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1032568/Naturalisation_as_British_citizen_by_discretion.pdf" rel="external">detailed caseworker guidance</a> explains how late applications granted under the EUSS will be considered for naturalisation purposes.</p>

<p>You can no longer apply for citizenship based on your permanent residence status and are advised to submit an EUSS application before submitting a naturalisation application.</p>

<p>A person who is outside the UK is, by definition, not subject to any restriction under the immigration laws on his or her maximum length of stay in the UK. However, the Home Secretary will normally refuse an application made outside the UK where it appears that the main reason for making the application in this way was to avoid the requirement about immigration restrictions. If you make your application overseas but would have had only a conditional right to remain in the UK on the date of application if you had remained here, your application is unlikely to succeed.</p>

<h2>Good Character</h2>

<p>The British Nationality Act 1981 contains a statutory requirement that those seeking to register as British under section 4(2) of the Act must be of good character. This means you must observe UK laws and show respect for the rights and freedoms of its citizens.</p>

<p>Before you complete this section, you are advised to refer to the good character policy guidance which caseworkers use to decide your application. This is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-character-nationality-policy-guidance">web</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/770960/good-character-guidance.pdf" rel="external">s</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/770960/good-character-guidance.pdf" rel="external">i</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/770960/good-character-guidance.pdf" rel="external">t</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/770960/good-character-guidance.pdf" rel="external">e</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/770960/good-character-guidance.pdf" rel="external">.</a></p>

<p>Checks will be carried out to ensure that the information you provide is correct. This may include checks with other government departments such as HM Revenue and Customs. If you are not honest about the information you provide, and you are registered on the basis of incorrect or fraudulent information you will be liable to have British citizenship taken away (deprivation) and you may be prosecuted. It is a criminal offence to make a false declaration knowing that it is untrue.</p>

<h3>Criminality</h3>

<p>You must give details of all criminal convictions both in the UK and overseas. This includes if you went to prison, or you received a non-custodial sentence such as a suspended sentence. You should also include any out-of-court disposal such as a fine, a caution, a warning or reprimand, a community sentence, a civil order, a hospital order or a restriction order. If you are not sure, you should declare all penalties or orders.</p>

<p>Fixed penalty notices for traffic offences such as speeding or parking tickets must also be disclosed, although will not normally be taken into account unless you have failed to pay and there were criminal proceedings as a result, or you have received multiple fixed penalty notices in a short space of time.</p>

<p>Where a fixed penalty notice (or fiscal fine in Scotland) has been referred to a court due to non-payment, or the notice has been unsuccessfully challenged by the person in court, we will consider it as a conviction and assess it in line with the new sentence imposed.</p>

<p>Drink driving offences must also be declared. If you have any endorsements on your driving licence you must provide the paper counterpart.</p>

<p>Criminal record checks will be carried out in all cases. If you have been charged with a criminal offence and are awaiting trial or sentencing, you are advised not to make any application for registration until the outcome is known.</p>

<p>You must give details of all civil judgments which have resulted in a court order being made against you as well as any civil penalties under the UK Immigration Acts. If you have been declared bankrupt at any time you should give details of the bankruptcy proceedings. (Your application is unlikely to succeed if you are an undischarged bankrupt).</p>

<p>You do not need to give details of family law proceedings such as divorce decrees, dissolved civil partnerships, guardianship orders, parental responsibility orders.</p>

<p>You must say if your details have been recorded by the police as a result of certain sexual offences, or if you are subject to one of the following orders: notification order, sexual offences prevention order, foreign travel order, risk of sexual harm order (or equivalent order made in a British overseas territory or any other country). If your details are recorded on the “sex offenders” register, even if any conviction is spent, the Home Secretary is unlikely to be satisfied that you meet the good character requirement and so an application for citizenship is unlikely to be successful.</p>

<p>You must say if there is any offence for which you may go to court, or which is awaiting hearing in court. This includes having been arrested for an offence and waiting to hear if you will be formally charged. If you have been arrested and not told that charges have been dropped, or that you will not have to appear in court, you may wish to confirm the position with the police. For applicants from Scotland any recent civil penalties must also be declared. You must tell us if you are arrested or charged with an offence after you make your application and while the application is under consideration. You risk prosecution under section 46 of the British Nationality Act 1981 if you do not do so.</p>

<h3>Terrorism and International Crimes</h3>

<p>You must say whether you have had any involvement in terrorism or whether you have been involved in any crimes in the course of armed conflict, including crimes against humanity, war crimes or genocide. If you are in any doubt as to whether something should be mentioned, you should mention it.</p>

<p>This guidance is not exhaustive. Before you answer these questions you should consider the full definitions of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide which can be found in Schedule 8 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010017.htm" rel="external">International Criminal Court Act</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010017.htm" rel="external">2</a><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010017.htm" rel="external">0</a><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010017.htm" rel="external">0</a><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010017.htm" rel="external">1</a><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010017.htm" rel="external">.</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, copies can be purchased from The Stationery Office, telephone<br>
0870 600 5522.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to satisfy yourself that you are familiar with the definitions and can answer the questions accurately.</p>

<p>Genocide - Acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.</p>

<p>Crimes against humanity - Acts committed at any time (not just during armed conflict) as part of a widespread or systematic attack, directed against any civilian population with knowledge of the attack. This would include offences such as murder, torture, rape, severe deprivation of liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law and enforced disappearance of persons.</p>

<p>War Crimes - Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions committed during an armed conflict. This includes an internal armed conflict and an international armed conflict. The types of acts that may constitute a war crime include wilful killing, torture, extensive destruction of property not justified by military necessity, unlawful deportation, the intentional targeting of civilians and the taking of hostages.</p>

<p>Terrorist Activities - Any act committed, or the threat of action, designed to influence a government or intimidate the public and made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause and that involves serious violence against a person; that may endanger another person’s life; creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public; involves serious damage to property; is designed to seriously disrupt or interfere with an electronic system.</p>

<p>Organisations concerned in terrorism - An organisation is concerned in terrorism if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>commits or participates in acts of terrorism,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prepares for terrorism,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>promotes or encourages terrorism (including the unlawful glorification of terrorism), or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is otherwise concerned in terrorism.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Deception</h3>

<p>If you have practised deception in your dealings with the Home Office or other Government Departments (such as by providing false information or fraudulent documents) this will be taken into account in considering whether you meet the good character requirement.</p>

<p>Your application will be refused if you have attempted to deceive the Home Office within the last 10 years.</p>

<h3>What if you haven’t been convicted but your character may be in doubt?</h3>

<p>You must say if there is any offence for which you may go to court, or which is awaiting hearing in court. This includes having been arrested for an offence and waiting to hear if you will be formally charged. If you have been arrested and not told that charges have been dropped, or that you will not have to appear in court, you may wish to confirm the position with the police. You must tell us if you are arrested or charged with an offence after you make your application and while the application is under consideration. You risk prosecution under section 46 of the British Nationality Act 1981 if you do not do so.</p>

<p>You must say whether you have been involved in anything which might indicate that you are not of good character. You must give information about any of these activities no matter how long ago this was. Checks will be made in all cases and your application may fail and your fee will not be fully refunded if you make an untruthful declaration. If you are in any doubt about whether you have done something, or it has been alleged that you have done something which might lead us to think that you are not of good character you should say so.</p>

<h2>Crown and designated service</h2>

<p>British Overseas Territories citizens, British Nationals (Overseas), British Overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons who do not meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#The_requirements">residence requirements</a> may be registered as British citizens if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they are or have been in Crown service under the government of a British Overseas territory, or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they are or have been in service as a member of a body established by law in a British overseas territory, the members of which are appointed by or on behalf of the Crown.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Registration will be ion an exceptional basis and at the Home Secretary’s discretion. You should show that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have been the holder of a responsible post, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have given outstanding service, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have some close connection with the United Kingdom.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should also explain the special circumstances you feel the Home Secretary should take into account when considering your application.</p>

<p>If you think you might qualify, you should write in the first instance, stating your case, to the Governor of the British overseas territory concerned.</p>

<p>Registration is not a reward for long service under the British Crown and is rarely granted on this basis.</p>

<h2>Additional provision for British Overseas Territories Citizens</h2>

<p>On 21 May 2002 anyone holding British Overseas Territories citizenship also automatically became a British citizen under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/8/contents" rel="external">British Overseas Territories Act 2002</a>. This means that most BOTCs will also be British citizens and will be able to live and work in the UK on that basis.</p>

<p>If you are a BOTC who does not also have British citizenship (for example, if you moved to the British Overseas Territory from another country and acquired BOTC status though naturalisation or registration after 21 May 2002) then you may apply to register as a British citizen unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your British Overseas Territories citizenship is by connection only with the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have previously ceased to be a British citizen as a result of a declaration of renunciation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Registration is at the discretion of the Home Secretary and subject to meeting the good character requirement.</p>

<h2>Referees</h2>

<p>Your application must be endorsed by 2 referees.</p>

<p>One referee can be of any nationality but must be a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications/accepted-occupations-for-countersignatories">professional person</a>. A professional person could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a minister of religion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>civil servant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a member of a professional body such as an accountant or a solicitor (but not one who is representing you with this application).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The other referee must be the holder of a British citizen passport and either a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications/accepted-occupations-for-countersignatories">professional person</a> or over the age of 25.</p>

<p>Each referee must not be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>related to you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>related to the other referee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your solicitor or agent representing you with this application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>employed by the Home Office</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will not usually accept a referee who has been convicted of an imprisonable offence during the last 10 years.</p>

<p>Checks may be carried out to ensure that the referees do not have unspent convictions and are qualified to act for you and that their signatures are genuine. It is a criminal offence to provide false information knowingly or recklessly, punishable with up to 3 months imprisonment or by a fine not exceeding £5,000 or both under section 46(1) of the British Nationality Act 1981.</p>

<h2>Biometric Enrolment</h2>

<p>Once your application has been submitted and you have paid the required <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table/home-office-immigration-and-nationality-fees-6-april-2022">application fee</a> you will be required to enrol biometric details.</p>

<p>You will be provided with instructions explaining where and how you need to enrol your biometric information after you have submitted your application. We may be able to re-use biometrics previously provided with earlier immigration applications. You will not be able to book a biometrics appointment, even if you know you will need one, until we have contacted you.</p>

<p>Children under 18 applying for registration as a British citizen must also enrol their biometric details. Children under the age of 6 do not need to provide fingerprints but must have a digital photograph taken of their face. Children under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian at their biometric enrolment appointment.</p>

<p>There is no upper age limit for biometric information to be taken.</p>

<p>Your application may be rejected as invalid if you do not enrol your biometrics when requested. There is no longer a fee for enrolling biometrics in the UK.</p>

<p>For more information about enrolling biometrics, please visit the following section of our website: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/biometric-residence-permits">http://www.gov.uk/biometricresidence-permits.</a></p>

<h2>Understanding the process</h2>

<h3>Before you apply</h3>

<p>Please ensure you have the correct documents before you apply. If you do not submit your application with supporting documents and pay the correct <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table/home-office-immigration-and-nationality-fees-6-april-2022">fee</a>, then the application will be returned to you unprocessed. You should indicate in the space provided what documents you have supplied and why.</p>

<p>Dual/multiple nationality</p>

<p>Dual nationality (sometimes called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dual-citizenship">dual citizenship</a>) is when someone holds British nationality and the nationality of another country at the same time. It is also possible to hold more than two nationalities at the same time.</p>

<p>The UK recognises dual and multiple nationality and allows British nationals who have more than one nationality to hold a British passport.</p>

<p>Before applying, you should be aware that not all countries accept dual and/or multiple citizenship and you may therefore lose, or have to give up, any other nationality you may hold in addition to your existing British nationality, in order to become a British citizen. If you have any questions about this, you should seek advice from the country of which you are already a citizen before making your application.</p>

<h3>Evidence of identity</h3>

<p>If you were issued with a Biometric Residence Permit, you must provide/use it in support of your application, alongside:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your passport* or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>National identity* card or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Home Office travel document* or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Home Office entitlement card* or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Home Office ARC letter* or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your birth certificate or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your photo driving licence* or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A bank, building society or credit card statement issued to you within the last 6 months</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have changed name and/or gender and do not have, or cannot obtain, any of these documents in your acquired identity you are also required to provide evidence of that change. This can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-gender-recognition-certificate">Gender Recognition Certificate</a> or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a letter from your doctor or medical consultant confirming that your change of gender is likely to be permanent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>change of name deed poll</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>marriage certificate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a civil partnership certificate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to provide evidence that you are a British Overseas Territories citizen, a British National (Overseas), a British Overseas citizen, a British subject, or a British protected person. You can demonstrate this most easily be providing your passport (as above), or your naturalisation or registration certificate. If you cannot provide these, and your claim is through your birth and/or your parents’ birth, send your birth certificate and, if possible, your parents’ birth and marriage certificates.</p>

<h3>Residence Requirements</h3>

<h4>Absences</h4>

<p>You should supply the following documents to show you have been mainly in the UK during the 5 years before making your application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your passports</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are unable to provide your passport, explain why and supply letters from employers (including start and finish dates), payslips, P60s, educational establishments or other government departments indicating your presence in the United Kingdom during the relevant period</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of documents that can be used to show you have been in the UK for the required time period, can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="#Residence_Requirements">here</a>.</p>

<p>Although we do not normally accept doctors’ letters on their own as proof of presence, these may be accepted if nothing else is available and the doctors can confirm that they have seen you on a regular basis during the period concerned.</p>

<p>If your passport is not stamped when you come into the United Kingdom, you must still provide your passport, but also provide alternative evidence of presence as above.</p>

<p>Please note, you do not need to submit documents that have been uploaded as part of previous immigration applications – we will have a record of these and will consider them in support of your application.</p>

<p>Demonstrating absences from the UK (if applying based on continuous UK residence)</p>

<p>We understand that sometimes people may not remember the exact dates of travel outside the UK. Please do your best to provide the relevant information and we will try to use our own records to help confirm your presence in the UK.</p>

<p>If you have had so many trips outside the UK that you exceed the size limit on the application form, please provide any additional absences as a separate attachment.</p>

<h4>Lawful Residence</h4>

<p>We have the power, under the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, to not enquire further into the lawful residence of an applicant, where you have been granted indefinite leave to enter or remain in the UK. This means that if you are applying based on 5 years’ residence in the UK, you will normally only need to demonstrate that you hold valid indefinite leave in the UK in order to meet the lawful residence requirement.</p>

<p>If you are a dual EEA national, supplying evidence of your settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) will also normally meet this requirement. That also means you will not need to send evidence of what you were doing in the UK prior to being granted settled status.</p>

<p>This includes people who did not hold comprehensive sickness insurance under the EEA regulations whilst either a student or a self-sufficient person. You can now meet the lawful residence requirement simply by showing you have been granted settled status under the EUSS. You also no longer need to explain why you did not hold comprehensive sickness insurance.</p>

<h3>If you are applying as a BOTC who does not already hold British citizenship</h3>

<p>You will need to provide evidence that you are a BOTC such as your passport or your naturalisation or registration certificate. You will also need to be of good character.</p>

<h3>If you are applying based on your Crown service</h3>

<p>You will need to provide a letter from the relevant employer confirming date and place of recruitment, position held, and the extent to which it would be in the employer’s interests for the application to be granted.</p>

<h3>Biometric Enrolment</h3>

<p>All applicants applying for British citizenship will need to enrol their biometric details to verify their identity as part of the application process. You will usually need to complete this step of the application process within 45 days of submitting your application and failure to do so would invalidate your application.</p>

<p>You will be provided with instructions explaining where and how you need to enrol your biometric information after you have submitted your application. We may be able to re-use biometrics previously provided with earlier immigration applications.</p>

<p>Enrolling biometrics for children</p>

<p>Child are also required to enrol their biometric details as part of their registration application.</p>

<p>Up to the age of 6 the Home Office only requires a digitised image of the child’s face, although the regulation does not prevent fingerprints being recorded from children aged less than 6 years. There is no upper age limit for biometric information to be taken. Children under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian at their biometric enrolment appointment.</p>

<h3>Application Processing Times</h3>

<p>We aim to conclude citizenship naturalisation applications within 6 months from the date on which we receive your application. Please do not contact us within this timeframe to request an update on your application – we will get in touch if we need any more information to help us make a decision.</p>

<h3>Travel after submitting an application</h3>

<p>After submitting your registration application, you are free to travel whilst you are waiting for a decision using your valid passport and evidence of your valid ILR, or other valid status. You do not need to tell us about your travel plans.</p>

<p>Please be aware, however, that you will usually be required to <a class="govuk-link" href="#Biometric_enrolment">enrol your biometric information</a> within 45 days of submitting your application. This may involve attending an appointment at a UK Visa and Citizenship Application Service (UKVCAS) Centre (operated by Sopra Steria) in person and failure to do so would invalidate an application. You will receive instructions on how to provide your biometric details once you have submitted your application.</p>

<p>In addition, please note that should we grant an application, there is a 90-day period where you will need to arrange attendance at a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Citizenship_Ceremonies">citizenship ceremony</a>.</p>

<p>But, outside of these timeframes, there is nothing in the citizenship process that would prevent you from travelling while your application is being considered.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that a registration application does not provide you with immigration permission and you will need to demonstrate your entitlement to re-enter the UK at the UK border.</p>

<p>You should ensure that we are able to contact you quickly if we have any queries about your application.</p>

<h3>Citizenship Ceremonies</h3>

<h4>Arranging a citizenship ceremony</h4>

<p>If your application is successful, you will be invited to attend a citizenship ceremony if you are over 18. You will receive an invitation from the Home Office, and this will confirm the local authority you should contact to arrange your ceremony.</p>

<p>Your ceremony invitation may be sent to you via email if you have applied online and we recommend checking your email’s spam or junk folder for any correspondence about your application.</p>

<p>We normally expect you to arrange to attend a ceremony within 3 months of receiving your invitation otherwise it will expire, and you will have to re- apply for registration and pay a further processing fee.</p>

<p>If you are outside the UK, arrangements will be made for you to make the oath/affirmation and pledge at the British Embassy, High Commission, Consulate, Governor’s Office or Lieutenant Governor’s Office.</p>

<p>You must make immediate contact with the local authority once you have been informed that your application is successful, as you only have 90 days in which to attend the ceremony. The date by which you must attend your ceremony will be given in your Home Office citizenship ceremony invitation. If you do not attend the ceremony within 90 days without good reason, your application for citizenship will be refused and you will need to re-apply.</p>

<h4>At the ceremony</h4>

<p>If you are over the age of 18, you will be asked to affirm or swear an Oath of Allegiance to the Monarch and to pledge your loyalty to the UK. This is a legal requirement for adults and is the point at which you will become a British citizen.</p>

<p>Following this you will be presented with your certificate of registration as a  British citizen.</p>

<p>If you have special needs or concerns about saying the Oath (or Affirmation) and Pledge in English, you should bring these to the attention of the local authority once you have received your invitation. Please be assured that the wording is of a level that a person who has met the language requirement should be able to understand.</p>

<p>You must ensure you have sufficient immigration permission to remain in the UK until you have attended your ceremony and made the Oath and Pledge. A citizenship application does not, in itself, give permission to stay in the UK.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<h4>What to do if there is an error on your citizenship certificate</h4>

<p>If you notice a mistake on your citizenship certificate, you will need to download and complete an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/correct-a-registration-or-naturalisation-certificate">application for a correction of a registration or naturalisation certificate</a>. You will then need to send the form and your original certificate to the following address:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Department 201  
<br>UKVI  
<br>The Capital  
<br>New Hall Place  
<br>Liverpool  
<br>L3 9PP
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You may need to pay to change the details on your certificate, depending on if the mistake is your fault (for example, if you provided incorrect details when you applied). UKVI will send you a letter telling you if you need to pay.</p>

<h4>Returning your Biometric Residence Permit (BRP)</h4>

<p>If you hold a Home Office issued immigration document, such as a BRP (or BRC), you should return it the Home Office within 5 working days of getting your certificate of British citizenship.</p>

<p>Please cut your BRP/BRC into 4 pieces and put it in a windowless envelope.</p>

<p>Please enclose a note saying you are returning your permit because you have become a British citizen. Include your name, date of birth and the document number (found on the front of the card) in the note.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Naturalisation BRP Returns  
<br>PO Box 195  
<br>Bristol  
<br>BS20 1BT
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Please note that you may be fined up to £1,000 if you do not return your permit within 5 working days.</p>

<h3>Travelling to and from the UK after registering</h3>

<p>Once you have completed the registration process, you will no longer be able to enter the UK using your BRP (if applicable) or by presenting your citizenship certificate at the UK border.</p>

<p>For travel purposes, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-adult-passport">apply for a British passport</a> or for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/right-of-abode/apply-for-a-certificate-of-entitlement">certificate of entitlement to the right of abode</a> that can be placed in a valid foreign passport.</p>

<h4>Citizenship-related queries</h4>

<p>If, having read the information set out in this guidance, you have questions about applying for British citizenship, you can email the Citizenship and Nationality Enquiries team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:nationalityenquiries@homeoffice.gov.uk">nationalityenquiries@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You should also contact them to let them know if you have made an application and your circumstances change (for example, you move house, get married or are arrested).</p>

<p>If you’ve not had a response, we recommend checking your email’s spam or junk folder before contacting UKVI again.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can get in touch via telephone on 0300 790 6268. You will need to select option 2, then option 2 again. You can get in touch Monday to Thursday from 9am to 4:45pm, or Friday, 9am to 4:30pm. Information about call charges can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/call-charges">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Applications submitted before 28 June 2022</h4>

<p>Changes introduced by the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 come into force on 28 June 2022. If you submitted your application before that date, we will still use the new powers to decide your application where this would be of benefit to you. For example, we can use ILR for the lawful residence requirement without the need to examine further evidence.</p>
