<p><strong>Your suppliers</strong> -  a list of related parties or suppliers previously recorded in the online form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Supplier information</h3>

<p>Where the supplier is a limited company, you must provide the company number. You can get information about companies from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/" rel="external">Companies House</a>. For all suppliers you need to provide an address.</p>

<p>Tell us about the person or organisation providing goods or services, selecting from the descriptions outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academy-trust-handbook/part-5-delegated-authorities#nbsp-nbsp-related-party-transactions">Academy Trust Handbook, section 5.49</a>.</p>

<p>If none of the available options apply, you will need to select ‘other’ and enter a description of the relationship in the free text box.</p>

<p>Using the checkboxes, you will be asked to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the supplier is listed in the academy trust register of business interests</li>
  <li>a signed statement of assurance has been received from the supplier</li>
  <li>an open book agreement is in place with the supplier</li>
  <li>whether you have received a donation from the supplier in the past</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have received donations from the supplier in the past, tell us which type of donation it was, by selecting from the list. If you select 'other' you must also complete a free text box.</p>

<p>If a formal contract is proposed, you need to select 'create a contract'. This includes new agreements and existing ones which are being renewed.</p>

<p>If details of an existing supplier have changed, contact us using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">ESFA enquiry form</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Contract or agreement</h3>

<p>This page only appears if you indicated that a formal contract is proposed.</p>

<p>Where a contract will be delivered across more than one financial year, the full contract value should be reflected in the first financial year of the contract period. For example, an agreement value of £25,000 comprising an estimated £5,000 of transactions per year over 5 years should be declared as £25,000 in the first year rather than £5,000.</p>

<p>The table sets out information you will need to provide about the contract.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Transaction information</h3>

<p>You need to provide the expected date, type and value of the transaction, contract or agreement.</p>

<p>The proposed date of transaction should be the expected start date of the agreement, or the date from which it will be renewed. This should be a future date as academy trusts are required to seek approval before confirming or renewing an agreement with a related party. For transactions made across more than one financial year, provide the transaction start date with further details of the contract duration or end date in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#_3.3_Contract_or">contract or agreement section</a> of the form.</p>

<p>Enter a description of the goods or services to be provided and include the proposed cost of the transaction. If the academy trust intends to recover VAT, the proposed cost should not include VAT.</p>

<p>The total value of transactions to date is calculated automatically. Where the cumulative total value of transactions with a single supplier exceeds £20,000, the transaction will be referred to ESFA for approval.</p>

<p>The total value of transactions refers to all transactions with the same supplier or related party within a financial year, including any that are being considered for approval.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Managing conflict of interest</h2>

<p>You must confirm whether the related party was involved in the decision-making process. You must provide a summary of how the conflict of interest was resolved, or how their involvement was managed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Upload evidence</h2>

<p>This section is only visible if the related party transaction requires approval from the ESFA. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/related-party-transactions-information-for-academy-trusts/checklist-information-needed-before-completing-the-on-line-form">checklist</a> sets out the type of documents to upload, to provide evidence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>of how you agreed to the related party transaction. This may include minutes from meetings where the related party transaction was discussed and agreed, and records of any relevant discussions.</li>
  <li>that your academy trust followed its procurement policy and, if applicable, any results or scores from a tendering process.</li>
  <li>that your academy trust tested the market before making a decision.</li>
  <li>to show how you have managed any conflict of interest.</li>
  <li>that a statement of assurance is in place.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to include a copy of the agreement or proposed contract.</p>

<p><strong>This is not an exhaustive list</strong></p>

<p>Accepted formats include PDF files and Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Check your answers</h3>

<p>The summary page shows all the information you have entered into the form. You can amend any of the information by using the 'back' button on the page to return to a section. You cannot amend the form once you've clicked 'save and submit'.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Academy trust details and declaration</h3>

<p>Review the contact information for the academy trust. If the details have changed or are incorrect, please contact ESFA enquiries, selecting 'related party transactions' from the options menu.</p>

<p>You must make declarations about the process followed to agree the proposed transaction. The declarations are that, on behalf of the academy trust:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I declare that conflicts of interest in the tendering of goods and services with the related party have been managed in line with policy guidelines</li>
  <li>I declare that the transaction complies with the “at cost” policy</li>
  <li>I declare that the transaction is an ’arm’s length transaction’</li>
</ul>

<p>Important</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The academy trust Accounting Officer is responsible for the accuracy of these declarations, including where these are made by others under delegated authority. The form must be completed by a representative of the academy trust who has authority to do so.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Submitting the completed online form</h2>

<p>After submitting the form, you’ll receive an email confirming receipt and providing a reference number for the transaction.</p>

<p>We aim to decide on requests for approving related party transactions within 10 working days, subject to receiving all relevant information and evidence. It is important that you submit requests for approval in sufficient time to allow ESFA to assess them.</p>

<p>You’ll receive an email confirming receipt and providing a reference number for the transaction.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>After submitting the form</h2>

<p>If you've made a mistake on the form, information has changed, or you've submitted the form by mistake, you will need to contact us. Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">ESFA enquiry form</a> stating the transaction reference number and the reason it needs to be removed or amended.</p>

<p>We will confirm with you when a submitted transaction did not need to be reported. The transaction will then be removed from your IDAMS account.</p>

<p>Transactions are given a status, as described at section 3.1. When a transaction status changes, an alert email is issued to prompt you to review the details on IDAMS.</p>

<p>We’ll send an email alert if we need further information about a transaction. Your IDAMS account will have details of the information we need to continue the assessment.</p>
