<h2>The Ukrainian Family Scheme</h2>

<p>On Friday 4 March, the UK launched the Ukraine Family Scheme.</p>

<p>The Ukraine Family Scheme allows immediate and extended family members of British nationals and people settled in the UK to come to the country. Those joining the Scheme will be granted leave for three years, giving them certainty and ensuring their future in the country.  The Scheme is free and does not include any salary or language requirements.</p>

<p>Those applying to the Ukraine Family Scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must be applying to join or accompany a UK-based family member</li>
  <li>must be Ukrainian or the immediate family member of a Ukrainian national who is applying to the scheme</li>
  <li>must have been residing in Ukraine prior to 1 January 2022 (including those who have now left Ukraine)</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications made under the Ukraine Family Scheme will be prioritised by the Home Office.</p>

<p>Those applying should await a decision before travelling to the UK. All applications will be subject to security checks. Applications are being fast tracked and additional staff have been surged across our centres in Europe to process applications.</p>

<p>Guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa">how to make an application to the Ukraine Family Scheme can be found on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>To access our 24/7 helpline call (+44 (0)808 164 8810  - select option 1).</p>

<h2>Ukrainian nationals already in the UK</h2>

<p>If you are here on work, study or visit visas in the UK, you will be able to switch onto different visa routes free of charge.</p>

<p>Ukrainian nationals on an existing points-based system route can extend their leave in the UK.</p>

<p>Ukrainian nationals on an existing visitor visa can exceptionally switch into a points-based system migration route without having to leave the UK.</p>

<p>Ukrainian nationals on an existing visitor visa can apply under the family route for further leave without meeting the immigration status requirement, provided they meet the requirements for leave based on exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>These concessions are available for people with valid visas in the UK. For those not eligible for these concessions, our immigration system remains open for applications via safe and legal routes.</p>

<h2>Safe and legal routes</h2>

<p>The Home Office also has several safe and legal routes under the points-based system which could be used by Ukrainian nationals to reach the UK.</p>

<p>Ukrainian nationals can get visas to work and study in the UK through the points-based immigration system, such as via the skilled worker route, graduate route, health and care visa or student route.</p>

<h2>Applying to come to the UK</h2>

<p>Applications can be made from one of our many visa applications centres across Europe. <br>
Ukrainian nationals have access to Schengen states, which enables them to reach safe neighbouring countries from which they can make their applications to come to the UK.</p>

<p>Further details on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre">VAC locations can be found on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Further support</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom is standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and we will be launching a new sponsorship scheme to make sure that Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes due to this terrible conflict have a route to safety.</p>

<p>Details are being developed and will be communicated in due course.</p>
