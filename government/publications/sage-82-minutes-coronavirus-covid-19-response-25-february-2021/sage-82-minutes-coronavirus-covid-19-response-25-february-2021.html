<p>Eighty-second <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> meeting on <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, 25 February 2021.</p>

<p>Held via Video Teleconference.</p>

<h2>Situation update</h2>

<p>1. The number of new infections continues to decline although there are signs of a slowing of the rate of decline, particularly in children and younger adults.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is between 0.6 and 0.9, and in England, Scotland, and Wales it is between 0.7 and 0.9. For Northern Ireland, <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> is between 0.6 and 0.9. The growth rate in new infections in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is between -6% and -2% per day. Estimates lag changes in transmission due to the time between people being infected, having symptoms, being tested and needing healthcare. Different models use different data (with different degrees of lag) but these combined estimates lag changes in transmission by 2 to 2 weeks.</p>

<p>3. There are currently estimated to be between 9,000 and 25,000 new infections per day in England. For the most recent week of the study (13 to 19 February 2021) the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> Community Infection Survey estimates that an average of 373,700 people had <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in the community in England (credible interval 346,400 to 401,300).</p>

<p>4. There remains heterogeneity in levels of transmission across the country, with some data suggesting that there are areas where the number of new infections is not declining and may be increasing. It would be useful to study the characteristics of these areas to understand if anything can be learnt about these communities or settings within them. It will be particularly important to monitor these areas as restrictions are relaxed.</p>

<p>5. As community prevalence decreases, outbreaks in particular settings will become more detectable and influential. There have been a significant number of recent outbreaks in prisons. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> has previously advised limiting transfer of individuals between prisons (see <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> 7).</p>

<p>6. The relationship between positive test results of different types (lateral flow and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) and the infectiousness of individuals is inferred from several indirect observations. A study comparing results of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, lateral flow tests, and virus culture, both between individuals and longitudinally within individuals, would be valuable for understanding this relationship. This could inform design of testing programmes.</p>

<p>7. There continue to be outbreaks of various new variants around the world. Reducing prevalence continues to be the most effective way of reducing the risk of the emergence of new variants of concern (high confidence). There may also be a need for guidance for those involved in the care of immunocompromised people with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, including advice on the use of therapeutic antibodies, to address specific risks in that group.</p>

<h2>Long <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>
</h2>

<p>8. In an <abbr title="International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium">ISARIC</abbr> study of the long-term effects of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in those that survived hospital admission (based on self-reporting from 325 people), half of participants reported feeling not fully recovered from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> (median follow-up 7 months). The response rate was around 40% and, as with all such studies, there may be some responder bias as individuals who experienced syptoms (or more significant symptoms) may have been more likely to respond.</p>

<p>9. Fatigue was the most common symptom (77% of respondents), followed by shortness of breath (54% of respondents). Fatigue and breathlessness commonly occurred together, often along with other neurological and pain symptoms. Around a quarter reported a new disability in sight, walking, memory, self-care and/or communication.</p>

<p>10. Long <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr> is likely to encompass a number of post-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr> syndromes rather than a single one, and these syndromes may have different outcomes. There may also be differences between those who were hospitalised compared to those who had infection that did not become severe. There are not currently any internationally agreed case definitions. The <abbr title="International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium">ISARIC</abbr> analysis shows that symptoms commonly occur in related clusters, which may provide some preliminary indications about sets of symptoms that define these syndromes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the first of these clusters includes fatigue, being breathless on exertion, headache, dizziness, muscle pain, joint pain, disturbance of balance and limb weakness</li>
  <li>the second is nested within the first and includes muscle pain, joint pain, disturbance of balance and limb weakness</li>
  <li>the third includes loss of smell, taste, difficulty passing urine, weight loss and disturbance of appetite</li>
</ul>

<p>11. Overall, participants reported a drop in quality of life including greater difficulty doing their usual activities and increases in anxiety, depression and pain.</p>

<p>12. Outcomes were worse in working age females than males. Females under 50 were over 5 times more likely to report incomplete recovery, over 5 times more likely to report a new disability, more likely to have severe fatigue, and more than 6 times more likely to report increased breathlessness than males under 50. The long-term impact of post-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr> syndromes on the working age population is not well-understood but is may be very significant.</p>

<p>13. Participants who had required invasive ventilation were 4 times more likely to report an incomplete recovery compared to those who had not required supplementary oxygen.</p>

<p>14. The most effective way to reduce prevalence of these syndromes is to reduce the prevalence of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> (high confidence). The impact of vaccination on reducing prevalence of these syndromes is not yet known; post-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr> syndromes can occur after mild disease and the impact of vaccination on mild disease is not yet entirely clear.</p>

<p>15. Further work is underway including studies in people who have not been hospitalised and work to bring together different studies to better understand the overall impact of these syndromes. It will be important to have a better understanding of physiology including oxygen levels, lung function and evidence of scarring.</p>
