<strong>1. How the tool works:</strong><br><br>1.1 The tool is made up of a machine learning model, integrated into a web application that can be accessed by Stakeholders within the Local Authorities (LAs) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Use of the system is voluntary and aims to provide a standard methodology for prioritising inspections of food businesses based on their predicted food hygiene rating.<br><br>1.2 A machine learning framework called LightGBM was used to develop the FHRS AI model. This model was trained on data from three sources: internal Food Standards Agency (FSA) FHRS data, publicly available Census data from the 2011 census and open data from HERE API.<br><br>1.3 Using this data, the model is trained to predict the food hygiene rating of an establishment awaiting its first inspection, as well as predicting whether the establishment is compliant or not.<br><br>1.4 Access to the web application is only granted to stakeholders within Local Authorities who have agreed to the terms and conditions of use. Users will have access to information on establishments within their remit, for example, users from the Ealing LA will only be able to access information about establishments within the Ealing area.<br><br>1.5 This information is presented to the user in three ways:<br><br>* as a table showing the establishment, predicted compliance and the predicted rating<br>* as an interactive map, again showing the establishment, predicted compliance, predicted rating, and finally the type of establishment<br>* as a CSV file download<br><br><strong>2.How it is incorporated into decision making process:</strong><br><br>2.1 This will be understood in more detail post alpha testing phase. A high-level summary of how we expect this to be incorporated into the decision-making process can be found in section 3.1<br><br><strong>3. Problem we’re aiming to solve:</strong><br><br>3.1 A significantly greater number of registrations of new businesses have been received by local authorities compared with pre-pandemic levels, and more businesses have changed their functions, which may require a new inspection to take place.<br><br>3.2 As a result, the number of businesses classified as ‘Awaiting Inspection’ on the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme website has increased steadily since the beginning of the pandemic. This has been the key driver behind the development of the FHRS AI use case.<br><br>3.3 More broadly, it is necessary to investigate whether this new technology can help LAs to manage their resources and increase the impact of their regulatory activity.<br><br><strong>4. Justification/Rationale:</strong><br><br>4.1 The objective is to help local authorities become more efficient in managing the hygiene inspection workload in the post-pandemic environment of constrained resources and rapidly evolving business models.<br><br>4.2 Not using Machine Learning may reduce the ability of local authorities to make use of data and digital to tackle their backlogs or to operate more efficiently. In the long-term this unrealised benefit may threaten the integrity of the food hygiene rating scheme or reduce consumer protection because a backlog may remain, or local authority resources may be used less efficiently.</td>

      <td>The system has been designed for:<br><br>* Supporting local authorities by taking a data-driven approach to prioritising their inspection regime. The FHRS rating and compliance prediction from the model, along with the knowledge of the subject matter experts engaging with the system, should be used together to deploy LA resources more effectively to establishments who show traits of being at a higher risk of non-compliance, and therefore those which may have a lower food hygiene rating.<br><br>The system has not been designed for:<br><br>* Replacing the current FHRS scheme and inspection regime. This means that food hygiene rating predicted by the model should not be used in place of the rating provided via a formal inspection in any situation<br>* Using the predicted food hygiene rating in isolation to prioritise the inspection regime.

Currently, this process is manual, labour intensive and inconsistent across Local Authorities. Therefore, the use of a robust, data driven approach may allow for a more efficient utilisation of limited resources, by prioritising inspections of those businesses that are more likely to be non-compliant.</td>

Due to the variations across all LA’s, it would be impractical to document how each one conducts the triage process in detail but in general the following factors are looked at as part of the decision-making process.<br><br>* Catering to Priority Groups<br>* Handling Process and Food Type<br>* Food Operator History<br>* Premise Structure<br>* Reach and Distribution</td>

This information is required to be managed and used securely as it may constitute personal information.<br>2. Potential bias from the model (e.g. consistently scoring establishments of a certain type much lower, less accurate predictions)<br>3. Potential bias from inspectors seeing predicted food hygiene ratings and whether the system has classified the establishment as compliant or not. This may have an impact on how the organisation is perceived before receiving a full inspection.<br>4. With the use of AI/ML there is a chance of decision automation bias or automation distrust bias occurring. Essentially, this refers to a user being over or under reliant on the system leading to a degradation of human-reasoning.</td>

These tools will also be integrated and monitored post-alpha testing to detect and mitigate potential biases from the system once fully operational<br>3. Continuously reflect, act and justify sessions with business and technical subject matter experts throughout the delivery of the project, along with the use of the three impact assessments outlined earlier to identify, assess and manage project risks<br>4. Development of usage guidance for local authorities specifically outlining how the service is expected to be used. This document also clearly states how the service should not be used, for example, the model outcome must not be the only indicator used when prioritising businesses for inspection.</td>
