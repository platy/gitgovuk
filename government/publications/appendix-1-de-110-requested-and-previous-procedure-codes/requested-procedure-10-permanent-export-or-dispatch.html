<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 10-series Requested Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Exports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>1007<br>
1040<br>
1042<br>
1044</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item.  This restriction does not apply to <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/10 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/18 where seals information is required for pre-departure declarations</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">1007 </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Removal of Union or free circulation goods from an excise warehousing procedure where neither excise duty nor (when applicable) VAT, has been paid, that are intended to be permanently exported to a non-EU country (B1).</p>

<p>Removal of Union or free circulation goods from an excise warehousing procedure where neither excise duty nor (when applicable) VAT, has been paid, that are intended to be permanently exported to any Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union (B4).</p>

<p>The law which governs the storage of goods in an excise warehouse may be found in section 17 of Notice 197.</p>

<p>Regulation 63A of the Excise Goods (Holding, Movement and Duty Point) Regulations 2010 (as amended) applies to direct exports under Customs Supervised Exports (<abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>) using a standard declaration only.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>Goods being declared using a Single Transport Contract (<abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>) or Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) regular use must be covered by an Excise Movement Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>) declaration.</p>

<p>Excise duty suspended movements are required to start at the tax warehouse of dispatch in the UK.</p>

<p>Warehouse keepers must not allow goods to leave their premises without a valid <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration (eAD â electronic Administrative Document) or <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> Fallback Document (<abbr title="EMCS Fallback Document">FAD</abbr>). The only exception to this is where goods are declared under <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> for direct export on a standard declaration.</p>

<p>The eAD/ <abbr title="EMCS Fallback Document">FAD</abbr> must be cross referenced by entering the ARC into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 of the export declaration.</p>

<p>An ARC number is not required in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, where <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> is being used with a standard declaration for direct exports only.</p>

<p>Excise guarantee details must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/2 (Guarantee Type) and 8/3 (Guarantee Reference) where no ARC number is provided in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>Discharge of the movement will be achieved when the dispatching warehouse keeper has received a report of export issued by HMRC via <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>. Guarantors should be aware that until the movement is discharged their liability for the excise duty remains.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The goods must be entered to the export procedure at an approved excise warehouse, registered tobacco store or other registered premises as declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse).</p>

<p>VATZ must not be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 when using this procedure code.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: F or Y, authorisation to use <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> (regular use) must also be held.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A, authorisation to use <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> must also be held.</p>

<p><abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> (regular use) may not be used with <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> for excise suspense goods.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> may not be used for indirect exports unless an <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration is provided.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code is to be used for the permanent export of goods to territories outside the territory of the Customs Union previously entered to end use.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>An end use authorisation, valid at the time the goods were originally entered to end use, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence of export must be retained to support the completion of the bill of discharge for end-use. Failure to demonstrate appropriate discharge of the relief through permanent export may result in a demand for the revenue relieved under end use being issued.</p>
