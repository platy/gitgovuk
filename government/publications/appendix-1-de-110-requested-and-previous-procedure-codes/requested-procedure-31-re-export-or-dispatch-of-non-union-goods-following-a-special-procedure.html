<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 31-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for re-exports.</p>

3153<br>
3154<br>
3171</p>

<p>To note: 3178 deleted as re-exports from a free zone do not require a written customs declaration.</p>

<p>This will be covered under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>.</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item.  This restriction does not apply to <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/10 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/18 where seals information is required for pre-departure declarations</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">3151: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code is used for the permanent re-exportation, to outside the territory of the Customs Union, of non-Union goods which were previously entered to Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) (B1).</p>

<p>This Procedure code may also be used for the dispatch of goods previously entered to VAT only <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> to any Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union (B4).</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Re-export of excise goods under <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>:</p>

<p>Goods being declared using a Single Transport Contract (<abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>) or Simplified Declaration Procedure (SDP) regular use must be covered by an Excise Movement Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>) declaration.</p>

<p>Exporters must not allow goods to leave their premises without a valid <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration (eAD â electronic Administrative Document) or <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> Fallback Document (FAD). The only exception to this is where goods are declared under Customs Supervised Exports (CSE) for direct re-export on a standard declaration.</p>

<p>The eAD/ FAD must be cross referenced by entering the ARC into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 of the re-export declaration.</p>

<p>An ARC number is not required in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, where CSE is being used with a standard declaration on a direct re-export only.</p>

<p>Excise guarantee details must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/2 (Guarantee Type) and 8/3 (Guarantee Reference) where no ARC number is provided in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>Discharge of the movement will be achieved when the Exporter has received a report of re-export issued by HMRC via <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>. Guarantors should be aware that until the movement is discharged their liability for the excise duty remains.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional MUCR.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence must be held and made available to Customs on request, demonstrating the audit trail between the re-exported goods and the goods previously imported to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Failure to submit a Bill of Discharge by the due date to the supervising office may lead to having to pay any suspended duty and VAT.</p>

<p>VATZ must not be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 when using this procedure code.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A or C, authorisation to use CSE must be held.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J, K, Y or Z authorisation to use SDP (regular use) or Entry in Declarantâs Records (EIDR) must also be held.</p>

<p>Additional declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2): C, F, J, K, Y or Z cannot be used where use of the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration. AI code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with code A or D in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 on this declaration.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>EIDR may only be used for direct exports and where the pre-departure declaration is waived, as per Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446, Article 245.</p>

<p>EIDR cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>SDP (regular use) may not be used with CSE for excise suspense goods.</p>

These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code is used for the permanent re-exportation, to outside the territory of the Customs Union, of non-Union goods which were previously entered to Temporary Admissions (TA) (B1).</p>

<p>This Procedure code may also be used for the dispatch of goods previously entered to VAT only TA to any Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union (B4).</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>A TA authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to TA, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Re-export of excise goods under TA:</p>

<p>Goods being declared using a Single Transport Contract (<abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>) or Simplified Declaration Procedure (SDP) regular use must be covered by an Excise Movement Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>) declaration.</p>

<p>Exporters must not allow goods to leave their premises without a valid <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration (eAD â electronic Administrative Document) or <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> Fallback Document (FAD). The only exception to this is where goods are declared under Customs Supervised Exports (CSE) for direct re-export on a standard declaration.</p>

<p>The eAD/ FAD must be cross referenced by entering the ARC into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 of the re-export declaration.</p>

<p>An ARC number is not required in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, where CSE is being used with a standard declaration on a direct re-export only.</p>

<p>Excise guarantee details must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/2 (Guarantee Type) and 8/3 (Guarantee Reference) where no ARC number is provided in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>Discharge of the movement will be achieved when the Exporter has received a report of re-export issued by HMRC via <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>. Guarantors should be aware that until the movement is discharged their liability for the excise duty remains.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence must be held and made available to Customs on request, demonstrating the audit trail between the re-exported goods and the goods temporarily imported.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were entered to TA.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A or C, authorisation to use CSE must be held.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J, K, Y or Z authorisation to use the SDP (regular use) or Entry in Declarantâs Records (EIDR) must also be held.</p>

<p>Additional declaration type (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2): C, F, J, K, Y or Z cannot be used where use TA was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration. If TA was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration, AI code 00100 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 may only be used with codes A or D in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 on this declaration.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State.</p>

<p>VATZ must not be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 when using this procedure code unless D51 is declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>SDP (regular use) and EIDR cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>EIDR may only be used for direct exports and where the pre-departure declaration is waived, as per Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446, Article 245</p>

<p>SDP (regular use) may not be used with CSE for excise suspense goods.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code is used for the permanent re-exportation, to outside the territory of the Customs Union, of non-Union goods which were previously entered to Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) in another Member State.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>A full, multi-state <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Re-export of excise goods under <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>:</p>

<p>Goods being declared using a Single Transport Contract (<abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>) must be covered by an Excise Movement Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>) declaration.</p>

<p>Exporters must not allow goods to leave their premises without a valid <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration (eAD â electronic Administrative Document) or <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> Fallback Document (FAD). The only exception to this is where goods are declared under Customs Supervised Exports (CSE) for direct re-exports.</p>

<p>The eAD/ FAD must be cross referenced by entering the ARC into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 of the re-export declaration.</p>

<p>An ARC number is not required in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, where CSE is being used for direct re-export only.</p>

<p>Excise guarantee details must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/2 (Guarantee Type) and 8/3 (Guarantee Reference) where no ARC number is provided in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>Discharge of the movement will be achieved when the Exporter has received a report of re-export issued by HMRC via <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>. Guarantors should be aware that until the movement is discharged their liability for the excise duty remains.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence must be held and made available to Customs on request, demonstrating the audit trail between the re-exported goods and the goods previously imported to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full multi-state authorisation being held at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration cannot be used with this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Failure to submit a Bill of Discharge by the due date to the supervising office may lead to having to pay any suspended duty and VAT.</p>

<p>VATZ must not be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 when using this procedure code.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A, authorisation to use CSE must be held.</p>

<p>CSE may not be used for excise suspense goods for indirect re-exports unless an <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration is provided.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (SDP) regular use or Entry in Declarantâs Records (EIDR).</p>

These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Re-export, to outside the territory of the Customs Union, of non-Union or Union goods previously entered to Customs Warehousing (B1).</p>

<p>Re-export of Union goods previously entered for VAT purposes only to a Customs Warehouse now being dispatched to a Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union (B4).</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to re-export non-Union or Union goods previously entered to customs warehousing to outside the territory of the Customs Union.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to dispatch Union goods from VAT only warehousing to a Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union.</p>

<p>A Customs Warehousing authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>The MRN of this declaration must be provided to the warehousekeeper for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a re-export procedure.</p>

<p>Re-export of excise goods under Customs Warehousing:</p>

<p>Goods being declared using a Single Transport Contract (<abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>) or Simplified Declaration Procedure (SDP) regular use must be covered by an Excise Movement Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>) declaration.</p>

<p>Warehouse keepers must not allow goods to leave their premises without a valid <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration (eAD â electronic Administrative Document) or <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> Fallback Document (FAD). The only exception to this is where goods are declared under Customs Supervised Exports (CSE) for direct exports on a standard declaration.</p>

<p>The eAD/ FAD must be cross referenced by entering the ARC into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 of the export declaration.</p>

<p>An ARC number is not required in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, where CSE is being used with a standard declaration on a direct export only.</p>

<p>Excise guarantee details must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/2 (Guarantee Type) and 8/3 (Guarantee Reference) where no ARC number is provided in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>Discharge of the movement will be achieved when the dispatching warehouse keeper has received a report of export issued by HMRC via <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>. Guarantors should be aware that until the movement is discharged their liability for the excise duty remains.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Non-Union goods must not be dispatched to a Special Fiscal Territory or territory with which the EU has formed a customs Union.</p>

<p>The goods must be entered to the export procedure at the approved customs warehouse as declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse).</p>

<p>VATZ must not be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 when using this procedure code.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation being held for Customs Warehousing.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A or C, authorisation to use CSE must be held.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F, J, K, Y or Z authorisation to use the SDP (regular use) or Entry in Declarantâs Records (EIDR) must also be held.</p>

<p>EIDR may not be used to re-export the goods where it was previously used to enter the goods to the Customs Warehouse.</p>

<p>EIDR cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code,</p>

<p>EIDR may only be used for direct exports and where the pre-departure declaration is waived, as per Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446. Article 245.</p>

<p>SDP (regular use) may not be used with CSE for excise suspense goods.</p>

<p>CSE may not be used for excise suspense goods for indirect exports unless an <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration is provided.</p>
