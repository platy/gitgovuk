These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code is used for the temporary exportation of goods under the Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure for goods previously entered to end use, that are not covered by Requested Procedure Code 21 (Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Articles 254 (end use) and 259 – 262 (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>)).</p>

<p>The goods temporarily exported under this procedure should be intended for processing outside the territory of the Customs Union prior to a subsequent claim to duty relief on their  re-entry to end use at re-importation.</p>

<p>This procedure code may be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The simultaneous application to textile products of the Outward Processing Textiles (<abbr title="Outward Processing Textiles">OPT</abbr>) procedure and the economic <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> procedure (Regulation (EC) No 3036/94).</li>
  <li>Temporary export of goods for repair, processing, adaptation, making up or re-working where no customs duties will be due at re-importation.</li>
  <li>Temporary export of goods previously held under end use, where the end use has not yet been fulfilled, where the goods are being sent for repair.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation is required to use this customs procedure. The <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration). See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>An end use authorisation, valid at the time the goods were originally entered to end use, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Evidence must be held and made available to Customs on request, demonstrating the audit trail between the temporarily exported goods and the subsequent re-importation of the compensating products.</p>

<p>Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the Exporter named in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 or 3/2 of this export declaration.</p>

<p>VAT relief cannot be claimed if the goods were sold while outside the Customs Union.</p>

<p>This procedure can only be used where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods were released to free circulation under a duty exemption or at a reduced rate of duty by virtue of their end use and</li>
  <li>the end use requirement has not been fulfilled unless the goods are being temporarily exported for repair.</li>
</ul>

<p>This procedure code should not be used for goods falling within the remit of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Requested Procedure Code 21.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The temporarily exported goods must be placed back under end use following their re-importation.</p>

<p><abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> may not be used for any of the following goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In excise duty suspense</li>
  <li>whose export or dispatch gives rise to repayment or remission of import duty</li>
  <li>whose export or dispatch gives rise to export refunds</li>
  <li>where a financial advantage other than refunds is granted under the CAP by virtue of the export or dispatch of those goods. Any refunds claimed at the time of exportation or dispatched will need to be repaid at re-import of the associated revenue paid prior to release</li>
</ul>

<p>Where VAT relief was claimed at the time of original importation, VATZ must not be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17.</p>

<p>Where VAT relief is intended to be claimed at re-import, VATZ must not be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 on the export declaration.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure  is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held for <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were originally entered to end use.</p>

<p>For Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation) the annual usage allowed is 3 per calendar year. Each individual transaction claiming the Authorisation by Customs Declaration is subject to a goods item value limit of £500,000.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be claimed where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occurs within the same Member State. Please refer to Notice 3001: Special Procedures, for additional requirements relating to the use of Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation).</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A, authorisation to use Customs Supervised Exports (<abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>) must be held.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) regular use or Entry in Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>
