<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 21-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Exports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>2100<br>
2144<br>
2151<br>
2154</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item. This restriction does not apply to <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/10 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/18 where seals information is required for pre-departure declarations</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">2100: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code is used for the temporary exportation of Union goods or goods in free circulation and home use goods under the Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure where the goods have not been subject to any previous procedure (Council Regulation (EU) No., Article 259 - 262).</p>

<p>The goods temporarily exported under this procedure should be intended for processing outside the territory of the Customs Union prior to a subsequent claim to duty relief on their re-importation.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation is required to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration). See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Evidence must be held and made available to Customs on request, demonstrating the audit trail between the temporarily exported goods and the subsequent re-importation of the compensating products.</p>

<p>Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the exporter named in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 or 3/2 of this export declaration.</p>

<p>VAT relief cannot be claimed if it is intended that the goods will be sold whilst outside the European Union.</p>

<p>This procedure code should not be used for goods falling within the remit of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Requested Procedure Code 22.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p><abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> may not be used for any of the following goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in customs, excise or VAT suspense</li>
  <li>whose export gives rise to repayment or remission of import duty</li>
  <li>whose export gives rise to export refunds</li>
  <li>where a financial advantage other than refunds is granted under the CAP by virtue of the export of those goods. Any refunds claimed at the time of exportation will need to be repaid at re-import of the associated revenue paid prior to release.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where VAT relief is intended to be claimed at re-import, VATZ must not be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 on the export declaration.</p>

<p>Goods may not be temporarily exported for processing under VAT only <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 B53 or B54 at export) using this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held for <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>For Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation) the annual usage allowed is 3 per calendar year. Each individual transaction claiming the Authorisation by Customs Declaration is subject to a goods item value limit  of Â£500,000.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be claimed where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occur within the same Member State.  Please refer to Notice 3001: Special Procedures, for additional requirements relating to the use of Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation).</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A, authorisation to use Customs Supervised Exports (<abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>) must be held.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) regular use or Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code is used for the temporary exportation of goods under the Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure for goods previously entered to end use (Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Articles 254 (end use) and 259 â 262 (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>)).</p>

<p>The goods temporarily exported under this procedure should be intended for processing outside the territory of the Customs Union prior to a subsequent claim to duty relief on their re-entry to end use at re-importation.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation is required to use this customs procedure.  This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration).  See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>An end use authorisation, valid at the time the goods were originally entered to end use, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Evidence must be held and made available to Customs on request, demonstrating the audit trail between the temporarily exported goods and the subsequent re-importation of the compensating products.</p>

<p>Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the exporter named in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 or 3/2 of this export declaration.</p>

<p>VAT relief cannot be claimed if the goods were sold while outside the European Union.</p>

<p>This procedure can only be used where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods were released to free circulation under a duty exemption or at a reduced rate of duty by virtue of their end use and</li>
  <li>the end use requirement has not been fulfilled.</li>
</ul>

<p>This procedure code should not be used for goods falling within the remit of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Requested Procedure Code 22.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The temporarily exported goods must be placed back under end use following their re-importation.</p>

<p><abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> may not be used for any of the following goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In excise duty suspense</li>
  <li>whose export gives rise to repayment or remission of import duty</li>
  <li>whose export gives rise to export refunds</li>
  <li>where a financial advantage other than refunds is granted under the CAP by virtue of the export of those goods. Any refunds claimed at the time of exportation will need to be repaid at re-import of the associated revenue paid prior to release.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where VAT relief was claimed at the time of original importation, VATZ must not be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17.</p>

<p>Where VAT relief is intended to be claimed at re-import, VATZ must not be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 on the export declaration.</p>

<p>Goods may not be temporarily exported for processing under VAT only <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 B53 or B54 at export) using this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held for <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were originally entered to end use.</p>

<p>For Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation) the annual usage allowed is 3 per calendar year.  Each individual transaction claiming the Authorisation by Customs Declaration is subject to a goods item value limit  of Â£500,000.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be claimed where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occur within the same Member State. Please refer to Notice 3001: Special Procedures, for additional requirements relating to the use of Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation).</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A, authorisation to use Customs Supervised Exports (<abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>) must be held.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) regular use or Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code is used for the temporary exportation of non-Union goods under the Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure for goods previously entered to Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) (Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Articles 256 (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) and 259 â 262 (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>)).</p>

<p>The goods temporarily exported under this procedure should be intended for processing outside the territory of the Customs Union prior to their subsequent re-entry to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> at re-importation.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation is required to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration). See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> authorisation, valid at the time the goods were originally entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Evidence must be held and made available to Customs on request, demonstrating the audit trail between the temporarily exported goods and the subsequent re-importation of the compensating products.</p>

<p>Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the exporter named in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 or 3/2 of this export declaration.</p>

<p>Temporary export of <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> excise goods under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>:</p>

<p>Goods being declared using a Single Transport Contract (<abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>) must be covered by an Excise Movement Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>) declaration.</p>

<p>Exporters must not allow goods to leave their premises without a valid <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration (<abbr title="electronic Administrative Document">eAD</abbr> â electronic Administrative Document) or <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> Fallback Document (<abbr title="EMCS Fallback Document">FAD</abbr>). The only exception to this is where goods are declared under Customs Supervised Exports (<abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>) for direct export.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="electronic Administrative Document">eAD</abbr>/ <abbr title="EMCS Fallback Document">FAD</abbr> must be cross referenced by entering the ARC into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 of the export declaration.</p>

<p>An ARC number is not required in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, where <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> is being used on a direct export only.</p>

<p>Excise guarantee details must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/2 (Guarantee Type) and 8/3 (Guarantee Reference) where no ARC number is provided in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>Discharge of the movement will be achieved when the Exporter has received a report of export issued by HMRC via <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>. Guarantors should be aware that until the movement is discharged their liability for the excise duty remains.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p><abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> may not be used for any of the following goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whose export gives rise to repayment or remission of import duty</li>
  <li>whose export gives rise to export refunds</li>
  <li>where a financial advantage other than refunds is granted under the CAP by virtue of the export of those goods. Any refunds claimed at the time of exportation will need to be repaid at re-import of the associated revenue paid prior to release.</li>
</ul>

<p>VATZ must not be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 when using this procedure code.</p>

<p>Goods may not be temporarily exported for processing under VAT only <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 B53 or B54 at export) using this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held for <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>This procedure code is only to be used where the <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> goods are being temporarily exported and will be re-entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> on their re-importation.</p>

<p>For permanent exportation for <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> goods, procedure code 3151 should be used.</p>

<p>For Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation) the annual usage allowed is 3 per calendar year.  Each individual transaction claiming the Authorisation by Customs Declaration is subject to a goods item value limit  of Â£500,000.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be claimed where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occur within the same Member State.  Please refer to Notice 3001: Special Procedures, for additional requirements relating to the use of Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation).</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A, authorisation to use <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> must be held.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> may not be used for excise suspense goods for indirect exports unless an <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration is provided.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) regular use or Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code is used for the temporary exportation of non-Union goods under the Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) procedure for goods have been previously entered to Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) in another Member State (Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Articles 256 (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) and 259 â 262 (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>)).</p>

<p>The goods temporarily exported under this procedure should be intended for processing outside the territory of the Customs Union prior to their subsequent re-entry to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> at re-importation.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation is required to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration). See conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>A full, multi-state <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>, is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Evidence must be held and made available to Customs on request, demonstrating the audit trail between the temporarily exported goods and the subsequent re-importation of the compensating products.</p>

<p>Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the exporter named in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 or 3/2 of this export declaration.</p>

<p>Temporary export of <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> excise goods under <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>:</p>

<p>Goods being declared using a Single Transport Contract (<abbr title="Single Transport Contract">STC</abbr>) must be covered by an Excise Movement Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>) declaration.</p>

<p>Exporters must not allow goods to leave their premises without a valid <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration (<abbr title="electronic Administrative Document">eAD</abbr> â electronic Administrative Document) or <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> Fallback Document (<abbr title="EMCS Fallback Document">FAD</abbr>). The only exception to this is where goods are declared under Customs Supervised Exports (<abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>) for direct export.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="electronic Administrative Document">eAD</abbr>/ <abbr title="EMCS Fallback Document">FAD</abbr> must be cross referenced by entering the ARC into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 of the export declaration.</p>

<p>An ARC number is not required in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, where <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> is being used on a direct export only.</p>

<p>Excise guarantee details must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/2 (Guarantee Type) and 8/3 (Guarantee Reference) where no ARC number is provided in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>Discharge of the movement will be achieved when the Exporter has received a report of export issued by HMRC via <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>. Guarantors should be aware that until the movement is discharged their liability for the excise duty remains.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p><abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> may not be used for any of the following goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whose export gives rise to repayment or remission of import duty</li>
  <li>whose export gives rise to export refunds</li>
  <li>where a financial advantage other than refunds is granted under the CAP by virtue of the export of those goods. Any refunds claimed at the time of exportation will need to be repaid at re-import of the associated revenue paid prior to release.</li>
</ul>

<p>VATZ must not be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 when using this procedure code.</p>

<p>Goods may not be temporarily exported for processing under VAT only <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 B53 or B54 at export) using this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held for <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The use of this procedure is subject to a full multi-state authorisation being held for <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> at the time the goods were entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>This procedure code is only to be used where the <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> goods are being temporarily exported and will be re-entered to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> on their re-importation.</p>

<p>For permanent exportation for <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> goods, procedure code 3154 should be used.</p>

<p>For Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation) for <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> the annual usage allowed is 3 per calendar year. Each individual transaction claiming the Authorisation by Customs Declaration is subject to a goods item value limit of Â£500,000.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be claimed where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occur within the same Member State. Please refer to Notice 3001: Special Procedures, for additional requirements relating to the use of Authorisations by Customs Declaration (simplified authorisation).</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A, authorisation to use <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> must be held.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> may not be used for excise suspense goods for indirect exports unless an <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> declaration is provided.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) regular use or Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>
