<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 23-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Exports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:<br></p>

<p>2300</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item. This restriction does not apply to <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/10 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/18 where seals information is required for pre-departure declarations.</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">2300: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure code is for the temporary exportation of Union goods or goods in free circulation and/ or home use, intended to be re-imported in an unaltered state where a claim to Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>) under Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013 (UCC), Article 203 will be made upon re-importation (B1).</p>

<p>This procedure code is for the temporary dispatch of Union goods or goods in free circulation and home use goods, intended to be re-imported in an unaltered state where a claim to <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> under Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013 (UCC), Article 203 will be made upon re-importation from any Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union (B4).</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to temporarily export Union goods or goods in free circulation and  home use goods to outside the territory of the Customs Union, with an intention to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> on re-importation (B1).</p>

<p>This Procedure Code is used to temporarily export Union goods or goods in free circulation and  home use goods to any Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union, with an intention to claim VAT relief under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> on re-importation (B4). Please see Notice 236 for detailed conditions regarding use of <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> with Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union.</p>

<p>Evidence must be available to demonstrate the status of the goods at their original export.</p>

<p>Where a claim will be made to relief from VAT at re-importation, proof of home use as well as free circulation status will be required. VATZ must not be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 on the export declaration.</p>

<p>On re-importation, the MRN of the export declaration or export customs clearance request must be declared as a previous document in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 using previous document code MRN.</p>

<p>Goods must return in an un-altered state (Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013 (UCC), Article 203), to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted). A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods that will increase the value or upgrade the specification.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for VAT relief at re-import, the legal declarant at export and re-import must be the same entity (the <abbr title="Economic Operation and Registration Identification">EORI</abbr> number or named person shown in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 or 3/2 at export and 3/15 or 3/16 at re-import must be the same).</p>

<p>VAT relief cannot be claimed if the goods were sold while outside the European Union unless the specific conditions in Notice 236 are met.</p>

<p>Please see Notice 236 for additional conditions for eligibility for <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Declarations to this procedure code must be pre-lodged, with the exception of Entry in Declarants Records (EIDR).</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Codes used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Duplicate list cannot be used with this procedure code.</p>

<p>Goods must not have been exported for the purpose of repair or process.</p>

<p>Goods must not be in customs, excise or VAT suspense.</p>

<p>Any revenue claimed at export must be repaid at re-import (for example, if VAT zero-rated at export, VAT must be paid at re-import).</p>

<p>Where VAT relief is intended to be claimed at re-importation, VATZ must not be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/17 on the export declaration.</p>

<p>This procedure code may not be used for goods in excise duty suspense or where excise drawback is being claimed at exportation.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: F, J, K, Y or Z authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedure (SDP) regular use or EIDR must also be held.</p>

<p>EIDR may only be used for direct exports and where the pre-departure declaration is waived, as per Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446, Article 245.</p>

<p>Where the INF document codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 are declared, EIDR may not be used.</p>

<p>EIDR cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code may not be used with Customs Supervised Exports (<abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>).</p>
