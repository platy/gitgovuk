<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 11-series Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/10 for Exports.</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:<br><br>
1100</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item. This restriction does not apply to <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/10 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/18 where seals information is required for pre-departure declarations</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2><span class="number">1100: </span></h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the Exporter that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>This procedure is to be used for equivalent Union goods or free circulation and home use goods being entered to the export procedure, for permanent export outside the territory of the Customs Union, using Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>) prior export equivalence (<abbr title="prior export equivalence">PEE</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>This procedure code may only be used with a full, authorisation for <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> <abbr title="prior export equivalence">PEE</abbr> valid at the time of exportation, see conditions and requirements detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence must be held and made available to Customs on request, demonstrating the audit trail between the exported equivalent goods and the subsequent importation of replacement products.</p>

<p>Evidence of export must be retained to support the completion of the bill of discharge for <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> following subsequent importation of replacement products.</p>

<p>Failure to demonstrate appropriate discharge of <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> through permanent export may result in a demand for the revenue suspended under <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> being issued.</p>

<p>The MRN of this export declaration must be included as a previous document reference on the subsequent import of the replacement products in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 of the import declaration.</p>

<p>Declaration category C1 C&amp;F (Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) regular use) - these goods must be entered by or on behalf of the <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> authorisation holder whose <abbr title="prior export equivalence">PEE</abbr> authorisation must include approval to use <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> (regular use).</p>

<p>Where an Indirect Representative is used, they must be approved to use <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> (regular use) at export and be named on the <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> authorisation under which the <abbr title="prior export equivalence">PEE</abbr> goods are exported.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>The subsequently imported replacement products must be declared using Procedure Code 5111 in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10.</p>

<p>A full <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> authorisation, valid at the time of exportation, is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.</p>

<p>Authorisation by Customs Declaration cannot be used with this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: A or C, authorisation to use Customs Supervised Exports (<abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>) must be held.</p>

<p>Where the additional declaration type used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is: C, F or Y authorisation to use the <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> (regular use) must be held.</p>

<p>Goods must not be in customs, excise or VAT suspense.</p>

<p><abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> (regular use) cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code cannot be used with Entry in Declarantâs Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>
