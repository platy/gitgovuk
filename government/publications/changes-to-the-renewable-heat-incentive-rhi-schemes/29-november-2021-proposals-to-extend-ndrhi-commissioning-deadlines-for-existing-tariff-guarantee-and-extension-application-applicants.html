<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Government has implemented multiple measures to support Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (<abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr>) projects through challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are now looking to implement further support for these projects, by providing an additional 12-month extension for the <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr>’s remaining tariff guarantee (<abbr title="tariff guarantee">TG</abbr>) and extension application deadlines for non-biomethane technologies.</p>

<h2>Policy background</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr> closed to new applicants on 31 March 2021, as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/non-domestic-renewable-heat-incentive-ensuring-a-sustainable-scheme">government response <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr> – Ensuring a Sustainable Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>Government implemented <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-the-renewable-heat-incentive-rhi-schemes">several measures</a> to support plants through COVID-19, including extending the second tariff guarantee allocation (<abbr title="second tariff guarantee allocation">TG2</abbr>), introducing a third tariff guarantee allocation (<abbr title="third tariff guarantee allocation">TG3</abbr>) and allowing COVID-19 affected plants to apply for a year longer to commission through an ‘extension application’. We also introduced modified capacity for shared ground loops, to allow projects to commission their heat capacity in stages rather than all at once (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/non-domestic-renewable-heat-incentive-ensuring-a-sustainable-scheme">consultation outcome</a> for more information).</p>

<p>We recognise the difficulty some projects have continued to face in meeting their commissioning deadlines, due to a range of factors including the COVID-19 pandemic. We want to ensure projects that otherwise would have been able to commission by 31 March 2022 are not prevented from doing so due to extenuating factors.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">29 November </span> 2021: Proposal for an extension</h2>

<p>We propose to extend the deadline for commissioning for eligible <abbr title="second tariff guarantee allocation">TG2</abbr>, <abbr title="third tariff guarantee allocation">TG3</abbr> and extension applications from 31 March 2022 to 31 March 2023. This extension will only affect applicants who already have a Tariff Guarantee or have successfully made an extension application. Tariff payments will continue to cease by 31 March 2041. This extension does not affect withdrawn Tariff Guarantee or extension applications.</p>

<p>We judge that a 12-month extension to deadlines, until 31 March 2023, will give sufficient time for projects currently experiencing disruption to be able to successfully commission.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr> technologies with eligible <abbr title="second tariff guarantee allocation">TG2</abbr>, <abbr title="third tariff guarantee allocation">TG3</abbr> and extension applications will be eligible for these proposed extensions, except for biomethane. This is because <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr> biomethane Tariff Guarantee applicants are able to apply to the successor Green Gas Support Scheme (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>). As set out in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/970565/green-gas-levy-future-support-low-carbon-heat-govt-response.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> Government Response</a>, current <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr> tariff guarantee applicants can apply for the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> by either withdrawing their <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr> tariff guarantee application before the coming into force date of the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> regulations, or by letting their tariff guarantee application time-out.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Do you agree with our proposal to extend TG2, TG3 and extension application deadlines for non-biomethane technologies by 12 months to 31 March 2023? Please explain your reasoning and include any evidence you think is relevant.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Further details on taking forward either of these measures will be published in a further government publication. Please send any responses to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:RHI.consultations@beis.gov.uk">RHI.consultations@beis.gov.uk</a> by 20 December 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19 January </span> 2022: Government response</h2>

<p>We received 35 responses to this question: all expressed strong support for the proposals. Respondents agreed that the delays caused by COVID-19 had made the commissioning of Non-Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (<abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr>) projects harder to deliver. Issues cited included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shortages in materials</li>
  <li>parts and labour</li>
  <li>increased delays in supply chains</li>
</ul>

<p>Some respondents also highlighted that while the Green Gas Support Scheme (<abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>) was a positive successor scheme for most <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr> biomethane projects, some projects at risk from COVID-19 delays would be ineligible for the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>.</p>

<p>We therefore will implement a 12-month extension to the commissioning deadline, from 31 March 2022 to 31 March 2023.</p>

<p>We will apply this extension more broadly than our original proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it will apply to all <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr> technologies with eligible <abbr title="second tariff guarantee allocation">TG2</abbr>, <abbr title="third tariff guarantee allocation">TG3</abbr> or extension applications, including to biomethane projects who could not become eligible for the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>it will not apply to <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr> biomethane projects that would become eligible for the <abbr title="Green Gas Support Scheme">GGSS</abbr> if their current <abbr title="tariff guarantee">TG</abbr> application timed out</li>
</ul>

<p>The extension applies automatically to existing eligible applications. Ofgem will provide guidance on what evidence biomethane plants should submit to show that the project would not become eligible for the Green Gas Support Scheme, such as evidence of their equipment being pre-used.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive">NDRHI</abbr> will remain closed to new applications. Cancelled or withdrawn applications will not be re-opened or extended.</p>
