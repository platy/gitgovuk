<p>The period product scheme is available to all <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school">state maintained schools</a> and 16 to 19 education organisations in England. It provides free period products to girls and women<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> who need them in their place of study. The scheme is available for organisations to order until July 2024.</p>

<p>To make sure organisations have access to a wide range of period products in the most cost-effective and efficient way, we have a contract with Personnel Hygiene Services Limited (<abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr>). This allows you to order period products and have them delivered when you need them.</p>

<p>This guidance contains information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>choosing and ordering period products</li>
  <li>distributing products within institutions</li>
  <li>tackling stigma</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Period products, such as pads and tampons, should be available for all who need them, when they need them, in order to access education. Having periods should not be a barrier to education for anyone. Making girls and women aware of the scheme is vital to making sure they can access period products when they are needed and to reduce the stigma surrounding periods.</p>

<p>This scheme is for all girls and women who need to access period products in their place of learning in order to access education. It is not a universal offer of free period products to everyone under the age of 19. This would be prohibitively costly and would not represent good value for taxpayers’ money.</p>

<p>When ordering products, you should consider the specific needs, characteristics and preferences of all learners.</p>

<p>When deciding how to distribute products, you should consider the potential impact that any perceived stigma around periods could have on access to products.</p>

<h2>Who is eligible</h2>

<p>Girls, women, and learners who identify as non-binary or transgender, who have periods may all need to access this scheme. All learners in schools and 16 to 19 organisations should be able to access period products if they need them. This may include, for example, where individuals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have forgotten their products</li>
  <li>cannot afford products</li>
  <li>have come on their period unexpectedly</li>
</ul>

<p>Girls and women under 19 in the current academic year may receive support from the scheme.</p>

<p>Women aged 19 or over are only eligible for support if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are continuing on a study programme they began aged 16 to 18 (‘19+ continuers’)</li>
  <li>have an education, health and care plan</li>
</ul>

<h3>Not covered by the scheme</h3>

<p>The scheme does not cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>girls and women on higher education qualifications</li>
  <li>apprentices</li>
  <li>women who are staff (including supply staff, volunteers and contractors)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to order products</h2>

<p>Our supplier, <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr>, will stock and deliver period products. They will also offer customer service support relating to the ordering and delivery of products.</p>

<p>You will be able to order a range of period products and have these delivered free of charge. There will be a spend cap on the amount you have to spend. Find out how we calculate this and <a class="govuk-link" href="#what-you-will-get">what you will get</a>. The available budget for your school or organisation will show on the ordering portal.</p>

<p>You can order products using your spend cap, which is your allocation covering the period September 2022 until July 2023.</p>

<p>You can order at any point in the year until July 2023. To reduce waste, you should wait until any stocks of existing period products you may have are low before ordering.</p>

<p>When ordering products, you should think carefully about the types of products selected and consider the environmental impact of the frequency of deliveries.</p>

<h3>Recommended ordering frequencies</h3>

<p>We recommend these ordering frequencies based on your annual budget for period products.</p>

<h3>Setting up an account</h3>

<p>When the scheme launched in January 2020 we provided <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> with one email address for each organisation. 
This is linked to your account on the <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> portal. Phs sent an activation email to this email address, which enables you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up a password</li>
  <li>log in</li>
  <li>order products</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have already activated your account, you can continue to use these details to order products in the 2022 to 2023 school year. If you have not activated your account, <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> will send a new activation email in September 2022. The email will be sent to the email address that is held by the Department for Education.</p>

<p>If you have not received an activation email by 16 September 2022, check your ‘admin@’ and ‘enquiries@’ account(s) and spam folder. If you cannot find the activation email in any of these locations, call <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> on 01827 255500.</p>

<p>To change the email address linked to your account or request extra log-in accounts, call <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> on 01827 255500.</p>

<h3>Accounts for organisations with multiple addresses</h3>

<p>Each organisation has been set up with one account which has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one spend cap</li>
  <li>one delivery address</li>
</ul>

<p>An activation email was sent to the email address linked to this ‘parent site’ account. If your account has not previously been activated, a new activation email will be sent in September 2022.</p>

<p>If you are the parent site in a multi-site organisation, you can choose whether to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>order products and have them delivered to your registered delivery address</li>
  <li>order products and request that they are delivered to other registered sites - you must place these orders by phone and the delivery address will be amended for that order only</li>
  <li>divide the spend cap between your registered sites</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also request log-in accounts for staff in other sites to order and have products delivered to their registered addresses. A senior member of staff from the parent site (such as the headteacher or finance director) must contact <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> to arrange this. To verify each new site, you will need to provide a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> and/or <abbr title="UK provider registration number">UKPRN</abbr> for the organisation</li>
  <li>staff name and email address</li>
  <li>full postal address</li>
</ul>

<p>As a parent site, you can place orders and arrange deliveries for other sites if required.</p>

<h3>Ordering process</h3>

<p>You will be able to access the scheme using the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.phsdirect.co.uk/periodproducts" rel="external"><abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> portal</a>. We recommend you use the portal as it contains the information you need to place the right orders. If you need an alternative method for ordering, you can call <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Online</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.phsdirect.co.uk/periodproducts" rel="external"><abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> portal</a> contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information about the products available to order (including safety information and ingredients)</li>
  <li>spend caps for the year</li>
</ul>

<p>Phs’ <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.phsdirect.co.uk/media/3251/phs-dfe-period-products-user-guide-v1.pdf" rel="external">detailed user guide</a> explains how to access the portal and order products.</p>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmation email. The order confirmation screen on the <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> portal will tell you where the confirmation email is being sent.</p>

<p>This email allows you to access details about the products you have ordered, including important safety information. You can track the progress of your delivery via a link in the <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> portal.</p>

<p>To minimise incorrect orders, you should check your order confirmation email as soon as you get it. If there are any issues, call <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> on 01827 255500.</p>

<h4>Phone</h4>

<p>You will also be able to order period products by phone. Lines will be open from 8.30am until 5pm on normal business days. This includes school holidays but excludes weekends and bank holidays and public holidays.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

<p>You should check all items are present and undamaged before signing for a delivery. You should consider school holidays when ordering, as a member of staff must be present to sign for the package. All items should then be stored in a clean, dry environment.</p>

<p>You cannot get products delivered to addresses other than registered education sites. If you would like products delivered to a different registered education site, call <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> on 01827 255500.

</li>
  <li>contact <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> on 01827 255500</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cancelling an order</h3>

<p>If you wish to cancel an order, call <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> as soon as possible on 01827 255500. Cancellations will be accepted up to 3pm on the day before delivery is due.</p>

<h2>What you will get</h2>

<p>In September 2022 you will receive your funding allocation, which you can use to order products up to and including July 2023.</p>

<p>We have based this amount on 35% of the number of recorded girls and women in your organisation who, based on age, are likely to have started their periods. This is how your total amounts have been calculated in previous years of the scheme.</p>

<p>The 35% is an assumed take-up rate, reflecting the fact that not all girls and women will have a need for products all of the time. This mirrors the assumed take-up rate used in the scheme to provide learners in Scotland with access to free period products.</p>

<p>You can see the amount you can spend for the 2022 to 2023 school year on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.phsdirect.co.uk/periodproducts/user-login/?returnUrl=/periodproducts/" rel="external"><abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> portal</a> from 8 September 2022. If you have both girls of secondary school-age and girls and women aged 16 to 19, or you are a middle or all-through school, you will receive one spend cap for the year.</p>

<p>Spend caps have been set for each organisation within a multi-academy trust.</p>

<p>You will be able to track spend against your spend cap throughout the year.</p>

<p>Larger organisations will be able to order up to 25% of their total spend for the year, each time they order. To keep our carbon footprint low, each order should have a minimum value of £5.</p>

<p>You will be responsible for monitoring and staying within your spend and order caps. The <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> portal will ask you to reduce your order if you try to exceed your maximum spend or order cap.</p>

<h2>Products available</h2>

<p>You will be able to select from a wide range of period products, varying in type, size and brand. When deciding which products to order, you should consider individual needs and preferences.</p>

<p>You may want to speak to girls and women about the types of products to keep in stock. You could do this by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>engaging with student councils</li>
  <li>holding informal discussions with learners</li>
  <li>sending out anonymous surveys</li>
</ul>

<p>Our research found that participants thought it was important their views were heard when organisations were making decisions about ordering period products. When choosing products, they would prioritise comfort, familiarity and value for money.</p>

<p>Parents or carers may object to the use of some period products. You should consider the views of girls and women and parents or carers from all religious and cultural backgrounds when ordering products. More information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#equality-requirements">equality requirements</a> section.</p>

<p>Not all period products are suitable for girls and women with specific disabilities. You should ensure you have methods to gather the views of disabled girls and women, and make suitable products which meet their needs available in your setting.</p>

<p>You must provide safety information for each product in an accessible format, prior to use. Further information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#your-responsibilities">your responsibilities</a> section.</p>

<p>You do not need to order the same products throughout the year. You may wish to trial some products in smaller quantities to begin with. We may adjust the product range available to you following feedback and monitoring of purchasing patterns.</p>

<h3>Things to consider when choosing products</h3>

<h4>Period pads</h4>

<p>The period pads:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are available in regular (‘normal’) both with and without wings, and long with wings</li>
  <li>are made of polyolefins, absorbent wood cellulose with polyolefin, absorbent gel, rayon, or polyester</li>
  <li>can be stored for up to 2 years</li>
</ul>

<p>The environmentally friendly period pads are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are available in regular (‘normal’) with wings and super with wings</li>
  <li>are made of organic cotton, biodegradable corn starch film, siliconised paper and hotmelt latex-free adhesive</li>
  <li>can be stored for up to 3 years</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2018, Scotland began funding a scheme providing learners with access to period products. Their scheme found that period pads made up 73% of all products purchased by schools.</p>

<p>Evidence from our research suggested that pads were the most popular product amongst participants, who perceived them as being easier to use than other products.</p>

<h4>Reusable period pads</h4>

<p>The reusable period pads:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are available in mini with wings and midi with wings</li>
  <li>are made of brush nylon, polyester, polyester microfibre and <abbr title="PolyUrethane">PU</abbr> laminate</li>
  <li>last for up to 10 years</li>
</ul>

<p>You would need to provide these products for individuals to keep. If an individual were to use these products for the duration of their period, they would need approximately 10 to 12 pads. You may wish to consider the long-term cost and the environmental benefit of providing these products.</p>

<p>The safety information for this product indicates that the pads must be washed after being worn for 4 to 6 hours. Washing instructions for this product advise that users rinse products immediately after use with cold water, before storing them in a wet bag and then washing them at 40 degrees with other laundry items.</p>

<p>If you choose to provide reusable pads, you must make sure users have access to a wet bag and appropriate facilities to rinse the products before placing them in the bag. Wet bags are available to order through this scheme.</p>

<p>Our research found that participants had concerns that these products were less sanitary than disposable pads. They also held the misconception that these were shared rather than individual products and would need to be washed and returned after each use.</p>

<p>You should provide all learners with relevant health and safety information and make them aware of the risks of improper use. This will help dispel any myths about using these products.</p>

<h4>Tampons</h4>

<p>Both applicator and non-applicator tampons (including organic non-applicator tampons) are available to order.</p>

<p>The applicator tampons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are available in regular, super and super plus</li>
  <li>are made of rayon, polyester, cotton</li>
  <li>can be stored until the expiry date on the pack</li>
</ul>

<p>The non-applicator tampons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are available in regular, super and super plus</li>
  <li>are made of viscose with a polyester/polyethylene cover and a cotton and/or polyester string</li>
  <li>can be stored until the expiry date listed on the pack</li>
</ul>

<p>The organic non-applicator tampons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are available in regular, super and super plus</li>
  <li>are made of organic cotton with a polypropylene wrapping</li>
  <li>can be stored for up to 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>In the scheme to provide learners in Scotland with access to period products, tampons made up 57% of the products purchased by colleges.</p>

<p>Our research found that while some participants used tampons, others had concerns about how to insert the product properly and found them difficult to use.</p>

<p>Tampons are an internal product and you should think about learners’ age and individual needs when considering which products to buy. Internal period products carry the additional risk of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Toxic-shock-syndrome/" rel="external">toxic shock syndrome (<abbr title="toxic shock syndrome">TSS</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>If you choose this product, you must provide relevant health and safety information and ensure awareness of the risks of improper use. You should read about <a class="govuk-link" href="#your-responsibilities">your responsibilities</a> before distributing tampons.</p>

<p>You should also be aware of religious and cultural beliefs around tampons when considering which products to buy and you should consider the views of parents and carers before distributing tampons. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#equality-requirements">equality requirements</a> section for more information.</p>

<p>Flushing any period product down the toilet is harmful to the environment. It may also result in drain blockages and/or damage to the plumbing. You should make all learners aware of the importance of disposing of tampons and other products correctly.</p>

<h4>Menstrual cups</h4>

<p>The menstrual cups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are available in size A and size B</li>
  <li>are made of medical grade silicon</li>
  <li>last for up to 10 years</li>
</ul>

<p>Menstrual cups can be reused and last for up to 10 years if cleaned and stored correctly. These are extremely environmentally friendly, and you may wish to consider the long-term cost and environmental benefit of providing these products.</p>

<p>The safety information for this product indicates that cups must be removed, emptied and washed at least every 4 to 8 hours during an individual’s period. You should consider whether you have the facilities (such as sinks in individual toilet cubicles) to allow for this to happen discreetly, safely and hygienically.</p>

<p>Menstrual cups are internal period products. You should provide learners with relevant health and safety information in an accessible format. You must make them aware of the risks of improper use, including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Toxic-shock-syndrome/" rel="external"><abbr title="toxic shock syndrome">TSS</abbr></a>. You should read about <a class="govuk-link" href="#your-responsibilities">your responsibilities</a> before distributing menstrual cups.</p>

<p>Our research found that knowledge of this product and how to use it was low amongst participants. Menstrual cups may be difficult for some disabled individuals to use. You should consider finding out if individuals would like this product on offer before ordering, and ensure alternative products are available for those who may require them.</p>

<p>You should also consider the religious and cultural views of parents, carers and girls and women when purchasing this product. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#equality-requirements">equality requirements</a> section for more information.</p>

<h4>Period pants</h4>

<p>The period pants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are available in black and sizes 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18</li>
  <li>can hold up to 3 tampons worth of fluid</li>
  <li>are stain- and odour-resistant</li>
  <li>can be reused</li>
  <li>can be used on their own, or alongside other products</li>
</ul>

<p>Period pants are designed for long-term use and offer a sustainable alternative to other period products. You should consider ordering this product in smaller quantities to ensure the needs of your learners are met before committing to larger volumes.</p>

<p>A sizing chart and care instructions are available on the <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> portal. Following these closely will allow learners to get the most out of their period pants.</p>

<p>Period pants are easy-to-use, external products which offer immediate and discreet protection. For this reason, they may be most suitable for individuals who have started their period unexpectedly, or who may have difficulty using other period products. This may include, for example, younger pupils or pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>). Organisations should take this and other cultural and religious needs into consideration.</p>

<p>Like other reusable products, period pants require additional care at home, including the need to wash them in a washing machine. The pupil or their parents will be need to ensure they have clean products available for their period. You should consider whether this is suitable for your pupils before ordering this product.</p>

<h4>Tights</h4>

<p>Tights are available in black in sizes small to medium and medium to large.</p>

<p>Organisations may wish to have tights on hand for pupils who have started their periods unexpectedly and so require fresh underwear. This may include, for example, younger pupils or pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>.</p>

<p>These are supplementary items and not intended as a uniform provision. We would expect schools to spend no more than 25% of their budget on these products.</p>

<h2>Your responsibilities</h2>

<p>All management information on the <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> portal is available to the Department for Education. You will not need to routinely report on the scheme or how you have used it.</p>

<p>The Department for Education will publish data on use of the scheme on an annual basis. See the last data publication on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/period-products-scheme-management-information">period products scheme</a> for more information.</p>

<p>There is a relatively low risk of injury from the use of period products. All period products available through the scheme meet the relevant industry standards and regulations. You can find detailed information about the products on the <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr> portal and via your order confirmation email.</p>

<p>You will also receive safety guidance specific to each product you order. Product and safety information may be updated and you should always refer to the information provided with the product.</p>

<p>You must provide learners with safety information for each product in an accessible format before they use the product. This is particularly important for internal products, such as tampons.</p>

<p>To minimise the risk of injury from use of period products, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask learners and/or their parents or carers if they have experienced an allergic reaction to period products or their materials</li>
  <li>provide all learners with the relevant safety and usage information for each product they are using</li>
  <li>provide expiry dates with each individual product</li>
  <li>keep a record of the batch numbers of products supplied</li>
  <li>follow safety guidelines when stocking products</li>
  <li>make sure all products remain individually wrapped</li>
  <li>dispose of any expired products - products past their expiry date must not be provided to learners</li>
</ul>

<p>Incorrect usage of period products can, in some cases, result in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Toxic-shock-syndrome/" rel="external"><abbr title="toxic shock syndrome">TSS</abbr></a>. <abbr title="toxic shock syndrome">TSS</abbr> can be a result of using a product for longer than the manufacturer recommends. Symptoms of <abbr title="toxic shock syndrome">TSS</abbr> develop and worsen quickly, so it is important for staff and learners to be aware of the most common symptoms. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a sudden high fever</li>
  <li>flu-like symptoms (such as dizziness, sore throat, exhaustion)</li>
  <li>vomiting</li>
  <li>diarrhoea</li>
  <li>dizziness</li>
</ul>

<p>You should seek medical advice as soon as possible if a learner is experiencing a combination of these symptoms.</p>

<h3>Equality requirements</h3>

<p>You are required to comply with the relevant requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance">Equality Act 2010</a>, including the public sector equality duty (section 149 of the Equality Act).</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the Equality Act, schools and colleges must not unlawfully discriminate against pupils or, in further education settings, students because of their age, sex, race, disability, religion or belief, gender reassignment, pregnancy or maternity, marriage or civil partnership, or sexual orientation (collectively known as the protected characteristics)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. This includes learners who identify as transgender or non-binary who have periods (or who may later have periods). You must also make reasonable adjustments to alleviate disadvantage and be mindful of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25"><abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> code of practice</a> when implementing this scheme.</p>

<p>You should consider the gender, culture, religion and age range of your learners. This will help you decide if it is appropriate or necessary to provide additional support for learners whose protected characteristics present particular considerations for these decisions.</p>

<p>Religious and cultural beliefs concerning periods and the use of period products can restrict access to certain types of period products. Girls and women from certain backgrounds may be less aware of internal products such as tampons and menstrual cups and how these should be used.</p>

<p>Understanding girls’ and women’s religious and cultural beliefs and building relationships between the school and local faith communities will help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure you’re providing individuals with products which meet their needs</li>
  <li>individuals, parents and carers feel comfortable with the way(s) in which products are provided</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/period-products-scheme-impact-assessment">period products scheme: impact assessment</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Making products available to learners</h2>

<p>Once products have been delivered, you need to decide how to make these products available. There are a variety of methods you could choose, some of which are set out in this section.</p>

<p>When deciding how to make products available, you should make sure the needs of all learners are met. This includes learners who do not identify as female (but instead identify as transgender or non-binary) but still have periods. You must follow the Equality Act 2010, under which sexual orientation and gender reassignment are among the protected characteristics.</p>

<p>You should also consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether all learners can access the products easily and when they need them</li>
  <li>if learners have all the safety information they need for each product available in a format they can access and understand</li>
  <li>the individual needs of learners, including those with <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>, those with medical conditions affecting menstruation and those with English as an additional language</li>
  <li>if the way in which learners access products minimises the risk of embarrassment</li>
  <li>if you have clean and dry storage space for the products you’re ordering</li>
</ul>

<p>Our research found that participants prefer products to be available to them without them having to ask (particularly male) members of staff, to avoid feelings of embarrassment. However, participants also indicated that the stigma and embarrassment around periods should not still exist and were keen to break this cycle.</p>

<h3>Distribution examples</h3>

<p>This section provides some example methods of distributing period products. This is not an exhaustive list. You should use a different, or combination of methods if appropriate.</p>

<h4>Making products available in toilets or communal areas</h4>

<p>Our research found that having appropriate products available for girls and women to take in toilets can reduce stigma and feelings of embarrassment. Products would also be available at the time and place they were most needed.</p>

<p>Having products in communal areas such as libraries or student services means that all learners, including those who would not use female toilets, can access the products.</p>

<p>If you decide to place products within toilets or other communal areas, you will need to consider how you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide safety information and advice prior to use</li>
  <li>monitor the products to ensure more are not being taken  than needed</li>
  <li>check the products to make sure they have not been tampered with</li>
</ul>

<h4>Making products available on request from a member of staff</h4>

<p>Our engagement with stakeholders and teachers found that it was easier to provide girls and women with safety information and advice when supplying products on request from members of staff. They also reported that it was easier for organisations to keep track of the number and type of products being distributed.</p>

<p>Our learner research found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>asking a member of staff for products was embarrassing and, in some cases, learners would rather go without products than ask</li>
  <li>some learners would feel more comfortable asking a student representative rather than a member of staff</li>
  <li>having posters or stickers on the back of toilet doors directing learners to where they can access products would be useful - find ideas and suggestions on <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-to-reduce-stigma">how to reduce stigma</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you decide to make products available on request from a member of staff, you will need to consider how you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>minimise any embarrassment for learners, particularly those with non-standard needs, for example, non-binary learners and those who experience very heavy periods</li>
  <li>make the scheme accessible to all learners, for example, those with English as an additional language or those with <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Making products available via restricted access</h4>

<p>Another option is making products available via restricted access. This could be through token vending machines or lockers placed in or near bathrooms.</p>

<p>If making products available in this way, you must ensure access to safety information and advice prior to use of the products.</p>

<p>Research with learners found that they felt this distribution method was a safe option. It meant that products could not be tampered with and were more likely to be taken based on need. Participants also felt a key benefit of this approach was that they did not need to ask a member of staff for help. However, participants thought it may be embarrassing to obtain products in front of other people.</p>

<p>If you decide to make products available via restricted access, you will need to consider how you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a token system for vending machines or lockers without causing embarrassment</li>
  <li>provide safety information and advice prior to use</li>
  <li>provide access to learners who would not use female toilets</li>
</ul>

<h3>Case studies</h3>

<h4>Example from a large sixth-form college</h4>
<p>The college has a population of over 5,000 learners. We have provided period products for many years from our own funds and from a scheme which provides colleges with free period products. We currently bulk buy online. We then distribute to learners using our student services base in one of the central buildings. We chose to house the box in a building that has a high percentage of female learners.</p>

<p>We have always provided a mix of products to give the learners a choice to suit their needs for both their comfort and confidence. We feel that it is important that a scheme should be based on individual needs, especially given the range of courses students follow, including those participating in water sports, for example.</p>

<p>We never advertised that we hold these products. Learners have simply come to student services to ask if we have anything that they can use. They then help themselves from the supply held in a discreet cupboard. This system has worked well for both staff and learners as it is discreet yet readily available to anyone in need. We have never needed to distribute or watch learners as they have been respectful of others and only taken what they needed at that time.</p>

<p>Since joining the scheme, we have only used advertising to identify a second location rather than raise awareness of the scheme.</p>

<h4>Example from a primary school in Scotland</h4>
<p>Kirn primary school, in Scotland, has 285 pupils. At the end of the academic year, the school consulted with a group of girls in year 5 and 6 about the initial set-up of free period product provision. They discussed what products should be made available and where would be appropriate for easy access for all. The discussion generated talk about sanitary bin provision in school, which the girls felt was inadequate. As a result of this collaboration, a sanitary bin and box with supplies (pads, nappy bags, deodorant, wet wipes and a guidance leaflet) were placed in the disabled toilet between the year 5 and 6 classrooms. The young people felt that when in school, the disabled toilet was the most sensible place for them to access period products.</p>

<p>The school informed parents that education on the menstrual cycle and sanitary products would take place. All year 5 and 6 girls took part in a discussion which focused on the menstrual cycle but also allowed the girls to familiarise themselves with period products, how to use them and apply them to underwear.</p>

<p>While usage of the products is not high, the school keeps it topped up termly. Staff felt that having a supply available removed the embarrassment factor of having to ask.</p>

<h4>Example from a secondary school in Scotland</h4>
<p>Tynecastle High School is a diverse inner-city high school in Scotland, with 609 pupils speaking 42 different languages between them. Pupils at the school have shared their experiences of the period products scheme.</p>

<p>There are individual products, a mixture of tampons and towels, available in toilets in every faculty as well as the disabled toilets, which are gender neutral. We have some pupils in the school who are transitioning so we spoke with them and our LGBT group to plan where would be the best place to put these.</p>

<p>Toilets, where free sanitary protection is available, have a poster on the door and there is a list of teachers, from whom products can be collected, on the poster too. We think that it’s important that pupils can collect them in bulk if they want so they can get them from the named teachers or there is a classroom on the first floor where they can help themselves to boxes of tampons or sanitary towels. There are stocks available in <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> too. It’s good to be able to get them in more than one way.</p>

<p>We check supplies a few times a week and know they are really being used as we are doing lots of topping up. Both teachers and pupils see the differences this has made. The biggest one is that the young people are no longer having to go to the, often busy, welfare office to ask for products. It has removed the embarrassment. People can access sanitary protection where and when they need to, but also know where they can go for help if they want it.</p>

<h2>Promoting the scheme</h2>

<p>Communicating about the scheme will help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce the stigma around periods</li>
  <li>encourage girls and women to access period products when needed</li>
  <li>make sure girls and women know where and how to access products and which products are available</li>
</ul>

<p>When deciding how you will communicate about the scheme, you should think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>girls’ and women’s ages</li>
  <li>girls’ and women’s experiences of having periods</li>
  <li>relationships with parents and carers</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several ways you can let learners know about the scheme. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>posters</li>
  <li>assemblies</li>
  <li>letters to parents and guardians</li>
</ul>

<p>You may wish to use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.phs.co.uk/periodequalitydfe/" rel="external">template poster</a> provided by <abbr title="Personnel Hygiene Services Ltd">phs</abbr>. There is also a range of other posters and materials available.  Our research showed learners preferred posters which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>had short, bold headlines</li>
  <li>used friendly, supportive and approachable language</li>
  <li>had positive can-do imagery</li>
  <li>avoided the use of stereotypes around girls</li>
  <li>used imagery which reflected the diversity of the school or college</li>
</ul>

<p>Our research has shown that some words associated with periods may discourage learners from using the products and cause embarrassment. When talking about periods or promoting the scheme, you should avoid using words most negatively associated with periods like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sanitary (such as sanitary product) - learners may associate this word with uncleanliness</li>
  <li>hygiene - this could imply that periods are in some way unclean</li>
  <li>poverty - using language associated with poverty may discourage learners from using these products</li>
  <li>affordability - using this word or ‘struggling’ may imply that the products are only available for learners who cannot purchase the products themselves</li>
  <li>shame - this may discourage openness and reinforce the idea of stigma and embarrassment</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to reduce stigma</h3>

<p>The UK still experiences many challenges regarding stigma and taboo relating to periods, which works to create a sense of shame around what is a natural bodily process. You should consider what you can do to create healthy and respectful communication about periods amongst all staff and learners.</p>

<p>Our research with learners found that there was a significant amount of stigma relating to periods and asking for products. To help tackle this, you should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>including learners who do not have periods into your discussions - this could include inviting them to talks about periods, or placing posters in areas accessed by all learners</li>
  <li>extending conversations and tools to parents and carers</li>
  <li>making sure all staff (including male staff) have enough knowledge about periods and about the products available</li>
  <li>using open and positive language about periods</li>
</ul>

<p>Educating all learners about periods is crucial to tackling the stigma which surrounds it. You may currently cover periods and the use of different period products in health education. From September 2020, teaching both boys and girls about periods and menstrual wellbeing  is compulsory in all state-funded schools, primary and secondary, as part of health education.</p>

<p>You can find a range of free resources online to help you discuss periods with your learners. You should assess each resource before using it to make sure it is appropriate for the age and maturity of learners and sensitive to their needs.</p>

<p>From spring 2020, all teachers will have access to a central programme of support for health education. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an implementation guide</li>
  <li>access to high-quality resources</li>
  <li>case studies</li>
  <li>training materials</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annex A: research</h2>

<p>We used our research with teachers, learners and other stakeholders to develop this scheme. The results of our research have been included as part of our advice to schools and colleges on distributing products and promoting the scheme.</p>

<p>Management information data on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/period-products-scheme-management-information">period product scheme</a> is available.</p>

<h3>Learner research</h3>

<p>To inform this guidance, we carried out independent research with learners aged 9 to 19.</p>

<p>We commissioned Hopscotch Consulting Ltd to help us understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>learners’ perceptions of the period products scheme</li>
  <li>different methods for making period products available</li>
  <li>how institutions could communicate the scheme with their learners</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopscotch used an online forum for this research and recruited 62 learners from a range of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ages</li>
  <li>locations</li>
  <li>institution types</li>
  <li>free school meals and <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> statuses</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/period-product-scheme-the-learner-perspective">period product scheme: the learner perspective</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Stakeholder survey and discussion group</h3>

<p>We held a discussion group and carried out a survey with charities and interest groups who shared their views and experiences regarding period product provision.</p>

<p>We asked stakeholders to share their perspectives on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what information institutions need when ordering period products</li>
  <li>the types of period products suitable for learners with different characteristics</li>
  <li>how organisations can make period products available</li>
  <li>how organisations can tackle period-related stigma</li>
</ul>

<h3>Teacher engagement</h3>

<p>We held discussions with staff in education organisations including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>primary headteachers</li>
  <li>secondary headteachers</li>
  <li>teachers</li>
  <li>leaders from further education organisations</li>
</ul>
