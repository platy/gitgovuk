<p>National Competence Centre Process for Resolution of Disagreements Between BDUK and Network Providers in relation to BDUK Subsidy Control Determinations through the Public Review Process</p>

<p>The role of the National Competence Centre (NCC) is described in the Gigabit Infrastructure Scheme Detailed Overview document, available on the DCMS website[^1]. This is given below for ease of reference.</p>

<p>5.1. Project Gigabit is to be operated and monitored by Building Digital UK (BDUK), which acts in this context as the national competence centre (NCC). The NCC’s responsibilities include: (i) the central coordination of Subsidy Control aspects of the Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy scheme; (ii) acting as a conduit for, and assurance of the use of, central Programme funds; (iii) acting as an assurance function for compliance with subsidy control requirements, whether projects are delivered by BDUK or any other bodies; and (iv) providing support, guidance, information sharing and toolkits for BDUK and any implementing bodies, such as the devolved administrations.</p>

<p>5.2. For the Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy scheme, the intention is for BDUK to direct resources for qualifying projects, so it will ensure that the NCC operates in a functionally separate capacity within BDUK in making its assessments (BDUK will operate the NCC as a separate team from those responsible for running the procurements).</p>

<p>The Detailed Overview document goes on to describe the Public Review (PR) process (Section 8.2), as well as the NCC’s role in resolving any disagreements:</p>

<p>8.2.6. In the event of any disagreement with a network provider, the implementing body, which will usually be BDUK, will inform the NCC who will seek to resolve the matter as part of its role as scheme administrator.</p>

<p>This document describes the process which the NCC will take to discharge this responsibility, and must be made available to all network providers (NPs) who participate in a PR. It is recognised that the NCC will generally have had involvement in the Assurance process for the particular PR in question, and so we will ensure that the personnel involved in this process are not those who undertook the Assurance.</p>

<p>This is an informal review process and does not affect any rights a network provider (NP) may have to seek other redress. It deals only with disagreements over the Subsidy Control determination of premises as Gigabit white or under review as a result of BDUK’s (or other implementing bodies) PR evaluation activities and not on other related activities such as the formation of the Intervention Area.  All NCC considerations will be made in the context of the published OMR/PR Subsidy Control Classification Guidance[^2]. If an NP enters into this process, they can withdraw at any point. It should be noted that the overall PR outcome, along with any concomitant activities such as formation of Intervention Areas, will be conditional until this process has been concluded, meaning that Invitations to Tender should not be issued until then.</p>
