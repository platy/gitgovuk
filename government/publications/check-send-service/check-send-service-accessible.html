  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how we (and Sopra Steria Ltd) deal with Check &amp; Send applications</p>

<h3>Publication</h3>

<p>Below is information on when this version of the guidance was published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>version 3.0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>published for Home Office staff on 27 October 2021</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes from last version of this guidance</h3>

<p>This document has been updated with minor reformatting changes.</p>

<h2>Passport Check &amp; Send services</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office about the different Check &amp; Send services the Post Offices provides and what checks they do on applications.</p>

<p>Some United Kingdom Post Offices can check a customer’s passport application and forward it to an HM Passport Office. This is called a Check &amp; Send service.</p>

<p>The Post Office charges an extra fee for this but it is not a guaranteed service. Post Office (POL) staff and the customer’s POL receipt will tell customers the service is not guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Different types of Check &amp; Send services</h3>

<p>There are 3 different types of POL Check &amp; Send services:</p>

<p>1. A paper application form Check &amp; Send service.</p>

<p>2. A POL digital application (booth) service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for adult renewals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>filled in by a POL clerk in a private booth</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. A POL (tablet) application service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for all UK application types</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>filled in by POL staff on a tablet</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Check &amp; Send service: Post Office clerk checks</h3>

<p>To see what checks a POL clerk must do, you must refer to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Paper application: how a customer applies guidance for paper Check &amp; Send applications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Post Office Limited digital: how a customer applies guidance for applications made using the digital booth service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Digital Check and Send tablet: how a customer applies guidance for applications made using the digital tablet service</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How we deal with Post Office Check &amp; Send applications</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport staff how we and Sopra Steria Ltd deal with Post Office Check &amp; Send applications.</p>

<p>Sopra Steria Limited (SSL) will get all passport applications and post first. They will deal with Post Office (POL) Check &amp; Send applications before they deal with applications sent directly from customers. After SSL have finished their checks, they will send POL applications to us.</p>

<h3>How we deal with Check &amp; Send applications</h3>

<p>The turnaround target for Check &amp; Send service is the same as our standard turnaround targets for applications of that type.</p>

<p>If a customer used the paper Check &amp; Send service, we will deal with the application on AMS (Application Management System). If a customer used the digital Check &amp; Send service, we will deal with the application on DAP (Digital Application Processing).</p>

<p>You, the examiner, must check the application for POL errors, regardless of whether it is on AMS or DAP.</p>

<h4>Check &amp; Send replacement applications</h4>

<p>If you need to ask for a new paper application form for a POL Check &amp; Send application (for example, a new countersignatory) you must:</p>

<p>1. Use the AMS barcode on the new SE04 form to replace the original POL barcode (we no longer use POL barcodes on replacement Check &amp; Send applications).</p>

<p>2. Fill in the AMS generated examiner return form.</p>

<p>3. Specify it is a POL replacement by writing, ‘POL’ on the examiner return form in the application number box.</p>

<p>4. Re-box the application for return to SSL.</p>

<p>5. Gratis (make it free) the application fee when SSL returns the replacement application form.</p>

<h2>How to identify a Check &amp; Send application</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff how to check if an application is a Post Office Check &amp; Send application.</p>

<p>We need to know if the customer sent their application using the Check &amp; Send service, as we may need to give them a refund if the Post Office made an error.</p>

<h3>How to identify a paper Check &amp; Send application</h3>

<p>If a customer applied using a paper Check &amp; Send service, the application will be a paper form and have a Post Office (POL) barcode at the top of the form.</p>

<h3>How to identify a digital Check &amp; Send (booth) application</h3>

<p>If a customer applied using the digital Check &amp; Send (booth) service, the application will be an adult renewal and have a ‘POD’ prefix (for example, ‘POD 1234567890’). This is for DAP (Digital Application Processing) applications but includes those transferred to AMS (Application Management System).</p>

<h3>How to identify a digital Check &amp; Send (tablet) application</h3>

<p>The system will tell the examiner if the customer applied using the digital Check &amp; Send (tablet) service.</p>

<p>DAP will show Post Office Application. If the application transfers to AMS, DAP will also add a case note. For more about information displayed in DAP and AMS, see: Digital Check &amp; Send tablet: how a customer applies.</p>

<h2>Check &amp; Send service: how to identify Post Office errors</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff why we need to identify Post Office (POL) errors, how to identify POL errors and what to do if there is a POL error.</p>

<p>Customers who use the Check &amp; Send service pay an extra fee. If you, the examiner, find a Post Office error, you must deal with it immediately so the customer can claim a refund of their Post Office fee.</p>

<p>You must examine Check &amp; Send applications to check if, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>customer’s photos are acceptable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>customer has provided the correct documents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>countersignatory’s details are correct</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fees are correct</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>customer has filled in the application form correctly (if it’s a paper application)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>service type is what the customer needs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Post Office photo errors</h3>

<p>If a customer applied using the Check &amp; Send service and their photo is not acceptable, you must:</p>

<p>1. Check the table to see if the reason is included.</p>

<p>2. Follow <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark28">dealing with POL errors</a> guidance (if the Post Office made an error).</p>

<p>3. Follow <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark29">If it is not a POL error</a> guidance (if the Post Office did not make an error).</p>

<h3>Post Office missing document errors</h3>

<p>If a customer has applied using the Check &amp; Send service, the POL clerk will check they have sent the listed documents for their chosen application type. You must:</p>

<p>1. Check the table for the listed documents.</p>

<p>2. Follow <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark28">dealing with POL errors</a> guidance (if POL has made an error).</p>

<p>3. Follow <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark29">If it is not a POL error</a> guidance (if POL have not made an error).</p>

<p>POL clerks do not receive nationality or parental responsibility training. They will not know if the documents can determine parental responsibility or a customer’s nationality. POL errors only apply if listed documents for the chosen application type are missing.</p>

<h2>DAP: Post Office Check &amp; Send refunds</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff working on Digital Application Processing how to deal with applications if the customer is entitled to a refund.</p>

<p>When you, the Digital Application Processing (DAP) examiner, deal with a Post Office Check &amp; Send application on DAP you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>view the task and decide if you need to contact the customer for a new photo or document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide if the customer is entitled to a refund of the Check &amp; Send fee</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>DAP: how to refund the Check &amp; Send fee (photo standards)</h3>

<p>If a customer is entitled to a refund of the Check &amp; Send fee because their photo does not meet our standards and the Post Office should have identified the error, you must select yes when asked, ‘Should this Check &amp; Send customer get a refund from the Post Office?’ on the Photo standards tab.</p>

<p>DAP will automatically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>tell the customer they are entitled to a refund of the Check &amp; Send fee in the email, telling them to upload a new photo</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send the customer a letter they can take to the Post Office to get their refund</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>show the refund question to the examiner on the first photo rejection only. This means the refund letter is only issued once to the customer</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>DAP: how to refund the Check &amp; Send fee (documents)</h3>

<p>If a customer is entitled to a refund of the Check &amp; Send fee because their document is not suitable (for example, it’s a photocopy or damaged), you must:</p>

<p>1. Send an email to the customer asking for a new document.</p>

<p>2. Select yes when asked, ‘Should this Check &amp; Send customer get a refund from the Post Office?’ on the Send an email tab.</p>

<p>3. Select all the reasons the document is unacceptable.</p>

<p>DAP will automatically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>tell the customer they are entitled to a refund of the Check &amp; Send fee in the email telling them to send the document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send the customer a letter they can take to the Post Office to get their refund</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide the application data to the Supplier Management team who work with the Post Office to resolve disputes about refunds</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How the Post Office deals with a refund</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office examiners about the Post Office Check &amp; Send refund process.</p>

<p>If the Post Office has made an error, customers can claim a refund of their Post Office Check &amp; Send fee. To get a refund, the customer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>return to the Post Office branch they used, with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>their refund letter</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>their Post Office receipt</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quote their reference number at the Post Office</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a customer does not have their Post office receipt, the Post office clerk will search for a record of the Check &amp; Send transaction. If they find the record, they will refund the Check &amp; Send fee. If they cannot find a record, the clerk can decide if they can refund the fee.</p>

<h3>How the Post Office refunds the Check &amp; Send fee</h3>

<p>If the Post Office agrees to refund the customer’s fee, they will do it in the same way it was paid. For example, if the customer paid by debit card, the Post Office will refund it back to the same card.</p>

<h2>How the Post Office deals with Check &amp; Send questions</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff how Post Office staff deals with questions for Check &amp; Send applications.</p>

<p>Using the dedicated Post Office Ltd (POL) helpline number, POL staff will call the Customer Service Management Team (CSMT), if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>POL guidance does not cover the problem</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the customer has a laminated document and they want to know if we will accept it</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>POL staff must not call CSMT to check the progress of an application. If a Post Office contacts CSMT inappropriately, CSMT must log and report it to the Post Office issues inbox.</p>

<h3>How the Post Office deals with laminated documents</h3>

<p>POL will not accept laminated birth, naturalisation or registration certificates. If a customer wants to send us a laminated document as a supporting document, the POL clerk must call CSMT using the dedicated POL Helpline number.</p>

<p>CSMT will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>check if we can accept the laminated document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell the POL clerk we will accept the laminated document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell the POL clerk we cannot accept the laminated document</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If CSMT says we cannot accept the document, the POL clerk will not accept the laminated certificate.</p>

<h3>How to deal with Post Office questions</h3>

<p>If you, the examiner, get a call directly from a Post Office staff member, you may speak to them (if they pass the Data Protection checks). You must tell them to contact the Customer Service Liaison Team using the dedicated POL helpline number for future questions.</p>
