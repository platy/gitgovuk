<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise its power on inspection. This is a regulatory power and is set out in Chapter 6 and sections 201 to 203 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>. The power may be exercised in relation to all registered providers.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>2 - The regulator may commission an inspection to establish whether a registered provider is compliant with our standards and regulatory requirements. In considering whether or not to commission an inspection, the regulator will take account of the different thresholds for intervention that apply to the economic and to the consumer standards, including whether or not the serious detriment test is met in relation to consumer standards. The regulator will decide the scope of, and produce the brief for, each inspection. The brief will set out the matters to be investigated and the methodology to be followed. The inspection will focus on those areas where concerns have been identified and will provide a clear, evidence-based assessment of compliance with our standards and regulatory requirements.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>3 - Section 201 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> specifies that the regulator may arrange for a person to inspect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a registered provider’s performance of its functions in relation to the provision of social housing, or</li>
  <li>the financial or other affairs of a registered provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>4 - The regulator is most likely to exercise the power of inspection where a registered provider might be non-compliant with one or more of the standards applicable to it, and the regulator needs to establish whether there is an actual failure and, if there is, the level of severity associated with the failure in order to consider whether further action might be necessary. Examples of the circumstances in which the regulator might commission an inspection include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of a breach of one or more economic standards including indicators of financial problems or poor financial management</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of a breach of one or more consumer standards where there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been or there is risk of serious detriment to tenants</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where we have grounds to suspect that an agreed programme of self-improvement to resolve previously identified concerns has failed to achieve compliance with the standards or is not being progressed in a timely way</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of impropriety (including fraud) and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whistle blowing involving allegations of a serious nature.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>5 - The power of inspection may be exercised in relation to a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> where the inspection relates to economic standards under section 194 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> and to all registered providers where the inspection relates to consumer standards under section 193 of the Act. An inspection of the social housing activities of a local authority provider will include liaison with managing agents where management services are provided by an arm’s length management organisation, a tenant management organisation, or other manager under contract.</p>

<h2>The power</h2>

<h3>Who can conduct an inspection?</h3>

<p>6 - The regulator may appoint any person to conduct an inspection. The regulator will ensure that the inspector is qualified for the intended purpose of the inspection. An inspector is most likely to be:
• an appropriate professional expert, or
• a member of the regulator’s staff if the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> consents on either a general or specific basis.</p>

<h3>The inspection brief</h3>

<p>7 - It is for the regulator to decide whether an inspection is needed and its scope, taking into account the particular circumstances of the registered provider. The regulator will ensure that the inspection is focussed on any potential failure of a standard. The regulator will produce the brief for the inspection. While the nature of the brief will vary depending on the circumstances of the case, it will be bespoke to the specific presenting concerns at the registered provider and will focus on investigating whether or not the registered provider is compliant with the relevant standards. The brief will usually include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the matters to be investigated</li>
  <li>the methodology to be followed</li>
  <li>the proposed dates for the start and completion of the inspection, which is most likely to be carried out at short notice</li>
  <li>the reporting arrangements</li>
  <li>fees and cost control arrangements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notification and initial contact with the provider</h2>

<p>8 - The regulator’s general approach to regulatory engagement with registered provider means that in most cases any concerns will have been discussed with the registered provider before the regulator considers whether to commission an inspection. Cases where it might not be appropriate to do so include those where the regulator has to act speedily in order to protect tenants or the taxpayer. Once the regulator has decided to commission an inspection and has given the brief to the commissioned inspector, it will notify the provider of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the reason it has commissioned the inspection</li>
  <li>the standard(s) to which the inspection relates</li>
  <li>the brief for the inspection.</li>
</ul>

<p>9 - The regulator will agree the arrangements for the inspection with the inspector and the registered provider based on the particular circumstances of the case. The regulator will expect the inspector to then make contact with the provider in order to agree the detailed practical arrangements associated with the inspection, including confirmation of dates and any requirements for information or access that might be necessary.</p>

<p>10 - The regulator expects the registered provider to give all the background information required for the inspection to the inspector on a timely basis. The regulator will give support to the inspector in circumstances where it is necessary to use regulatory powers to obtain specified information and documents in the Act. The regulator will provide any supporting information it holds to the inspector. The inspector will ensure that the inspection is delivered in a timely, efficient and cost-effective way that minimises the administrative impact on the registered provider while ensuring that it fully investigates the matters that led to the inspection being commissioned. The regulator will monitor the inspector’s progress in order to achieve these outcomes.</p>

<h2>An inspector’s powers</h2>

<p>11 - The inspector will be authorised in writing by the regulator to exercise the powers of an inspector which are set out in Section 203 of the Act. In summary these are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>require a person to provide specified documents or information. The regulator would expect a registered provider, or its agents, to produce information and documents when requested to do so by the inspector as listed in section 107(1) (see separate guidance note on section 107 of the Act). Where the registered provider does not do so, the inspector may by notice require the information and documents to be produced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enter premises occupied by the registered provider at any reasonable time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inspect, copy or take away documents found on the premises. This includes all relevant documents held by the registered provider, including documents stored on computers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inspect any computer on which documents have been created or stored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require any person, including any person having charge of a computer, to provide such facilities or assistance as the inspector reasonably requests.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The inspection report</h2>

<p>12 - The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> requires the inspector to produce a written report. The report will in particular set out the inspector’s opinion on whether or not the registered provider is compliant with regulatory standards and requirements. The inspector will be required to provide evidence to support their opinion. Where an inspector identifies serious concerns, the regulator would normally expect them to make recommendations for remedial action.</p>

<p>13 - The regulator will ensure that a copy of the report is given to the registered provider together with its own assessment of the outcome of the inspection. The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> makes provision for both the regulator and the inspector to have discretion to publish the report, and the regulator will take into account all relevant factors in coming to a decision on publication, including all legal requirements and commercial confidentiality. Where the regulator decides that it would be appropriate to publish an inspection report, it will determine the basis on which it is published having taken account of the views of the inspector and the registered provider.</p>

<h2>Follow-up action</h2>

<p>14 - The regulator will consider the inspection report, decide whether or not there has been a breach of a standard or our regulatory requirements and, if there has, whether or not it is sufficiently serious to warrant follow-up action by the provider. Different thresholds may apply in such circumstances depending on whether or not the serious detriment test is met in relation to consumer standards. Where an inspection demonstrates a failure against a standard or mismanagement in the affairs of a registered provider, the regulator may consider further action against the registered provider, including the possible exercise of one or more of its enforcement powers.</p>

<p>In considering the outcome of the inspection, the regulator may assess any wider implications for the management and governance of the registered provider, where applicable. The regulator will ensure that inspection findings are reflected in any published regulatory judgement or notice where they are material and its overall assessment of the registered provider is changed as a result of them. The regulator will expect any remedial action that is necessary to be implemented swiftly by the registered provider.</p>

<h2>The costs of an inspection</h2>

<p>15 - The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> makes provision for the regulator to pay for an inspection. It also makes provision for the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> by Order to authorise the regulator to charge fees for inspections. The <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> has not made such an Order, so the regulator cannot charge fees for inspections. The <abbr title="Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government">MHCLG</abbr> and regulator may consult about charging fees at a future date.</p>

<h2>Sanctions for failing to co-operate with an inspector</h2>

<p>16 - The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> makes provision for the regulator or the Director of Public Prosecutions (or someone else with their consent) to bring proceedings in circumstances where a person without reasonable excuse obstructs an inspector exercising the powers set out in section 203 (4-8) of the Act.</p>

<h2>What the regulator expects from the registered provider</h2>

<p>17 - The regulator expects a registered provider that is subject to inspection to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>co-operate fully with the regulator and the inspector</li>
  <li>give access to premises, staff and tenants to the inspector when requested</li>
  <li>provide information and documents to the inspector on a timely basis</li>
  <li>provide facilities and assistance to the inspector when requested</li>
  <li>not to publicly comment on the findings of an inspection until the report is in the public domain</li>
</ul>
