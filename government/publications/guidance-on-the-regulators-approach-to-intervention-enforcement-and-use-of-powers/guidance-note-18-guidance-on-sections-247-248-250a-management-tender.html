<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power to require a provider to tender its management functions. This is an enforcement power and is set out in Part 2 Chapter 7 sections 247, 248 and 250A of the 2008 Act.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - The power may be exercised in relation to all providers including a non-profit registered provider, a for-profit registered provider and a local authority provider.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>3 - A provider is responsible for ensuring that it achieves the standards set by the regulator. This requires the control and management of risk across all parts of the provider’s operations and good service delivery to its tenants. Management services might be delivered by the provider directly, or by an agent or a contractor working under an agreement or a contract, including services delivered for a local authority by an <abbr title="Arm's Length Management Organisation">ALMO</abbr> or a <abbr title="Tenant Management Organisation">TMO</abbr>. The provider is responsible for managing itself, its employees, its agents and its contractors effectively.</p>

<p>4 - The regulator expects a provider to be proactive in responding to any organisational or service delivery problem before it reaches a critical stage. The provider has primary responsibility to review the performance of its employees, agents and contractors and, where underperformance or some other problem is identified, to take the action it considers necessary to improve performance or resolve the problem. This could include action against an agent or contractor under the terms of the relevant agreement or contract, or, if the provider considers it appropriate to do so, the termination of that agreement or contract. In circumstances where a provider does decide to instigate changes to its management arrangements, the regulator will expect it to take effective action to maintain continuity of services and ensure that new arrangements are put in place in a timely manner.</p>

<p>5 - In circumstances where there has been a failure against a standard applicable to it, or where the affairs of a provider have been mismanaged in relation to its social housing, the regulator may consider exercising those enforcement powers that relate to the management of a provider. Those powers are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>require a management tender (which is covered in this guidance note) where the regulator will specify the process for selection, but the provider will select the new manager; or</li>
  <li>require a management transfer (which is covered in a separate guidance note) where, in certain circumstances following a statutory inquiry, the regulator, with the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>, will select the new manager.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The power of management tender</h2>

<p>6 - The power of management tender is set out in sections 247, 248 and 250A of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008. The regulator may require a provider to put out to tender some or all of its management functions in relation to some or all of its social housing. The regulator may exercise the power of management tender if it is satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a registered provider has failed to meet a standard applicable to it</li>
  <li>the affairs of a registered provider have been mismanaged in relation to social housing – “mismanagement” in relation to the affairs of a registered provider is defined in section 275 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 as managed in breach of any legal requirements (imposed by or under an Act or otherwise)</li>
  <li>the registered provider has failed to comply with relevant provisions of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 or with regulations made by the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> under the <abbr title="Western Riverside Waste Authority">WRWA</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>7 - In such circumstances, the regulator may issue a requirement to a provider. A requirement is a Direction which sets out certain actions that the provider must take in order to tender out the specified management functions. In particular, the requirement will specify a process that the provider must implement to invite applications to undertake the relevant management functions and to select and appoint a new manager.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the power of management tender</h2>

<p>8 - The three specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise its discretion to use the power to tender management functions are set out in paragraph 6 of this guidance. The regulator is most likely to exercise the power where there has been a failure against a standard or the affairs of the provider have been mismanaged and one or more of the circumstances below apply. This is not an exhaustive list and the regulator may conclude that it is necessary to consider exercising the power in other circumstances to those set out below</p>

<ul>
  <li>there has been persistent poor performance in some or all of a provider’s social housing management functions</li>
  <li>there has been persistent poor performance in the delivery of services where there has been serious detriment to tenants</li>
  <li>the provider is unable or unwilling to bring about necessary improvements through its own voluntary action</li>
  <li>the provider has failed to honour a relevant voluntary undertaking to the satisfaction of the regulator.</li>
</ul>

<p>9 - When exercising the power of management tender, the regulator’s main objectives will be to improve the management of social housing and to secure compliance with the standards. The regulator’s approach will depend on the circumstances of the case, and on its assessment of the provider’s willingness to contribute positively to a timely resolution of the presenting problems and capacity to achieve any necessary improvements or changes in the relevant management functions. The regulator is only likely to exercise the power of management tender when there are no appropriate and reasonable alternatives, or when it considers that the provider is unable to take action to resolve management failures through voluntary means.</p>

<h2>Additional provisions for local authority providers</h2>

<p>10 - Section 250A of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 sets out some additional statutory provisions which apply where the regulator exercises the power of management tender in relation to a local authority provider. These are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the regulator can exercise the power of management tender even if the local authority already has a management agreement covering the same management functions in place</li>
  <li>the local authority may not give effect to a new or separate management agreement relating to those management functions of the authority that are the subject of the regulator’s requirement in the period that the requirement is in force</li>
  <li>any duty the local authority may have to consult on changes to the exercise of any relevant management functions does not apply in circumstances where the authority is acting in respect of a requirement imposed by the regulator</li>
  <li>a requirement imposed by the regulator is not a management agreement within the definition set out in section 27 of the Housing Act 1985, but the local authority remains responsible for anything done or not done by or to the new manager as if the requirement was a management agreement, except where the terms of any relevant management agreement provide otherwise or in relation to criminal proceedings against the new manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>11 - In addition, the provisions of The Housing Management Agreements (Break Clause) (England) Regulations 2010 (the Regulations) imposed an obligation on all local authority providers to include a break clause in any management agreement entered into after 1 April 2010. This is intended to ensure that local authority providers have a suitable break clause that allows the management agreement to be terminated and the management functions tendered in circumstances where a requirement to tender management functions is imposed by the regulator.</p>

<p>12 - The position may not be clear in relation to any management agreements that were in place before 1 April 2010. Although many will include a clause providing for termination where there is serious underperformance, it is possible that some will not. It would not be tenable to defer a requirement to tender management functions until an existing management agreement had expired or had reached a previously agreed review point. In such circumstances, it would be for the provider to take any steps it considers necessary to comply with the requirement put in place by the regulator.</p>

<h2>Additional expectations for private registered providers</h2>

<p>13 - The additional statutory provisions outlined in paragraphs 10 to 12 do not apply to either a non-profit or a for-profit PRPs. In general, the regulator expects such providers to ensure that any agreements or contracts with third parties for management services are specified to ensure compliance with relevant regulator standards. In addition, providers are expected to make provision for regular and periodic monitoring against agreed standards of performance and include provision for penalties or termination where agreed standards of performance are not achieved. In circumstances where the regulator imposes a requirement to tender management functions, the regulator expects the provider to review its options in relation to its existing arrangements for the delivery of the relevant management functions, to take any steps it considers necessary to comply with the requirement and to ensure that the new manager can perform its duties regardless of any agreement or contract previously in place.</p>

<h2>Best practice in procurement</h2>

<p>14 - The <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 requires the regulator to ensure that best procurement practice consistent with any applicable procurement law is embedded into the tender process. The regulator will set out its initial proposals for achieving these outcomes at an early stage in the process, and will invite the provider to make its own proposals on how its existing procurement policies and procedures might contribute to such outcomes. It is in the best interests of both the provider and the regulator to identify the most efficient and effective tender process, and the regulator would expect the provider to co-operate with it in order to do so. The process to select the new manager will be carried out by the provider, so the provider will carry any risk associated with compliance with any relevant statutory procurement requirements.</p>

<h2>The potential for increased costs</h2>

<p>15 - It is possible that the management tender process may result in efficiencies or savings that might benefit the provider and its tenants. However, such efficiencies or savings are not specific objectives of the process and the provider should not assume that they will result from it. Neither should the provider assume that the tender process and new management arrangements will be cost neutral. The regulator will expect the provider to draw up financial projections and budgets based on the requirement and to make reasonable assumptions about any possible additional or increased costs. The nature and extent of these will depend on the particular circumstances of the case and on the provider’s existing arrangements for the delivery of services in those management functions that are the subject of the requirement.</p>

<p>Factors that may result in additional or increased costs could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the costs associated with the administration of the tender process</li>
  <li>the costs of any expert or legal advice the provider considers it necessary to commission in relation to the tender process</li>
  <li>the costs associated with resolving any outstanding matters in relation to the previous standards of performance in the relevant management function</li>
  <li>the costs associated with addressing previous under-investment or underperformance in the management function by the provider</li>
  <li>an improved or extended specification for the future delivery of the management function to balance any previous under-investment or poor performance</li>
  <li>a new liability for Value Added Tax (<abbr title="Value-added Tax">VAT</abbr>) in circumstances where a non-profit or a for-profit <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> that previously used its own staff to deliver the management function (where there would be no liability for <abbr title="Value-added Tax">VAT</abbr>) subsequently purchases that management function from a third party (where there would be a liability for <abbr title="Value-added Tax">VAT</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>16 - Any additional or increased costs must ultimately be borne by the provider. In considering whether or not to impose a requirement for a management tender, the regulator will take account of any representations made by the provider in respect of the potential adverse impact on its management costs and its overall business. The regulator may work with the provider in order to explore how best to manage and mitigate these, but it will remain the provider’s responsibility to decide on and take any action it considers necessary in order to do so.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<h3>Notice</h3>

<p>17 - If the regulator is minded to exercise this power, it must give the provider notice and seek representations in accordance with the provisions set out in section 248 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008. The notice must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set out the grounds on which the regulator might take action</li>
  <li>warn the provider that the regulator is considering action</li>
  <li>explain the effect of section 248 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008</li>
  <li>specify a period of at least 28 days beginning on the day the provider receives the notice in which the provider may make representations to the regulator</li>
  <li>refer the provider to the provisions of section 125 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008, by which the provider may give a voluntary undertaking to the regulator. The regulator must indicate whether, and to what extent, it would accept a voluntary undertaking instead of, or in mitigation of, any action to require the provider to tender management functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>18 - The <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 specifies that the regulator must send a copy of the notice to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> in a case where the requirement would be imposed on a provider owning land in Greater London</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>, in a case where the requirement would be imposed on a local authority provider</li>
  <li>any other persons or organisations the regulator thinks appropriate depending on the circumstances of the case.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The possible use of other enforcement powers</h2>

<p>19 - The <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 specifies that the regulator may combine this notice with one or more notices relating to the possible use of certain other enforcement powers. In particular, the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 makes reference to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a pre-penalty warning (section 230 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008)</li>
  <li>a pre-compensation warning (section 242 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008)</li>
  <li>a management transfer (section 250 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008)</li>
  <li>an appointment of a manager (section 252 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008).</li>
</ul>

<p>20 - In circumstances where the regulator decides to issue more than one notice it will do so in accordance with the terms of each relevant section of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 and of each relevant guidance note on the use of the specific power. It follows that the regulator will only do so where the circumstances of the case make it appropriate and where the specific power is applicable to the particular type of provider. In addition, the regulator may also consider whether it would be appropriate to exercise any of its other enforcement powers either singly or in combination.</p>

<h2>Seeking views on a requirement</h2>

<p>21 - The <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 specifies that in imposing a requirement to tender management functions, the regulator must have regard to views of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relevant tenants – the regulator recognises that in any situation where some or all of the provider’s management functions might be subject to tender, tenants may have concerns about the potential impact on the services they receive. The regulator will ensure, as far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, that tenants are informed about the proposed changes and the potential implications for both them and the provider. The nature of the information given to tenants will depend on the circumstances of the case and the timescales involved. It may not be practicable in all situations to make direct contact with each individual tenant, and, in seeking tenants’ views, the regulator may work through the provider or any recognised tenant representative groups or an appointed tenant adviser.</li>
  <li>the registered provider – the regulator recognises that in any situation where some or all of the provider’s management functions might be subject to tender, those involved in the delivery of the functions, including employees, agents and contractors may have concerns about how the proposals might impact on the provider, on their organisations or on them as individuals. The regulator will seek the views of the provider. The regulator will expect the provider to keep its employees, agents and contractors fully informed about how the requirement to tender management functions might impact on them throughout the process. Since the regulator is not required to have regard to the views of the provider’s employees, agents or contractors, it will not seek their views and, if any such views are offered, it will not take them into account in reaching its decision.</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> where the requirement relates to a provider owning land in Greater London.</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>, in a case where the requirement is to be imposed on a local authority provider.</li>
  <li>any relevant local authority in circumstances where the regulator thinks it appropriate to do so. The regulator will seek the views of the local authority in its strategic housing role in the area in which the registered provider that is subject to the requirement operates. However, the regulator will not usually seek the views of a local authority in its strategic role if it is considering the use of this power against the same local authority in its landlord role. In such circumstances, the regulator will usually only seek the views of the local authority in its role as the registered provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>22 - The regulator will seek views on the proposed requirement from relevant people and organisations at the most appropriate point in the process. This could be at the same time as the regulator sends notice to the provider or at a later date. The regulator’s over-riding objective will be to provide all the information relevant to the particular circumstances of the case, so that respondents are as fully informed as possible when giving their views.</p>

<h2>Considering views, representations and voluntary undertakings</h2>

<p>23 - Before making its decision on whether or not to impose a requirement, the regulator will consider all the views submitted to it by those individuals and organisations listed in paragraph 21. While the regulator must have regard to these views, it will not necessarily be bound by them. In particular, it may not be possible to reconcile all the various views in circumstances where some of them suggest a fundamentally different approach to others. The regulator’s approach will depend on the nature of the various views submitted to it, on the specific circumstances of each case and on whether the regulator is satisfied that any necessary improvements or changes to relevant management functions will be achieved in a timely manner.</p>

<p>24 - The regulator will also consider any representations and any proposals for voluntary undertakings submitted by the provider in response to the notice in accordance with its general approach to such undertakings set out in the first section of this document. The acceptability, or otherwise, of any such undertaking will depend on the circumstances of the case. The regulator will consider the provider’s capacity to honour the undertaking and whether the terms of the undertaking are sufficient to bring about the necessary improvements to relevant management functions in a timely manner.</p>

<p>25 - Where the regulator is satisfied with the proposed terms of the voluntary undertaking, it may decide not to impose the requirement with immediate effect, but to allow the provider a period of time to implement its proposals. In such circumstances, the regulator will monitor and review the provider’s progress on a regular basis and at key milestones in order to assess whether or not the provider has honoured the undertaking. The regulator will give reasons for any decisions it makes in relation to such monitoring or review. In circumstances where the regulator subsequently concludes that a provider has failed to honour the undertaking or has failed to deliver any obligations at key milestones, it may decide to impose the requirement to tender management functions without delay.</p>

<p>26 - Alternatively, where the regulator is not satisfied with the proposed terms of the voluntary undertaking, it may decide to impose the requirement without delay. The regulator is likely to take such action where it considers that the terms of the undertaking are unsatisfactory or insufficient to resolve the problems or where urgent or immediate action is necessary.</p>

<h2>The requirement</h2>

<p>27 - In circumstances where the regulator decides to impose a requirement, the regulator will specify a process that the provider must implement to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>invite applications to undertake the relevant management functions</li>
  <li>select from the applications</li>
  <li>appoint a new manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>28 - The requirement will set out the extent of the services that the provider must put out to tender. The terms of an individual requirement will vary from case to case and will be dependent on a combination of factors, including in particular the nature and the extent of both the management functions and the housing stock to which the requirement applies. A requirement may include some or all of the provider’s management functions and some or all of its social housing stock. It could be limited to specific services or to specific parts of the social housing stock, for example, to tackle management problems on a single estate.</p>

<p>29 - The requirement must also include provision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>about the persons that will make up the panel with responsibility for selecting the new manager, including specific provision for ensuring that tenants’ interests will be represented on the panel</li>
  <li>for ensuring that the procurement process follows best practice and is consistent with any applicable procurement law</li>
  <li>about the terms and conditions on which the new manager is to be appointed including specific provision for setting, monitoring and enforcing standards of performance and for the resources that are to be made available or applied to the management function that is the subject of the requirement.</li>
</ul>

<p>30 - The regulator will notify the provider about a requirement by a letter addressed to the Chief Executive or other suitable person. The regulator will set out proposals for how it intends to liaise with the provider, monitor progress against the requirement and ensure that the specified process is followed. The regulator will expect the provider to effectively manage the transition from its existing manager to the new manager and to implement the change in a timely manner.</p>

<p>31 - The regulator will publicise the action that it takes in accordance with its policy on public statements.</p>

<h2>Notification of a requirement</h2>

<p>32 - The regulator will inform those individuals and organisations that provided views on the proposed requirement about the regulator’s final decisions on the matter. The <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 specifies that in circumstances where the regulator imposes a requirement to tender management functions, it must send a copy of it to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homes England;</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> in a case where the requirement is to be imposed on a provider owning land in Greater London; and</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>, in a case where the requirement is to be imposed on a local authority provider.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Appeal</h2>

<p>33 - The provider may appeal to the High Court against a requirement to tender management functions.</p>

<h2>Complying with a requirement</h2>

<p>34 - The regulator will expect the provider to keep it informed about progress and to demonstrate compliance with the terms of the requirement at certain specified points in the process. These milestones will have been set out in the requirement, and are most likely to occur when the short-list of applicant managers is agreed, when the new manager is selected and when the new manager is appointed. The regulator will review the information submitted by the provider to demonstrate compliance and will wish to satisfy itself that the provider is taking the appropriate action in all the circumstances of the case. Where the provider does not do so, the regulator will review its options and may consider exercising any of its regulatory, enforcement or general powers or taking other action against the provider.</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<h3>What the provider can expect from the regulator</h3>

<p>35 - The regulator will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agree appropriate liaison and reporting arrangements including nominating a member of regulator staff as the main point of contact for all aspects of the enforcement and management tender processes</li>
  <li>give notice of possible enforcement action, seek the views of the provider and consider any representations or any voluntary undertaking offered by the provider</li>
  <li>in circumstances where a requirement is imposed, review progress at agreed points in the process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What the regulator expects from the provider</h2>

<p>36 - The regulator expects the provider to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>co-operate with the regulator at all stages of the management tender process</li>
  <li>take any steps it considers necessary to comply with the terms of any requirement that is imposed by the regulator</li>
  <li>take any steps it considers necessary to ensure that the new manager can perform its duties</li>
  <li>ensure an effective transition between managers and maintain continuity of service during the process</li>
  <li>draw up financial projections and budgets based on the requirement and to make reasonable provision for any possible additional or increased costs</li>
  <li>commission and pay for any expert advice or legal advice it considers necessary in relation to either the tender or associated processes, including any specific matters of concern to the provider or its staff: such matters will depend on the specific circumstances of the case but may include, among other things, any obligations it may have in relation to pensions, taxation, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006” as amended by the “Collective Redundancies and Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (Amendment) Regulations 2014, the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or the European Union Public Procurement Directive 2014/24/EU</li>
  <li>comply with best procurement practice and any applicable procurement law</li>
  <li>keep its employees, agents and contractors informed about how the requirement might impact on them and ensure that they co-operate with the regulator in relation to the requirement</li>
  <li>provide information and documents in relation to the requirement when requested, keep the regulator informed about progress generally and demonstrate compliance with the terms of the requirement at certain specified points in the process or when requested by the regulator</li>
  <li>co-ordinate its communications strategy on all matters relating to a requirement to tender management functions and to give the regulator the opportunity to comment on the content and timing of any news releases or other public statements.</li>
