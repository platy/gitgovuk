<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Censure of a local authority employee or agent during or following an inquiry</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Purpose</h3>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power to censure a local authority employee or agent during or following an inquiry. This is an enforcement power and is set out in chapter seven and section 269A of the 2008 Act.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - The power may be exercised only in relation to an employee or agent of a local authority provider. It may not be exercised in relation to an elected member of a local authority. This power does not apply to PRPs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>3 - The authority is responsible for ensuring that it achieves the standards set by the regulator. This requires the control and management of risk across all parts of the authority’s social housing operations and good service delivery to its tenants, both where management services are provided by the authority directly, or where such services are provided by an <abbr title="Arm's-Length Management Organisation">ALMO</abbr>, a <abbr title="Tenant Management Organisation">TMO</abbr> or another manager under contract. The authority is responsible for managing itself, its employees and its agents effectively.</p>

<p>4 - Where the regulator suspects that an authority’s affairs in relation to its social housing may have been mismanaged, the regulator may hold an inquiry in accordance with sections 206 to 209 of the Act. As part of an inquiry, the regulator may require the authority’s accounts and balance sheet relating to its social housing to be audited in accordance with section 210 of the Act. Further advice about the regulator’s approach to the exercise of the powers on inquiry and extraordinary audit is set out in the relevant guidance note. In circumstances where an inquiry is in progress, the regulator will expect the authority to ensure that its employees and its agents co-operate fully with the inquiry and respond positively and in a timely manner to all reasonable requests from the inquirers. The power to censure a local authority employee or agent is one of the enforcement powers available to the regulator in certain circumstances when an inquiry is in progress.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>5 - Section 269A of the 2008 Act sets out the circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power to censure a local authority employee or agent. The regulator may give a censure notice to an authority where an inquiry under section 206 of the 2008 Act is in progress in respect of the authority and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The regulator has reasonable grounds for believing that the affairs of the authority have been mismanaged and that the interests of the tenants of the authority, or its assets, require protection, or</li>
  <li>The regulator is satisfied as a result of an inquirer’s interim report that the affairs of the authority have been mismanaged.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>The power</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Consideration of an inquiry report</h3>

<p>6 - The regulator will consider an interim or a final report of an inquiry into the affairs of a local authority provider in accordance with the principles set out in the guidance on the use of the power to hold an inquiry. In doing so, the regulator will consider all the relevant material and decide whether it demonstrates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the affairs of the authority have been mismanaged</li>
  <li>that there are grounds for believing that the interests of the tenants of the authority require protection</li>
  <li>that there are grounds for believing that the authority’s assets require protection.</li>
</ul>

<p>7 - In circumstances where the regulator concludes that one or more of the criteria in paragraph 6 apply, it will also consider whether any employee or agent of the authority has contributed to the mismanagement or the risk to tenants or assets. If the regulator is satisfied that an employee or agent of the authority has so contributed, it will also consider whether a censure notice is appropriate, balancing all the relevant factors associated with the case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Censure notice</h2>

<p>8 - A censure notice is a mechanism by which the regulator might notify an authority where the regulator has concluded that an individual employee or a group of employees or, where relevant, an individual employee or group of employees of an <abbr title="Arm's-Length Management Organisation">ALMO</abbr> or <abbr title="Tenant Management Organisation">TMO</abbr> or an agent of the authority has contributed to the failure or mismanagement. The notice would set out the regulator’s reasons for reaching the conclusion. The notice would be addressed to the Chief Executive of the authority or other suitable person and also to the employee or agent concerned. While no more than one employee or agent can be named in a censure notice, the regulator may give several notices in respect of the same failure or mismanagement.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Response to the censure notice</h2>

<p>9 - The Order makes provision for section 269B of the 2008 Act which requires the authority to which the censure notice is given to respond to the regulator in writing within 28 days of receiving the notice. The response must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain what action (if any) the authority has taken or proposes to take in relation to the employee or agent, or</li>
  <li>explain why the authority does not think that the employee or agent has contributed to the failure or mismanagement or the risk to its tenants or assets, or</li>
  <li>explain why the authority does not think that its affairs have been mismanaged.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Possible further action by the regulator</h2>

<p>10 - The regulator will consider whether the authority’s response to the censure notice is satisfactory taking into account all the circumstances of the case. Where the regulator concludes that the response is not satisfactory, it may consider taking further action including, but not limited to, the possible use of other regulatory, enforcement or general powers. In circumstances where the regulator does decide to take further action, it would inform the relevant local authority and <abbr title="Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government">MHCLG</abbr> its sponsoring government department, of its intention to do so. The regulator may also inform other relevant organisations where it is appropriate to do so.</p>

<p>11 - The regulator is most likely to take further action where it has concluded that the interests of tenants of the authority, or its assets, require protection but the authority has neither taken the action necessary to achieve that protection, nor provided a satisfactory explanation for not doing so.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Further action by the authority</h2>

<p>12 - It is the local authority’s responsibility to take action against its employees or agents following a censure notice, where it considers it to be appropriate to do so. The regulator has no locus in any such action, but it would expect the authority to keep it informed about progress and the final outcome of the action. The regulator will wish to satisfy itself that the action had been concluded appropriately in all the circumstances of the case. Should the authority fail to complete the actions it had proposed to take, the regulator may consider its options and may require the authority to take some further action.</p>
