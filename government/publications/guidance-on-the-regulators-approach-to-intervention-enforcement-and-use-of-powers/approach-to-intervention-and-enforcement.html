<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1 - The regulator expects registered providers to identify problems and take effective action to resolve them. If a registered provider takes responsibility for self-improvement and we conclude that it has the capacity and capability to respond to the problems, we will work with it to achieve the necessary corrective actions. However, in circumstances where self-improvement has not succeeded, or where a registered provider is unable or unwilling to respond positively, or where the regulator concludes that such an approach is not appropriate (for instance, where urgent action is necessary or there is an immediate and significant risk of serious detriment to a registered provider’s tenants in relation to consumer matters), we may need to consider the use of our regulatory, enforcement and general powers.</p>

<p>2 - This document sets out our general approach to intervention and enforcement. It presents the high level objectives and principles underpinning our approach to dealing with poor performance. The guidance notes 1-21 attached set out further detail and information about how the regulator uses, and intends to use, its statutory regulatory and enforcement powers and also certain of its general powers. These guidance notes should be read in conjunction with this section.</p>

<p>3 - The regulator uses the term private registered provider to refer to not-for-profit and for-profit organisations. The term registered provider encompasses both <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> and local authority registered providers. We do not regulate <abbr title="local authority registered provider">LARP</abbr> against the economic standards as they are not applicable to them [<abbr title="The Rent Standard will apply to LARPs from April 2020">^1</abbr>]. All registered providers are subject to the consumer standards and are regulated in line with our published approach.</p>

<p>4 - Previous versions of this guidance referred to the Homes and Communities Agency or Homes England. We have used Homes England, which is the current trading name of Homes England, throughout the guidance notes.</p>

<p>5 - In these guidance notes the Greater London Authority will be referred to as the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>.</p>

<p>6 - In the event of any conflict between the guidance notes and the legislation, the legislation will prevail.</p>

<h2>Approach to use of powers</h2>

<p>7 - The Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 sets out the regulator’s economic and consumer regulation objectives. The thresholds set for the use of regulatory and enforcement powers under the economic standards mean that we can exercise those powers where we suspect or have evidence of a failure by a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> against an economic standard, or where the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> has mismanaged its affairs. Additionally, we may exercise a regulatory power where there is a risk that if no action is taken by a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> or the regulator, the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> will fail to meet an economic standard.</p>

<p>8 - The threshold for intervention by the regulator is significantly higher in relation to consumer standards because of the serious detriment test. Failure to meet one or more of the consumer standards by a registered provider does not in itself lead directly to a judgement of serious detriment. However, we may consider whether evidence of failures on consumer standards calls into question a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s capacity to meet the governance requirements of the economic standards.</p>

<p>9 - The regulator’s approach to the use of powers is underpinned by five key components: the economic regulation objectives, the consumer regulation objectives, the statutory duty to minimise interference, the standards and any specific requirements set out in the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>.</p>

<p>10 - We may consider the use of our regulatory powers to investigate where we suspect there may have been a failure to meet the economic standards or that the affairs of a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> have been mismanaged. Where there is a potential failure in relation to consumer standards by a registered provider, we may seek information in order to inform any investigation. In such circumstances, it may be necessary to use regulatory powers to investigate where there:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are reasonable grounds to suspect a failure to meet a consumer standard has resulted in serious detriment to the provider’s tenants or potential tenants</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is a significant risk that, if no action is taken by the regulator, a failure to meet a consumer standard will result in serious detriment to the provider’s tenants or potential tenants; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is a risk that if no action is taken by the provider or by the regulator, the provider will fail to meet a consumer standard and cause a serious detriment to tenants or potential tenants.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>11 - When such investigations have been completed, we consider whether further action is necessary and, if it is, what action is most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the case. This may include the use of enforcement powers.</p>

<p>12 - The regulator is not required to use its regulatory powers before exercising its enforcement powers. However, our general approach is to apply the most appropriate and least intrusive power available, taking into account proportionality, the statutory duty to minimise interference and the seriousness of the issue under consideration.</p>

<p>13 - We will keep the use of our powers under regular review and may decide to exercise them if the circumstances of the case make it necessary to do so. We may use our powers either singly or in combination, depending on the circumstances of the case.</p>

<h2>Principles underpinning the approach: what registered providers can expect</h2>

<p>14 - Registered providers can expect the regulator to apply the following principles in relation to intervention and enforcement. We will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>consider any proposals for self-improvement made by the registered provider before using its powers, but in cases where this is either not appropriate, for example, where it is necessary to protect tenants from immediate harm or to protect public funds, or has not been successful, the regulator will consider how best to address the issue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adopt a graduated approach to the use of enforcement powers where possible, but given the high threshold for intervention in relation to consumer standards, the materiality of the problem may mean the regulator cannot do so. In these circumstances, the regulator will aim to use the least intrusive powers that are appropriate, but the provider is likely to be subject to one or more enforcement powers with little or no advance warning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have regard to the economic regulation and consumer regulation objectives when considering any individual case and will seek to balance the interests of the registered provider, its tenants, its key stakeholders and the impact on public funds when responding to the circumstances of each individual case</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be proportionate and consistent in making judgements, accountable for its actions, and transparent in relationships with the registered provider, its tenants and other stakeholders, but there may be occasions where the circumstances of the case will limit how transparent the regulator can be with third parties</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>explain the grounds and give reasons for taking action, and will usually give notice of any action – in some cases this is a requirement of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> – unless to do so would undermine the regulator’s ability to act</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assess the most appropriate course of action taking account of the particular circumstances of the registered provider, the level of risk and the potential impact associated with the registered provider, tailor the regulatory engagement accordingly and always take action which is commensurate with the materiality of the breach or failure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give careful consideration to any remedial strategies proposed by the registered provider, including any relevant voluntary undertakings, and seek to agree the way forward with the registered provider when it is prepared to resolve the presenting issues and the regulator concludes that it has the capacity, the capability and all the resources necessary to do so</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take account of any significant changes in circumstances and adapt the approach accordingly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>15 - The regulator may need to react and respond as a matter of urgency to unanticipated and exceptional events. In circumstances where it is expedient to do so, we may adjust the intensity of our engagement with a registered provider, or exercise one or more of our powers with little or no notice, particularly in circumstances where giving notice would defeat the purpose of taking the proposed action or where it is necessary to protect tenants from immediate harm or to protect public funds.</p>

<h2>How the regulator will engage with registered providers</h2>

<p>16 - We will seek to be transparent in our relationship with a registered provider when considering the use of our powers. The use of some powers requires us to follow detailed procedures which are specified in the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>.</p>

<p>While we will always follow these procedures, our approach must have regard to the circumstances of the case, particularly where we conclude that urgent or immediate action is necessary and have to use our powers with little or no notice. As far as practicable the regulator will apply the following principles when considering the use of powers.</p>

<p>We will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have dialogue with the registered provider before, during and following the process in accordance with the regulator’s usual approach to regulatory engagement in order to protect tenants, social housing assets and public funding. This includes informing a registered provider when the regulator is minded to use a power, explaining the issues and concerns and giving the provider an opportunity to respond</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give notice to a registered provider when proposing to use a power. The regulator will explain the power and the issues or concerns that have led to the possibility of using it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>invite the registered provider to make representations in response to the notice within a reasonable timescale, and to give the regulator any information or comments, including any relevant voluntary undertaking, it thinks might help make the decision about whether or not to use the power</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>carefully consider any representations, information and comments, including any relevant voluntary undertakings received from the registered provider in coming to a decision about the action the regulator intends to take</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>notify the registered provider of the decision and give reasons for making it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inform registered providers about the protocol that the regulator has developed that allows a provider to appeal against decisions on the use of some of our powers. Additionally, the guidance notes set out details of those powers where statutory appeals processes are specified in the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Factors that may lead to the use of powers</h2>

<p>17 - In broad terms, any decision will be based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the seriousness of the failure or problem identified, including harm or potential harm to tenants</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the urgency with which the problem or failure needs to be addressed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the level of risk associated with the registered provider and the potential impact of its failure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the degree of assurance given by the registered provider to the regulator in relation to the action it is taking or will take to resolve the issue. The regulator may take into account the registered providers history in dealing with relevant issues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the resources available to the registered provider to resolve the problems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>proportionate use of resources that need to be applied to the regulator’s regulatory engagement with the provider.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>18 - In order to bring about improvements, the regulator may propose an action plan setting out the key corrective actions it requires the registered provider to take and the milestones and timetable in which they should be achieved. In such circumstances, we will work with the registered provider to agree how best to implement the plan and will carefully consider any remedial plan submitted by the registered provider including any voluntary undertaking it offers.</p>

<p>When we are satisfied that the key corrective actions have been completed, we will notify the registered provider. Given the high threshold for intervention in relation to the consumer standards, the materiality of the problem may provide grounds for the regulator not to follow a self-improvement approach.</p>

<p>19 - The regulator’s aims will always be underpinned by its economic regulation and consumer regulation objectives and the standards. The regulator’s specific objectives may vary from case to case or change during the course of a case, but broadly speaking we would want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>address and resolve the presenting problems and any related or contributory problems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintain the financial viability of <abbr title="private registered providers">PRPs</abbr> and require the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> to meet acceptable standards of organisational effectiveness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>act as a catalyst for change within the registered provider and ensure that any improvements in performance are sustained in the long term</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>protect public expenditure and guard against the misuse of public funds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reassure lenders and encourage investment in social housing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>protect the interests of tenants</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>protect the reputation of providers of social housing as a whole</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>address and seek to resolve any additional relevant and material matters that come to light while a registered provider is subject to regulatory, enforcement or general powers, particularly in relation to governance issues, where applicable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where necessary, co-ordinate the approach with other regulatory bodies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Checks and balances on the use of our powers</h2>

<p>20 - There are a number of checks and balances which must be applied to the use of powers.</p>

<h2>Duty to minimise interference</h2>

<p>21 - The regulator has a duty under the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> to exercise its functions in a way that minimises interference and (so far as is possible) is proportionate, consistent, transparent and accountable. These requirements overlay how the regulator carries out all its functions.</p>

<h2>Regulators’ Code</h2>

<p>22 - The regulator must also comply with the Regulators’ Code [<abbr title="The Regulators’ Code came into statutory effect on 6 April 2014 under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, replacing the Regulators’ Compliance Code.">^2</abbr>]. The code does not apply to the exercise by a regulator of any specific regulatory function in individual cases. The regulator must have regard to the Code when developing policies and procedures that guide our regulatory activities.</p>

<h2>Consideration before exercising a power</h2>

<p>23 - The regulator must consider some specific matters before exercising an enforcement power:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the desirability of a registered provider being free to choose how to provide services and conduct business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the speed with which the failure or other problem needs to be addressed and, before exercising an enforcement power in relation to economic standards:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the failure or other problem is serious or trivial</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the failure or other problem is a recurrent or isolated incident.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Voluntary undertakings</h2>

<p>24 - A registered provider can give the regulator a voluntary undertaking in respect of any matter concerning social housing [<abbr title="Section 125 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">^3</abbr>]. The circumstances in which such a voluntary undertaking can be given are widely drawn, for example, a provider may offer a voluntary undertaking while subject to regulatory, enforcement or general powers. In exercising some powers, the regulator must have regard to any voluntary undertaking offered or given by a provider.</p>

<p>25 - The regulator may take into account whether a sufficient voluntary undertaking has been offered and 
honoured. In considering a voluntary undertaking, the regulator will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>assess whether or not the terms of a voluntary undertaking are satisfactory, giving reasons for the decision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>monitor the provider’s progress towards meeting its voluntary undertaking and assess whether the provider has honoured the voluntary undertaking, giving reasons for the decision.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>26 - Although giving a voluntary undertaking will always be a matter for the registered provider, the regulator will respond in the event a provider asks whether a voluntary undertaking would address matters that have necessitated enhanced scrutiny by the regulator.</p>

<p>27 - While the regulator must have regard to any voluntary undertaking offered or given by a registered provider, there may be circumstances where the existence of a voluntary undertaking may not prevent further enforcement activity. This might include circumstances in which the regulator considers that the voluntary undertaking is unsatisfactory or insufficient to resolve the problems or where urgent or immediate action is necessary.</p>
