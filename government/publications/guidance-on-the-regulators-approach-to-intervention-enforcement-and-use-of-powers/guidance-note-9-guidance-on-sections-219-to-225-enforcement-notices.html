<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator proposes to exercise the power on enforcement notices. This is an enforcement power and is set out in Chapter 7, sections 219 to 225 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - The power may be exercised in relation to all providers including a non-profit registered provider , a for-profit registered provider and a local authority provider.
Background and context to the use of the power</p>

<p>3 - A provider is responsible for ensuring that it manages itself effectively, achieves the standards set by the regulator, and engages positively with the regulator’s regulatory framework. Where a failure against a standard or other problem has been identified, the regulator expects providers to respond in a prompt and effective manner. It may be necessary for the regulator to step in and exercise this power when a provider fails to do so.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>4 - Section 220 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 includes 11 specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power of enforcement notices. They are:</p>

<p>4.1. - where the registered provider has failed to meet an economic standard or failed to meet a consumer standard and there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been or there is a risk of serious detriment to tenants</p>

<p>4.2. -  where the affairs of the registered provider have been mismanaged</p>

<p>4.3.  - where the registered provider has failed to comply with an earlier enforcement notice</p>

<p>4.4. - where the registered provider has failed to publish information in accordance with a requirement under section 228(3) or 240(3) of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008</p>

<p>4.5. - where the interests of tenants of the registered provider require protection</p>

<p>4.6. - where the assets of the registered provider require protection</p>

<p>4.7. - where the registered provider has given an undertaking under section 125 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 and failed to comply with it</p>

<p>4.8. - where the registered provider has failed to pay an annual fee under section 117(2) of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008</p>

<p>4.9. where an offence under Part 2 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 has been committed by a registered provider</p>

<p>4.10. where the registered provider has failed to comply with an Order made by an ombudsman appointed by virtue of section 124 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008</p>

<p>4.11. where the registered provider has failed to comply with relevant provisions of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 or with regulations made by the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> under the <abbr title="Welfare Reform and Work Act">WRWA</abbr>.</p>

<p>5 - Except in cases where urgent action is required, the regulator will attempt to secure the voluntary agreement of the provider to take the necessary action before issuing an enforcement notice. In reaching a decision to issue a notice, the regulator will have regard to the willingness, capacity and resources available to the provider to undertake the necessary action.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>6 - Where the regulator considers that the circumstances may require use of the power, it will advise the provider accordingly and seek information on the provider’s intended response. The regulator will take account of this intended response in considering whether an enforcement notice is needed. If the regulator considers that an enforcement notice is required it will be issued in writing to the provider.</p>

<p>7 - When issuing an enforcement notice the regulator will:
* specify the grounds on which an enforcement notice is given
* specify the action the regulator requires the registered provider to take
* specify when the action is to be taken
* specify what information the registered provider must provide to the regulator to demonstrate that the required action has been completed
* explain that a registered provider who is given an enforcement notice may appeal to the High Court
* explain that the regulator may withdraw the enforcement notice by giving notice to the registered provider
* explain that if a registered provider does not comply with the enforcement notice the regulator may consider exercising other regulatory or enforcement powers.</p>

<p>8 - The regulator expects the provider to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take prompt and effective action in accordance with the Direction in the enforcement notice</li>
  <li>provide evidence to demonstrate its achievement of the actions specified in the notice</li>
  <li>co-operate fully with the regulator</li>
  <li>co-ordinate its communications strategy on all matters relating to enforcement with the regulator, and to give the regulator the opportunity to comment on the content and timing of any news releases or other public statements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notification</h2>

<p>9 - When the regulator issues an enforcement notice it will send a copy of it to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homes England</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> where it relates to a registered provider owning land in Greater London</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> where it relates to a local authority provider.</li>
</ul>
