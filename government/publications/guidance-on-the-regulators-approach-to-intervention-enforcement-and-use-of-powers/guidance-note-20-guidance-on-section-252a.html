<h2>Appointment of an adviser to a local authority provider</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power to appoint an adviser to a local authority provider. This is an enforcement power and is set out in chapter seven and section 252A of the 2008 Act.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - The power may be exercised only in relation to a local authority provider. It does not apply to a <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>3 - The authority is responsible for ensuring that it achieves the standards set by the regulator. This requires the control and management of risk across all parts of the authority’s social housing operations and good service delivery to its tenants, both where management services are provided by the authority directly, or where such services are provided by an <abbr title="Arm's-Length Management Organisation">ALMO</abbr>, a <abbr title="Tenant Management Organisation">TMO</abbr> or another manager under contract.</p>

<p>4 - In circumstances where there has been a failure against a standard, or where the authority’s affairs in relation to social housing have been mismanaged, the regulator will assess the most appropriate course of action. We will consider the authority’s willingness to contribute positively to a timely resolution of the presenting problems and its capacity to achieve the necessary improvements. Where the regulator has been engaging with the LA to achieve those improvements, but the underperformance has continued, it may have to exercise the power to appoint an adviser or require the authority to appoint an adviser.</p>

<p>5 - In exercising this power, the regulator’s intention is to work with the authority to help improve its services. An adviser or advisers will give the authority specialist support and a range of relevant additional skills and expertise to assist in addressing the regulator’s concerns. This is a supportive action designed to act as a catalyst for the changes necessary to address those concerns.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>6 - The 2008 Act specifies the circumstances in which the regulator may exercise its discretion to use this power. They are set out in paragraph seven of this guidance. The regulator is most likely to exercise the power where it considers that one or more of the following circumstances apply:
* the authority’s affairs in relation to its social housing have been mismanaged
* there has been a failure against one or more consumer standards where there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been or there is a risk of a serious detriment to tenants
* the authority has failed to deal with previous regulatory interventions to the satisfaction of the regulator
* the authority has failed to honour a relevant voluntary undertaking to the satisfaction of the regulator
* the case raises matters of wider regulatory significance or concern.</p>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list and the regulator may conclude that it is necessary to exercise the power in other circumstances to those set out above.</p>

<h2>The power</h2>

<h3>The circumstances in which the power can be exercised</h3>

<p>7 - Section 252A of the 2008 Act specifies that the regulator may exercise the power to appoint an adviser when it concludes that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is necessary for the proper management of the authority’s affairs in relation to its social housing, or</li>
  <li>it is desirable in the interests of securing better services for the authority’s tenants.</li>
</ul>

<p>8 - In such circumstances the regulator may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appoint one or more advisers to assist the authority in relation to its social housing affairs, or a particular aspect of those affairs. (An appointment)</li>
  <li>require the authority to appoint one or more advisers to assist in relation to its social housing affairs, and specify a process which the authority is required to implement for selecting advisers. (A requirement).</li>
</ul>

<p>9 - The regulator will consider whether to direct an appointment or a requirement based on the particular circumstances of each case. In principle, the regulator would prefer to work with the authority through the requirement route and, if it is appropriate to do so, to draw on mechanisms for self-improvement that are available to the local authority sector. The regulator may require the authority to put an adviser in place at an early stage in its regulatory engagement in order to reinforce the authority’s own proposals for self-improvement. In circumstances where the regulator directs a requirement, the regulator may propose certain individuals as advisers, but will also consider individuals proposed by the authority as potential advisers. The regulator will specify the process that the authority will be required to follow for selecting the adviser. The regulator may participate in the selection process. The final decision will be made by both the regulator and the authority together.</p>

<p>10 - However, in circumstances where the regulator concludes that the authority is either unable or unwilling to work in partnership to identify and select a suitable adviser, or where an authority has not fulfilled its obligations under a requirement in a timely manner, the regulator may identify and appoint advisers itself. In such circumstances the final decision will be made by the regulator.</p>

<p>11 - The Order specifies that the authority must co-operate with any advisers. The regulator will monitor this through the adviser, and if the authority fails to co-operate, the regulator may consider taking further action including, but not limited to, the possible use of other regulatory, enforcement or general powers.</p>

<h2>The period and terms of an appointment or a requirement</h2>

<p>12 - The appointment or requirement will specify the adviser’s terms and conditions, including any provision for remuneration. The appointment or requirement will usually be for an initial period of six months, although this may vary depending on the circumstances of the case. It will be reviewed on a regular basis and the regulator may extend the period or may withdraw the adviser at any time depending on the progress made at agreed milestones. An adviser can resign at any time. Where an adviser does so, the regulator will decide whether it is necessary to replace the adviser who has resigned, and whether any new adviser should be put in place through an appointment or a requirement.</p>

<p>13 - The regulator will agree the most appropriate mechanisms by which the adviser will interact with the authority’s management structure in consultation with the authority and the adviser. This will depend on factors such as the particular management arrangements within the authority and those aspects of the authority’s social housing affairs that are the subject of the appointment or requirement. The regulator expects an adviser to work within the authority’s relevant codes of conduct, standing orders, policies, procedures and budgets, and to give advice and exercise their judgement in the best interests of both the authority and its tenants. The adviser will focus on the matters specified in the appointment or requirement and assist the authority to achieve the proper management of its social housing affairs or to secure better services for tenants.</p>

<h2>Who can be an adviser?</h2>

<p>14 - The 2008 Act places no restrictions on who can be an adviser. Individuals could be drawn from any source. The regulator will always try to match the most suitable people to the authority and to the particular circumstances of the case. Advisers will have relevant knowledge, skills and expertise. They will have the interpersonal and relationship management skills to operate effectively.</p>

<p>15 - The regulator will establish good working relations with organisations that encourage self-improvement in the local authority sector. Such organisations can draw on local authority elected members, senior officers and expert advisers to assist in resolving problems. The regulator may consider using such individuals as an adviser to an authority. However the regulator may also consider others with relevant skills and experience from other sectors. The regulator’s over-riding objective will be to identify the most appropriate people for the case.</p>

<h2>Notification and initial contact</h2>

<p>16 - The regulator will notify the authority about a requirement or an appointment by a letter addressed to the Chief Executive or other suitable person. In respect of a requirement, the regulator will serve an Order which specifies the process that it requires the authority to implement for selecting the adviser and will then work with the authority to ensure that the specified process is followed. In respect of an appointment, the regulator will serve an Order on the authority for each adviser and the orders will be copied to the adviser. The regulator will issue a news release to announce a requirement or an appointment. The authority will be given an opportunity to comment on the factual accuracy of any such news release.</p>

<p>17 - The 2008 Act specifies that the regulator must send a copy of the notice to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homes England;</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> in a case where the requirement would be imposed on a provider owning land in Greater London; and</li>
  <li>any other persons or organisations the regulator thinks appropriate, including, in particular, any person or organisation that provided information that resulted in the notice being given. The regulator will consider which persons or organisations might be appropriate depending on the circumstances of the case.</li>
</ul>

<p>18 - The regulator will hold a meeting with the advisers to brief them and to provide them with all the background material they will need to carry out their duties. As a minimum, such background material is likely to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information about the authority and its operations</li>
  <li>background to the regulator’s concerns</li>
  <li>specific detailed information about any particular aspect of the authority’s social housing affairs that is the subject of the appointment or requirement</li>
  <li>any relevant assessment or performance information</li>
  <li>the most recent financial statements in relation to social housing</li>
  <li>the terms of any public statement that the regulator requires the authority to make</li>
  <li>a draft news release to announce the advisers.</li>
</ul>

<p>19 - The regulator will hold a meeting with the authority in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduce the advisers and explain their role</li>
  <li>explain the advisers’ relationship with the regulator</li>
  <li>explain the advisers’ relationship with the authority and with the <abbr title="Arm's-Length Management Organisation">ALMO</abbr>, <abbr title="Tenant Management Organisation">TMO</abbr> or contractor, where relevant</li>
  <li>explain the regulator’s expectations of the authority and of the <abbr title="Arm's-Length Management Organisation">ALMO</abbr>, <abbr title="Tenant Management Organisation">TMO</abbr> or contractor where relevant</li>
  <li>explain the implications of the authority’s regulatory status and the actions that the regulator expects the authority to take to overcome the failure or problem with the support of the adviser</li>
  <li>agree lines of communication between the regulator and the advisers and between the regulator and the authority.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<h3>What an adviser can expect from the regulator</h3>

<p>20 - Throughout the period that an adviser is in place, the regulator will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agree appropriate liaison and reporting arrangements with advisers at the outset, including nominating a member of the regulator’s staff as the main point of contact</li>
  <li>meet advisers from time to time in order to check progress and ensure that the underlying concerns are resolved to the satisfaction of the regulator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What the regulator expects from an adviser</h2>

<p>21 - The regulator expects an adviser to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work in the best interests of the authority and its tenants</li>
  <li>work within the authority’s relevant codes of conduct, standing orders, policies, procedures and budgets</li>
  <li>be circumspect about making any public comments about the authority or about their role as an adviser and to generally act within the authority’s rules on confidentiality</li>
  <li>refer any news enquiries to the appropriate person in the authority and to generally act within the authority’s communications strategy</li>
  <li>maintain contact with the regulator, to keep it informed of key developments and to provide it with feedback on progress.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What the regulator expects from the authority</h2>

<p>22 - The regulator expects members and staff of the authority to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>co-operate with the regulator in relation to an appointment or a requirement</li>
  <li>co-operate with advisers in accordance with the requirements of the 2008 Act and, where relevant, to ensure that the board members and staff of any <abbr title="Arm's-Length Management Organisation">ALMO</abbr>, <abbr title="Tenant Management Organisation">TMO</abbr> or other agent also co-operate with advisers</li>
  <li>facilitate the full involvement of an adviser in the social housing affairs of the authority or in the relevant aspect of those affairs</li>
  <li>provide the adviser with copies of all documents, operating procedures and standing orders relevant to their role as an adviser</li>
  <li>make copies of all notices, agendas and papers for meetings available to an adviser</li>
  <li>provide liability insurance cover to advisers that are subject to a requirement which is equal to such insurance cover it arranges for elected members or senior officers of the authority</li>
  <li>reimburse an appointed adviser for all reasonable expenses they incur in accordance with the established policy and practice for the authority</li>
  <li>pay remuneration to the adviser in accordance with the provisions of the appointment or requirement</li>
  <li>co-ordinate its communications strategy on all matters relating to the advisers with the regulator, and to give the regulator the opportunity to comment on the content and timing of any news releases or other public statements.</li>
</ul>
