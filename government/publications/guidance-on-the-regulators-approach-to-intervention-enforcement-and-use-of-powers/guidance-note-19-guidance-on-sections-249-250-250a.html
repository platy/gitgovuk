<h2>Management transfer</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power to require a provider to transfer management functions. This is an enforcement power and is set out in Chapter 7 and sections 249, 250 and 250A of the 2008 Act.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - This power may be exercised in relation to all providers including a non-profit registered provider, a for-profit registered provider and a local authority provider.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>3 - A provider is responsible for ensuring that it achieves the standards set by the regulator. This requires the control and management of risk across all parts of the provider’s operations and good service delivery to its tenants. Management services might be delivered by the provider directly, or by an agent or a contractor working under an agreement or a contract, including services delivered for a local authority by an <abbr title="Arm's-Length Management Organisation">ALMO</abbr> or a <abbr title="Tenant Management Organisation">TMO</abbr>. The provider is responsible for managing itself, its employees, its agents and its contractors effectively.</p>

<p>4 - Where the regulator suspects that the affairs of a provider may have been mismanaged, it may hold an inquiry in accordance with sections 206 to 209 of the Act. As part of an inquiry, the regulator may require the provider’s accounts and balance sheet to be audited in accordance with section 210 of the Act. Further advice about the regulator’s approach to the exercise of the powers on inquiry and extraordinary audit is set out in the relevant guidance note. The regulator will consider an interim or a final report of an inquiry into the affairs of a provider in accordance with the principles set out in the guidance on the use of the power to hold an inquiry. The power to require a provider to transfer management functions is one of the enforcement powers available to the regulator in certain circumstances as a result of an inquiry.</p>

<h2>The power of management transfer</h2>

<p>5 - The power of management transfer is set out in sections 249, 250 and 250A of the Act. The regulator may require a provider to transfer some or all of its management functions in relation to some or all of its social housing if, as a result of an inquiry under section 206 or an audit under section 210, the regulator is satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the affairs of the provider have been mismanaged in relation to social housing, or</li>
  <li>a transfer of certain of a provider’s management functions would be likely to improve the management of some or all of its social housing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Potential triggers to the power of management transfer</h2>

<p>6 - If the regulator is satisfied that one or both of the circumstances specified in paragraph 5 apply, it will also consider whether it might be necessary to exercise any of the enforcement powers in the Act, including the power to require a provider to transfer management functions. The regulator is most likely to conclude that such a transfer is required in circumstances where it is satisfied that the findings of the inquiry demonstrate that one or more of the following circumstances apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there has been persistent mismanagement in some or all of the provider’s management functions</li>
  <li>there has been mismanagement in the delivery of services where there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been or there is a risk of a serious detriment to tenants</li>
  <li>there has been mismanagement and there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been or there is a risk of serious detriment to the security or interests of some or all of the provider’s tenants</li>
  <li>it is necessary to improve the management of some or all of the provider’s social housing</li>
  <li>the provider has failed to comply with any previous Order or Direction made by the regulator, including a requirement for a management tender, or to deal with previous regulatory interventions to the satisfaction of the regulator</li>
  <li>the provider has failed to honour a relevant voluntary undertaking to the satisfaction of the regulator.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are illustrative examples, not an exhaustive list. The regulator may conclude that it is necessary to consider exercising the power where the findings of the inquiry demonstrate other circumstances to those set out above.</p>

<p>7 - When exercising the power of management transfer, the regulator’s main objectives will be to improve the management of social housing and to secure better services for tenants. The power gives the regulator an option to address poor performance without having to transfer ownership of the provider’s assets. The regulator can require the provider to transfer management functions to an alternative manager selected by the regulator. The regulator’s approach will depend on the circumstances of the case, and on its assessment of the provider’s willingness to contribute positively to a timely resolution of the presenting problems and capacity to achieve any necessary improvements or changes in the relevant management functions. The regulator is only likely to exercise the power of management transfer when there are no appropriate and reasonable alternatives, or when it considers that the provider is unable to take action to resolve management failures through voluntary means.</p>

<h2>Additional provisions for local authority providers</h2>

<p>8 - Section 250A of the 2008 Act sets out some additional statutory provisions which apply where the regulator exercises the power of management transfer in relation to a local authority provider. These are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the regulator can exercise the power of management transfer even if the local authority already has a management agreement covering the same management functions in place</li>
  <li>the local authority may not give effect to a new or separate management agreement relating to those management functions of the authority that are the subject of the regulator’s requirement in the period that the requirement is in force</li>
  <li>any duty the local authority may have to consult on changes to the exercise of any relevant management functions does not apply in circumstances where the authority is acting in respect of a requirement imposed by the regulator</li>
  <li>a requirement imposed by the regulator is not a management agreement within the definition set out in section 27 of the Housing Act 1985, but the local authority remains responsible for anything done or not done by or to the new manager as if the requirement was a management agreement except where the terms of any relevant management agreement provide otherwise or in relation to criminal proceedings against the new manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>9 - In addition, the provisions of The Housing Management Agreements (Break Clause) (England) Regulations 2010 (the Regulations) imposed an obligation on all local authority providers to include a break clause in any management agreement entered into after 1 April 2010. This is intended to ensure that local authority providers have a suitable break clause that allows the management agreement to be terminated and the management functions transferred in circumstances where a requirement to transfer management functions is imposed by the regulator.</p>

<p>10 - The position may not be clear in relation to any management agreements that were in place before 1 April 2010. Although many will include a clause providing for termination where there is serious underperformance, it is possible that some will not. It would not be tenable to defer a requirement to transfer management functions until an existing management agreement had expired or had reached a previously agreed review point. In such circumstances, it would be for the provider to take any steps it considers necessary to comply with the requirement put in place by the regulator.</p>

<h2>Additional expectations for private providers</h2>

<p>11 - The additional statutory provisions outlined in paragraphs 8 to 10 do not apply to either a non-profit or a for-profit private provider. In general, the regulator expects such providers to ensure that any agreements or contracts with third parties for management services are specified to ensure compliance with relevant regulator standards. In addition, providers are expected to make provision for regular and periodic monitoring against agreed standards of performance and include provision for penalties or termination where agreed standards of performance are not achieved. In circumstances where the regulator imposes a requirement to transfer management functions, the regulator expects the provider to review its options in relation to its existing arrangements for the delivery of the relevant management functions, to take any steps it considers necessary to comply with the requirement and to ensure that the new manager can perform its duties regardless of any agreement or contract previously in place.</p>

<h2>Best practice in procurement</h2>

<p>12 - The 2008 Act does not make specific provision for the regulator to apply best procurement practice to a management transfer. As a public authority, the regulator is bound by relevant procurement law and will ensure that best procurement practice consistent with any applicable procurement law is embedded into the process. The regulator will inform the provider about its initial proposals for achieving these outcomes at an early stage in the process. It is in the best interests of both the provider and the regulator to identify the most efficient and effective process, and the regulator would expect the provider to co-operate with it in order to do so. In particular, the regulator will require the provider to give information and documents showing the basis on which relevant management functions are delivered by the provider or by its agent, together with any associated or related documents which might inform the regulator’s decision on how best to proceed. The process to select the new manager will be carried out by the regulator, so the regulator will carry any risk associated with compliance with any relevant statutory procurement requirements.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<h3>Notice</h3>

<p>13 If the regulator is minded to exercise this power, it must give the provider a notice and seek representations in accordance with the provisions set out in section 250 of the Act. The notice must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set out the grounds on which the regulator might take action</li>
  <li>warn the provider that the regulator is considering action</li>
  <li>explain the effect of section 250 of the Act</li>
  <li>specify a period of at least 28 days beginning on the day the provider receives the notice in which the provider may make representations to the regulator</li>
  <li>refer the provider to the provisions of section 125 of the Act, by which the provider may give a voluntary undertaking to the regulator. The regulator must indicate whether, and to what extent, it would accept a voluntary undertaking instead of, or in mitigation of, any action to require the provider to transfer management functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>14 - The 2008 Act specifies that the regulator must send a copy of the notice to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homes England;</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> in a case where the requirement would be imposed on a provider owning land in Greater London;</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>, in a case where the requirement would be imposed on a local authority provider; and</li>
  <li>any other persons or organisations the regulator thinks appropriate, including, in particular, any person or organisation that provided information that resulted in the notice being given. The regulator will consider which persons or organisations might be appropriate depending on the circumstances of the case.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The possible use of other enforcement powers</h2>

<p>15 - The 2008 Act specifies that the regulator may combine this notice with one or more notices relating to the possible use of certain other enforcement powers. In particular, the 2008 Act makes reference to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a pre-penalty warning (section 230 of the Act)</li>
  <li>a pre-compensation warning (section 242 of the Act)</li>
  <li>a management tender (section 248 of the Act), or</li>
  <li>an appointment of a manager (section 252 of the Act).</li>
</ul>

<p>16 - In circumstances where the regulator decides to issue more than one notice, it will do so in accordance with the terms of each relevant section of the 2008 Act and of each relevant guidance note on the use of the specific power. It follows that the regulator will only do so where the circumstances of the case make it appropriate and where the specific power is applicable to the particular type of provider. In addition, the regulator may also consider whether it would be appropriate to exercise any of its other enforcement powers either singly or in combination.</p>

<h2>Seeking views on a requirement</h2>

<p>17 - The 2008 Act specifies that in imposing a requirement to transfer management functions, the regulator must have regard to views of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relevant tenants – the regulator recognises that in any situation where some or all of the provider’s management functions might be subject to transfer, tenants may have concerns about the potential impact on the services they receive. The regulator will ensure, as far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, that tenants are informed about the proposed changes, and about the potential implications of the changes for both them and the provider. The nature of the information given to tenants will depend on the circumstances of the case and the timescales involved. It may not be practicable in all situations to make direct contact with each individual tenant and, in seeking tenants’ views, the regulator may work through the provider or any recognised tenant representative groups or an appointed tenant adviser.</li>
  <li>the registered provider – the regulator recognises that in any situation where some or all of the provider’s management functions might be subject to transfer, those involved in the delivery of the functions, including employees, agents and contractors may have concerns about how the proposals might impact on the provider, on their organisations or on them as individuals. The regulator will seek the views of the provider. The regulator will expect the provider to keep its employees, agents and contractors fully informed about how the requirement to transfer management functions might impact on them throughout the process. Since the regulator is not required to have regard to the views of the provider’s employees, agents or contractors, it will not seek their views and, if any such views are offered, it will not take them into account in reaching its decision</li>
  <li>Homes England;</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> where the requirement relates to a provider owning land in Greater London;</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> in a case where the requirement is to be imposed on a local authority provider.</li>
  <li>And, any relevant local authority in circumstances where the regulator thinks it appropriate to do so. The regulator will seek the views of the local authority in its strategic housing role in the area in which the registered provider that is subject to the transfer operates. The regulator will not usually seek the views of a local authority in its strategic role if it is considering the use of this power against the same local authority in its landlord role. In such circumstances, the regulator will usually only seek the views of the local authority in its role as the registered provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>18 - In addition, and depending on the circumstances of the case, the regulator may also provide information to, and, possibly, seek views from others, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>other regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority, the Charity Commission or the Registrar of Companies</li>
  <li>secured creditors particularly when a requirement is likely to have a material impact on some aspect of the provider’s business.</li>
</ul>

<p>19 - The regulator will seek views on the proposed requirement from relevant people and organisations at the most appropriate point in the process. This could be at the same time as the regulator sends notice to the provider or at a later date. The regulator’s over-riding objective will be to provide all the information relevant to the particular circumstances of the case, so that respondents are as fully informed as possible when giving views on the requirement.</p>

<h2>Considering views, representations and voluntary undertakings</h2>

<p>20 - Before making its decision on whether or not to impose a requirement, the regulator will consider all the material and views submitted to it in the light of the findings set out in the inquiry report. While the regulator must have regard to the views of those individuals and organisations listed in paragraph 17, it will not necessarily be bound by them. In particular, it may not be possible to reconcile all the various views in circumstances where some of them suggest a fundamentally different approach to others. The regulator’s approach will depend on the nature of the various views submitted to it, on the specific circumstances of each case and on whether the regulator is satisfied that any necessary improvements or changes to relevant management functions will be achieved in a timely manner.</p>

<p>21 - The regulator will also consider any representations and any proposals for voluntary undertakings submitted by the provider in response to the notice in the light of the findings set out in the inquiry report and in accordance with its general approach to such undertakings set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-the-standards">Regulating the Standards</a>. The acceptability, or otherwise, of any such undertaking will depend on the circumstances of the case. The regulator will consider the provider’s capacity to honour the undertaking and whether the terms of the undertaking are sufficient to bring about the necessary improvements to relevant management functions in a timely manner.</p>

<p>22 - The regulator will expect the provider to demonstrate clearly that it has the capacity and the capability to achieve a timely resolution of all relevant problems identified in the findings of the inquiry report, including the commitment of any funds or other resources that are necessary. The provider must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulator that the proposals set out in any views, representations or voluntary undertakings will fully resolve any mismanagement and bring about any necessary improvements in the management of the social housing. The proposals must achieve outcomes for tenants or for the business which can be sustained in the long term and are at least as good and as timely as those anticipated by the terms of the proposed requirement for a management transfer.</p>

<p>23 - Where the regulator is satisfied with the proposed terms of the voluntary undertaking, it may decide not to impose the requirement with immediate effect, but to allow the provider a period of time to implement its proposals. In such circumstances, the regulator will monitor and review the provider’s progress on a regular basis and at key milestones in order to assess whether or not the provider has honoured the undertaking. The regulator will give reasons for any decisions it makes in relation to such monitoring or review. In circumstances where the regulator subsequently concludes that a provider has failed to honour the undertaking or has failed to deliver any obligations at key milestones, it may decide to impose the requirement to transfer management functions without delay.</p>

<p>24 - Alternatively, where the regulator is not satisfied with the proposed terms of the voluntary undertaking, it may decide to impose the requirement without delay. The regulator is likely to take such action where it considers that the terms of the undertaking are unsatisfactory or insufficient to resolve the problems or where urgent or immediate action is necessary.</p>

<h2>The transfer</h2>

<p>25 - The purpose of this power is to improve the management of some or all of the provider’s social housing. The requirement to transfer management may relate to the provider’s management functions generally or to specific management functions in relation to its social housing. It may relate to the provider’s social housing stock generally or to specific social housing stock in a defined area. The circumstances of each case will determine whether the regulator requires a full or partial transfer of functions. For example, a partial transfer may be required where the underlying mismanagement is known to be confined to a specific function of the provider’s management operations in relation to its social housing, or to a specific geographical area.</p>

<p>26 - The regulator will select the new manager that will take the transfer of management functions. The 2008 Act makes provision for the transferee manager to be any person or organisation specified by the regulator. This could be another registered provider or an agent or a contractor with the capability and capacity to deliver efficient and effective management and sustain it throughout the period stipulated by the regulator in the requirement. In selecting the transferee manager, the regulator will have particular regard to the quality and management of that organisation’s service delivery in relation to the specific functions to be transferred. In addition, the regulator will expect the transferee manager to demonstrate good governance, financial viability and the management and financial capacity to deliver these functions.</p>

<h2>The terms of the transfer</h2>

<p>27 - The 2008 Act makes provision for the transfer to be on terms and conditions specified in, or determined in accordance with, any requirement imposed by the regulator. The actual terms and conditions will depend on the circumstances of the case. The regulator will specify the terms and conditions of the transfer and will set them out in any requirement imposed on the provider. Those terms and conditions must include provision for the remuneration of the transferee manager and specify the powers of the transferee manager. The 2008 Act also makes provision for the transferee manager to have any other power in relation to the provider’s affairs required by the manager for the purposes specified in the requirement, including for example, the power to enter into agreements and to take other action on behalf of the provider.</p>

<h2>The consent of the Secretary of State</h2>

<p>28 - The regulator can only exercise the power to require a provider to transfer management functions with the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> to the transfer and to terms of the transfer. The regulator will keep <abbr title="Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government">MHCLG</abbr> informed of progress on any cases where a requirement to transfer management functions might be imposed. The regulator will submit its formal application for the necessary consents following any decision by the regulator to impose the requirement. The application will include full information about the case and the process followed by the regulator in reaching its decision to impose the requirement.</p>

<h2>The requirement and complying with it</h2>

<p>29 - The requirement will set out the extent of the services that the provider must transfer and the specific terms and conditions attached to the transfer. The regulator will notify the provider about the requirement by letter addressed to the Chief Executive or other suitable person. The letter will set out the regulator’s proposals for its subsequent liaison with the provider to ensure compliance with the requirement. The regulator will expect the provider to effectively manage the transition from its existing manager to the transferee manager. The regulator will wish to satisfy itself that the provider is taking the appropriate action to comply with the requirement. Where the provider does not do so, the regulator will review its options and may consider exercising any of its regulatory, enforcement or general powers or taking other action against the provider.</p>

<h2>Notification of a requirement</h2>

<p>30 - The regulator will publicise the action that it takes in accordance with its policy on public statements. The regulator will inform those individuals and organisations that provided views on the proposed requirement about the regulator’s final decisions on the matter. The 2008 Act specifies that in circumstances where the regulator imposes a requirement to transfer management functions, it must send a copy of it to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homes England;</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> in a case where the requirement is to be imposed on a provider owning land in Greater London; and</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>, in a case where the requirement is to be imposed on a local authority provider.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Appeal</h2>

<p>31 - The provider may appeal to the High Court against a requirement to transfer management functions.</p>
