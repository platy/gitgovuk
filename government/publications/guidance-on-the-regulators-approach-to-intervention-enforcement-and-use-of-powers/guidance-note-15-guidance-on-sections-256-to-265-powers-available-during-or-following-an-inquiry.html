<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on the powers that the regulator may exercise during or following an inquiry. These are enforcement powers that are set out in Chapter 7 and sections 256 to 265 of the 2008 Act. These powers do not apply to local authorities.</p>

<p>2 - These powers can only be used after an inquiry and/or extraordinary audit and this document should be read in conjunction with the guidance on those powers.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>3 - The powers in sections 256 to 261 may be exercised only in relation to non-profit registered providers. They do not apply to for-profit registered providers or a local authority provider.</p>

<p>4 - The powers in sections 262 to 265 apply to all registered providers except local authorities.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>5 - Where the regulator suspects that the affairs of an registered provider may have been mismanaged, the regulator may hold an inquiry in accordance with section 206 of the Act. As part of an inquiry, the regulator may require the providerâs accounts and balance sheet to be audited by a qualified auditor appointed by the regulator (section 210).</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>6 - The 2008 Act sets out the circumstances in which the regulator may exercise this power and they are set out below.</p>

<p>7 - Following receipt of an interim or final inquiry report, the regulator may conclude that it is necessary to use one or more of the powers available.</p>

<p>8 - In particular, the regulator may conclude that it is necessary to suspend or remove officers, employees or agents of the registered provider in order to ensure the proper conduct of the inquiry and/or the proper management of the providerâs functions, including the delivery of services to its tenants. It may also conclude that it is necessary to restrict the dealings of the registered provider in order to protect its assets and the public investment.</p>

<p>9 - Where a person is removed from their position following a statutory inquiry or extraordinary audit, the regulator may conclude that it would not be appropriate for that person to serve as an officer of another provider and so the regulator may disqualify that person.</p>

<h2>The powers</h2>

<h3>Restrictions on dealings during an inquiry</h3>

<p>10 - Section 256 of the 2008 Act includes two specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power on restrictions on dealings during an inquiry under section 206 of the 2008 Act into a non-profit registered provider. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the regulator has reasonable grounds for believing that the affairs of the non-profit registered provider have been mismanaged and that its assets or the interests of its tenants require protection</li>
  <li>where the regulator is satisfied that, as a result of an inquirerâs interim report under section 207 of the Act, the affairs of the non-profit registered provider have been mismanaged.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Restrictions on dealings following an inquiry</h2>

<p>11 Section 257 of the 2008 Act includes two specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power on restrictions on dealings following an inquiry under section 206 of the 2008 Act into a non-profit registered provider. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the regulator is satisfied that, as a result of an inquiry under section 206 of the Act, the affairs of the non-profit registered provider have been mismanaged</li>
  <li>where the regulator is satisfied that, as a result of an audit under section 210 of the Act, the affairs of the non-profit registered provider have been mismanaged.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suspension of officers, employees or agents during an inquiry</h2>

<p>12 - Section 259 of the 2008 Act includes two specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power on suspension during an inquiry under section 206 of the 2008 Act into a non-profit registered provider. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the regulator has reasonable grounds for believing that the affairs of the non-profit registered provider have been mismanaged and that its assets or the interests of its tenants require protection</li>
  <li>where the regulator is satisfied that, as a result of an inquirerâs interim report under section 207 of the Act, the affairs of the non-profit registered provider have been mismanaged.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Removal or suspension of officers, employees or agents following an inquiry</h2>

<p>13 - Section 260 of the 2008 Act includes two specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power on removal of suspension following an inquiry under section 206 of the 2008 Act into a non-profit registered provider. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the regulator is satisfied that, as a result of an inquiry under section 206 of the Act, the affairs of the non-profit registered provider have been mismanaged</li>
  <li>where the regulator is satisfied that, as a result of an audit under section 210 of the Act, the affairs of the non-profit registered provider have been mismanaged</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disqualification of a removed person</h2>

<p>14 - Section 262 of the 2008 Act includes two specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power on disqualification of a removed person. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where a person has been removed under section 260 of the Act</li>
  <li>where a person has been removed under paragraph 24(2)(a) of schedule 1 of the Housing Act 1996, section 30(1)(a) of the Housing Associations Act 1985 or section 20(1)(a) of the Housing Act 1974 (other similar provisions).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process</h2>

<h3>Restrictions on dealings</h3>

<p>15 - The regulator may order a bank or other person holding money or securities on behalf of the non-profit registered provider not to part with them without the regulatorâs consent. Before issuing an Order, the regulator will take all reasonable steps to give notice to the non-profit registered provider and the person to whom the Order is made.</p>

<p>16 - The Order may restrict:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the transactions that may be entered into by the non-profit registered provider or</li>
  <li>the nature and amounts of payments that may be made by the non-profit registered provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>17 - The Order may in particular stipulate that transactions or payments may not be entered into or made without the regulatorâs consent. The regulator may only make an Order in respect of a registered provider that is a registered charity if that provider has received (financial) public assistance.</p>

<p>18 - An Order made following an inquiry has effect until revoked by the regulator. An Order made during an inquiry has effect until the end of a period of six months beginning on the day the inquirerâs final report is made. The regulator may revoke the Order before that time or extend it for a further period of up to six months.</p>

<p>19 - The bank or person to whom the Order is made will be informed that if they contravene the Order, they will commit an offence and may be prosecuted.</p>

<h2>Suspensions and removals</h2>

<p>20 - During an inquiry, the regulator may, by Order, suspend any officer, employee or agent of the non-profit registered provider who the regulator thinks has contributed to the failure or mismanagement.</p>

<p>21 - Suspension ceases at the end of the period of six months beginning on the day the inquirerâs final report is made. The regulator can revoke the Order before the end of that period.</p>

<p>22 - Following an inquiry, the regulator may, by Order, remove any officer, employee or agent of the non-profit registered provider who the regulator thinks has contributed to the failure or mismanagement. Pending a decision whether to remove such a person the regulator may suspend them for a specified period of up to six months.</p>

<p>23 - Before making an Order to remove an officer, employee or agent of the non-profit registered provider, the regulator will take all reasonable steps to give at least 14 daysâ notice to the person and the registered provider.</p>

<p>24
The regulator may only suspend or remove an officer, employee or agent of a registered provider charity if the charity has received public assistance. The regulator will notify the Charity Commission if it suspends or removes an officer, employee or agent of a registered charity.</p>

<p>25 - Where a person has been suspended or removed the regulator may give directions to the non-profit registered provider about the performance of the suspended/removed personâs functions or any other matter arising from the suspension/removal. The regulator may appoint a person to perform the suspended/removed personâs functions.</p>

<h2>Disqualification</h2>

<p>26 - If a person has been removed (not suspended) as an officer under section 260 they are disqualified from acting as an officer of any registered provider except local authorities (for the avoidance of doubt this covers non-profit registered providers and for-profit registered providers).</p>

<p>27 - The regulator may waive disqualification either generally or in relation to a particular registered provider or class of registered providers. A waiver will only be granted following an application by the disqualified person. The regulator will notify the person if any aspect of their disqualification has been waived.</p>

<p>28 - The regulator will maintain a register of disqualified persons that shows the details of any waivers and which is available for inspection by the public.</p>

<p>29 - If a disqualified person acts as an officer for a registered provider, the personâs acts are not invalid by reason of the disqualification only.</p>

<p>30 - A person who acts as an officer while disqualified is committing an offence and may be prosecuted.</p>

<p>31 - A person who acts as an officer while disqualified and who receives payment or other benefits from the registered provider may be required by the regulator to repay the sum or a specified amount representing the whole or part of the value of the benefit. If the person fails to comply with a requirement to repay, the non-profit registered provider may recover the sum or specified amount as a debt.</p>
