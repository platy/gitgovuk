<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power on the amalgamation of a registered society. This is an enforcement power and is set out in Chapter 7 and section 255 of the 2008 Act.</p>

<p>2 - This power can only be used after an inquiry and/or extraordinary audit and this document should be read in conjunction with the guidance on those powers.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Scope</h2>

<p>3 - The power may be exercised only in relation to a non-profit registered provider which is a registered society. It may not be exercised in relation to a for-profit provider, a local authority provider or a non-profit registered provider which is not a registered society.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>4 - Where the regulator suspects that the affairs of a registered provider may have been mismanaged, the regulator may hold an inquiry in accordance with section 206 of the Act. As part of an inquiry, the regulator may require the providerâs accounts and balance sheet to be audited by a qualified auditor appointed by the regulator (section 210).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>5 - Section 255 of the 2008 Act includes two specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power on amalgamation. They are where, as a result of an inquiry under section 206 or an audit under section 210, the regulator is satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the affairs of a non-profit <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> which is a registered society have been mismanaged in relation to social housing, or</li>
  <li>the management of social housing owned by a non-profit <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> which is a registered society would be improved if the registered society <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> were amalgamated with another registered society.</li>
</ul>

<p>6 - The power can only be exercised as a result of the regulatorâs conclusions in these two areas following an inquiry under section 206 or an audit under section 210.</p>

<p>7 - If, as a result of an inquiry or audit, the regulator is satisfied that the affairs of the registered society <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> have been mismanaged in relation to social housing or is satisfied that an amalgamation of the registered society <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> with another registered society would be likely to improve the management of social housing, the regulator may make and execute an instrument on behalf of the registered society <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> which provides for its amalgamation with another registered society.</p>

<p>8 - Under section 255, the regulator can only make and execute an instrument amalgamating the two registered societies having first obtained the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Process</h2>

<p>9 - In considering its findings following a statutory inquiry or extraordinary audit, the regulator will decide whether to exercise the power to amalgamate a registered society.</p>

<p>10 - The regulator will seek the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> to the proposed amalgamation. Following receipt of the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> to the amalgamation, the regulator will follow the outline process below in executing the boardâs decision.</p>

<p>11 - For ease of reference, in the remainder of this document the provider subject to the statutory inquiry or extraordinary audit will be referred to as PRP1, the provider with which PRP1 will be amalgamated will be referred to as PRP2 and the resultant organisation referred to as PRP3.</p>

<p>12 - In general, the regulator will expect PRP2 to take the lead on business and operational planning for PRP3. The regulator expects PRP1 to work positively with the regulator and PRP2 in taking the amalgamation forward.</p>

<p>13 - PRP3 must be a registered society, registered by the regulator and designated as a non-profit registered provider. Pending registration by the regulator, PRP3 shall be treated as registered and designated as a non-profit provider.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Selection of PRP2</h2>

<p>14 The regulator will select organisation PRP2. In identifying a suitable, willing organisation and making its selection, the regulator will have regard to the quality and management of services to residents provided by potential PRP2 organisations, the quality of their governance systems, their financial viability, general regulatory compliance and management and financial capacity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Due diligence and business planning</h2>

<p>15 - PRP2 will be expected to conduct due diligence as it sees fit on PRP1.</p>

<p>16 - PRP2 will be expected to prepare a business plan for PRP3 and to submit that for consideration by the regulator.</p>

<p>17 - PRP2 will be expected to develop a plan to establish PRP3 and to submit that for consideration by the regulator.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Consultation</h2>

<p>18 - The regulator expects PRP1 and PRP2 to conduct appropriate consultation regarding the amalgamation with their residents, lenders and local authorities in which they work.</p>

<p>19 - Where necessary PRP1 and PRP2 will need to obtain the formal consent of their lenders to the propose amalgamation.</p>

<p>20 - The regulator will agree with PRP2 and PRP1 which organisation will undertake which aspects of consultation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Governing instrument (rules)</h2>

<p>21 - The regulator will invite PRP2 to draft a set of rules for PRP3. These will be expected to be based on the most up-to-date version of model rules for registered societies and will need to be approved by both PRP1 and PRP2. The regulator will provide comments and in principle agreement to the new rules before they are considered by the regulator.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Agreement to the amalgamation by the regulator</h2>

<p>22 - The regulator will receive a report setting out the detail of the proposed amalgamation and covering the outcome of consultation and due diligence, business and operational planning for PRP3, views of lenders and local authorities and the new rules for PRP3. If the regulator agrees to the detail of the proposed amalgamation, it will seek the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> to that proposal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Registration of the amalgamation</h2>

<p>23 - Following receipt of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>âs consent to the proposal, the regulator will prepare an instrument of amalgamation and send a copy of it to the Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>). The copy will be sent for registration within 14 days of the date of execution. A copy registered after that 14 day period is valid. The <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr> will register the instrument (the amalgamation does not take effect until it is registered by the <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>). The regulator will advise PRP3 of the <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>âs registration of the instrument of amalgamation.</p>
