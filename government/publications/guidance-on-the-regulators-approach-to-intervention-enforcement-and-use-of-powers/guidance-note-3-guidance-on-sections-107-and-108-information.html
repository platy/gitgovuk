<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power on the collection of information and documents. This is a general power and is set out in Chapter 2, sections 107 and 108, of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>. It may be exercised in relation to all registered providers.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - The power may be exercised in relation to all providers, including a non-profit <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>, a for-profit <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> and an local authority provider. It may also be exercised in relation to anyone who has applied to become a registered provider.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>3 - The regulator needs to collect and hold reliable information so it can undertake its functions. The regulator will use this information to assess compliance with the standards framework. The regulator is committed to minimising the additional burden of its information requirements through the best use of information that is already available. This may include information produced by providers for public reporting or for internal management purposes.</p>

<p>The regulator expects providers to produce the information and documents it requires on a regular and timely basis under this general power. However, it may be necessary for the regulator to exercise this power in circumstances where providers are unable or unwilling to provide the documents or information that the regulator requires routinely to carry out its functions, or where it believes that there may have been a breach of the standards. This guidance sets out how the regulator would use the power in those circumstances.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>4 - Sections 107 and 108 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> set out the circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power to collect information. The regulator may, for a purpose connected with its functions, require a person to provide a document or information which it believes is, or may be, in the person’s possession and which relates to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the financial or other affairs of a provider</li>
  <li>activities which are, or may be, carried out by a person who is, or who has applied to become, a registered provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>5 - The regulator is most likely to exercise the power where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a potential failure against a standard</li>
  <li>the provider has failed to produce the information and documents required on a routine basis by the regulator</li>
  <li>the provider is either slow or unwilling to produce additional information and documents requested by the regulator when the regulator has grounds to believe that there may be a problem with a provider’s performance and needs to undertake further regulatory scrutiny</li>
  <li>the provider has failed to honour a voluntary undertaking to the satisfaction of the regulator</li>
  <li>the provider has failed to deal with previous regulatory interventions to the satisfaction of the regulator</li>
  <li>it is necessary to collect information or documents as part of the exercise of the regulator’s wider regulatory or investigatory powers such as an inspection or an inquiry.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list and the regulator may conclude that it is necessary to exercise the power in other circumstances to those set out above.</p>

<h2>The power</h2>

<h3>Who can be required to provide documents and information?</h3>

<p>6 - The application of the provisions of sections 107 and 108 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> is not restricted to a provider. The regulator can require a document or information from any person who is, or may be, in possession of it. This may include any person who is, or has been an officer, member, employee or agent of a provider or anyone providing goods or services to a provider. A requirement may be imposed on a person other than a provider only if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the provider has been asked to produce a document or information but has failed to do so</li>
  <li>the regulator concludes that the provider is unable to produce it.</li>
</ul>

<p>7  -The provisions of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> do not require a person to produce anything which they would be entitled to refuse to disclose on the grounds of legal professional privilege in proceedings in the High Court.</p>

<p>8 - The provisions of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> do not require a banker to breach a duty of confidentiality owed to a person who is not the provider to whose affairs or activities the documents or information relate or a subsidiary of the provider or an associate of the provider.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<h3>A requirement</h3>

<p>9 - The regulator will send a notice, or a requirement, to the provider which will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clearly state that the information is required under this power</li>
  <li>specify the document or information required</li>
  <li>the form and manner in which the document or information is to be provided, which may include the provision of a legible copy of information stored electronically</li>
  <li>when and where the document or information is to be provided.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Response</h2>

<p>10 - The regulator expects the provider or other person to produce the document or information in accordance with the terms of the requirement. If the provider or other person does so, the regulator will acknowledge receipt. The regulator may copy or record the document or information produced.</p>

<h2>Failure to comply with a requirement</h2>

<p>11 - If a provider or other person fails to comply with a requirement without reasonable justification, the regulator will consider whether further action may be necessary. If a provider or other person is unable to produce the document or information, they may give the regulator a written explanation setting out the reasons for the failure to comply with the requirement. Any such representations will be considered by the regulator and taken into account in deciding whether or not to take further action.</p>

<h2>Further action</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>12 - The regulator may apply to the High Court to make an Order to remedy the failure to comply with a requirement. In such circumstances the regulator may seek to recover its costs.</p>
</div>

<p>13 - The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> makes provision for the regulator or the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring proceedings, or to consent to proceedings if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a provider or other person fails without reasonable excuse to comply with a requirement</li>
  <li>a provider or other person intentionally alters, suppresses or destroys a document or information to which a requirement relates.</li>
</ul>

<p>14 - Where information has been altered, suppressed or destroyed, the regulator may consider using one or more of its other powers.</p>
