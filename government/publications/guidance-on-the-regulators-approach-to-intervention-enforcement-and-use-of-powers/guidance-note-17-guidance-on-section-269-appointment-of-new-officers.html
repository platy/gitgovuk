<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power on the appointment of a new officer. This is an enforcement power and is set out in Part 2 Chapter 7 section 269 of the 2008 Act.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - The power may be exercised only in relation to an officer of a non-profit registered provider. It cannot be applied to a local authority provider or to a for-profit registered provider.</p>

<p>3 - The word “officer” is defined in section 270 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 in relation to the various constitutional arrangements of a registered provider. The word “mismanagement” in relation to the affairs of a registered provider is defined in section 275 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 as managed in breach of any legal requirements (imposed by or under an Act or otherwise).</p>

<p>4 - This power may be exercised in relation to an officer of a registered charity only if the charity has received public assistance, as defined in section 274 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008. In summary, this means that the registered charity must have received certain specified loans or grants from public sources or had property transferred to it by a local authority. The power to appoint an officer to a registered charity may be exercised only if the regulator has consulted the Charity Commission.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>5 - The provider is responsible for ensuring that the organisation is properly governed and viable, and achieves the standards set by the regulator. In circumstances where there has been a failure against a standard or where a provider has been mismanaged, the regulator will assess the most appropriate course of action. The regulator will consider the willingness of members of the provider’s governing body to contribute positively to a timely resolution of the failure against a standard or mismanagement and whether they have the capability, expertise and skills in sufficient depth to achieve a satisfactory outcome. If the regulator concludes that they do not, it may appoint officers to the governing body.</p>

<p>6 - The appointment of officers is intended to give the provider a range of relevant additional skills and expertise to assist in resolving the failure against standards or mismanagement.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>7 - Section 269 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 includes three specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power on the appointment of new officers. They are:</p>

<p>7.1. to replace an officer removed under section 266 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008, that is the removal of an officer in certain specified circumstances such as bankruptcy</p>

<p>7.2. where there are no officers</p>

<p>7.3. to ensure that the registered provider’s affairs are managed in accordance with legal requirements (imposed by or under an Act or otherwise).</p>

<p>8 - The regulator is most likely to exercise the power to appoint an officer where one or more of the following circumstances apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the provider’s affairs have been mismanaged in accordance with the definition in section 275 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008</li>
  <li>there has been a failure against one or more economic standards</li>
  <li>there has been a failure against one or more consumer standards where there has been serious detriment to tenants</li>
  <li>it is necessary to replace an officer removed in accordance with the provisions of section 266 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008</li>
  <li>where there are no officers.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list and the regulator may conclude that it is necessary to consider exercising the power in other circumstances that meet the statutory grounds for appointments to those set out above.</p>

<p>9 - When the regulator exercises its power to remove an officer under section 266, it will always consider whether it is necessary to replace the officer who has been removed. It will make its decision in the light of the circumstances of the provider. In particular, it will assess whether the governing body has the capability, expertise and skills in sufficient depth to resolve any failure against standards or mismanagement.</p>

<p>10 - It is most unusual for there to be no officers on the governing body of a provider, so the regulator expects to have to exercise its power to appoint a person as an officer in these circumstances on very rare occasions.</p>

<h2>The power</h2>

<h3>The restrictions on the number of appointed officers</h3>

<p>11 - The regulator may appoint more than one officer to the governing body of a provider. The <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 specifies that in general the use of this power overrides any restriction on eligibility or numbers of officers imposed by the provider’s constitution. However, this is balanced by a restriction that in most circumstances the number of appointed officers must be a minority of officers of the provider. The regulator may appoint more than a minority of the officers of a provider only if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the provider has fewer officers than required by its constitution</li>
  <li>the provider’s constitution does not specify a minimum number of officers.</li>
</ul>

<p>12 - The regulator will decide how many appointments to make based on the need for additional capability, expertise and skills sufficient to resolve the failure against standards or mis-management and the constitution of the provider. The regulator will review the number of appointed officers from time to time and may adjust the number where it is proportionate to do so.</p>

<h2>The period and the terms of an appointment</h2>

<p>13 - The <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 requires the Order appointing an officer to specify the period for which, and the terms on which, office is to be held. The regulator will usually appoint officers for an initial period of six months. The regulator will review the need for the appointments and may extend the period of office or may withdraw the appointed officers at any time, depending on the circumstances of the case. An appointed officer can resign at any time within the rules of the provider. In these circumstances, the regulator will decide whether to replace an appointed officer who has resigned. The terms on which an appointed officer holds office will be set out in the Order making the appointment.</p>

<h2>The rights, powers and obligations of an appointed officer</h2>

<p>14 - The <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 specifies that an appointed officer has the same rights, powers and obligations as any other officer of the provider’s governing body.</p>

<h2>Direction to the Homes and Communities Agency (Homes England)</h2>

<p>15 - Under section 100G of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, one of the circumstances in which the regulator may direct Homes England not to give financial assistance to a specified <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> (either under section 19 or in connection with social housing) is where the regulator has appointed an officer of the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> under section 269 (and the person appointed has not vacated office). The regulator will review its approach on a regular basis until the person appointed has vacated office, at which point the direction to Homes England will be withdrawn. Further advice and guidance about the regulator’s approach to the use of this power to make directions is set out in the relevant guidance note.</p>

<h2>Direction to the Greater London Authority</h2>

<p>16 - Under the Greater London Authority Act 1999 section 333ZG, in circumstances where the regulator has appointed an officer to the governing body of a <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>, it may give a Direction to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> which prohibits the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> from giving financial assistance to the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>. In circumstances where it has appointed an officer, the regulator will also consider whether to issue such a Direction to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>. The regulator will review its approach on a regular basis until the person appointed has vacated office, at which point the Direction to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> will be withdrawn. Further advice and guidance about the regulator’s approach to the use of this power to make directions is set out in the relevant guidance note.</p>

<h2>Who can be an appointed officer?</h2>

<p>17 - While the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 places no restrictions on who can be an appointed officer, the regulator will always aim to match the best and most suitable people to the provider and to the particular circumstances of each case. The regulator will appoint people with relevant knowledge, skills and expertise.</p>

<h2>Notification and initial contact</h2>

<p>18 - The regulator will notify the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> about the appointments by a letter addressed to the chair or company secretary or other suitable person. The regulator will serve an Order on the provider for each appointed officer and the orders will be copied to the appointed officers. The regulator will issue a news release to announce the appointed officers. The <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> will usually be given an opportunity to comment on the factual accuracy of any such news release.</p>

<p>19 - The regulator will provide the appointed officers with the relevant background and briefing material they will need to carry out their duties. As a minimum, such background material is likely to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>’s constitution</li>
  <li>the most recent audited accounts and auditor’s management letter</li>
  <li>the most recent regulatory judgement</li>
  <li>the most recent in depth assessment or stability check reports</li>
  <li>key correspondence between the regulator and the provider</li>
  <li>the terms of any public statement that the regulator asks the provider to make</li>
  <li>a draft news release to announce the appointed officers.</li>
</ul>

<p>20 - The regulator will hold a meeting with the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>, usually with its governing body and senior staff, in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduce the appointed officer(s)</li>
  <li>explain the reasons for making the appointment</li>
  <li>explain the regulator’s expectations of the provider</li>
  <li>explain the implications of the provider’s regulatory status and the actions that the regulator expects the provider to take to overcome the failure against the standards or mismanagement</li>
  <li>agree lines of communication between the regulator and the provider.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<h3>What appointed officers can expect from the regulator</h3>

<p>21 - The regulator will agree appropriate liaison arrangements and lines of communication with appointed officers including nominating a member of the regulator’s staff as the main point of contact for all aspects of the appointments.</p>

<h2>What the regulator expects from appointed officers</h2>

<p>22 - The regulator expects an appointed officer to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work in the best interests of the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>act in the knowledge that they have the same rights, powers and obligations as any other officer of the provider’s governing body, and to exercise their judgement accordingly</li>
  <li>work within the constitution, code of conduct, standing orders, policies and procedures of the provider or, where these are not properly documented, to exercise their judgement to comply with generally accepted good practice</li>
  <li>to act within the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> rules on confidentiality but also to act in a manner consistent with the Regulatory Standards</li>
  <li>refer any media enquiries to the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> and to act within the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>’s communications strategy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What the regulator expects from the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>
</h2>

<p>23 - The regulator expects the officers and staff of the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>co-operate fully with the regulator</li>
  <li>co-operate with an appointed officer</li>
  <li>facilitate the full involvement of an appointed officer in the affairs of the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>provide copies of all documents, codes of conduct, standing orders, policies and procedures relevant to their membership of the governing body to an appointed officer</li>
  <li>send copies of all notices, agendas and papers for meetings to an appointed officer</li>
  <li>consult an appointed officer about the dates and times of meetings that they will be required to attend</li>
  <li>inform any other relevant authority, for example Companies House in the case of a registered company, that an appointed officer has joined the governing body as it is required to do when any new member joins the governing body</li>
  <li>provide details of the liability insurance cover it provides for all members of its governing body to an appointed officer, and to inform the insurers that an appointed officer has joined the governing body if it is required to do so under the terms of the insurance</li>
  <li>admit the appointed officer to membership and issue a share certificate where the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> has a shareholding membership</li>
  <li>reimburse an appointed officer for all reasonable expenses they incur in accordance with the established policy and practice for all members of the governing body</li>
  <li>offer to pay appointed officers where the <abbr title="Private Registered Provider">PRP</abbr> pays members of its governing body – it will be for each appointed officer to decide whether or not to accept the offer.</li>
</ul>
