<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power on penalties. This is an enforcement power and is set out in Part 2 Chapter 7 sections 226 to 235 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - The power may be exercised in relation to a non-profit registered provider, or a for-profit registered provider. It may not be exercised in relation to a local authority.</p>

<h3>Background and context to the use of the power</h3>

<p>3 - This power allows the regulator to penalise failure on the part of registered provider by the imposition of fines.</p>

<h3>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h3>

<p>4 - Section 227 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 includes seven specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power on imposing penalties. They are:</p>

<p>4.1 where the registered provider has failed to meet an economic standard or failed to meet a consumer standard and there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been or there is a risk of serious detriment to tenants</p>

<p>4.2 where the affairs of the registered provider have been mismanaged</p>

<p>4.3 where the registered provider has failed to comply with an enforcement notice</p>

<p>4.4 where the registered provider has given an undertaking under section 125 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 and failed to comply with it</p>

<p>4.5 where the registered provider has failed to pay an annual fee under section 117 (2) of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008</p>

<p>4.6 where an offence under Part 2 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 has been committed by a registered provider</p>

<p>4.7 where the registered provider has failed to comply with relevant provisions of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 or with regulations made by the Secretary of State (<abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>) under the <abbr title="Welfare Reform and Work Act">WRWA</abbr>.</p>

<p>5 - In considering whether to penalise a provider, the regulator will take into account all relevant circumstances of the case, including the provider’s financial position and any potential detrimental imposition on its tenants. It will also consider whether a penalty is the most appropriate response in each case, or if it should use one or more of its other powers.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>6 - Before a penalty notice is issued, the regulator will give the provider a ‘pre-penalty warning’. This will warn the provider that the regulator is considering imposing a penalty and will set out the grounds on which the regulator believes the penalty can be imposed.</p>

<p>7 - The pre-penalty warning will include any details the regulator is able to give concerning the likely amount of the penalty. It will provide details of how the provider can make representations to the regulator. It will indicate whether or to what extent the regulator would accept a voluntary undertaking instead of, or in mitigation of, a penalty. The warning will also include details of the enforcement of the proposed penalty.</p>

<p>8 - The pre-penalty warning will be copied to Homes England and in addition to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> where it relates to a provider owning land in Greater London and any other persons the regulator thinks appropriate, in particular any person who provided information as a result of which the pre-penalty warning is being issued.</p>

<h3>Representations</h3>

<p>9 - The regulator will specify a period in the pre-penalty warning during which the provider may make representations concerning the imposition of the proposed penalty or its amount. This period will be of at least 28 days and will begin on the date the pre-penalty warning is received by the provider. The regulator will normally send such notices by recorded delivery and will work on the basis that the provider receives the documents the day after they are sent. At the end of the period, the regulator will consider any representations and decide whether to impose the penalty.</p>

<h2>Imposition</h2>

<p>10 - A penalty is imposed by the regulator giving a penalty notice to the provider. The notice will set out the grounds on which the penalty is imposed, the amount, payment method, payment period, the interest to be charged on any late payment and the means of appeal. The notice may require the provider to publish information about the penalty and may set out the manner of that publication.</p>

<h2>Notifying the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> and Homes England</h2>

<p>11 - When a penalty is imposed the regulator will send a copy of it to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> where it relates to a provider owning land in Greater London. The regulator will also send a copy of the penalty to Homes England.</p>

<h3>Amount</h3>

<p>12 - Penalties for an offence under Part two of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 may not exceed the maximum amount of fine that a magistrates’ court could impose for the relevant offence, and the notice will confirm that the penalty falls within the current limit. For all other instances the penalty imposed may not exceed £5,000 or other maximum amount as ordered by the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Destination</h3>

<p>13 - Money received by way of a penalty will be paid to the Regulator. In accordance with section 233 the regulator may deduct such a sum as represents the direct costs to the regulator of imposing and enforcing the penalty and a reasonable share of expenditure by the regulator which is indirectly referable to the imposition and enforcement of the penalty. The regulator will establish and publish a methodology for calculating these deductions. Any excess shall be paid to Homes England in accordance with the Act.</p>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<p>14 - The penalty will be treated as a debt owed to the regulator. If payment is not made by the date specified in the notice the regulator may charge interest on the debt from that date and may impose one or more additional penalties in accordance with any regulations that may be made by HM Treasury.</p>

<p>15 - The regulator may include a provision in the penalty notice allowing a discount if the penalty is paid on or before the specified date. The regulator will establish and publish a methodology for calculating any discounts.</p>

<h2>Appeal</h2>

<p>16 - The regulator has developed a protocol which allows a provider to appeal against its decisions on the use of some enforcement powers. In addition, a provider who is given a penalty notice may appeal to the High Court against the imposition of the penalty, its amount, or both.</p>
