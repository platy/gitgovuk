<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator envisages the powers relating to the potential insolvency of a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> working.</p>

<p>2 - There are two distinct sets of powers. The regulator’s moratorium powers are set out in Chapter 4 of part 2 (sections 143A to 159) of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> as amended by the Housing and Planning Act 2016 (“the <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016”).</p>

<p>3 - The Housing Administration regime and the power of the regulator to apply to the court for a Housing Administration set out in chapter 5 of Part 4 of the <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 (including schedules).</p>

<p>4 - The Housing Administration powers may be exercised in relation to non-profit and for-profit <abbr title="private registered providers">PRPs</abbr> but not local authority providers.</p>

<p>5 - This guidance note is organised into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Background;</li>
  <li>Moratorium powers; and</li>
  <li>Housing Administration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part (a) Background and context</h2>

<p>6 - Where a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> identifies a potential problem with, or threat to, its viability, for whatever reason, the regulator expects the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> to notify the regulator immediately. The regulator will intervene as it considers appropriate bearing in mind its own statutory objectives, and this will usually include an aim of ensuring that viability is maintained. It may be possible to avert a potentially damaging situation without the need for either a moratorium or Housing Administration, and where that is possible and reasonable that is what the regulator will work towards.</p>

<p>7 - Many of the actions required in a potential insolvency are specified in legislation and, as in the case of Housing Administration, associated rules, and the regulator must act within the legislative framework. Further, there are powers and responsibilities which fall to the courts and the Secretary of State, which it would not be appropriate to address in guidance issued by the regulator.</p>

<p>8 - The purpose of the moratorium provisions in the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> is to create a period of time in which to seek a solution to the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s viability problem, in order to protect the social housing assets and the interests of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s tenants. The moratorium provisions should not be construed as a guarantee that the regulator will underwrite the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s financial position in any way. During a moratorium the regulator will always consider the precise factual situation and make decisions on a case by case basis. It will usually consider making proposals in accordance with the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> and will usually work towards ensuring continued management of housing property by a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>. That may not prove possible, and in any event the future owner or manager might not be the existing provider. The regulator will take seriously its statutory obligations towards the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s creditors in any proposed solution.</p>

<p>9 - A moratorium is automatically triggered by notice of an insolvency-related “step”, as defined in the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> (as amended by the <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016), being taken. In that event, or where the regulator considers that a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> is likely to be unable to pay its debts, the regulator will consider whether to apply to the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> for permission to seek a Housing Administration Order from the court.</p>

<h2>Part (b): The moratorium powers</h2>

<h3>The circumstances in which a moratorium may occur</h3>

<p>10 - Section 145 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> (as amended by the <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016) specifies five provisions under which, where notice is given to the regulator, a moratorium is automatically triggered. The relevant notices are:</p>

<p>a. winding up petition (further rules about which are set out in <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 section 104(2)(a))</p>

<p>b. application for permission to pass a resolution for voluntary winding up (further rules about which are set out in <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 section 105(4)(a))</p>

<p>c. Ordinary Administration application (further rules about which are set out in <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 section 106(3)(a))</p>

<p>d. appointment of ordinary administrator (further rules about which are set out in <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 section 107(4)(a))</p>

<p>e. intention to enforce security (further rules about which are set out in <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 section 108(2)(a)).</p>

<p>11 - A notice under section 145 should be served, as soon as is practicable, in writing, on the</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Chief Executive 
<br>Regulator of Social Housing 
<br>Level 1A 
<br>City Tower
<br>Piccadilly Plaza
<br>Manchester
<br>M1 4BT
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>This is the address for service of any legal documents on the regulator.</p>

<p>12 - The notice should state clearly the step (specified in HRA section 145) under which the person is serving the notice and the reasons why this action is being taken.</p>

<h3>The effect of notice under HRA section 145</h3>

<p>13 -  If notice is given under section 145 in respect of a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>, a moratorium on the disposal of land P by the provider, begins. The initial period of moratorium is 28 calendar days, but this can be extended or ended early. The 28-day period begins with the day on which the notice is given.</p>

<p>14 - During a moratorium the regulator has a variety of powers including powers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appoint an interim manager of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>make proposals (following certain statutory processes) about the future ownership and management of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s land with a view to ensuring that the property will be properly managed by a registered provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>15 - If the regulator makes proposals, those proposals only have effect if they are agreed by each of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s secured creditors, as far as the regulator is able to locate after making reasonable enquiries. The HRA further provides for proposals to include the appointment of a manager by the regulator. The powers which may be conferred upon the manager are set out in the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>.</p>

<p>16 - The regulator has the power under section 158 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> to give financial or other assistance to a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> for the purpose of preserving its position pending the agreement of proposals, or to a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> or an appointed manager to facilitate the implementation of agreed proposals. Certain forms of financial assistance require the prior consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>“Early warning” and Notification</h2>

<p>17 - As described above, the relevant provisions of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> are triggered when a “notice” is given to the regulator of at least one of the steps set out in section 145 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>. The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> includes no requirement to provide formal early warning of the issue of such a notice to the regulator. However, the regulator as part of the co-regulatory approach expects transparency on the part of <abbr title="private registered providers">PRPs</abbr> and for them to communicate with the regulator in a timely manner in relation to material issues such as serious emerging financial difficulties.</p>

<p>18 - On receipt of an early warning, or notice, the regulator will contact the relevant parties to gain an understanding of the problem. The regulator is likely to seek an urgent meeting with the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> to explore options for resolving the problem. The action to be taken will depend on the circumstances of the case, and may include use of another of the regulator’s statutory powers, such as (but not limited to) the power to make appointments to the governing body of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>.</p>

<p>At this stage it may also be necessary for the regulator and/or the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> to commission an independent accountant’s review of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s financial position. The regulator will use reasonable endeavours to keep the party who gave the notice appropriately informed throughout the period of its discussions with the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> and, in particular, will advise that party as soon as practicable if resolution does not appear to be possible.</p>

<h2>The moratorium</h2>

<p>19 - The initial moratorium on disposal of land by the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> lasts up to 28 calendar days beginning with the day on which the notice under section 145 is given. Once the moratorium is in place, the taking of a further step by another party would not start a new moratorium period. Section 146 makes provision for the regulator to extend (or further extend) the moratorium with the consent of the secured creditors. The regulator may consider requesting consent to extend a moratorium where appropriate, and in particular (but without limitation) where it considers that it may be able to make acceptable proposals under section 152 about the future ownership and management of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s land, but requires more time to finalise those proposals.</p>

<p>20 - Section 146 makes provision for the regulator to cancel a moratorium if it is satisfied that it is not necessary to make proposals under section 152. In some cases, the problem may prove capable of being resolved without the need to produce a formal proposal. An example might be where the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> arranges a partnership deal with another financially strong <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>. In that scenario the regulator would assess the proposal, including the capability and capacity of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> for continued ownership and management of the land, and, if it is satisfied that this is the most appropriate course, cancel the moratorium.</p>

<p>21 - It is possible that, despite the efforts of the regulator and other stakeholders, the problems which first gave rise to the moratorium cannot be resolved within a moratorium period or at all. Alternatively, proposals put together by the regulator might not be agreed by the secured creditors. In such cases, the regulator is likely to convey its conclusions on this point, including the reasons why proposals are not being pursued, to the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> and to its secured creditors.</p>

<p>Creditors will then be free to take alternative action as they see fit (as will the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> itself), as long as no Housing Administration Order or liquidation process is in force. It should be noted that where a moratorium ends without any proposals being agreed, the taking of a further step within the next three years will not automatically trigger another moratorium without a decision to impose a moratorium by the regulator and the consent of such secured creditors as can be located after reasonable enquiries (section 147).</p>

<h2>Effect of a moratorium</h2>

<p>22 - During a moratorium, the regulator’s prior consent is required under section 148 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> to a disposal of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s land, clarified in the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> to include disposal of a present or future interest in rent or other receipts arising from the land. Section 149 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> outlines some exceptions where consent is not required, mainly covering specific types of lettings, ‘right to buy’ and ‘right to acquire’. Homes England and the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> are prevented under section 148 from giving the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> a Direction in relation to recovery of social housing grant or enforcing any such Direction previously given, during a moratorium.</p>

<p>23 - Section 150 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> makes it clear that a purported disposal without consent is void (unless it is of a single dwelling and the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> believes that the buyer intends to use the property as the buyer’s principal residence).</p>

<p>24 - As a general rule, the regulator considers it inappropriate for disposals to be made during a moratorium. However, the regulator will consider each request for disposal on its merits, and may consent where it believes that it is reasonable to do so. A possible situation where the regulator might consent would be where a disposal would appear to be likely to stabilise or improve the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s financial position, thus giving time to facilitate the development of proposals for an overall solution. The regulator would have regard to the position of secured creditors and creditors in general before providing any consent. Any such consent may be given subject to conditions which would be dictated by the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

<h2>Interim manager</h2>

<p>25 - Section 151 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> gives the regulator the power to appoint an interim manager of a registered provider during a moratorium. An appointment may relate to a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s affairs generally or to specific affairs, and the terms and conditions of the appointment will be specified. An appointment lasts until the earliest of: the end of the moratorium or the agreement of proposals made by the regulator, or a date specified in the appointment.</p>

<p>An interim manager may be given wide-ranging powers in relation to the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s affairs, but the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> forbids an interim manager from disposing of land or granting security over land. There is no provision in the HRA for meeting the costs of an interim manager. The regulator anticipates that those costs will be met by the provider, but in cases where this is clearly not possible the regulator may consider underwriting the costs of an interim manager in whole or in part.</p>

<p>26 - The regulator envisages appointing an interim manager in most cases where the moratorium is triggered. An interim manager can assist in the management of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s affairs and maintenance of services to tenants on an interim basis. The skills and expertise required of the interim manager and the powers conveyed in the appointment will be determined by the circumstances in each case.</p>

<p>regulator anticipates that in most cases an interim manager will be a senior housing executive, a professionally qualified person, or an insolvency practitioner. In most cases, the regulator expects to give an interim manager full executive powers over the provider’s affairs, although this will depend on an assessment of the skills and expertise already available to the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>. The regulator will take into account the views expressed by a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s secured creditors before making an appointment.</p>

<p>27 - When it receives a notice under section 145, the regulator will make an early assessment of the capacity and willingness of the registered provider’s governing body to oversee its affairs during a moratorium and may consider taking steps to strengthen the governing body. This may be by way of making statutory appointments under section 269 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> (see separate guidance on such appointments).</p>

<h2>Making proposals</h2>

<p>28 - Section 152 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> permits the regulator to make proposals about the future ownership and management of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s land with a view to ensuring that the property will be properly managed by a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>. The regulator must have regard to the interests of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s creditors as a whole and, so far as is reasonably practicable, avoid worsening the position of unsecured creditors. Section 152 also makes provision for protecting the status quo in respect of preferential creditors.</p>

<p>Proposals may provide for the appointment of a manager under section 155 to implement all or part of the proposals (see paragraphs 29 to 33). Where the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> is a charity, the regulator’s proposals will not require the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> to act outside the terms of its trusts and will only provide for disposal of accommodation to another charity with similar objects.</p>

<p>29 - In drawing up proposals, the regulator will have regard to the interests of all stakeholders. It is not possible to outline in advance the precise form that proposals will take in a particular situation. The particular circumstances of each case will determine the regulator’s strategy. The regulator will dedicate resources throughout the moratorium period in seeking to devise a rescue plan.</p>

<p>Meetings will normally be arranged with the provider itself and its secured creditors. Under section 153 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>, before making proposals, the regulator must consult with the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> and (so far as is reasonably practicable) its tenants, and with the Financial Conduct Authority or the Charity Commission, as appropriate.</p>

<p>30 - If the regulator makes proposals, it must, under section 153, send a copy of those proposals to the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> and its officers, such of the secured creditors as the regulator is able to locate after making reasonable enquiries, and to any appointed insolvency office holder. The regulator expects to be able to agree a list of secured creditors with the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> at an early stage and may take legal advice as appropriate to determine which creditors might be deemed to have secured status.</p>

<p>The regulator must also make arrangements to bring proposals to the attention of the provider’s members, its tenants, and its unsecured creditors. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulatory-standards">Governance and Financial Viability Standard</a> requires <abbr title="private registered providers">PRPs</abbr> to maintain a thorough, accurate and up-to-date record of their assets and liabilities and particularly those liabilities that may have recourse to social housing assets.</p>

<p>31 - Proposals can only be taken forward for implementation if they have been agreed by all of the identified secured creditors. The regulator expects that, through its prior engagement with the secured creditors, it will know what proposals are likely to be acceptable. Section 153 makes provision for modifications to be incorporated in the proposals in order to reach agreement.</p>

<p>32 - If proposals are agreed, the regulator must send a copy of those proposals to the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> and its officers, the secured creditors, any appointed insolvency office holder, and the Financial Conduct Authority or the Charity Commission as appropriate. The regulator must also make arrangements to inform the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s members, its tenants, and its unsecured creditors. Any subsequent amendments to proposals must follow the same process as that for the original proposals.</p>

<p>33 - In most cases, the regulator’s objective in drawing up proposals is likely to be to seek to avoid the formal insolvency of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>, while recognising that it may be difficult to satisfy the competing interests of all stakeholders, and that the regulator has a wide range of obligations pursuant to its statutory objectives. The regulator will seek to ensure that any proposals do not cause a conflict of duties for any appointed insolvency holder.</p>

<p>Preserving the independence of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> will not usually be a primary consideration. In many cases where a moratorium is in place, other <abbr title="private registered providers">PRPs</abbr> are likely to be able to assist with a solution. The regulator may hold discussions with such other providers as it believes may have the capacity and capability to provide the necessary assistance.</p>

<h2>Effect of agreed proposals</h2>

<p>34 - Under section 154 of the HRA the regulator, the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>, its creditors, and any appointed insolvency office holder must implement agreed proposals. The directors, committee members, or trustees of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> are required to co-operate with the implementation of agreed proposals, with the proviso that they are not required or permitted to commit a breach of a fiduciary or other duty to the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>. The regulator may take enforcement action through the courts against any persons who do not comply with their obligations in respect of agreed proposals.</p>

<h2>Appointment of manager and related powers</h2>

<p>35 - Section 155 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> enables the regulator to appoint a manager where agreed proposals make provision for such appointment, and for the payment of the manager’s reasonable remuneration and expenses. This is a separate power from the power to appoint an interim manager of a registered provider during a moratorium.</p>

<p>The regulator may give the manager general or specific directions. If the provider is a charity, the regulator must notify the Charity Commission that a manager has been appointed. Section 156 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> lays down a non-exhaustive list of powers which may be conferred on the manager.</p>

<p>In general, these powers enable a manager to carry on the business of the provider while proposals are implemented. They include a power to appoint a solicitor, accountant or other professional to assist the manager. A manager must, so far as is reasonably practicable, consult and inform the provider’s tenants about an exercise of powers likely to affect them.</p>

<p>36 - The regulator considers that the appointment of a manager is likely to be necessary in most cases in which proposals are agreed, but will look at each case on its merits. The appointment details and the identity of the manager will be included in the agreed proposals. The skills and expertise required of the manager and the powers conveyed in the appointment will be determined by the circumstances in each case.</p>

<p>The regulator anticipates that in most cases a manager will be an experienced senior housing executive, an experienced professional person, or an experienced insolvency practitioner. The manager may be the same person who acted as interim manager during the moratorium. The proposal will make provision for the payment of the manager’s remuneration and expenses.</p>

<p>37 - Section 157 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> gives the manager additional powers where the registered provider is a Registered Society (as defined by the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014). Under this provision, the appointment of a manager may confer on the manager power to take the legal steps necessary to amalgamate the society with another Registered Society or to transfer its engagements.</p>

<p>38 - The regulator believes that the power to amalgamate or transfer engagements is an effective power which is likely to be useful in the management of an insolvency situation. This is because any recipient registered provider would be chosen for its capacity and capability to resolve the problems. Such a proposal would be likely to be included so as to increase the likelihood that properties would be properly managed by a registered provider (as required under section 152), while the interests of tenants, public funding, and creditors would be protected.</p>

<p>39 - The regulator would expect a manager to act expeditiously to ensure implementation of agreed proposals and to work closely with all interested parties to achieve this objective. A manager may apply to the High Court for directions in relation to his or her actions, and High Court directions would overrule any directions given by the regulator on the same matter. The regulator would expect a manager to exercise the duty to consult or inform tenants where any actions are likely to affect their continuing rights, their rents, or the level of services being provided.</p>

<h2>Assistance by the regulator</h2>

<p>40 - Section 158 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> permits the regulator to give financial or other assistance to a registered provider for the purpose of preserving its position pending the agreement of proposals, or to a registered provider or a manager to facilitate the implementation of agreed proposals. In particular, the regulator may lend staff and may arrange for payment of the manager’s remuneration and expenses. The regulator’s power to provide financial assistance is restricted by the need to obtain the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> to make grants or loans, to indemnify a manager, to make payments in connection with secured loans, or to guarantee payments in connection with secured loans.</p>

<p>41 - The regulator expects agreed proposals to make provision for the payment of a manager’s remuneration and expenses, but, in the unlikely event that without such provision a proposal would otherwise fail to be agreed, the regulator would consider underwriting the costs of a manager. The regulator does not expect to seek the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> to other forms of financial assistance as, generally speaking, to do so would mean public funds being employed to protect the commercial risks of existing creditors.</p>

<p>The regulator believes that there may be exceptional circumstances, as for example, where an additional line of temporary credit is needed during a moratorium, in which it might be necessary for the regulator to consider whether an approach to the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> for these purposes is warranted.</p>

<h2>Applications to the court</h2>

<p>42 - Once they are agreed, proposals are binding on the relevant parties as noted in paragraph 33. Section 159 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> makes provision for the registered provider or a creditor of the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> to make application to the High Court where they think that action by a manager is not in accordance with the agreed proposals. It also allows any party bound by the proposals to make application to the High Court where it thinks that action by another bound party is in breach of the obligation to implement agreed proposals.</p>

<h2>What the regulator expects from the provider</h2>

<p>43 - The regulator expects the registered provider (including its officers and its directors, board members, committee members and/or trustees) affected by a moratorium triggered under section 145 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify the regulator immediately where the provider identifies a potential problem with, or threat to, its viability, for whatever reason</li>
  <li>notify the regulator immediately where it has reason to believe that a notice under section 145 is likely to be served</li>
  <li>take legal and financial advice as to its trading position and duties under the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> and under insolvency legislation, to include specific advice to the provider’s officers and its directors, board members, committee members and/or trustees</li>
  <li>provide up-to-date details to the regulator of the provider’s officers and its directors, board members, committee members or trustees</li>
  <li>provide such information and assistance as the regulator requires in order to identify all the secured creditors of the provider</li>
  <li>provide details to the regulator of any insolvency office holder appointed in respect of the provider’s affairs</li>
  <li>supply relevant details, to be agreed with the regulator, to enable the regulator to bring information to the attention of the provider’s members, its tenants and its unsecured creditors</li>
  <li>co-operate with any interim manager appointed by the regulator, and provide facilities and information to assist the interim manager to discharge his or her specified duties</li>
  <li>supply relevant details, to be agreed with the regulator, to enable the regulator to bring information to the attention of the provider’s members, its tenants and its unsecured creditors</li>
  <li>co-operate with any manager appointed by the regulator, and provide facilities and information to assist the manager to discharge his or her specified duties</li>
  <li>provide such information as the regulator requests, and access to relevant books and records, to enable an assessment of the provider’s financial (and where relevant governance) position to be undertaken</li>
  <li>co-operate fully with the regulator, and provide such support as the regulator requires, in the development of proposals for the future ownership and management of the provider’s land</li>
  <li>co-operate fully with the regulator in its use of any other regulatory powers during the period of a moratorium</li>
  <li>co-ordinate a communications strategy on all matters relating to the use of these powers with the regulator, and ensure that no public statements are made without the regulator’s prior agreement, and</li>
  <li>implement proposals agreed between the regulator and the secured creditors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Consultation</h2>

<p>44 - The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> requires the regulator, in exercising its moratorium powers, to consult relevant persons at certain stages and also to notify other identified persons. The regulator also recognises that regard may have to be had to a number of legitimate interests and that it may be appropriate to consult or inform stakeholders accordingly. The regulator will consider what is appropriate in each specific case, but consultees may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>secured creditors – any proposals made by the regulator under section 152 can only be implemented with the agreement of the secured creditors (see also paragraphs 28 and 29). The regulator will usually endeavour to work closely with the secured creditors throughout the process set out in the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>. The regulator will hold an early meeting with the provider and its secured creditors to agree an action plan, which will include a communications strategy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tenants – the regulator recognises that any situation where moratorium powers are triggered could cause anxiety for tenants and leaseholders, and the regulator will take reasonable steps to mitigate that anxiety where possible. The regulator will ensure that it complies with the legal requirements for consulting and informing tenants, and will monitor any manager’s compliance with such rules. The nature of any consultation will depend on the circumstances of the case and the timescales involved. It will not be practicable in some situations to make direct contact with each individual tenant. The regulator may use various techniques and media to consult and inform tenants including where appropriate, liaison with recognised tenant representative groups, appointment of a tenant adviser, telephone help-lines, advertisements in local newspapers, making information available online and tenant meetings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the registered provider – the regulator is required to consult with and inform the provider in some circumstances. The provider (including its officers and its directors, committee members or trustees) and its senior staff are likely to be involved fully from the outset. The regulator’s expectations of the provider are outlined in paragraph 42.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any insolvency office holder – the regulator recognises that, in certain situations, an insolvency office holder could also be appointed in respect of the provider or its land. It will usually be appropriate for the regulator to support the person appointed in the performance of his or her duties, and the regulator would endeavour to hold an early meeting with the insolvency office holder to make appropriate arrangements for communication. In cases where an insolvency office holder is in place, and the regulator wishes to appoint an interim manager, the regulator will consider, in discussion with the relevant parties, whether it would be appropriate to appoint the insolvency office holder as the interim manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unsecured creditors – the regulator must make arrangements for bringing proposals (both before and after their agreement) to the attention of any unsecured creditors. The regulator will require the provider to provide a list of unsecured creditors for this purpose. If, for any reason, it is not possible to obtain contact details for all unsecured creditors, the regulator will make arrangements for advertising the proposals in an appropriate publication such as the London Gazette.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other regulators – the regulator is obliged to consult and inform the Financial Conduct Authority and the Charity Commission, as appropriate. In addition to its formal obligations, the regulator will keep these two bodies, as well as the Registrar of Companies (where the provider is a registered company), informed of the ongoing situation during a moratorium as regularly as is appropriate and practicable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>local authorities – the regulator recognises that local authorities in whose areas a registered provider operates may have various levels of interest in the provider’s affairs. Where a local authority is a secured creditor its position is the same as other secured creditors as outlined above. In other situations, the regulator does not have a legal duty to consult or inform local authorities, but the regulator will endeavour to keep local authorities informed as appropriate to the particular circumstances of each case</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>central government – the regulator will keep relevant persons at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (<abbr title="Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government">MHCLG</abbr>) informed at relevant stages in the exercise of these powers and will agree with <abbr title="Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government">MHCLG</abbr> on a case by case basis which other government departments should also be kept informed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cross border regulators – where the regulator’s insolvency power is triggered in respect of a registered provider which undertakes business activities or has operating subsidiaries in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland the regulator will notify the Scottish Housing Regulator, the Welsh Assembly Government, and/or the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, as appropriate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Direction to Homes England</h2>

<p>45 - Under section 100G the regulator can direct the Homes and Communities Agency, which now refers to itself as Homes England, not to provide financial assistance to a specified registered provider. In circumstances where it has received notice under section 145, the regulator will consider whether to make such a direction to Homes England. The circumstances of each case will be different and the regulator will be mindful of its objective of protecting public funds.</p>

<p>However, as a general rule the regulator will not generally make a direction to Homes England where to do so might worsen the financial position of the provider, thus hastening the onset of insolvency. At the outset of a moratorium the regulator will endeavour to meet with Homes England to gain a full and detailed understanding of the position of the provider in respect of existing and proposed Homes England financial assistance, and to ensure that Homes England is aware of the circumstances of the case.</p>

<h2>Direction to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>46 - Under the Greater London Authority Act 1999 section 333ZG, the regulator can direct the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> not to provide financial assistance in connection with social housing to a specified registered provider. In circumstances where it has received notice under section 145, the regulator will consider whether to make such a Direction to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>. The circumstances of each case will be different and the regulator will be mindful of its objective of protecting public funds.</p>

<p>47 - However, as a general rule, the regulator will not give a Direction to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> where to do so would worsen the financial position of the provider, thus hastening the onset of insolvency.</p>

<p>48 - At the outset of a moratorium relating to a provider owning land in Greater London, the regulator will endeavour to meet with the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> to gain a full and detailed understanding of the position of the provider in respect of existing and proposed <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> financial assistance, and to ensure that the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> is aware of the circumstances of the case. Further advice about the regulator’s approach to the use of this power is set out in the relevant guidance note.</p>

<h2>Part (c): Housing Administration</h2>

<p>49 - The <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 introduced a Housing Administration regime for <abbr title="private registered providers">PRPs</abbr> of social housing.</p>

<p>50 - The new Housing Administration regime enables the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> or the regulator (with the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>) to apply to court for an Order appointing licensed insolvency practitioners to act as Housing Administrators of a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>.</p>

<p>51 - Section 145 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> requires notice to be given to the regulator of intended insolvency or enforcement steps which are proposed by creditors, the provider or other stakeholders under certain provisions of the <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016. This triggers a moratorium as set out in paragraph 10 of the introduction to the guidance, during which the regulator may work with the affected parties to try and agree a rescue scheme with the registered providers secured creditors (within the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> moratorium regime) and/or whether to apply for a Housing Administration Order. It is also open to the regulator to decide not to take any action, in which case the insolvency or enforcement steps which are proposed by creditors, the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> or other stakeholders will proceed in accordance with the relevant process.</p>

<p>52 - Housing Administration, similarly to an Ordinary Administration, permits arrangements to be put in place to allow a provider to continue operating until it is either rescued as a going concern, sold, or its assets transferred to other providers or third parties. The second objective is to maintain social housing in the regulated sector as far as possible. Additionally, the regulator’s objectives are to maintain continuity of provision of social housing and maintain the attractiveness of the sector to current and future investors.</p>

<h2>The circumstances in which the power can be exercised and the regulator’s approach to applying to court for a Housing Administration Order</h2>

<p>53 - Section 99 of the <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 sets out that an application to the court for a Housing Administration may be made either by the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> or regulator, with the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>’s consent. The <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 does not prescribe the circumstances under which the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> or the regulator may apply to the court for a Housing Administration Order but Section 100 of the <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 sets out that the court may only make a Housing Administration Order in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>54 - The regulator will consider each case on its precise facts, and decide the most appropriate course accordingly, but it envisages it may make an application for a Housing Administration Order in circumstances:</p>

<p>i) where it appears to the regulator that it is likely the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> will be unable to pay its debts, and that Housing Administration offers an appropriate route to achieving the regulator’s objectives; or</p>

<p>ii). the regulator has been notified of a “step” towards insolvency under section 145 of the HRA, and the regulator considers that:</p>

<p>a. there is a significant risk that it will not be possible to agree acceptable proposals via the moratorium process; and/or</p>

<p>b. a better outcome is unlikely to be achieved via a normal administration (if available).</p>

<h2>Regulator’s approach to applications from creditors for Ordinary Administration</h2>

<p>55 - Section 106 of the <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 sets out that the regulator must be given at least 28 days’ notice of an application by a third party for an Ordinary Administration Order. This triggers a moratorium under section 145 of the HRA. During that period, the regulator will decide whether to make proposals under the HRA moratorium power, apply for a Housing Administration Order, or allow the Ordinary Administration to proceed. In line with the principles set out previously, the regulator will normally seek to resolve the situation through making proposals within a moratorium, unless it considers that Housing Administration offers a better chance of satisfactory resolution in line with the regulator’s objectives.</p>

<h2>Appointment of a Housing Administrator</h2>

<p>56 - The documents supporting an application to court for a Housing Administration Order will identify the proposed Housing Administrator. The legislation requires that a person is not to be the Housing Administrator of a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> unless they are qualified to act as an insolvency practitioner in relation to the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>. In an application by the regulator, the regulator will decide who to propose for the role on the basis of a transparent process which includes consideration of experience and expertise in relation to <abbr title="private registered providers">PRPs</abbr> and special administration regimes.</p>

<p>In circumstances where the <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> has already engaged an insolvency practitioner to support it in resolving its problems, the regulator will consider whether to put forward that person for appointment as Housing Administrator. In all cases the proposed Housing Administrator will be a qualified insolvency practitioner and will, as soon as is practical, publish a notice of appointment which must be gazetted and may be advertised in such other manner as the Housing Administrator thinks fit.</p>

<p>57 - Following publication of the notice the administrator must deliver the notice to the appointed persons named in the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr></p>

<h2>Objectives of the Housing Administrator</h2>

<p>58 Once appointed the Housing Administrator has two statutory objectives:</p>

<h3>Objective 1</h3>

<ul>
  <li>rescue the registered provider as a going concern, or</li>
  <li>achieve a better result for the registered provider’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the registered provider were wound up (without first being in Housing Administration), or</li>
  <li>realise property in order to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (<abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016, s 97(1)).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Objective 2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that the registered provider’s social housing remains in the regulated housing sector (i.e. owned by a registered provider) (<abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016, s 98).</li>
</ul>

<p>59 - While the Housing Administrator must work towards achieving both objectives, as with a normal administration, Objective 1 takes priority over Objective 2. They must also aim to achieve these objectives as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

<h2>Additional powers for the Secretary of State</h2>

<p>60 - Where a Housing Administration Order has been made, the Secretary of State (<abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>) has a number of new powers available under sections 109 to 113 <abbr title="Housing and Planning Act">HPA</abbr> 2016 to support the achievement of the objectives of the administration which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making grants or loans to the registered provider</li>
  <li>to provide indemnities in respect of liabilities incurred or loss or damage sustained in connection with the Housing Administrator carrying out their function and</li>
  <li>to provide guarantees in respect of financial obligations of the registered provider.</li>
</ul>

<h2>End of administration</h2>

<p>61 - The <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>, or (with the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr>) the regulator or the Housing Administrator can make an application to court to end the Housing Administration.</p>
