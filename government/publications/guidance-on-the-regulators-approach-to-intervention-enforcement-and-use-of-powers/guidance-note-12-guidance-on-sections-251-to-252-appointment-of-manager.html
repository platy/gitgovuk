<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power of appointment of a manager. This is an enforcement power and is set out in Part 2 Chapter 7 sections 251 to 252 of the 2008 Act.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - The power may be exercised in relation to non-profit registered providers and for-profit registered providers. It may not be exercised in relation to a local authority provider.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>3 - A provider is responsible for ensuring that it manages itself in accordance with any applicable legal requirements, meets the standards set by the regulator, and engages positively with the regulator’s regulatory framework. In some circumstances it may be necessary to appoint a manager to a provider.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>4 - The <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 sets out three specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise this power. These are:</p>

<p>4.1. where the registered provider has failed to meet a standard</p>

<p>4.2. where the affairs of the registered provider have been mismanaged in relation to social housing – “mismanagement” in relation to the affairs of a registered provider is defined in section 275 of the <abbr title="Housing Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 as managed in breach of any legal requirements (imposed by or under an act or otherwise)</p>

<p>4.3. where the registered provider has failed to comply with relevant provisions of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 or with regulations made by the SoS under the <abbr title="Western Riverside Waste Authority">WRWA</abbr>.</p>

<p>5 - The regulator is most likely to exercise the power in circumstances where there has been a failure to meet a standard or the affairs of the provider have been mismanaged and the regulator considers that the provider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is facing critical financial viability problems that require urgent action to remedy and/or</li>
  <li>is failing to adequately address serious deficiencies in the delivery of services where there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been or there is a risk of serious detriment to some or all of a provider’s tenants.</li>
</ul>

<p>6 - Key factors in a decision to appoint a manager will include the regulator’s assessment of the seriousness of the problem, the need for additional professional support, and the provider’s willingness and ability to take effective action without the need for the regulator to use this power.</p>

<h2>Appointment process</h2>

<p>7 - Before making an appointment, the regulator will give the provider a warning notice. This notice will explain that the regulator is considering exercising this power, set out the grounds on which that action is proposed and explain its effects. The warning notice will specify a period during which the provider may make representations to the regulator. That period will commence on the date the registered provider receives the notice and will be for no less than 28 days. The regulator will normally send such notices by recorded delivery and will work on the basis that the documents are received by the provider the day after they are sent.</p>

<p>8 - The warning notice will indicate whether or to what extent the regulator would accept a voluntary undertaking instead of, or in mitigation of, the appointment of a manager.</p>

<p>9 - The regulator will send a copy of the warning notice to Homes England and additionally the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> where it relates to a provider owning property in Greater London and any other persons the regulator thinks appropriate, in particular any person who provided information as a result of which the warning notice is issued.</p>

<h2>Terms of appointment</h2>

<p>10 - The regulator will normally require the registered provider to appoint the manager. In exceptional cases, for example where it has serious concerns about the performance of the governing body, the regulator may appoint the manager itself.</p>

<p>11 - Managers will be individuals, rather than corporate bodies, although the individual may work for a corporate body. The individual will be selected by the regulator on the basis of relevant professional experience. The appointment may relate to the provider’s affairs generally in regard to social housing or in relation to a specific aspect of social housing.</p>

<p>12 - The manager’s terms and conditions (including remuneration, which will be paid by the provider) will be specified by the regulator and included in the notice of appointment. In setting the remuneration level, the regulator will have regard to market rates for the specified work and the financial circumstances of the provider.</p>

<p>13 - The manager will have any power specified in the notice of appointment and any other additional power he or she requires to achieve the purposes of the appointment. Where the manager considers that additional powers are required he or she will discuss and agree these with the regulator.</p>

<p>14 - The regulator may require the manager to report to it on the affairs specified in the appointment notice.</p>

<h2>Notification to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> and Homes England</h2>

<p>15 - When a manager is appointed, the regulator will notify the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> where the appointment relates to a provider owning property in Greater London. Under s252, the regulator will also notify Homes England of an appointment or requirement under section 251(2).</p>

<h2>Appeal</h2>

<p>16 - The regulator has developed a protocol which allows a provider to appeal against its decision on the use of some enforcement powers. In addition, a provider may appeal to the High Court against the appointment of a manager or a requirement to appoint.</p>
