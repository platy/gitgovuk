<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the powers on inquiry and extraordinary audit. These are regulatory powers and are set out in Chapter 6 and sections 206 to 209 and section 210 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>. They may be exercised in relation to all registered providers, subject to the exceptions applying to Las and for-profit providers that are set out in the section headed “scope” below.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - These powers may be exercised in relation to all providers including a non-profit <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>, a for-profit <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> (in relation to its social housing) and a local authority provider (in relation to its social housing).</p>

<p>3 - An extraordinary audit of the accounts and balance sheet of a local authority provider may only cover the extent to which they relate to the provision of social housing.</p>

<p>4 - These powers may be exercised in relation to a registered charity only if the charity has received public assistance. The term “public assistance” is defined in section 274 of the Act, but in summary, it means that the registered charity must have received certain specified loans or grants from public sources or had property transferred to it by a local authority. An inquiry into a registered charity may only relate to its social housing activities. An extraordinary audit of the revenue accounts of a registered charity may only cover the extent to which they relate to its social housing activities. If an inquiry is held into a registered charity, the regulator will notify the Charity Commission in accordance with section 209 of the Act.</p>

<p>5 - During the course of an inquiry, the inquirer may consider the affairs of a body which at the relevant time was a subsidiary or associate of a registered provider. The terms “subsidiary” and “associate” are defined in section 271 of the Act, but in summary, they include any organisation falling within the meaning of “subsidiary” in either the Companies Act 2006 or the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014; any organisation where the provider has the power to appoint or remove all or a majority of the board of directors; or any organisation where the provider holds more than half in nominal value of the company’s equity share capital.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the powers</h2>

<p>6 - The registered provider is responsible for ensuring that the organisation is properly governed, is viable, and achieves the standards set by the regulator. In circumstances where the affairs of a registered provider may have been mismanaged, it may be necessary for the regulator to step in and use the power to hold an inquiry. An extraordinary audit may be required as part of an inquiry. The regulator will commission the inquiry and appoint one or more inquirers. Although the regulator must appoint one or more independent persons to conduct the inquiry, the inquiry is conducted on behalf of the regulator, with the inquirer(s) presenting findings on matters specified by the regulator, which may include making recommendations. The report of a statutory inquiry will be considered by the regulator, which will decide on any action that may need to be taken, including the possible use of any of its powers.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>7 - Sections 206 to 209 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> specifies that the regulator may hold an inquiry if it suspects that the affairs of a registered provider may have been mismanaged. The term “mismanaged” in relation to the affairs of a provider is defined in section 275 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>.</p>

<p>8 - The regulator is most likely to exercise the power to hold an inquiry in circumstances where it suspects mismanagement, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there may have been a failure against one or more economic standards</li>
  <li>there may have been a failure against one or more consumer standards where there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been or there is a risk of a serious detriment to tenants</li>
  <li>the registered provider may have failed to honour its commitments set out in a voluntary undertaking</li>
  <li>the registered provider may have failed to comply with an Order or Direction made by the regulator or to resolve problems that led to previous regulatory interventions</li>
  <li>the registered provider may have been involved in activities that might endanger the security or interests of tenants or put the social housing funds or assets of the provider at risk</li>
  <li>the registered provider may have been involved in the misuse or misapplication of public, charitable or other assets or funds</li>
  <li>there may have been a failure to operate within the registered providers constitution, governing instrument or standing orders, which has been detrimental to the provider, its tenants or its operations</li>
  <li>the registered provider may have knowingly given false information to the regulator or to other organisations</li>
  <li>the registered provider may have been involved in persistent unlawful discrimination or other breaches of legislation</li>
  <li>the registered provider may have been involved in unlawful or unacceptable conflicts of interest, including breaches of charity law</li>
  <li>the shareholding membership of a non-profit private provider may have failed to act in the best interests of the provider or of its tenants.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list and the regulator may conclude that it is necessary to exercise the power in other circumstances to those set out above.</p>

<p>9 - The regulator is most likely to exercise the power to hold an extraordinary audit in circumstances where it considers that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there may have been a material mis-statement in the accounts</li>
  <li>the accounts have been qualified</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>’s solvency is in doubt</li>
  <li>there may have been a fraud</li>
  <li>auditors have raised matters of serious concern, for example in their management letter</li>
</ul>

<h2>The powers</h2>

<h3>Who can conduct an inquiry?</h3>

<p>10 - An inquirer must be independent of the regulator. An inquirer is deemed to be independent in circumstances where they and the members of their family:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are not members, employees or consultants of the regulator</li>
  <li>have not been members or employees of the regulator within the previous five years.</li>
</ul>

<p>11 - The term “consultant” is defined in section 206 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> as an individual providing a service to the regulator otherwise than by virtue of employment with the regulator or an appointment as an inquirer. For the avoidance of doubt, the regulator takes this to mean that an individual consultant who is providing services to the regulator when the regulator decides to hold an inquiry cannot be appointed as an inquirer; however an individual consultant who has provided services to the regulator previously and who has completed the work associated with that commission may be appointed as an inquirer.</p>

<p>12 - The regulator will appoint an inquirer on the basis of the skills and experience required in the circumstances of each individual case.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>13 - The process for an inquiry is set out in detail below.</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>14 - The regulator will meet the cost of the inquiry on terms to be agreed with the inquirer. Section 207 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> specifies that a local authority may contribute to the cost of any inquiry should it wish to do so.</p>

<h2>Extraordinary audit</h2>
<p>15 - Section 210 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> specifies that where an inquiry is being held, or has been held, the regulator may require the registered provider to allow its accounts and balance sheet to be audited by a qualified auditor appointed by the regulator.</p>

<h3>Who can conduct an extraordinary audit?</h3>

<p>16 - The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> defines the term “qualified auditor” as a person eligible for appointment as auditor of the provider’s ordinary accounts. The regulator will ensure that the auditor is qualified for the intended purpose of the extraordinary audit.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>17 - The auditor will be appointed and briefed by the regulator. The provider subject to the inquiry, and others, will be notified in the same way as for an inquiry. See sections of this guidance headed appointing an inquirer, briefing an inquirer and notification of an inquiry. The regulator will determine the matters to be audited during the extraordinary audit and the form of the report and will agree a work plan, timetable and costs of the extraordinary audit with the auditor. On completion of the extraordinary audit, the auditor will report to the regulator on such matters and in such form as determined by the regulator.</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>18 - The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> specifies that the provider subject to the inquiry must pay the costs of the extraordinary audit including the auditor’s remuneration (section 210 (5)).</p>

<h2>Appointing an inquirer</h2>

<p>19 - Before appointing an inquirer, the regulator will seek proposals from the prospective inquirer in relation to the possible methodology, likely time input and fees, overall timetable as well as estimated cost. The prospective inquirer will be asked to identify any additional support that is needed to facilitate the inquiry including professional services. The regulator will consider the prospective inquirer’s proposals and will direct the parameters for the inquiry, including the proposed methodology; the likely time input by the inquirer; the likely time input by other professional services; spending limits for specific items; overall timetable; overall budget; format, content and frequency of reports.</p>

<p>20 - The regulator will appoint one or more individuals as inquirers, and they will conduct the inquiry. The regulator will ensure that the inquiry has access to all the skills necessary to meet the inquiry brief, including, where appropriate, specialists such as lawyers or forensic auditors. The regulator and the inquirer will consider the most appropriate method of procuring the services of such individuals: they may be appointed as an additional inquirer; alternatively the inquiry may choose to buy in their services.</p>

<p>Where the inquiry buys in services, the persons providing the service will not be an inquirer, but will undertake work for and on behalf of the inquiry under the direction of the inquirer. In all such cases, the regulator will approve the terms under which such individuals are appointed, including fee levels and the budget for the work to be undertaken. The regulator will ensure that the inquirer, and persons or organisations providing services to the inquiry do not have any actual or potential conflicts of interest which might be prejudicial to their involvement. The regulator may appoint an additional inquirer during the course of an inquiry if it is necessary to do so.</p>

<p>21 - The regulator will nominate a named member of staff to commission the inquiry on its behalf and to fulfil the client role to the inquiry. The regulator will also nominate a named member or members of staff as the main point or points of contact between the regulator and the inquirers, and, where necessary, between the regulator and the provider during the course of the inquiry. The regulator may also provide administrative support or other facilities to the inquiry. Where such support is in place, the member of staff providing it will not be the same person as one of the nominated points of contact.</p>

<h2>The inquiry</h2>

<p>22 - An inquirer is independent of the regulator, but conducts the inquiry on behalf of the regulator. The inquirer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shall determine the procedure for an inquiry</li>
  <li>may make interim reports</li>
  <li>shall make a final report on matters specified by the regulator.</li>
</ul>

<p>23 - Section 208 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> sets out the powers of an inquirer in relation to evidence. In summary, these are:
• to require a person to provide specified documents or information. The regulator would expect a registered provider, or its agents, to produce information and documents when requested to do so by the inquirer. The inquirer may by notice require the information and documents to be produced. The notice will specify the document or information required, the form and manner in which the document is to be provided and when and where the document or information is to be provided. This power applies to the documents and information set out under sections 107 and 108 of the Act, and a failure to comply with such a requirement is subject to the same sanctions that are available under those sections. Further advice and guidance about the regulator’s approach to this power is set out in the relevant guidance note.
* such a notice might require evidence to be given on oath and the inquirer may administer oaths for that purpose.
* to take evidence on oath.
* serve a notice on an appropriate person directing him or her to attend the inquiry at a specified time and place in order to give evidence or produce specified documents in their control or custody that are relevant to the inquiry.</p>

<h2>The inquiry brief</h2>

<p>24 - The regulator will draft the brief for the inquiry. The contents will vary depending on the circumstances of the case. This is not an exhaustive list, but the brief will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the regulator’s powers</li>
  <li>the inquirer’s powers, responsibilities and duties</li>
  <li>the general approach to the conduct of the inquiry</li>
  <li>information about the registered provider and its operations</li>
  <li>background to the regulator’s concerns</li>
  <li>the regulator’s principal concerns</li>
  <li>the parameters of the inquiry including the specific matters and time period that is to be investigated</li>
  <li>the timetable for the inquiry</li>
  <li>financial considerations</li>
  <li>the arrangements for reporting to the regulator, including any requirement by the regulator to provide interim reports</li>
  <li>the regulator’s expectations of the inquirer</li>
  <li>how success against the brief will be monitored and measured</li>
  <li>any other matters that the regulator may consider to be relevant to a particular inquiry.</li>
</ul>

<p>25 - The regulator will keep the brief under very close review during the course of the inquiry. If it becomes necessary to amend or extend the brief or allow additional time for the inquiry, the regulator will agree a revised brief to the inquirers and provide a copy to the registered provider.</p>

<h2>Briefing the inquirer</h2>

<p>26 - The regulator will provide both written and oral briefings to the inquirer covering both the inquiry process and key background on the registered provider. The inquirer will be given all relevant information and documents about the provider’s affairs and the specific areas for investigation that it is aware of or has in its possession. Since the circumstances of and the reasons for an inquiry will vary from case to case, it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of documents. The following material is likely to be made available to the inquirer, depending on the nature of the provider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the registered provider’s constitution</li>
  <li>the most recent audited accounts and auditor’s management letter</li>
  <li>business plan</li>
  <li>financial returns provided to the regulator</li>
  <li>performance information and compliance statement provided to the regulator</li>
  <li>any relevant voluntary undertaking given to the regulator</li>
  <li>the most recent regulatory judgement or notice produced by the regulator</li>
  <li>the most recent annual viability review produced by the regulator</li>
  <li>key correspondence between the regulator and the registered provider</li>
  <li>any documents directly relevant to the matters to be investigated</li>
  <li>any other relevant background material.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notification of an inquiry</h2>

<p>27 - Depending on the nature of the issues that are subject to an inquiry, it may not be possible to give a registered provider advanced notice of the decision to undertake an inquiry. However, the regulator will notify the provider in writing and may also arrange a meeting to explain the reasons for the inquiry, the process that will be followed and the anticipated timetable. The notification will usually include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the order appointing the inquirer</li>
  <li>the brief for the inquiry</li>
  <li>the powers of the inquirer</li>
  <li>a copy of these guidance notes</li>
  <li>the terms of any public statement that the regulator requires the provider to make</li>
  <li>a draft news release to announce the inquiry</li>
  <li>the proposed lines of communication between the regulator and the registered provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>28 - The registered provider will be asked to notify its key stakeholders. The regulator will notify other relevant organisations that it has decided to hold an inquiry. The regulator will keep relevant organisations informed of the progress of the inquiry as necessary. In doing so it will seek to balance the expectations of such organisations to be properly and fully informed against the disclosure of qualified, sensitive or privileged material. These organisations may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government">MHCLG</abbr>, the Financial Conduct Authority or Charity Commission, as appropriate</li>
  <li>Homes England or <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>, as appropriate</li>
  <li>a local authority in its capacity as the strategic housing authority for any area in which the provider operates where the inquiry is into the affairs of a <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>an appropriate body that represents the provider</li>
  <li>secured creditors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conduct of an inquiry</h2>

<p>30 -  It is for the inquirer working to the brief and within the parameters, timetable and budget set by the regulator to determine the procedure for the conduct of the inquiry. The inquirer is expected to establish matters of fact relating to the particular matters under investigation. If any matter of concern not within the brief comes to the inquirer’s attention during the course of the inquiry, the inquirer should seek instructions from the regulator on whether or not the matter should be followed within the inquiry. If the regulator agrees, it will issue a revised brief to the inquirer and to the provider.</p>

<p>31 - The inquirers have wide-ranging powers to obtain information and documents from the provider, its subsidiaries, from associated organisations and from current and former officers, members, employees and agents including any professional advisers or persons acting for or on behalf of the provider. Any person failing to comply with such an Order from the inquirers is liable to be prosecuted. The inquirers may take copies of any books, accounts or documents produced. Where an extraordinary audit is being carried out, inquirers may make an Order for such information with a view to passing it on to the auditor.</p>

<p>32 - The regulator will expect an inquiry to be conducted in accordance with the principles of natural justice. The inquirers may interview anyone who may have been involved in the matters under investigation. Any person interviewed may, if he or she wishes, be accompanied by a representative, provided that that person is not also someone who has been or is to be interviewed by the inquirers. Where appropriate, those interviewed may be asked to give evidence under oath, to make a declaration of the truth or to agree and sign written statements. Neither the regulator, nor the inquiry, will pay for any person or their representative to attend the inquiry. No payment will normally be made for loss of earnings or professional fees or out of pocket expenses.</p>

<p>33 - The inquirer will be asked to provide regular reports on the progress of the inquiry to the regulator, including in particular, progress in terms of timetable and budget. If the inquirer anticipates that the previously agreed timetable or budget is likely to be exceeded, the inquirer should inform the regulator and seek guidance about whether the regulator is minded to grant an extension and/or is prepared to authorise additional expenditure. If the regulator agrees it will issue a revised brief to the inquirer and to the provider.</p>

<h2>An interim report</h2>

<p>34 The inquirer may make one or more interim reports to the regulator, or as required by the regulator. If as a result of an inquirer’s interim report, the regulator is satisfied that the affairs of the provider have been mismanaged, the regulator may exercise any of its enforcement powers including those that are available during or following an inquiry. See the separate guidance notes on these powers.</p>

<h2>The final report</h2>

<p>35- Section 207 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> makes provision for the inquirer to make a final report on matters specified by the regulator.</p>

<p>36 = The regulator will expect the inquirer to send the final report, or relevant extracts, in draft form to any individual who is likely to be criticised in the final report in order to give them the opportunity to respond to those criticisms. A copy of the final report will also be sent to the provider. The inquirer should give the relevant parties a reasonable amount of time to respond. The regulator will expect the inquirer to demonstrate that the views of those individuals responding have been taken into account in making the final report. Where responses are received after the deadline set by the inquirer, it will be a matter for the discretion of the inquirer whether or not they will be taken into account.</p>

<p>37 - While the form and content of the final report will vary from case to case, in compiling the final report, the regulator will expect the inquirer to record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>findings about the matters for investigation set out in the inquiry brief</li>
  <li>the facts of the case</li>
  <li>the conclusions the inquirer has drawn from those facts, including specific conclusions as to whether or not there has been mismanagement, and, if there has, who was responsible for it</li>
  <li>any facts about which there was dispute</li>
  <li>any material conflicts of evidence</li>
  <li>how the inquirer has taken account of any responses to the draft final report from relevant parties in making the final report.</li>
</ul>

<p>38 - Where the inquirer wishes to make suggestions for improving the performance of the provider or that of providers generally, or wishes to comment on matters outside their brief, these should be discussed first with the regulator and, if agreed, recorded in a separate letter to the regulator.
Consideration of the final report and representations</p>

<p>39 - The regulator will consider the facts of the case as set out by the inquirer in the final report. It may not agree with some or all of the inquirer’s conclusions or may form different conclusions from the evidence. The regulator may refer the report back to the inquirer at any point in order to seek clarification on, or a supplementary report about, some specific part or parts or the whole of the report. Where this reveals that the report contains an error of fact, the regulator will consider whether the error was sufficiently material to change the findings detailed in the report.</p>

<p>40 - The regulator will complete its consideration of the report as soon as it is reasonably practicable to do so. The regulator will notify the provider of the provisional timetable in which it is expected to consider the report. This will include the date of any relevant formal meeting, or meetings and the anticipated deadline for the receipt of any written representations from the provider.</p>

<p>41 - The purpose of any formal meeting, or meetings, is to consider all the relevant material and to decide:
* whether the board is satisfied, as the result of an inquiry, that the affairs of the provider have been mismanaged
* if they have been mismanaged, whether any person or group of persons contributed to the mismanagement
* if they have been mismanaged, whether the board is minded to exercise any of its enforcement powers in the Act
* whether the regulator requires the provider to take any remedial action in relation to issues raised in the report.</p>

<p>42 - If the regulator concludes that the affairs of the provider have not been mismanaged, or if it is satisfied that only minor remedial action is required, the inquiry will usually be concluded.</p>

<p>43 - Once the board has made its findings, the provider will be informed as soon as possible in writing, setting out the reasons for the decisions. If the regulator concludes that there has been mismanagement, the regulator will inform the provider and any individuals who appear to have contributed to it. They will also be advised of any enforcement action that the regulator is minded to take. Copies of the final report, or relevant extracts, will be sent to the provider or to individuals or to third parties (referred to subsequently in this guidance as “relevant persons”) and they will be invited to make representations to the regulator. Any such invitation is entirely at the discretion of the regulator, and will only be extended to an individual or an organisation that appears to the regulator to have a direct and relevant interest in the governance, management and operations of the provider.</p>

<p>44 - The regulator would usually expect the relevant persons to make written representations. In addition, the regulator may be prepared to consider oral representations made in person. The purpose of the representations is to offer the relevant persons an opportunity to correct matters of fact or to refute the contents of the final report.</p>

<p>45 - Where the relevant persons wish to make written representations they will be asked to submit them by a specified deadline. It is in the best interests of the relevant persons to provide material by the deadline since this will give the regulator sufficient time to give it careful consideration before the meeting. Where representations are received after the deadline, the regulator will use its best endeavours to take it into account, but it cannot guarantee to do so. The regulator will not usually grant requests for additional time to submit written representations, although it may be prepared to do so if exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated.</p>

<p>46 - Where the regulator is prepared to consider oral representations, the relevant persons will be invited to do so at a formal meeting. The regulator will not usually grant requests to postpone such a meeting, although it may be prepared to do so in exceptional circumstances. The regulator may set a time limit for the provider, the individual or the third party to make their representations.</p>

<p>47 - Anyone making oral representations may be accompanied by a legal adviser or other representative if they so wish, provided that the person has not previously been interviewed by the inquirers, and the regulator has been notified in advance that they will be attending. The regulator will not pay for any person or their representative to attend the meeting. No payment will be made for loss of earnings, or professional fees or out of pocket expenses, other than if exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated.</p>

<p>48 - The regulator will determine how a meeting at which oral representations are to be made is to be conducted. The regulator may arrange for a verbatim transcript of the representations to be made. If it does so, a copy will be sent to those making the representations or their representatives. When the regulator is satisfied that the relevant persons have had a reasonable opportunity to state their case, it will conclude its consideration of the report in private session. The regulator will notify the relevant persons of the outcome of the board meeting, including the reasons for its decision, as soon as it is practicable to do so.</p>

<p>49 - At the conclusion of the inquiry, the provider, and all the organisations notified of the start of the inquiry will be notified of the conclusions reached and any action taken by the regulator.</p>

<h2>Publication of an inquiry report</h2>

<p>50 - Section 207 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> sets out the regulator’s power to publish all or part of an interim or final report. While the regulator is, in principle, committed to publishing all inquiry reports in full, it recognises that some reports may contain material where publication might not be in the public interest or might compromise the safety of individuals or might deter others from coming forward with information. The regulator will always consider whether publication is in the public interest. If it is, the regulator will consider the most appropriate form for publication which could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the full report</li>
  <li>a summary of the report
*• any representations made by the provider or by any individual.</li>
</ul>

<p>51 - Where the regulator does intend to publish material, it will notify the provider and any relevant individuals of its intention to do so. The regulator will issue a news release to announce the publication of the report.</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

  <li>to provide value for money and “best value” in conducting the inquiry</li>
  <li>at all times to be mindful that the regulator is a public body, and that the regulator’s economic objectives include the need to avoid the imposition of an unreasonable burden (directly or indirectly) on public funds, and to guard against the misuse of public funds</li>

  <li>at all times to be mindful that the regulator’s economic objectives include the need to avoid the imposition of an unreasonable burden (directly or indirectly) on public funds, and to guard against the misuse of public funds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Direction to the Homes and Communities Agency (Homes England)</h2>

<p>55 - Under section 100G the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>, one of the circumstances in which the regulator may direct Homes England not to give financial assistance to a specified registered provider (either under section 19 or in connection with social housing) is where the regulator has decided to hold an inquiry into the affairs of the registered provider under section 206 (and the inquiry is not concluded). The regulator will review its approach on a regular basis until the inquiry is concluded. Further advice and guidance about the regulator’s approach to the use of the power to direct Homes England is set out in the relevant guidance note.</p>

<h2>Direction to the Greater London Authority</h2>

<p>56 - Under the Greater London Authority Act 1999 section 333ZG, in circumstances where the regulator has decided to hold an inquiry, it may give a Direction to the Greater London Authority which prohibits the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> from giving financial assistance to the provider. In circumstances where it has decided to hold an inquiry, the regulator will also consider whether to issue such a Direction to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>. The regulator will review its approach on a regular basis until the inquiry is concluded. Further advice and guidance about the regulator’s approach to the use of this power to direct the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> is set out in the relevant guidance note.</p>

<h2>Powers exercisable during or following an inquiry</h2>

<p>57 - The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> gives the regulator a range of powers which can only be exercised during or following an inquiry. The powers are to:</p>

  <li>to censure a local authority employee (Order and sections 269A and 269B).</li>
</ul>

<p>Further advice and guidance about the regulator’s approach to the use of these powers is set out in the relevant guidance notes.</p>

<p>58 - The regulator may decide to exercise any of its enforcement or general powers during or following an inquiry. Further advice and guidance about the regulator’s approach to the exercise of these powers is set out in the relevant guidance notes.</p>
