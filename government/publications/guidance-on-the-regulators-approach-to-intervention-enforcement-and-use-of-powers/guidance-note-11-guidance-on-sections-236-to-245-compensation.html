<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power on the award of compensation. This is an enforcement power and is set out in Part 2 Chapter 7 sections 236 to 245 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>2 - This power allows the regulator to award compensation to a tenant of a failure on the part of a registered provider.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>3 - Section 237 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 includes three specific circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power on awarding compensation. They are:</p>

<p>3.1. where the registered provider has failed to meet an economic standard or failed to meet a consumer standard and there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been or there is a risk of serious detriment to tenants</p>

<p>3.2. where the registered provider has given an undertaking under section 125 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act">HRA</abbr> 2008 and failed to comply with it</p>

<p>3.3. where the registered provider has failed to comply with relevant provisions of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 (<abbr title="Welfare Reform and Work Act">WRWA</abbr>) or with regulations made by the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> under the <abbr title="Welfare Reform and Work Act">WRWA</abbr>.</p>

<p>4 - The regulator is most likely to find it appropriate to exercise the power in circumstances where a breach of the standards has resulted in serious detriment to a tenant, or tenants, as a result of a failure against a standard, or if the provider has failed to pay compensation that has been awarded by an ombudsman.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>5 - The power may be exercised in relation to a non-profit registered provider or a for-profit registered provider. It cannot be applied to a local authority.</p>

<p>6 - Awards of compensation may be made to persons who have suffered as a result of the failure provided that they are tenants of the provider.</p>

<p>7 - If the housing ombudsman has already awarded compensation to a particular person on a particular matter, the regulator may not award compensation to that person on that matter unless the provider has not made the payment directed by the ombudsman.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>8 - Before a compensation notice is issued, the regulator will give the provider a ‘pre-compensation warning’. This will warn the provider that the regulator is considering awarding compensation and will set out the grounds on which the regulator believes the compensation can be awarded.</p>

<p>9 - The pre-compensation warning will include any details the regulator is able to give concerning the likely amount of the award. It will provide details of how the provider can make representations to the regulator. It will indicate whether or to what extent the regulator would accept a voluntary undertaking instead of, or in mitigation of, an award. The warning will also include details of the enforcement of the proposed award. Before issuing a pre-compensation warning, the regulator will consult with the relevant ombudsman.</p>

<p>10 - The pre-compensation warning will be copied to Homes England and additionally to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> where it relates to a provider owning land in Greater London and any other persons the regulator thinks appropriate, in particular any person who provided information as a result of which the pre-compensation warning is being issued.</p>

<h3>Representations</h3>

<p>11 - The regulator will specify a period in the pre-compensation warning during which the provider may make representations to the regulator concerning the proposed award of compensation or its amount. This period will be of at least 28 days and will begin on the date the pre-compensation notice is received by the provider. At the end of the period, the regulator will consider any representations and decide whether to impose the compensation.</p>

<h3>Award of compensation</h3>

<p>12 - Compensation is awarded by the regulator giving a compensation notice to the provider and the person(s) to be compensated. The regulator will establish and publish a methodology for determining when an award of compensation would be appropriate and for setting the level of compensation to be awarded.</p>

<p>13 - The notice will set out the grounds on which the award is made, the amount, to whom it must be paid, the payment period, the interest to be charged on any late payment and the means of appeal. The notice may require the provider to publish information about the award and may set out the manner of that publication.</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>

<p>14 - When considering whether to award compensation or the amount of compensation to be awarded, the regulator will take account of information it has on the financial situation of the provider and the likely impact of the award on the provider’s ability to provide services.</p>

<p>15 - The regulator will aim to avoid jeopardising the financial viability of the provider, preventing the provider from honouring financial commitments or preventing the provider from taking action to remedy the matters on the grounds of which the compensation might be awarded.</p>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<p>16 - The award will be treated as a debt owed to the person to whom it is awarded. If payment is not made by the date specified in the notice, the regulator may charge interest on the debt from that date and may impose additional compensation.</p>

<h2>Appeal</h2>

<p>17 - The regulator has developed a protocol which allows a provider to appeal against its decision on the use of some enforcement powers. In addition, a provider who is given a compensation notice may appeal to the High Court against the award of compensation, its amount, or both.</p>
