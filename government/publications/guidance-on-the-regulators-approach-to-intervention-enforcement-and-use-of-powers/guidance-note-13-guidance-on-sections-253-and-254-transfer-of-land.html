<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power relating to the transfer of the land of a registered provider. This is an enforcement power and is set out in Chapter 7 sections 253 and 254 of the 2008 Act. It may be exercised in relation to registered providers with some exceptions, which are set out in the section below on scope.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - The power may be exercised in relation to a non-profit registered provider which is a registered company or a Registered Society. It cannot be applied to a local authority provider or to a registered charity. It can be applied to a for-profit provider only in relation to its social housing and associated land.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>3 - Where the regulator suspects that the affairs of a registered provider may have been mismanaged, the regulator may hold an inquiry in accordance with section 206 of the Act. As part of an inquiry, the regulator may require the provider’s accounts and balance sheet to be audited by a qualified auditor appointed by the regulator in accordance with section 210 of the Act. If, as a result of such an inquiry or audit, the regulator is satisfied that the affairs of the provider have been mismanaged in relation to social housing or is satisfied that a transfer of the provider’s land would be likely to improve the management of the land, the regulator may require the provider to transfer specified land to the regulator or to another registered provider. Further advice about the regulator’s approach to the exercise of the power to hold an inquiry is set out in the relevant guidance note.</p>

<h2>The power</h2>

<h3>The circumstances in which the power can be exercised</h3>

<p>4 - The power can only be exercised as a result of the regulator’s conclusions following an inquiry under section 206 of the Act. Under section 254 of the Act, the regulator can only require a provider to transfer land having first obtained the consent of the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> to both the transfer of that land and to the terms of the transfer.</p>

<h2>The transfer</h2>

<p>5 - A transfer of land may be to the regulator or to another specified registered provider. The purpose of a transfer is to ensure that the land will be properly managed. Therefore, a transfer of land is likely to be to another registered provider which has the capability and the capacity to ensure proper management in the future. As a general rule, the regulator will not require transfers of land to be made to the regulator itself. In the unlikely situation that a transfer to the regulator became necessary, the regulator would treat this as a temporary measure pending onward transfer to a registered provider. The regulator can only dispose of land transferred to it under section 253 to a registered provider and, if the original transfer was from a non-profit provider, a disposal must be to another non-profit provider.</p>

<p>6 - The regulator will select a suitable recipient registered provider for a transfer of land. In making its selection, the regulator will have regard to the quality and management of services to residents provided by the potential recipient, the quality of its governance systems, its financial viability, general regulatory compliance and management and financial capacity.</p>

<p>7 - A for-profit provider can only be required to transfer its social housing and associated land. Social housing has the meaning given to it by section 68 of the Act. The 2008 Act gives the regulator the power to decide what land belonging to a for-profit provider is associated with social housing. The regulator would expect social housing and associated land to be readily identifiable within the assets of a for-profit provider, and would expect to agree these with the provider at an early stage in any transfer process.</p>

<p>8 - A non-profit provider can only be required to transfer its land to another non-profit provider. An unregistered charity can only be required to transfer its land to another charity that has similar objects to those of the transferring charity. The 2008 Act gives the regulator the power to decide whether the objects of the two charities are similar. The regulator will consult with the two charities, and will take advice from the Charity Commission as necessary, before making a decision on similarity of objects. This provision does not apply to registered charities.</p>

<h2>The terms of transfer</h2>

<p>9 - Section 254 makes provision for determining the price of a transfer of land and the terms on which the transfer takes place. The price at which a transfer will take place will not be less than the amount certified by the District Valuer (to be the amount the land would fetch if sold by a willing seller to another registered provider). The onus is therefore on the District Valuer to prepare a valuation of the land to be transferred and to decide on the appropriate valuation methodology to be applied to reach that valuation. The regulator will commission, and pay for, valuations on transfers of land under section 253. At an early stage in the commission, the regulator will meet with the Valuer and agree the Valuer’s information and other requirements for the work necessary to prepare a valuation. The regulator will expect the registered provider to co-operate with the Valuer in supplying relevant information and facilitating access to manual and computerised records, as well as physical assets, in accordance with the Valuer’s requirements.</p>

<p>10 - The terms of a transfer of land under section 253 will be specified by the regulator in the requirement to make the transfer. Those terms must include provision for the payment of any debts or liabilities in respect of the land, whether or not those are secured on the land. The details of the terms will depend on the circumstances of the case, and, in particular, the amount of land to be transferred. Where a transfer of all of a provider’s land takes place, the terms of the transfer will make provision for all assets and liabilities of the provider to be passed to the recipient provider. The terms will ensure that the transfer is as close as possible to a complete transfer of engagements, leaving the transferor behind as a shell organisation only. The regulator will make provision for the solvent winding up of the transferor to be undertaken as soon as is practicable after the transfer has been completed. Section 166 of the 2008 Act gives the regulator the power to petition the court for the provider to be wound up under the Insolvency Act 1986 where a transfer of the provider’s land has taken place under section 253.</p>

<p>11 - Where a partial transfer of land takes place, the terms of the transfer will make provision for payment of any debts or liabilities associated with the land being transferred. The regulator expects the provider to co-operate fully in enabling the regulator to identify those debts and liabilities and, where relevant, to agree to also transfer cash or other assets, or an appropriate portion thereof, held by the provider in respect of the land. The regulator will seek to reach an equitable solution in the allocation or apportionment of assets and liabilities and, in particular, will seek to avoid giving preferential treatment to any creditor who is not lawfully entitled to such treatment. The regulator reserves the right to use its power under section 201 to inspect the provider’s financial or other affairs to inform the regulator’s task of setting the terms of the transfer.</p>

<p>12 - The regulator recognises the rights of secured creditors in respect of any security held over land that the regulator proposes to transfer from one registered provider to another, and that the secured creditors will need to give their consent to a transfer. The regulator will take appropriate steps with the provider to identify all relevant secured creditors, and will consult with the secured creditors about the proposed transfer and the terms of the transfer.</p>

<h2>The consent of the Secretary of State</h2>

<p>13 - The regulator can only require a provider to transfer its land if the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> has first given consent to the transfer and to the terms of the transfer. The regulator recognises that the decision for the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> is not the same one as the decision for the regulator and therefore the <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> will need to be fully informed about the details of the case as well as the process followed by the regulator in undertaking its responsibilities. The regulator will agree working arrangements with <abbr title="Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government">MHCLG</abbr> for the handling of any applications for <abbr title="Secretary of State">SoS</abbr> consent.</p>

<h2>Consultation</h2>

<p>14 - The 2008 Act does not require the regulator to consult relevant persons in exercising its power under section 253. However, the regulator recognises that it would be appropriate to have regard to a wide range of legitimate interests and is, therefore, committed to as full consultation as is possible with a number of different stakeholders. Those stakeholders may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tenants – the regulator recognises that any situation where land is transferred could cause anxiety for tenants and leaseholders, although their legal rights would not be affected. The regulator will take all steps it can to mitigate that anxiety. The regulator will ensure that tenants are consulted and informed, as far as is reasonably practicable, prior to a final decision on a transfer of land that affects them. The nature of consultation will depend on the circumstances of the case and the timescales involved. It will not be practicable in some situations to make direct contact with each individual tenant. The regulator will use various techniques to consult and inform tenants including where appropriate, liaison with recognised tenant representative groups, appointment of a tenant adviser, telephone helplines, advertisements in local newspapers and tenant meetings.</li>
  <li>secured creditors – the regulator will work closely with the secured creditors throughout the exercise of the power to require a transfer of land.</li>
  <li>Homes England and <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> – the regulator will consult Homes England and the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> (in relation to providers with land in Greater London) to ensure that the objective of protecting invested public funds is secured as far as possible</li>
  <li>the registered provider – the regulator will ensure that the provider (including its officers and its directors, committee members or trustees) and its senior staff are consulted and informed as appropriate throughout. The regulator expects the provider to co-operate in achieving an effective and timely outcome in the interests of all of its stakeholders.</li>
  <li>the proposed recipient registered provider – the regulator will work closely with the proposed recipient provider throughout the exercise of the power.</li>
  <li>other regulators – the regulator will consult and inform the Financial Conduct Authority, the Charity Commission and the Registrar of Companies as appropriate.</li>
  <li>local authorities – the regulator recognises that local authorities in whose areas a registered provider operates, may have various levels of interest in the provider’s affairs. Where a local authority holds security over land to be transferred, its position is the same as other secured creditors as outlined. In some cases a local authority may need to provide consent to a transfer of contracts or undertakings. The regulator will consult with and keep local authorities informed as appropriate to the particular circumstances of each case.</li>
  <li>central government – the regulator will keep relevant persons at <abbr title="Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government">MHCLG</abbr> informed at all stages in the exercise of these powers.</li>
</ul>
