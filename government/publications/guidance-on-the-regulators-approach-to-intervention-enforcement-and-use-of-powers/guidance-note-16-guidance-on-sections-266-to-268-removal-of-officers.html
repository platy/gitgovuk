<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power on the removal of an officer. This is an enforcement power and is set out in Chapter 7 and sections 266 and 267 of the 2008 Act. It may be exercised only in relation to a non-profit registered provider and excludes local authorities</p>

<p>2 - This document does not cover the power on the suspension or removal of an officer during or following an inquiry, which is set out in sections 259 to 265 of the Act. There is separate advice and guidance on this power.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>3 - The power may be exercised only in relation to an officer of a non-profit registered provider. It cannot be applied to a local authority provider or to a for-profit registered provider.</p>

<p>4 - The term “officer” is defined in section 270 of the Act.</p>

<p>5 - This power may be exercised in relation to an officer of a registered charity only if the charity has received public assistance. The term “public assistance” is defined in section 274 of the Act, but in summary, it means that the registered charity must have received certain specified loans or grants from public sources or had property transferred to it by a local authority.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>6 - In general, the regulator expects a provider’s constitution to make provision for removal where an officer fulfils one or more of the criteria specified in the Act, and for the provider to take action against an officer when it is appropriate to do so within the terms of its constitution.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>7 - Section 266 of the 2008 Act includes seven specific circumstances, or cases, in which the regulator may exercise the power on the removal of an officer. The regulator may remove a person who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has been adjudged bankrupt</li>
  <li>has made an arrangement with his or her creditors</li>
  <li>is subject to a disqualification Order or a disqualification undertaking under the Company Director’s Disqualification Act 1986 or equivalent legislation in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>is subject to an Order under section 429 (2) of the Insolvency Act 1986 relating to disabilities on revocation of a county court administration Order</li>
  <li>is disqualified under section 72 of the Charities Act 1993 from being a charity trustee</li>
  <li>is incapable of acting by reason of mental disorder</li>
  <li>is impeding the proper management of the provider by reason of absence or failure to act.</li>
</ul>

<p>8 - The regulator is most likely to step in and exercise this power when a person is impeding the proper management of the provider through absence or failure to act, particularly in circumstances where the regulator considers that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the absence of officers means that the governing body fails to hold quorate meetings</li>
  <li>the failure to act puts at risk the financial viability of the provider or the services to tenants in accordance with the standards set by the regulator.</li>
</ul>

<p>9 - The regulator may decide to step in where there is clear evidence one or more of the criteria specified in the 2008 Act applies, and where a provider has not taken action in a timely manner. It may be necessary for the regulator to step in and exercise this power against more than one officer of a provider.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<h3>Notice</h3>

<p>10 - Before making an Order under section 266, the 2008 Act requires the regulator to take all reasonable steps to give at least 14 days’ notice to both the officer and the provider.</p>

<p>11 - While it is not required to do so by the Act, in circumstances when it gives notice of removal, the regulator will seek representations from both the officer and the provider and, if any are received, it will take account of them in making its decision.</p>

<h2>Appeal</h2>

<p>12 - The regulator has developed a protocol which allows a provider to appeal against its decision on the use of some enforcement powers. In addition, an officer removed under this section of the 2008 Act may appeal to the High Court.</p>

<h2>The power to appoint a new officer</h2>

<p>13 - The regulator may exercise its power to appoint a new officer under section 269 to replace an officer removed under section 266.</p>
