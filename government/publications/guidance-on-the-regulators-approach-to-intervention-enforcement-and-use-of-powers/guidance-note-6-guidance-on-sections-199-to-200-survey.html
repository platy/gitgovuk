<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>1 - This document gives general advice and guidance on how the regulator may exercise the power to carry out a survey. This is a regulatory power and is set out in Chapter 6 sections 199 to 200 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>2 - The power may be exercised in relation to all providers, including a non-profit <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr>, a for-profit <abbr title="private registered provider">PRP</abbr> and a local authority provider.</p>

<p>3 - The term “premises” is not defined in the Act, but the regulator will only exercise the power to carry out a survey in relation to social housing, that is to homes or dwellings. The term “dwelling” is defined in section 275 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> as “a house or flat or other building occupied or intended to be occupied as a separate dwelling”, and “includes any garden, yard, outhouse or other appurtenance”. The regulator considers that common parts will fall within this definition.</p>

<h2>Background and context to the use of the power</h2>

<p>4 - A provider is responsible for ensuring that it achieves the standards set by the regulator. A provider has primary responsibility for ensuring that its tenants live in good quality accommodation which is repaired and maintained to the highest standards. The regulator expects providers to have good quality information on the condition of its social housing stock. It may be necessary for the regulator to step in and exercise this power when it suspects that a provider is failing to maintain its premises in accordance with the standards under section 193 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Potential triggers to the exercise of the power</h2>

<p>5 - Sections 199 and 200 of the <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> set out the circumstances in which the regulator may exercise the power to carry out a survey. The regulator may arrange for a survey of the condition of identified homes by an authorised person.</p>

<p>6 - Indicators of a potential breach of the standards could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a potential generic problem in design, construction or condition which may impact across the provider’s social housing stock where there are reasonable grounds to suspect there has been or there is a risk of a serious detriment to tenants</li>
  <li>a failure by the provider to honour a relevant voluntary undertaking to the satisfaction of the regulator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process</h2>

<h3>Who can carry out a survey?</h3>

<p>7 - A survey can be carried out by anyone who is authorised by the regulator. An “authorised person” may be a member of the regulator’s staff, or any other person who has been authorised in writing by the regulator for the purposes of carrying out a survey under this power. The regulator will ensure that the authorised person is qualified for the intended purpose of the survey.</p>

<h3>Authority to carry out the survey</h3>

<p>8 - The regulator will give the authorised person written authority to carry out the survey. The regulator will send a copy of this authority to the provider. When carrying out the survey, or seeking to enter premises in order to carry out the survey, the surveyor must produce a copy of the authorisation if requested to do so by the occupier of the premises. The surveyor may enter the premises at any reasonable time to carry out the survey.</p>

<h3>Notice</h3>

<p>9 - The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> places obligations on both the regulator and the provider in relation to giving notice of the survey:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authorised person must give the provider at least 28 days’ notice</li>
  <li>the provider must give each occupier of the premises at least seven days’ notice.
Report</li>
</ul>

<p>10 - After carrying out a survey, the surveyor must produce a written report for the regulator. The regulator will send a copy of the report to the provider.</p>

<h2>Costs</h2>

<p>11 - The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> makes provision for the regulator to require the provider to pay some or all of the costs of the survey and report. This is discretionary, but the regulator will usually seek to recover the full cost of the survey and report from the provider, having taken into account the outcome of the report and the circumstances of the provider.</p>

<h2>Sanctions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The <abbr title="Housing and Regeneration Act 2008">2008 Act</abbr> makes provision for the regulator or the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring proceedings in circumstances where:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>a provider fails without reasonable excuse to comply with the requirement to give each occupier of the premises at least seven days’ notice of a survey</li>
  <li>a provider, or an officer of a provider, obstructs an authorised person in exercising the power to carry out a survey.</li>
</ul>
