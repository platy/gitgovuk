<h2>When to offer the vaccine to pregnant women</h2>
<p>The ideal time for influenza vaccination is before influenza starts circulating. However, even after influenza is in circulation vaccination should continue to be offered to those at risk and newly pregnant women. Clinicians should apply clinical judgement to assess the needs of an individual patient, taking into account the level of influenza-like illness in their community and the fact that the immune response following influenza vaccination takes about 2 weeks to develop fully.</p>

<h2>Data review and data recording</h2>
<p>Uptake of vaccine by pregnant women, along with other groups, will be monitored. GPs will need to check their patient database throughout the duration of the influenza vaccination programme in order to accurately identify women who become pregnant during the season and opportunistic offers of vaccination should be made wherever possible. GPs should also review their records of pregnant women before the start of, and throughout, the immunisation programme to ensure that women who are no longer pregnant are not called for vaccination (unless they are in other clinical risk groups) and so that they can measure the uptake of influenza vaccine by pregnant women accurately.</p>

<p>Note that the government’s official statistics on vaccine coverage for eligible GP registered patients (including pregnant women) are managed through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.immform.phe.gov.uk/" rel="external">ImmForm website</a>. This data is used to formally evaluate the programme year-on-year (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flu-immunisation-programme-plan/appendix-i-data-collection">appendix I</a>).</p>

<p>Providers will be required to fully utilize the relevant NHS England and NHS Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) commissioned data capture application solution this influenza season to record all vaccinations administered, without exception. Providers will be required to use the system on a real-time basis to enable accurate and timely data collection and reporting.</p>

<p>Influenza vaccination data collected via the data capture application will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sent to registered GPs by a mechanism determined by NHS Digital</li>
  <li>sent to local commissioners to confirm activity and uptake to allow Provider payment</li>
  <li>included in national seasonal influenza operational management reports and official statistics</li>
</ul>

<p>For the 2022 to 2023 season, in addition to the routine data items covering vaccine uptake in pregnant women, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> runs a data collection to evaluate vaccine coverage in women who have delivered in the previous month. This is similar to how the pertussis vaccination programme is evaluated and takes place year-round to evaluate coverage year-on-year, rather than just in season. This allows for a direct comparison between influenza and pertussis vaccination coverage in pregnancy with data available after the influenza season has concluded.</p>

<h2>Maternity services</h2>
<p>All pregnant women are able to access influenza immunisation from their GP practice or a community pharmacy. In addition, Maternity Service Providers may also vaccinate pregnant women via a national Service Specification as commissioned by <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Midwives need to be able to explain the benefits of influenza vaccination to pregnant women and offer them the vaccine, or signpost women back to their GP or community pharmacy if they are unable to offer the vaccine.</p>

<p>It is important that the patient’s GP practice is informed in a timely manner so their records can be updated accordingly and included in vaccine uptake data collections.</p>
