<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224775/JCVI-statement-on-the-annual-influenza-vaccination-programme-25-July-2012.pdf" rel="external">recommendation to extend influenza vaccination to healthy children</a> was made in 2012 by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) to provide both individual protection to the children themselves and to reduce transmission across all age groups. Given the scale of the programme, it was recommended that implementation should be phased. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.25.1700496" rel="external">Research findings from the pilot programme</a> have showed encouraging impacts on influenza transmission.</p>

<p>In 2020 to 2021 because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, influenza vaccine was offered to those in Year 7 in secondary school to offer wider protection and in 2021 to 2022 this offer was extended up to those in Year 11. Whilst the extension of the schools programme to include all children up to Year 11 has been <a class="govuk-link" href="https://app.box.com/s/iddfb4ppwkmtjusir2tc/file/917206905793" rel="external">recommended by the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr></a>, to be introduced as far as it reasonably practical, this will not be taken forward over the 2022 to 2023 season.</p>

<p>This means that in 2022 to 2023 the following children will be offered vaccination:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all those aged 2 and 3 years on 31 August 2022 (date of birth on or after 1 September 2018 and on or before 31 August 2020) will be offered vaccine in general practice</li>
  <li>all primary school-aged children in Reception Year to Year 6 (aged 4 to 10 on 31 August 2022) will be offered through a school age immunisation service</li>
</ul>

<p>At-risk children who are eligible for influenza vaccination via the school aged service because of their age will be offered immunisation at school. However, these children are also eligible to receive vaccination in general practice if the school session is late in the season, their parents/ guardians prefer it, or they missed the session at school. GP practices should invite children in at-risk groups for vaccination so that parents or guardians understand they have the option of taking up the offer in either setting.</p>

<p>Children in at-risk groups for whom the live attenuated  influenza vaccine(<abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr>) is contraindicated or unsuitable will be offered an inactivated influenza vaccine.</p>

<p><abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr> is offered to children as it is more effective in the programme than the injected vaccines. This is because it is easier to administer and considered better at reducing the spread of influenza to others who may be vulnerable to the complications of influenza. Where parents object to <abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr> on the ground of its porcine gelatine content, an alternative injected vaccine (QIVc) will be available.</p>
