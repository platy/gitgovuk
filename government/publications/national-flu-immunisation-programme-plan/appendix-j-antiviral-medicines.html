<p>Antiviral medicines (<abbr title="Antiviral medicines">AVMs</abbr>) have an important role to play in treatment and prophylaxis of influenza for specified groups of patients.</p>

<p><abbr title="Antiviral medicines">AVMs</abbr> can only be prescribed by <abbr title="general practitioners">GPs</abbr> and non-medical prescribers in primary care during the influenza season, once a Central Alerting System (<abbr title="Central Alerting System">CAS</abbr>) Alert has been cascaded to <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> practices and community pharmacies by the Chief Medical Officer (<abbr title="Chief Medical Officer">CMO</abbr>) and Chief Pharmaceutical Officer authorising the prescribing and supply of <abbr title="Antiviral medicines">AVMs</abbr> at NHS expense. This is informed by surveillance data from the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) that indicates when influenza activity has risen above baseline levels across a number of indicators.</p>

<p>Antiviral medicines may be prescribed for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treatment of influenza-like illness (<abbr title="influenza-like illness">ILI</abbr>): for patients in clinical risk groups, pregnant women, patients aged 65 years and over, as well as individuals who are at risk of developing severe illness and/or medical complications from influenza if not treated. This is regardless of vaccination status</li>
  <li>prophylaxis of influenza: oseltamivir may be prescribed to patients in clinical risk groups, pregnant women and patients age 65 years and over if they are a close residential contact of an <abbr title="influenza-like illness">ILI</abbr> case, are unvaccinated since the previous season, the vaccine is not well-matched to the circulating strain or if the person is a resident of a care home</li>
</ul>

<p>More information on clinical at-risk groups and patients eligible for treatment in primary care at NHS expense with either oseltamivir or zanamivir can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/influenza-treatment-and-prophylaxis-using-anti-viral-agents">Influenza: treatment and prophylaxis using anti-viral agents web page</a>.</p>

<p>Once <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> informs the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) that the level of seasonal influenza activity is below threshold levels at the end of the influenza season, another <abbr title="Chief Medical Officer">CMO</abbr> <abbr title="Central Alerting System">CAS</abbr> Alert is cascaded to stop the prescribing and supply of <abbr title="Antiviral medicines">AVMs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The statutory prescribing restrictions that apply to primary care do not apply in secondary care. Hospital clinicians can continue to prescribe antiviral medicines for patients whose illness is confirmed or clinically suspected to be due to influenza, in accordance with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> guidance for the treatment of complicated influenza.</p>

<p>NHS England requires all clinical commissioning groups to have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/localised-community-outbreaks-of-influenza-in-the-out-of-season-period/" rel="external">mechanisms for the appropriate clinical assessment and supply of antivirals</a> for care home and similar institutional outbreaks both when the <abbr title="Chief Medical Officer">CMO</abbr> letter is in force and when it is not. For times when the <abbr title="Chief Medical Officer">CMO</abbr> letter is not in place, arrangements may involve mechanisms such as patient specific directions or patient group directions.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> works with manufacturers of <abbr title="Antiviral medicines">AVMs</abbr> from summer and throughout the influenza season to monitor supplies of <abbr title="Antiviral medicines">AVMs</abbr> to ensure adequate stocks are available in the supply chain to meet demand. Where there are indications that supplies may not meet demand, the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> teams works with the manufacturers to discuss mitigation plans.</p>
