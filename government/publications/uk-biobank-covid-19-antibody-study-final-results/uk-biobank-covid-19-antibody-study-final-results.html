<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>UK Biobank collected monthly blood samples and data on potential symptoms from over 20,000 UK Biobank participants, their adult children and grandchildren, to determine the extent of past infection with SARS-CoV-2 in different population subgroups across the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Between 27 May and 4 December 2020, 18,893 individuals (93.5%) provided at least one sample that was successfully assayed at the Target Discovery Institute (University of Oxford).</p>

<p>Participants took a finger-prick blood sample using a kit sent to their home every month for 6 months. All study participants were also invited to complete a symptom survey at the time of blood collection.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>One of the most significant findings of the study is that 99% of participants who had tested positive for previous infection retained antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 for 3 months after being infected, and 88% did for the full 6 months of the study. This discovery provides an early indication that the antibodies produced following natural infection may protect most people against subsequent infection for at least 6 months.</p>

<p>The proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (‘seroprevalence’, which indicates past infection) rose from 6.6% at the start of the study (May/June 2020) to 8.8% by the end of it (November/December 2020).</p>

<p>Across the various population groups included in the study, it was found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was most common in London (12.4%) and least common in Scotland (5.5%)</li>
  <li>there was no difference in seroprevalence by gender, but the proportion of participants with detectable antibodies was higher in younger people (13.5% among those under 30) and lowest in the elderly (6.7% among those over 70)</li>
  <li>the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was highest among participants of black ethnicity (16.3%) and lowest among those of white (8.5%) and Chinese ethnicities (7.5%)</li>
</ul>

<p>The most common symptom associated with having antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was a loss of sense of taste and smell, which was reported by 43% of sero-positive participants.</p>

<p>About one quarter (24%) of sero-positive participants were completely asymptomatic and 40% did not have one of the 3 ‘classic’ COVID-19 symptoms (fever, persistent dry cough or loss of sense of taste or smell).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The 6-month results demonstrate the persistence of antibody levels after infection, which may be indicative of long-term protection.</p>
