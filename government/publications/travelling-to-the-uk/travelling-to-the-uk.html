<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>
<p>This leaflet tells you about going through Customs when entering Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) in the United Kingdom (UK). There are different rules for travellers entering Northern Ireland (NI), these can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/travelling-to-the-uk">Travelling to the UK</a> page.</p>

<p>This leaflet details what you are and are not allowed to bring in, and your allowances for different types of goods below which you do not have to pay tax and/or duty.</p>

<p>We have a duty to protect the UK from drugs, firearms and other harmful goods and to stop smugglers evading taxes. This includes goods that travellers should pay UK tax and duty on. To do this, we need your help and co-operation. If we stop you and ask you about your baggage, please co-operate. We may stop you to ask questions, make checks and if you break the rules, seize your goods (including any vehicle you use to transport them).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Donât risk it all</h3>
<p>If you get caught smuggling goods or selling goods you did not declare, you could face prosecution and imprisonment. If we are satisfied that the goods are for a commercial purpose and you have not declared them, we may seize them and any vehicle used to transport them, and may not return them to you. If you are unsure about the goods you are carrying for your personal use, you can find more information and make an online declaration from 72 hours in advance of arrival using the HMRC <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods">Online Service for Passengers</a>.</p>

<p>If you are carrying commercial goods, please visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/goods-in-baggage">goods in baggage guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you need assisted digital support to make your declaration call HMRC from 72 hours in advance of arrival on: 
0300 322 9434 
Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm. 
Make your declaration ahead of arrival where possible, however, outside these hours of service, please use the red point phone or red channel.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Going through customs</h2>

<p>Most of our ports and airports have two exits or âchannelsâ: the red and green channel.
Some ports and airports only have one exit and a red point phone where you can declare goods.
If you let a coach, ferry, train or aircraft store your goods while travelling to the UK, you must make sure you collect the exact goods obtained by you and go through the correct channel.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Green channel</h3>

<p>Use the green channel if you are travelling with goods that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not go over your allowances</li>
  <li>are not banned or restricted</li>
  <li>have been declared using the Online Service for Passengers</li>
  <li>have been declared using the Merchandise in Baggage Online Declaration Service</li>
  <li>cash that has been declared using the online form.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Red channel or red point phone</h3>

<p>You must use the red channel or the red point phone if you are arriving and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have personal goods or cash to declare</li>
  <li>have commercial goods to declare</li>
  <li>you need to make a declaration</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Travelling to the UK from another country</h2>

<p>You can bring in goods up to the limits below without paying UK duty and/or tax. These goods must be for your own use or intended as gifts.</p>

<p>If you intend to sell or accept any kind of payment for the goods you bring in then this is classed as commercial use.</p>

<p>Details of your allowances are set out in the following pages.</p>

<p>If you have any goods that exceed these allowances, you will need to make a declaration and pay tax and duties due on the full amount of goods in the category or categories exceeded. You can check allowance details, make a declaration, and pay any tax and duty due from 72 hours in advance of arrival using the HMRC <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods">Online Service for Passengers</a>.</p>

<p>If you need assisted digital support to make your declaration call HMRC from 72 hours in advance of arrival: 
0300 322 9434 
Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm.</p>

<p>Make your declaration ahead of arrival where possible, however, outside these hours of service, please use the red point phone or red channel.</p>

<p>If you have made a declaration at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/%20duty-free-goods">duty free goods</a> and have nothing further to declare, you can use the Green Channel when going through customs. You should retain the reference number and your email receipt for your declaration as Border Force officers may ask to see this.</p>

<p>If you do not declare goods exceeding these limits, then we may seize all of the goods you are carrying within that allowance category, not just those that exceed the allowance.</p>

<p>Passengers transferring at a UK airport should check the security rules on the carriage of liquids (including duty free) purchased at airports outside the UK as these items may not be permitted through the security search point on transfer.</p>

<p>Further information can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/hand-luggage-restrictions">GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Alcohol and tobacco</h2>

<p>You are allowed to bring in the following without paying UK duty and/or tax:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Alcohol</h3>

<p>4 litres of spirits or strong liqueurs (over 22% ABV (Alcohol By Volume), or 9 litres of fortified wine (such as port or sherry), sparkling wine or any other alcoholic beverage of less than 22% ABV. You may combine these allowances, provided that you do not exceed your total alcohol allowance. For example, if you only bring back 4.5 litres of fortified wine (50% of your full allowance of 9 litres), you may also bring back 2 litres of spirits (50% of the full allowance of 4 litres) to make up your 100% alcohol allowance. Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.</p>

<p>In addition, you may also bring back 42 litres of beer, and 18 litres of still wine.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Tobacco</h3>

<p>200 cigarettes, or 100 cigarillos, or 50 cigars, or 250g of tobacco (including shisha tobacco) or 200 sticks of tobacco for heating.</p>

<p>You can combine these allowances, provided that you do not exceed your total tobacco allowance. For example, if you only bring back 100 cigarettes (50% of your full allowance of 200), you may also bring back 25 cigars (50% of the full allowance of 50) to make up your 100% tobacco allowance. Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.</p>

<p>All references to tobacco products include herbal smoking products. The allowance on cigarettes includes all types of cigarettes â normal, herbal or a combination of both.</p>

<p>Please note that you cannot combine your alcohol and tobacco allowances. For example: you cannot bring more alcohol back if you do not bring any tobacco.</p>

<p>Alcohol and tobacco allowances are only available to those aged 17 and over. This means if you are under 17 and bring back any of these goods you must pay tax and duty on the full amount.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Other goods including gifts and souvenirs</h2>

<p>Most travellers can bring other goods into the UK worth up to Â£390 (e.g. perfume and electrical goods) without paying duty and/or tax in the UK.</p>

<p>However, passengers travelling by private plane or boat for pleasure purposes are only entitled to an allowance of Â£270 worth of goods.</p>

<p>If you bring in goods over your allowance, you must pay UK taxes on all of the goods in that category, not just those above the allowance.</p>

<p>You cannot share your personal allowances with other passengers.</p>

<p>If you have any goods over these limits, you can pay any tax and duty due from 72 hours in advance of arrival using the HMRC <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods">Online Service for Passengers</a>.</p>

<p>If you have made a declaration at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/%20duty-free-goods">duty free goods</a> and have nothing further to declare, you can use the Green Channel when going through customs. You should retain the reference number and your email receipt for your declaration as Border Force officers may ask to check this email.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Food and plants</h2>

<p>From most countries outside the EU, you are not allowed to bring in any meat, honey or dairy products (except infant milk or special foods required for medical reasons, also not exceeding 2kg). This is because they can carry diseases, which can devastate our environment and economy.</p>

<p>Other animal products may also be banned although you may bring in a small quantity of some products from certain countries for your own use.</p>

<p>Visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/bringing-food-animals-plants-into-uk/food">brining food animals and plants into the UK</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Passengers arriving into Great Britain from countries outside the EU will be required to have their plants and plant products accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate. For further information please visit the link below.</p>

<p>For passengers arriving from the EU from 1 January 2021, the requirement for high-priority plants and plant products to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate will apply. From April 2021, all regulated plants and plant products, including high-priority plants, will need to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate when arriving from the EU. Visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/smarter-rules-for-safer-food-how-to-import-from-third-countries">smarter rules for safer food</a> guidance for more information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Declaring cash</h2>

<p>If you are carrying cash equivalent to Â£10,000 or more when you enter or leave Great Britain to or from any other country you must declare it. A declaration form can be found on line at gov.uk âdeclare cash you carry into or out of the UKâ. You may make the declaration from 72 hours in advance of arrival. Alternatively, at ports where there is a red channel you may obtain a form BOR 9011 from a Border Force Officer.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Commercial goods</h2>

<p>If you are carrying commercial goods which are below the Â£1,500 threshold which are not restricted or excise goods or weigh not more than 1,000kg, you can make an online declaration within 5 days of arriving at the GB port, by going to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/goods-in-baggage">goods in baggage</a>. For goods over the Â£1,500 threshold and restricted and excise goods, and goods over 1,000kg you will need to make a full customs declaration either by yourself or through an agent.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Air transfers</h2>

<p>On arrival in the UK, if you are transferring to a UK domestic flight operating under an airline transfer scheme (for example, where your hold baggage is moved directly from the arriving aircraft to your transfer flight without you having access to it), and you are carrying goods that you must declare, you must make your declaration at the following place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Online at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods">gov.uk/duty-free-goods</a>. If you have done this and have nothing further to declare, you may use the Green Channel when going through customs controls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goods to be declared carried with you on your person (such as in your pockets or in your hand luggage), and which have not been declared at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods">gov.uk/duty-free-goods</a>, must be declared at the red point phone or to an officer in the red channel at the first UK airport you arrive in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goods to be declared carried in your hold baggage which have not been declared at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods">gov.uk/duty-free-goods</a> and not declared at the first place of arrival in the UK, must be declared at the red point phone or to an officer in the red channel at your final destination.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At any point you may be requested to make a declaration by an officer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If your baggage is not checked through to your final UK destination you must collect it all and clear customs at your first point of arrival in the UK.</p>

<span class="number">11.1 </span>Pet animals and recognised assistance dogs</h3>

<p>Pet dogs, cats, ferrets and recognised assistance dogs must be compliant with the requirements laid down in the Pet Travel Scheme prior to entry into Great Britain. The entry requirements will vary depending on where the pet has travelled from. If the pet is not compliant with the entry requirements, travel may be refused by the carrier or the authorised pet checker, and any illegally landed pets may be seized and quarantined.</p>

<p>If entering or returning to Great Britain via a ferry or rail service with a recognised assistance dog, the assistance dog should have been checked for compliance prior to boarding. Passengers travelling by air must ensure they alert the Passengers with Reduced Mobility provider upon landing at the earliest opportunity to ensure the assistance dog is checked and compliant with the entry requirements.</p>
