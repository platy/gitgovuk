<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>This leaflet tells you about going through Customs when entering Northern Ireland (NI) in the United Kingdom (UK). There are different rules for travellers entering Great Britain (GB) (England, Scotland and Wales), these can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/travelling-to-the-uk">travelling to the UK</a> page. If you are travelling from Great Britain, you should check the rules on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trading-and-moving-goods-in-and-out-of-northern-ireland-from-1-january-2021">bringing goods in and out of Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>This leaflet details what you are and are not allowed to bring in, and your allowances on different types of goods before you have to pay duty and/or tax. What you can bring into the UK will vary depending on where you are travelling to and from.</p>

<p>We have a duty to protect the UK from drugs, firearms and other harmful goods and to stop smugglers evading taxes. This includes goods that travellers should pay UK tax and duty on. To do this, we need your help and co-operation. If we stop you and ask you about your baggage, please co-operate. We may stop you to ask questions, make checks and if you break the rules, seize your goods (including any vehicle you use to transport them).</p>

<h2>Don’t Risk It All</h2>

<p>If you get caught smuggling goods or selling goods you did not declare, you could face prosecution and imprisonment. If we are satisfied that the goods are for a commercial purpose, we may seize them and any vehicle used to transport them, and may not return them to you. If you are unsure about the goods you are carrying you can find more information and make an online declaration from 72 hours in advance of arrival using the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://gov.uk/duty-free-goods" rel="external">HMRC Online Service for Passengers</a>.</p>

<p>If you are carrying commercial goods, please visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/hmrc/goods-in-baggage">Taking commercial goods out of Great Britain in your baggage</a> page.</p>

<p>If you need assisted digital support to make your declaration call HMRC from 72 hours in advance of arrival on 0300 322 9434 (Monday to Friday between 8am–6pm). Make your declaration ahead of arrival where possible, however, outside these hours of service, please use the red point phone or red channel.</p>

<h2>Going through Customs</h2>

<p>Some of our ports have 3 exits: the red, green and blue channels. Where a port has three exits, you will need to use the appropriate exit.</p>

<p>Some ports and airports only have one exit and a red point phone where you declare goods.</p>

<p>If you let a coach, ferry, train or aircraft store your goods while travelling to the UK, you must make sure you collect the exact goods obtained by you and go through the correct channel.</p>

<h3>Blue channel</h3>

<p>Use the blue channel if you are travelling from a country within the European Union (EU) directly to the UK with no banned or restricted goods.</p>

<h3>Green channel</h3>

<p>Use the green channel if you are travelling to the UK from a non-EU country with goods that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not go over your allowances</li>
  <li>are not banned or restricted</li>
  <li>have been declared using the Online Service for Passengers</li>
  <li>have been declared using the Merchandise in Baggage Online Declaration Service</li>
  <li>cash that has been declared using the online form</li>
</ul>

<h3>Red channel or red point phone</h3>

<p>You must use the red channel or the red point phone if you are travelling to the UK from anywhere in the world and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have personal goods or cash to declare</li>
  <li>have commercial goods to declare</li>
  <li>are not sure about what you need to declare</li>
</ul>

<h2>Travelling from non-EU countries</h2>

<p>When travelling to the UK from a non-EU country you can bring in goods up to the limits below without paying duty and/or tax in the UK (non-EU countries includes the Canary Islands, the Channel Islands, and Gibraltar). These goods must be for your own use or intended as gifts and carried in your luggage. If you intend to sell or accept any kind of payment for the goods you bring in then this is classed as commercial use.</p>

<p>Read details of your allowances on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods">Bringing goods into the UK for personal use</a> page.</p>

<p>If you have any goods that exceed these allowances, you will need to make a declaration and pay tax and duties due on the full amounts of goods in the category or categories exceeded. You can check allowance details, make a declaration, and pay any tax and duty due from 72 hours in advance of arrival using the HMRC Online Service for Passengers on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods">Bringing goods into the UK for personal use</a> page.</p>

<p>If you need assisted digital support to make your declaration call HMRC from 72 hours in advance of arrival on 0300 322 9434 (Monday to Friday 8am – 6pm). Make your declaration ahead of arrival where possible, however, outside these hours of service, please use the red point phone or red channel.</p>

<p>If you have made <a class="govuk-link" href="http://gov.uk/duty-free-goods" rel="external">a declaration</a>, and have nothing further to declare, you can use the Green Channel when going through customs. You should retain the reference number and your email receipt for your declaration as Border Force officers may ask to see this.</p>

<p>If you do not declare goods exceeding these limits, then we may seize all the goods you are carrying within that allowance category, not just those that exceed the allowance.</p>

<p>Passengers transferring at a UK airport should check the security rules on the carriage of liquids (including duty free) purchased at airports outside the UK as these items may not be permitted through the security search point on transfer.</p>

<p>Read further information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/hand-luggage-restrictions">Hand luggage restrictions at UK airports</a> page.</p>

<p>When arriving into the UK from a non-EU country you are allowed to bring in the following without paying duty and/or tax in the UK.</p>

<h2>Alcohol</h2>

<ul>
  <li>litre of spirits or strong liqueurs (over 22% Alcohol by Volume [ABV])</li>
  <li>litres of fortified wine (such as port or sherry), sparkling wine or any other alcoholic beverage of less than 22% ABV</li>
</ul>

<p>You may combine these allowances, provided that you do not exceed your total alcohol allowance. For example, if you only bring back 1 litre of fortified wine (50% of your full allowance of 2 litres), you may also bring back half a litre of spirits (50% of the full allowance of 1 litre) to make up your 100% alcohol allowance. Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.</p>

<p>In addition, you may also bring back: 16 litres of beer, and 4 litres of still wine.</p>

<h2>Tobacco</h2>

<ul>
  <li>200 cigarettes</li>
  <li>100 cigarillos</li>
  <li>50 cigars</li>
  <li>250g of tobacco* (including shisha tobacco)</li>
  <li>200 sticks of tobacco for heating</li>
</ul>

<p>You can combine these allowances, provided that you do not exceed your total tobacco allowance. For example, if you only bring back 100 cigarettes (50% of your full allowance of 200), you may also bring back 25 cigars (50% of the full allowance of 50) to make up your 100% tobacco allowance.</p>

<p>This is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.</p>

<p>Please note that you cannot combine your alcohol and tobacco allowances. For example: you cannot bring more alcohol back if you do not bring any tobacco.</p>

<p>Alcohol and tobacco allowances are only available to those aged 17 and over. This means if you are under 17 and bring back any of these goods you must pay tax and duty on the full amount.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All references to tobacco products include herbal smoking products. The allowance on cigarettes includes all types of cigarettes – normal, herbal or a combination of both. These rules apply whether you are travelling within or from outside the European Union.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other goods (including gifts and souvenirs)</h2>

<p>Most travellers from non-EU countries can bring other goods worth up to £390 (e.g. perfume and electrical goods) without paying duty and / or tax in the UK.</p>

<p>However, passengers from non-EU countries travelling by private plane or boat are only entitled to an allowance of £270 worth of goods.</p>

<p>If you bring in goods worth more than your allowance, you must pay duty and / or tax on all of the goods in that category, not just the value above the allowance.</p>

<p>You cannot share your personal allowances with other passengers.</p>

<p>If you have any goods over these limits, you can pay any tax and duty due from 72 hours in advance of arrival using the HMRC online service for passengers on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://gov.uk/duty-free-goods" rel="external">Bringing goods into the UK for personal use</a> page.</p>

<p>If you have made <a class="govuk-link" href="http://gov.uk/duty-free-goods" rel="external">a declaration</a> and have nothing further to declare, you can use the Green Channel when going through customs. You should retain the reference number and your email receipt for your declaration as Border Force officers may ask to check it.</p>

<h2>Food and plants</h2>

<p>If travelling to NI from most countries outside the EU, you are not allowed to bring in any meat, honey or dairy products. This is because they can carry diseases, which can devastate our environment and economy.</p>

<p>Other animal products may also be banned although you may bring in a small quantity of some products from certain countries for your own use.</p>

<p>Most fruits, vegetables, seeds and bulbs are also subject to weight or quantity restrictions. Some plants and plant products (including potatoes) and loose soil may not be brought into NI unless you have obtained the relevant official licence.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/topics/food/personal-food-imports" rel="external">leaflets</a> ‘If in Doubt Leave It Out’ food products of animal origin’ and ‘Fruit, vegetable and plant products into the NI’.</p>

<h2>Declaring cash</h2>

<p>If you are carrying cash equivalent to 10,000 euros or more when you enter or leave Northern Ireland, to or from any country outside the EU, you must declare it. A declaration form can be found on line at GOV.UK ‘declare cash you carry into or out of the EU’. You may make the declaration online any time from 72hours before the time of arrival. Alternatively, at ports where there is a red channel you may obtain a form BOR 9011 (NI) from a Border Force Officer.</p>

<h2>Commercial goods</h2>

<p>If you are carrying commercial goods which are below the £873 (€1000) threshold and not weighing more than 1000kg, or are not restricted or excise goods, you will need to make an oral declaration where there is a red channel or red point phone at the port of entry. If you are carrying goods over the £873 (€1000) threshold, weighing more than 1000kg or carrying restricted or excise goods you must make a full customs declaration.</p>

<p>You or your agent can submit a declaration into HMRC’s Customs Declaration Service or if you do not have specialist software to submit the data to HMRC then you can do so through the Northern Ireland Trader Support Service.</p>

<h2>Air transfers</h2>

<p>If you are transferring to a UK domestic flight, you will need to clear immigration and customs when you first arrive in the UK before continuing your journey on your domestic flight.</p>

<h2>Bringing your personal belongings or your car into the UK?</h2>

<p>See ‘Notice 3’ available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3-bringing-your-belongings-pets-and-private-motor-vehicles-to-uk-from-outside-the-eu/notice-3-bringing-your-belongings-pets-and-private-motor-vehicles-to-uk-from-outside-the-eu">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Travelling directly to NI from within the European Union (EU)</h2>

<h3>Alcohol and tobacco</h3>

<p>You can bring an unlimited amount of most goods directly into NI from the EU, for example, you can bring in any alcohol, tobacco, meat and dairy products – as long as they are for your own use and carried in your luggage. ‘Own use’ means for your own consumption or gifts. If you intend to sell or accept any kind of payment for alcohol or tobacco products you bring in then this is classed as commercial use. Please contact the Helpline for more information.</p>

<h3>EU countries:</h3>

<p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus*, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland (Republic of), Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain (but not the Canary Islands), Sweden, Gibraltar is outside the Community Customs territory. The allowances for outside the EU therefore apply.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Though the whole of Cyprus is part of the EU, goods from any area of Cyprus not under effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus are treated as non-EU imports.</li>

<p>There are no limits on the amount of duty and/or tax paid alcohol and tobacco that you can bring directly into NI from the EU as long as the goods are for your own use or gifts and are carried in your luggage.</p>

<p>If you are bringing in alcohol or tobacco goods and we have reason to suspect they may be for a commercial purpose, an officer may ask you questions and make checks.</p>

<p>For example, about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type and quantity of goods you have bought</li>
  <li>why you bought them</li>
  <li>how you paid for them</li>
  <li>whether all your goods are openly displayed or concealed</li>
  <li>how often you travel</li>
  <li>how much you normally smoke or drink</li>
  <li>any other relevant circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are more likely to ask you questions if you have more than:</p>

<ul>
  <li>800 cigarettes</li>
  <li>200 cigars</li>
  <li>400 cigarillos</li>
  <li>1kg tobacco</li>
  <li>110 litres of beer</li>
  <li>90 litres of wine</li>
  <li>10 litres of spirits</li>
  <li>20 litres of fortified wine (for example, port or sherry).</li>
</ul>

<p>The country where you buy tobacco may have its own laws on how much tobacco you can buy or keep. If you are not sure, please check with that country’s authorities before you buy.</p>

<h2>Fuel</h2>

<p>In addition to fuel held in the standard tank of a vehicle, tourist travellers to the UK may carry reserve fuel for use in that vehicle in an appropriate canister. It should be noted that for safety reasons ferry and train companies impose strict limits on the amount of fuel carried outside the fuel tank.</p>

<h2>Food and plants</h2>

<p>If you are travelling to NI from a country within the EU, you may bring in any meat, dairy or other animal products if free from pest and disease. You may also bring in any fruit, vegetables or plant products other than plants and seeds of Fraxinus (Ash) intended for planting as long as they are, grown in an EU Member State, free from pests and diseases and are for your own use or consumption.</p>
