<p>We are committed to making vetting accessible to all users. If you have specific
needs, we will make reasonable adjustments wherever possible.</p>

<h2>What you can expect during the process and when you hold a clearance</h2>

<h3>Treat you with dignity and be non-judgemental</h3>

<p>We understand and respect differences in background and experience. We will treat
you - and for the highest level of clearance any referees we speak to as a part of
the vetting process - with dignity and respect. We will listen to your concerns and
answer your questions clearly. We will always treat you as an individual.</p>

<h3>Provide a helpful, efficient, effective and transparent service</h3>

<p>We will help you understand and navigate the process and be clear about why we
are asking the questions we do. We will deal with the information you give us
confidentially, quickly and efficiently. If you have any concerns we will address them
as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>Be professional</h3>

<p>We will ensure our staff are expert, accessible and approachable - they come from
all walks of life too. We will quality assure the service you receive. We will be
sensitive to any difficulties and concerns you might have.</p>

<h3>Protect your information and respect your privacy</h3>

<p>We will protect the information you share and any other personal data we hold about you. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-security-vetting-privacy-notice">UKSV Privacy Notice</a>. If we need to ask for more information we will explain why.</p>

<h3>Only do what is reasonable in respect of delivering proportionate people risk management</h3>

<p>We will only do what is reasonable in respect of understanding any potential risks to
you from holding security clearance. Where we cannot grant clearance, we will
provide as full an explanation of the reasons why as we are able to.</p>

<h3>Deal with complaints quickly and fairly, provide a complaints mechanism and a formal appeals process if clearance is refused for existing employees</h3>

<p>We will deal with your complaints or any appeal as quickly as we can. Our team will try to resolve complaints where it can, but if you are not satisfied that we are meeting these standards then <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-make-a-complaint-to-united-kingdom-security-vetting">there is a complaint process you can follow</a>.</p>

<h2>What we expect from you</h2>

<h3>Be straight forward and engage</h3>

<p>Be open, and engage with the process as completely as you can. Provide us with all
the relevant facts and information about your current and recent addresses, spent
and unspent convictions, and any additional information we ask you for. Remember
that our staff are here to help you through the process, so please treat them with
respect.</p>

<h3>Recognise that holding a security cleared role brings responsibilities</h3>

<p>We expect you to continue to engage with us for as long as you have a security cleared role.</p>

<h3>Keep us informed of any changes in your personal circumstances that might be relevant</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-security-vetting">Follow our guidance on how to fill in the forms</a> and get in touch with us as soon as possible if you need help.</p>

<h3>Keep accurate records and protect your information</h3>

<p>Keep accurate records of what you tell us, as far as possible. Do not share
confidential information with others and tell us straight away if you think someone
else knows your application details, such as passwords to the vetting website.</p>

<h3>Provide as much detailed information as possible</h3>

<p>Please also take care to avoid mistakes
when you send us information.</p>

<h3>Respond in good time</h3>

<p>Send us your questionnaire, any requests for additional information and, where
applicable, your interview availability as quickly as you can.</p>

<h3>Tell us how we did</h3>

<p>We really want your feedback. You will have the opportunity to provide this when
your vetting application is complete. Let us know how well the process met your
expectations, anything that concerned you, or things we might improve.</p>
