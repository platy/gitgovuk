<h2>What is vetting?</h2>

<p>Vetting helps employers and employees identify, manage and mitigate risks for roles
where national security concerns are a consideration, like jobs with access to high
risk sites, highly classified information or systems. Vetting establishes trust between
employers and employees, sometimes through confidential conversations. It is the
start of an ongoing dialogue about managing risks, which lasts for as long as a
person holds a security clearance.</p>

<h2>Who delivers vetting?</h2>

<p>Vetting is delivered by United Kingdom Security Vetting (<abbr title="United Kingdom Security Vetting">UKSV</abbr>), which is part of the
Cabinet Office Government Security Group and the Government Security Function.
Our staff are culturally sensitive and professional. You can find out more about
<abbr title="United Kingdom Security Vetting">UKSV</abbr> and how to join us <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/united-kingdom-security-vetting">here</a>.</p>

<h2>What information will I be asked for?</h2>

<p>We want to ensure that anyone, irrespective of their background or circumstance feels able to apply for a security related role and a clearance. Be assured that information will be gathered in a proportionate, respectful and sensitive way. If you are required to complete a Security Questionnaire, you will need to provide information about your background, family, employment history and where you’ve lived. We need to ask about any criminal convictions, and for higher levels of clearance your financial situation and life experiences to help us understand you as an individual.</p>

<h2>Why will I be asked for this information?</h2>

<p>We only ask for information that helps us to identify areas of risk in relation to the
clearance you are applying for - there are no right or wrong answers and the
process will not make any judgements of you as an individual or your life.
Depending on the level of clearance your role requires, in no particular order, we
may need to understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your nationality and any periods of residence or connections overseas,
especially in countries that the UK has more challenging relationships with, but
mindful that relatively few posts are reserved to UK nationals these days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether your spending is sustainable, mindful that most of us have debts and
credit agreements to manage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your mental and physical wellness, but only so far as it is strictly relevant to
risk management - it is very unusual for any health considerations to be a
cause for concern.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the strictest confidence, any aspects of your life or identity that you keep
private, but only to understand if there is a risk of somebody using this against
you maliciously.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How you manage family connections, associations and friendships, including
who might have a significant influence on you, but only to understand if there
is a risk of this influence being inappropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For civil and crown servants, whether any information you post online publicly
is consistent with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code">civil service code</a> and similar guidance, mindful that most
people have a significant social media footprint.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will only ask and explore what is reasonable and relevant from a security
perspective. We will frame and explain our questions to demonstrate that.</p>
