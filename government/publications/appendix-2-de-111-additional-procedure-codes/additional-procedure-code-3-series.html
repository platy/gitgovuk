<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 3-series National Additional Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/11 for Exports.</p>

<p>Use the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 – 1/11 correlation matrix, Additional Procedure Code index list and their respective completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for additional guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Additional Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>3LV: Low Value Export or Dispatch to a Single Recipient<br>
3NS: Home Use goods that are excluded from external trade statistics being exported or dispatched<br>
3PE: Export or Dispatch of Personal Effects<br>
3PM: Export or Dispatch of Private Means of Transport<br>
3RI:  Rejected Imports</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Export</a>.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>) must also be followed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes are not repeated against or superseded by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires the use of both Union and National Additional Procedure Codes, Union Codes (from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes Index List</a>) should be declared first (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Export</a>, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 for more details).</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes:</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item.  This restriction does not apply to <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/10 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 7/18 where seals information is required for pre-departure declarations</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
</ul>

<p>However, note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3LV: </span> Low Value Export or Dispatch to a Single Recipient</h2>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>For the exportation or dispatch of low value home use goods to a single recipient that are being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exported outside the territory of the Customs Union (B1 data set)</li>
  <li>Dispatched to a Special Fiscal Territory or territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union (B4 data set)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goods covered:</h3>

  <li>weigh less than 1,000kg net mass</li>

</ul>

<p>Where several commodities in a single consignment are sent to a single recipient, enter the commodity code for the item that attracts the highest duty rate in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/14.  Each commodity does not therefore need to be declared separately.</p>

<p>Declarations using code 3LV must have only a single goods item declared.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

  <li>Any excise goods</li>

<p>Entry in Declarants Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr>) cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Additional Procedure Code.</p>
