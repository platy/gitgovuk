<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 4-series National Additional Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/11 for Exports.</p>

<p>Use the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 – 1/11 correlation matrix, Additional Procedure Code index list and their respective completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for additional guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Additional Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>46P: The exportation of replacement goods following the prior import of processed products obtained from equivalent goods under Outward Processing (Prior Import Equivalence)<br>
48P: Export of defective goods under Outward Processing following the prior import of replacement products</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Export</a>.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>) must also be followed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes are not repeated against or superseded by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires the use of both Union and National Additional Procedure Codes, Union Codes (from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes Index List</a>) should be declared first (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Export</a>, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 for more details).</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>
