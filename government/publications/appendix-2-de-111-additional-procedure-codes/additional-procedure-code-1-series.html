<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 1-series National Additional Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/11 for Exports.</p>

<p>Use the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 – 1/11 correlation matrix, Additional Procedure Code index list and their respective completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for additional guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Additional Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>1CD:  Controlled Drugs using Simplified Procedures<br>
1CG:  Controlled Goods using Simplified Procedures<br>
1DP:  Goods exported or dispatched under diplomatic privilege (official use)<br>
1MP:  Prior export of equivalent milk and milk products (EX/IM)<br>
1NO:  Goods exported or dispatched for US and other <abbr title="The North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> visiting forces (official use)<br>
1NP:  Goods exported or dispatched by US and other <abbr title="The North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> visiting forces personnel (goods for personal use)<br>
1SW:  Export of goods to discharge the shipwork or platform end-use procedure<br>
1VW:  Goods liable to VAT only being exported or dispatched from customs warehousing<br></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>) must also be followed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes are not repeated against or superseded by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires the use of both Union and National Additional Procedure Codes, Union Codes (from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes Index List</a>) should be declared first (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 for more details).</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1CD: </span> Controlled Drugs using Simplified Procedures</h2>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>All normal supporting documentation must be produced with the simplified declaration (regular use) (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 codes C or F), including invoices, health certificates, licences and preference certificates.</p>

<p>A Supplementary Declaration using Additional Declaration Type Y in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2 is still required.</p>

<p>Where controlled goods are declared, all items on the declaration will be required to comply with the controlled goods data set. To avoid having to provide additional data for controlled goods, you may wish to declare any non-controlled goods on a separate declaration.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>This Additional Procedure Code must only be used for the export or dispatch of controlled drugs that have Union status or are in free circulation and/ or home use (excluding end use).</p>
