<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the B-series Union Additional Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/11 for Exports.</p>

<p>Use the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 — 1/11 correlation matrix, Additional Procedure Code index list and their respective completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for additional guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Additional Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>B51: Goods temporarily (re)exported for repair under guarantee using Outward Processing<br>
B52: Defective goods temporarily (re)exported for replacement under guarantee using Outward Processing<br>
B53: Outward Processing under agreements with third countries, possibly combined with VAT only Outward Processing<br>
B54: Goods temporarily dispatched under VAT only Outward Processing<br></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>) must also be followed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes are not repeated against or superseded by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires the use of both Union and National Additional Procedure Codes, Union Codes (from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes Index List</a>) should be declared first (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide"><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Exports</a>, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 for more details).</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<h2>B51: Goods temporarily (re)exported for repair under guarantee using Outward Processing</h2>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>Temporary (re)exportation of goods using Outward Processing (<abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>) for repair under guarantee in accordance with Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), Article 260 (goods repaired free of charge).</p>

<h3>Goods covered:</h3>

<p>The temporary (re)exportation of goods, to outside the territory of the Customs Union, under an <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation, for an authorised repair carried out free of charge either for contractual or legal reasons arising from a guarantee, or because of a manufacturing defect.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> authorisation is needed to use this Additional Procedure Code. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence must be held prior to (re)export and produced on request to demonstrate that the repair was carried out free of charge.</p>

<p>Where Additional Procedure Code B51 is used with <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Codes 2200 or 2244, the goods must be in free circulation and home use at the time of (re)export.</p>

<p>Where Additional Procedure Code B51 is used with <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Codes 2151 or 2154, the goods must have been previously entered to Inward Processing (<abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr>).</p>

<p>On re-importation the goods must be re-imported to <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> or the revenue suspended by <abbr title="inward processing">IP</abbr> must be paid at the time of re-importation.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>

<p>Evidence must be held and made available to Customs on request, demonstrating the audit trail between the temporarily exported goods and the subsequent re-importation of the repaired products.</p>

<p>If the goods were known to be defective at the time of original importation and this was reflected in the Customs Valuation at the time, then the goods are not eligible to use this Additional Procedure Code.</p>

<p>Additional Procedure Code, B02, may only be used at re-importation if Additional Procedure Code B51 is used at export.</p>

<p>Where an extended guarantee has been purchased with the goods, or the repair is chargeable, this Additional Procedure Code must not be used.</p>

<p>CAP goods may not be entered to this Additional Procedure Code.</p>

<p>This Additional Procedure code is only to be used for goods exported for repair. Where it is intended that goods will be replaced under guarantee, B52 should be used instead.</p>

<p>This Additional Procedure Code cannot be used for goods being dispatched to a Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union for <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr>.</p>

<p>This Additional Procedure Code cannot be used with VAT only <abbr title="outward processing">OP</abbr> (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Codes B53 or B54).</p>

<p>This Additional Procedure Code cannot be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) regular use or Entry in Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>
