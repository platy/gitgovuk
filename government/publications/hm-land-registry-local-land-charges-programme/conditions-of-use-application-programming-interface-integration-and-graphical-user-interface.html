<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> General Provisions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Access to the API and GUI</h3>

<p>With effect from the Commencement Date, we will provide you with the access to the API/GUI to enable you to establish a connection between your equipment and our system. You will use the API/GUI solely for the permitted purpose and for no other purpose. The API/GUI is provided on an âas isâ basis and we do not warrant or represent that the API/GUI shall be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>free of bugs or error</li>
  <li>uninterrupted, secure, timely or error-free</li>
  <li>compatible with third-party software or equipment</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Meeting the HM Government security classification</h3>

<p>You shall ensure that you have adequate and sufficient equipment with appropriate security controls in accordance with HM Government security classification of the data being handled, to enable you to establish the connection using the API/GUI. You are solely responsible for the development, operation, maintenance and support of your equipment. We shall have no obligations or liability in respect of any defect or failure of your equipment arising out of or in connection with your use of the API and GUI.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> SSL authentication certificate requirements</h3>
<p>You must comply, and continue to comply, with all the requirements for the issue of an SSL authentication certificate in respect of your connection to our system using the API/GUI.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Appointing a technical representative</h3>

<p>You shall appoint a technical representative who shall be responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all communications with Us concerning the use of the API/GUI</li>
  <li>ensuring that appropriate security procedures are in place to prevent unauthorised access to the API/GUI and our system</li>
  <li>recording and reporting security incidents to Us</li>
  <li>co-operating with Us to manage and investigate incidents and to undertake any emergency procedures as instructed by us</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Restrictions of use</h3>

<p>You shall not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>use, or permit the use of, the API or GUI in any way that may adversely affect or corrupt the API/GUI or our system or data (including uploading any material that contains a virus or other malicious code) or which may cause the API/GUI or system to be interrupted, damaged or impaired in anyway</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use the API or GUI in any way which will result in you accessing or retrieving any data which you are not entitled to access</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use or permit the use of any automated software programme (such as (without limitation) a web crawler) through the API or GUI to access the service or to search, monitor or obtain links to any part of the system except where this is necessary in connection with the permitted purpose and has been agreed in advance with us</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use or permit the use of the API or GUI in any way which may infringe the intellectual property rights of HM Land Registry or third parties or for any fraudulent or otherwise unlawful purpose</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make derivative works of, or commercially distribute or otherwise exploit the API or GUI</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decompile, observe, study or test the functioning of the API or GUI, or modify, add to or otherwise enhance the API or GUI, except with our express written agreement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attempt to rectify or permit any person (not authorised by us) to rectify any fault or inaccuracy in the API or GUI</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use the API or GUI in a manner that inaccurately represents that you have an arrangement or official partnership with us in relation to the use of the API or GUI or your service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use the API or GUI or permit it to be used by an authority who does not have a valid user ID</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> API token requirements</h3>

<p>We provide a token to the incumbent supplier/authority to store on your computer system (the âtokenâ). If an unauthorised person gains access to the token, it would make it easier for them to impersonate the authority. If you delete the token, you will be unable to authenticate, and access will be rejected.</p>

<p>You must comply with all the requirements for the issue of an API token about your use of the API. You should make sure appropriate measures are in place to protect your token such as disk encryption, access control or other suitable methods.</p>

<p>If you are an incumbent supplier:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you must ensure that the correct token is used with each corresponding Authority, maintaining accurate audit logs where you have multiple tokens</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you shall notify HM Land Registry if your authority/authorities change(s) so we can revoke the relevant token(s)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are an authority, you shall notify HM Land Registry if your incumbent supplier changes or is no longer used so we can revoke the relevant token.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> Monitoring and auditing</h3>

<p>We shall have the right at any time to monitor or audit  your use of the API/GUI to ensure that You are complying with the conditions of use.  You shall not seek to block or otherwise interfere with such monitoring and any failure to reasonably comply with our auditing of your compliance shall be a material breach of these conditions of use.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> Retaining records</h3>

<p>You will retain full and accurate records in connection with any of your services requested through the API/GUI for a period of at least 7 years. You will permit us to access such records on demand that may be required by us for security or fraud investigation purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span> Authorised person</h3>

<p>You will make sure each authorised person:</p>

<ul>
  <li>uses their individual User ID, where this has been allocated to them by the administrator</li>
  <li>has been properly trained to use the equipment to obtain the services</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the role of an authorised person within an authority changes, the administrator will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review that authorised personâs access rights to the API or GUI</li>
  <li>remove access to the API/GUI for that authorised person within that authority if required</li>
  <li>maintain a formal access control list for authorised persons within the authority</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> User ID restrictions</h3>

<p>You will not allow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>simultaneous access to the system using the same login</li>
  <li>the transfer or sharing of a user ID and password</li>
  <li>another person to access the services using a user ID of an authorised person who has left your organisation</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span> Preventing unauthorised access</h3>

<p>You will notify HM Land Registry immediately if a user ID, token and/or password:</p>

<ul>
  <li>becomes known or accessible to an unauthorised person</li>
  <li>is no longer to be used by the person to whom to which it was allocated</li>
</ul>

<p>On becoming aware of any unauthorised use of or access to the system or use of the services or other breach, you will take reasonable steps to ensure that such use or activity ceases and prevent a recurrence of it.</p>

<p>If a User ID has not been used to gain access to the system for a period of 3 months, HM Land Registry may cancel that user ID without giving prior notice to you.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Changes to the GUI, the API or other systems</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to make changes, updates and modifications to the API and the GUI or other related systems at any time for any reason. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such changes and modifications.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Intellectual property rights</h2>

<p>All intellectual property rights in and to the API and GUI shall vest and remain vested in HM Land Registry (and its licensors, including the Crown).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Data protection</h2>

<p>You must ensure that your collection, use and disclosure of any personal data in connection with your use of the API/ GUI complies with all applicable data protection laws.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Security requirements</h2>

<p>You agree to immediately notify HM Land Registry if you become aware of any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unauthorised access to the API and/or GUI</li>
  <li>information relating to the violation of these conditions of use</li>
</ul>

<p>You will use your best efforts to ascertain the source of any unauthorised access or use and will co-operate with HM Land Registry to gather information about any potential violations of the terms.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Disclaimers and limitations of liability</h2>

<p>Nothing in these conditions of use shall exclude or limit your or HM Land Registryâs liability for fraud, or death or personal injury caused by negligence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Cost of use</h3>

<p>The API and GUI are being provided to you by HM Land Registry free of charge. You accept that HM Land Registry will have no liability arising from your (or your authorityâs) access to or use of the API or the GUI (or HM Land Registryâs termination or suspension of such access and/or use).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Conditions of use losses</h3>

<p>HM Land Registry will not be liable to you for any loss of profits, business, contracts, anticipated savings, goodwill, or revenue, any wasted expenditure, or any loss or corruption of data (regardless of whether any of these types of loss or damage are direct, indirect or consequential).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Disconnection and Suspension</h2>

<p>HM Land Registry may disconnect or temporarily suspend the API and/or GUI without notice in the event of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>urgent essential maintenance or repairs being required to the API/GUI and/or HM Land Registryâs system</li>
  <li>failure of the API/GUI and/or HM Land Registryâs system</li>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> Routine maintenance</h3>
