<p>This note advises private registered providers who own or manage retirement leasehold accommodation of management fee limits for the financial year 2022-23</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>From 1 April 2022:</p>

<p>These limits have been agreed with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, which has policy responsibility in this area.</p>
</div>

<h2>Calculations</h2>

<h3>Basic limit</h3>

<p>The limit on the management element of relevant service charges is recalculated annually, with reference to the Consumer Price Index. This means that the basic limit rises each year by an amount set by Government. For 2022-23 this has been set at <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> + 1%. The annual rate of increase in <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> at September 2021 was 3.1%. Applying the combined amount of 4.1% to the <abbr title="Leasehold schemes for the elderly">LSE</abbr> management fee limit increases the basic limit to £501 for 2022-23 (the limit for 2021-22 was £481).</p>

<h3>Enhanced limit (where <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> is charged)</h3>

<p>A higher limit applies where the landlord contracts out the management element to a property manager who is required to charge <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> on management services. This higher limit is £574 for 2022-23 (the enhanced limit for 2021-22 was £551).</p>

<h3>Value added tax</h3>

<p>No <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> is chargeable on the actual supply by the landlord of residential accommodation to the leaseholder. This limit is concerned with the management element of the charge for services provided by the landlord to leaseholders. When a landlord contracts out management to an agent who is obliged to charge the landlord <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr>, a provider should ensure that the amount collected from the leaseholder in respect of management fee and <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> thereon does not exceed the limit of £574.</p>

<p>The higher limit where <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> is payable is derived as follows. In setting the maximum amount that a landlord taking part in this scheme can charge a leaseholder for the management element of the services which the landlord is obliged to contractually provide the leaseholder under the relevant lease or legislation, consideration is taken of the irrecoverable <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> cost incurred by the landlord on goods and services bought from third parties and which relate directly to the provision of residential accommodation. This “<abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> enhancement factor” that is used in calculating the upper limit of the management element of the service charge that can be charged by the landlord is 14.6%. Enhancing the basic limit by 14.6% produces an enhanced limit of £574 for 2022-23 (this was £551 for 2020-21).</p>

<p>The limits referred to in this announcement are maximum amounts that may be charged under leases. They are separate from the legislation on <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> and no inference should be drawn, about charging for or accounting for <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr>, from the fact that the limit is higher when a landlord employs a managing agent who is required to charge <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> for the management service. It is Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs who are responsible for setting rates of <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr>, the circumstances in which <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> is to be charged and the way in which persons should present <abbr title="Value added tax">VAT</abbr> returns.</p>

<h3>Applicability</h3>

<p>The limit applies to the management element of relevant service charges in leasehold schemes for the elderly, shared ownership for the elderly, and other types of grant-funded retirement leasehold accommodation, only where a clause appears in leases to specify that the limit should apply. The limit does not apply automatically where no such clause appears.</p>

<h3>Good practice</h3>

<p>Good practice on application of the limit and on management of retirement leasehold generally can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.arhm.org/" rel="external">Association of Retirement Housing Managers’ Private Retirement Housing Code of Practice</a>.</p>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>Information about the limit can be obtained from the Referrals and Regulatory Enquiries team at the Regulator of Social Housing by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries@rsh.gov.uk">enquiries@rsh.gov.uk</a>.</p>
