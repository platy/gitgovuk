<h2>What’s changed</h2>

<div aria-label="Important" class="advisory" role="note">
<p><strong>Omicron variant: changes to restrictions<br><br>New measures have been put in place as a precaution, because cases of a variant of concern have been found in the UK. There are changes to the rules in England on self-isolation, testing after international travel, and face coverings. From 4am on Tuesday 30 November, customers and staff are legally required to wear face coverings indoors in shops and on public transport services.<br><br>This guidance will be updated shortly to include more information on these changes.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>What this guidance covers</h2>

<p>This guidance sets out information for the public and sport providers on how to organise and participate in grassroots sport and physical activity as safely as possible. This includes advice on steps you can take to reduce the risk of transmission within the sport environment.</p>

<h2>How to use this guidance</h2>

<p>This document includes guidance for the public, for sport providers and for sport facility operators.</p>

<p>1. <a href="#participation" class="govuk-link"><strong>How to participate safely</strong></a></p>

<p>Information for the public on how to take part safely in grassroots sport and physical activity.</p>

<p>2. <a href="#provision" class="govuk-link"><strong>How to organise grassroots sporting activities safely</strong></a></p>

<p>Information for sport providers on factors to consider when organising grassroots sport and physical activity, whether this is your work, a volunteer role or a personal activity. This includes advice for national governing bodies (NGBs) and other organisations on factors to consider when developing advice or guidance for your sport, including individual sports, team sports, contact combat sports, and sport participation events (such as races and organised walking groups).</p>

<p>3. <a href="#facilities" class="govuk-link"><strong>How to manage a sport facility safely</strong></a></p>

<p>Guidance on how to operate your sport facility safely while reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19, including practical considerations on principles to apply in the workplace.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> How to participate safely</h2>

<p>There are no restrictions on how many people can take part in sport and physical activity, or on the activities they can do. Sport participation events such as races and walks can take place with no capacity caps for participants or spectators provided they can be safely accommodated.</p>

<p>However, there are some steps you should take to reduce the risk of transmission when you are participating.</p>

<h3>Check for COVID-19 symptoms and health conditions</h3>

<p>Before attending any sporting activities, all participants, officials, volunteers and spectators should self-assess for symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a new, continuous cough</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change to, your sense of smell or taste</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have one or more of these symptoms you should not attend any sporting activity, even if your symptoms are mild. You should follow <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">NHS guidance on testing and self-isolation</a>.</p>

<h3>Follow your sport provider’s safety measures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your sport facility or provider may ask you to ‘check in’ using the <a rel="external" href="https://www.covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID-19 app</a> to scan their QR code. This supports NHS Test and Trace, and helps to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your sport provider may ask you to take a COVID-19 test before participating in a match or tournament. This helps them to ensure that sport can take place safely, and that participants are not at risk of catching or spreading the virus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your sport provider may use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID Pass</a>. This allows people to demonstrate that they are at a lower risk of carrying COVID-19 and transmitting it to others, through vaccination, testing or natural immunity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where these types of measures are used, you should follow your provider’s guidance. This will help them to keep everyone as safe as possible, and minimise the risk of transmission at their events so they can continue to provide sport safely.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Take part safely</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You should continue to follow any relevant advice from your NGB or sport provider on how to participate safely in your sport or activity. This may set out different ways to organise matches or tournaments, or measures you should follow like regular breaks to sanitise the ball or other equipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should continue to follow good hygiene practices, to reduce the risk of transmission in sport environments. For example, you should not spit or rinse out your mouth on or around the playing area. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread">guidance on how to stay safe</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should avoid sharing water bottles or other refreshment containers. Where possible, you should take your own drink, in a labelled or highly distinguishable container.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Face coverings are no longer required by law, but people should wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed settings where they come into contact with people they do not normally meet. Where worn correctly, this can reduce the risk of transmission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, you may wish to put on a face covering after your sporting activity if you are in a crowded indoor facility, but you don’t have to wear one during sport. People should not generally wear a face covering while taking part in any strenuous activity or sport, unless advised to do so by a doctor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should avoid sharing equipment where possible and practical, particularly equipment which is used around the head and face (such as masks and helmets). If equipment needs to be shared, it should be cleaned between users, where possible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> How to provide sport and physical activity safely</h2>

<p>This guidance sets out the key principles that you should follow and communicate to providers and participants in your sport or physical activity. This advice applies to all types of sport and physical activity, but further advice is also provided below for team sports, contact combat sports and mass participation events.</p>

<h3>Key principles</h3>

<p>You should ensure that people can participate in your sport safely. You should consider the best way to approach this for your sport, including by issuing guidance (if you are a NGB or sport provider), following any relevant guidance from the sport’s NGB, the sport provider or facility, or by choosing to make your own changes to operating models to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The key principles below should form the basis of any provided guidance.</p>

<h4>1. Communications and guidance</h4>

<p>You should consider how you can inform participants of important information and any changes to processes in advance of the activity, for example on your website, when booking by phone or email, and in your digital marketing. You should consider how to do this in a way that works best for your sport or physical activity provision and is accessible to all, including those with disabilities.</p>

<p>For example, you could email registered participants in advance of a league starting to set out the operational information they should be aware of and safety measures you have chosen to put in place. Then include a brief reminder of any key points or steps they must take in your follow-up communications or social media engagement.</p>

<p>Your communication to participants should include the following points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Self-assessment:</strong> Before attending any sporting activities, all participants, officials, volunteers and spectators should self-assess for COVID-19 symptoms (a high temperature; a new, continuous cough; a loss of, or change to, their sense of smell or taste). If they have one or more of these symptoms (even if they are mild), you should advise them not to attend any sporting activity, and to follow <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">NHS guidance on testing and self-isolation</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Informed decisions:</strong> You should advise participants to consider their own health and circumstances (for example, if they are not yet double-vaccinated or they live with somebody at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19), so they can make an informed choice about whether they wish to participate. You should set out the safety measures you have put in place, and how you will mitigate any specific risks associated with your sporting activity. For example, you could advise participants that you are following your NGB’s guidance, and any safety measures you are putting in place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Self-isolation:</strong> Clearly communicate to participants that they should not take part in your activity if they need to self-isolate (for example, because they have tested positive or are asked to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace). If they are displaying any COVID-19 symptoms (a high temperature; a new, continuous cough; a loss of, or change to, their sense of smell or taste), you should advise them not to attend, even if these symptoms are mild. You may also wish to share guidance on what they should do if they <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">live with</a>, or have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">close contact with</a>, a positive case.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>2. NHS Test and Trace</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Sport providers are no longer required to collect participants’ contact details, or keep records of your staff and visitors.</li>
  <li>However, you are advised to continue to display an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">NHS QR code</a> for participants wishing to check in using the app, to support NHS Test and Trace. You do not have to ask participants to check in, or turn them away if they refuse.</li>
  <li>If you display an NHS QR code, you should also have a system to collect (and securely store) names and contact details for those who ask to check in but do not have the app.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Pre-participation safety measures</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Consider whether you should ask participants to take a COVID-19 test before participating, where this is practical and possible. This can help to ensure your sport provision is as safe as possible, and reduce the risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>You can also consider using the NHS COVID Pass to reduce the risk of transmission. The NHS COVID Pass allows people to demonstrate that they are at a lower risk of carrying COVID-19 and transmitting it to others, through vaccination, testing or natural immunity. It can help organisations to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19.</li>
  <li>The NHS COVID Pass will be available through the NHS App, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-pass/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">the NHS website</a>, or as a letter that can be requested by ringing NHS 119. Participants will also be able to show text or email confirmation of test results.</li>
  <li>If you use the NHS COVID Pass, you should ensure that you comply with all relevant legal obligations and guidance, including on equalities. You can find more information in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID Pass guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>Even when using the NHS COVID Pass, it is still important that you follow the rest of the guidance and put measures in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading at your venue or event.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Hygiene</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You should continue to follow good hygiene practices, to reduce the risk of transmission in sport environments. For example, you should not spit or rinse out your mouth on or around the playing area. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread">guidance on how to stay safe</a>.</li>
  <li>Water bottles or other refreshment containers should not be shared. Advise participants to bring their own water bottle or refreshment container, in a labelled or highly distinguishable container. If you are providing water or other beverages, ensure that these are provided to individuals and are not expected to be shared.</li>
  <li>You should consider whether there are any changes you can make to your sport provision, to reduce the risk of transmission. For example, you could ask teams not to shake hands after the match.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Equipment</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Organise your sport or physical activity sessions to avoid sharing equipment where it is possible and practical, particularly that used around the head and face. Where equipment needs to be shared, it should be cleaned between users.</li>
  <li>You may wish to encourage teams to sanitise balls or other equipment at regular intervals, for example before and after each match, and in half-time or a suitable break in play.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Face coverings</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Face coverings are no longer required by law, but people should wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed settings where they come into contact with people they do not normally meet. Where worn correctly, this can reduce the risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>If a sport facility or venue where your provision takes place recommends the use of face coverings (when not participating in sport or physical activity), ensure this is communicated to your staff and participants.</li>
  <li>People should not generally wear a face covering while taking part in any strenuous activity or sport, unless they have been advised to do so by a physician.</li>
</ul>

<h4>7. Medical provision</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Physios and other medical personnel should ensure that equipment and surfaces are frequently cleaned and disinfected, and maintain hygiene standards when treating participants.</li>
  <li>Where close face-to-face contact is required, medical personnel may decide that they and patients should wear a face covering. This is particularly important when they are conducting treatments which require them to be in close proximity to a person’s face, mouth and nose.</li>
  <li>After contact with an injured participant, physios and other medical personnel should clean their hands thoroughly with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser at the earliest opportunity. This applies in all situations, regardless of whether there was close contact.</li>
  <li>Those working at a sport event should familiarise themselves with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov" class="govuk-link">guidance for first responders</a>, in case of emergency situations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>8. Facility usage</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Providers which work with or operate facilities should ensure they are familiar with the guidance for sport facilities below. This sets out information on ventilation and other important steps you can take to reduce transmission.</li>
  <li>Where there is no facility operator (such as sport in a public park), the sport provider should review the guidance and consider following any relevant advice to reduce the risk of transmission.</li>
</ul>

<h4>9. Sporting events</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If you are organising grassroots sport events, or expect a significant number of spectators, you should review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a> and follow any relevant measures to reduce the risk of transmission at your event.</li>
  <li>You can also use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-management-template-for-event-organisers" class="govuk-link">risk management template</a> to help you plan your event.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advice for specific sports and events</h3>

<h4>Team sports</h4>

<ul>
  <li>There are no restrictions on how many people can take part in sport and physical activity, or on the activities they can do. This means there are no restrictions on how team sports can take place, and how sports such as rugby union, rugby league and netball can be organised.</li>
  <li>NGBs and sport providers should maintain COVID-specific guidance for participants on how to participate safely in your sport, which should be reviewed and updated as required to ensure that sport providers and participants are clear on the current advice and best practice. This guidance does not need to be reviewed by the government.</li>
  <li>NGBs and sport providers may wish to consider setting out alternative ways for people to participate, for those who do not feel comfortable with full versions of your sport but still wish to take part. For example, this could include training but not taking part in matches, or providing an alternative activity or light-contact version for some participants while others take part in full contact activity. You should consider the approach which works best for your sport, and encourage providers to discuss and agree an approach with their participants that works for them.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Contact combat sports</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Contact combat sport activities can resume full contact training and competitions for adults and children both indoors and outdoors.</li>
  <li>NGBs for contact combat sports should maintain COVID-specific guidance for participants on how to participate safely in your sport, which should be reviewed and updated as required to ensure that sport providers and participants are clear on the current advice and best practice. This guidance does not need to be reviewed by the government.</li>
  <li>NGBs and sport providers should consider whether it is necessary to provide guidance on measures to reduce risk. For example, you could consider:
    <ul>
      <li>Advising those in supporting roles (e.g. holding pads) to wear face coverings, where this is possible and practical.</li>
      <li>Advising participants to consider the number of different people they engage in full contact activity with.</li>
      <li>Advising coaches or officials to limit the number of groups or facilities they work with.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You may also wish to set out the different ways people can participate, or for different types of activity. For example, if people do not wish to take part in full contact activity, it may be helpful to have a framework for the different ways of participating in your sport. The following framework may be helpful:
    <ul>
      <li>Non-contact training: training individually, no activity with others, including with equipment (such as pad work).</li>
      <li>Equipment training: training with others, using handheld and wearable equipment (such as pad work).</li>
      <li>Contact training: contact training which includes some direct physical contact between participants.</li>
      <li>Full contact / competition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Sport participation events</h4>

<p>Sport participation events such as races, rides and walks can take place outdoors with no capacity caps for participants or spectators. In addition to your usual event organisation processes, you should ensure that you take steps to keep everyone safe, and reduce the risk of transmission at your events so you can continue to provide sport and physical activity safely.</p>

<p>As there continues to be a risk of infection from COVID-19,businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to those affected by their business. The way to do this is to carry out a health and safety risk assessment including the risk of COVID-19, and put in place measures to reduce the risks you identify. You should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>, which sets out advice on the risks you should take into account when managing events, along with options for managing and reducing these risks and a risk management checklist to help you plan your event. You can also use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-management-template-for-event-organisers">risk management template</a> to help you plan your event.</p>

<p>When planning your event, you should take into account the following factors:</p>

<p><strong>Do not admit customers or spectators who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>If a participant or spectator presents with symptoms, or you become aware of a case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 on-site,</strong> they should not be admitted or should be asked to leave the facility or event, unless they need to be transported to hospital for treatment. The customer should be advised to self-isolate in line with <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">NHS guidelines</a> and to take a PCR test.</li>
  <li>Where possible, the individual should be assessed on-site (by a medical professional, if you have this provision). Unless they are in need of urgent medical attention and need to be transported to hospital for treatment, they should be encouraged to take a supervised lateral flow test. Any customer returning a positive result from a lateral flow test must be required to leave the facility or event. They should be advised to self-isolate in line with <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">NHS guidelines</a> and to take a PCR test.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider encouraging customers and spectators to wear face coverings,</strong> for example through signage, if your event is likely to include enclosed and crowded spaces.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Face coverings are no longer required by law, but the government expects and recommends that people should continue to wear them in crowded and enclosed settings, to protect themselves and others.</strong> Where worn correctly, this can reduce the risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Your workers may choose to wear a face covering, particularly if they are likely to come into contact with a lot of people during the event.</strong> You should support them in doing so, and ensure they are aware of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">guidance on using face coverings safely</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Consider recommending the use of face coverings by workers and spectators as a safety measure,</strong> in enclosed and crowded spaces where they may come into contact with people they don’t normally meet.When deciding whether you will ask workers or spectators to wear face coverings:
    <ul>
      <li>You need to consider the reasonable adjustments needed for workers and spectators with disabilities. You also need to carefully consider how this fits with other obligations to workers and spectators arising from the law on employment rights, health and safety and equality legislation.</li>
      <li>You should not ask people to wear face coverings while taking part in any strenuous activity or sport.</li>
      <li>Remember that some people are not able to wear face coverings, and the reasons for this may not be visible to others. Please be mindful and respectful of such circumstances. Be aware that face coverings may make it harder to communicate with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider displaying an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">NHS QR code poster</a></strong> so that customers can check in using the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are no longer required to collect customer contact details, or keep a record of your staff and visitors.</li>
  <li>However, you are advised to continue to display an NHS QR code for customers wishing to check in using the app, as this will help to reduce the spread of the virus and protect your customers, visitors and staff. You do not have to ask customers to check in, or turn them away if they refuse.</li>
  <li>If you display an NHS QR code, you should also have a system to collect (and securely store) names and contact details, for those who ask to check in but who do not have access to a smartphone or who prefer not to use the app.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider whether you should put in place safety measures to reduce the risk of transmission.</strong> For example, you could consider ways to distribute chips and medals which don’t require contact between large groups of people. You could also consider organising bag-drops and equipment storage to minimise crowding and shared handling, and ensure hand sanitiser is provided. You can find more advice on the types of measures which may be appropriate for your event in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance on events and attractions</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure that any safety measures are communicated clearly and consistently</strong> to all participants and support staff, including volunteers. You can find advice about how to do this in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance on events and attractions</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Consider how any safety measures will affect participants, staff and attendees with protected characteristics, and any adjustments you should make.</strong> You should also consider whether any special provisions should be made for children and young people under the age of 18 and vulnerable adults, if this is relevant to your event.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure that there is sufficient access to toilet facilities (particularly for those with special needs and disabilities), and that they are well-ventilated and frequently cleaned.</strong> Particular care should be taken to clean portable toilets and larger toilet blocks.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Consider how best to provide refreshments during the event.</strong> Water bottles or other refreshment containers should not be shared between participants.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ensure that any amenities at the event follow the relevant guidance,</strong> such as hospitality services (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/restaurants-offering-takeaway-or-delivery" class="govuk-link">guidance for restaurants, pubs, bars, nightclubs and takeaway services</a>) and retail outlets (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/shops-and-branches" class="govuk-link">guidance for shops, branches, and close contact services</a>).</p>

<h3>Priority actions to take</h3>

<p>Six steps you can take to protect yourself, your staff and your customers during coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Complete a health and safety risk assessment that includes risks from COVID-19.</strong> This should consider the points below in the rest of this guidance. It should also take into account any reasonable adjustments needed for staff and customers with disabilities. You should share your risk assessment with your staff. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#risk">section on risk assessments</a> and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/risk-assessment.htm">HSE guidance</a>. There is additional advice for event organisers in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">events and attractions guidance</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn people with COVID-19 symptoms away.</strong> Staff members, customers and participants who have symptoms of COVID-19  (a new, persistent cough; a high temperature; or loses/has changes to their sense of taste or smell) should self-isolate and take a PCR test, even if these symptoms are mild. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#workplace">section on managing your workplace</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide adequate ventilation.</strong> You should make sure there is a supply of fresh air to enclosed spaces where there are people present. This can be natural ventilation through windows, doors and vents, mechanical ventilation using fans and ducts, or a combination of both. You should identify any poorly ventilated spaces in your premises and consider steps you can take to improve fresh air flow in these areas. In some places, a CO2 monitor can help identify if the space is poorly ventilated. You can find more information in the <a href="#facility" class="govuk-link">section on managing your facility</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm" class="govuk-link">HSE guidance on ventilation and air conditioning during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean more often.</strong> Increase how often you clean surfaces, especially those that are touched a lot. You should ask your staff and customers to use hand sanitiser and clean their hands frequently, and provide them with advice to promote good hygiene. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#facility">section on managing your facility</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable people to check in at your venue.</strong> You are no longer legally required to collect contact details, however doing so will help to support NHS Test and Trace to reduce the spread of the virus. You can enable people to check in by providing an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">NHS QR code</a>, though you do not have to ask customers to check in or turn them away if they refuse. If you display an NHS QR code, you should also have a system to collect (and securely store) names and contact details for those who ask to check in but do not have the app. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#customers">section on reducing risk to customers</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communicate and train.</strong> Keep all your workers, contractors and visitors up-to-date on how you’re using and updating safety measures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the priority actions to make your business safer during coronavirus (COVID-19). You should also read the full version of the guidance below, and review the guidance for any additional facilities within your premises or event, including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/restaurants-pubs-bars-nightclubs-and-takeaway-services" class="govuk-link">hospitality venues (such as cafes and bars)</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">events and attractions</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/shops-branches-and-close-contact-services" class="govuk-link">shops, branches and close contact services</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/offices-factories-and-labs" class="govuk-link">offices, factories and labs</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/construction-and-other-outdoor-work" class="govuk-link">construction and other outdoor work</a>. You may also want to check with relevant organisations in your sector, who may have tailored advice for specific types of facility or business.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This document gives you guidance on how to open workplaces safely while reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19. It provides practical considerations on how to apply this in a sport facility.</p>

<p>This guidance supports your existing legal obligations relating to health and safety, employment and equality duties. This document contains non-statutory guidance that you should take into account when complying with these existing obligations, to ensure you are working safely by reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</p>

<p>Remember this guidance does not just cover your workers. You must also take into account agency workers, contractors, volunteers and customers or users of your business or venue.</p>

<p>To help you decide which actions to take, you must carry out an appropriate assessment. This risk assessment must be done in consultation with unions or workers; you may also want to consult industry representatives.</p>

<h3>Who this guidance is for</h3>

<p>This guidance applies to all indoor and outdoor sport facilities, including indoor gyms and leisure centres, sport courts and pitches, swimming pools, fitness studios, golf courses and other single or multi-sport facilities.</p>

<p>This guidance does not apply to facilities which can be used for sport but are primarily used for leisure (such as trampoline parks, bowling alleys), or which provide physical activity which is not a recognised sport. These types of facilities should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>. It does not apply to children’s playgrounds, which should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-playgrounds-and-outdoor-gyms/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-playgrounds-and-outdoor-gyms" class="govuk-link">guidance for outdoor gyms and playgrounds</a>.</p>

<h3>Risk assessments</h3>

<p>As an employer, by law you must protect workers and others (including contractors, volunteers and customers/users) from risks to their health and safety. This includes risks from COVID-19. COVID-19 is a workplace hazard. You should manage it in the same way as other workplace hazards. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completing a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks of COVID-19 in the workplace</li>
  <li>identifying control measures to manage that risk</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Failure to carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, and put in place control measures to manage the risk of COVID-19 in the workplace, may be considered a breach of health and safety law.</p>
</div>

<p>Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">tools to support you</a>.</p>

<p>You should also consider the security implications of any decisions and control measures you intend to put in place. Any revisions could present new or altered security risks you may need to mitigate.</p>

<p>You do not have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have fewer than 5 workers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are self-employed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, you may still find it useful to do so.</p>

<h4>Consult your workers</h4>

<p>As an employer, you have a legal duty to consult workers on health and safety matters. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work they do and how you will manage the risks from COVID-19.</p>

<p>You may do this by consulting with any recognised trade union health and safety representatives.</p>

<p>If you do not have any, you can consult with a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be.</p>

<p>Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If you cannot do this, see below for other steps you can take.</p>

<h4>Raising concerns</h4>

<p>If you’re an employee, you can contact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your employee representative</li>
  <li>your trade union if you have one</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also contact HSE’s COVID-19 enquiries team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>online: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hsegov.microsoftcrmportals.com/workingsafelyenquiries/" rel="external">working safely enquiry form</a>
</li>
  <li>telephone: 0300 790 6787 (Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 5pm)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Enforcement</h4>

<p>Enforcing authorities identify employers who do not take action to comply with the relevant law and guidance to control public health risks. When they do, they can take a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. The HSE and your local authority are examples of enforcing authorities.</p>

<p>When they identify serious breaches, enforcing authorities can do a number of things. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sending you a letter.</li>
  <li>serving you with an improvement or prohibition notice.</li>
  <li>bringing a prosecution against you, in cases where they identify significant breaches.</li>
</ul>

<p>If an enforcing authority issues you with any advice or notices, you should respond rapidly and within their timescales. Inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/750/made" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 3) Regulations 2020</a>, local authorities continue to have the power to place public health restrictions on businesses in cases where there is a serious and imminent threat to public health posed by COVID-19. However, coronavirus legislation does not impose any restrictions on the types of events which can take place, and local authorities may only exercise those powers by issuing a direction where that is necessary in public health terms, and any prohibitions, requirements or conditions imposed by the Direction are proportionate to the risk. Further information is available in the section on working with partners and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-powers-to-impose-restrictions-under-coronavirus-regulations/local-authority-powers-to-impose-restrictions-health-protection-coronavirus-restrictions-england-no3-regulations-2020" class="govuk-link">guidance on local authority powers to impose restrictions</a>.</p>

<h4>What to include in your risk assessment</h4>

<p>To carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, you should consider the different ways the virus can be spread (aerosols, droplets and surfaces) and put in place measures to reduce the risk of each type of transmission. An example of the factors you should consider is included in the box below.</p>

<p>You will need to translate this into the specific actions you need to take. These will depend on the nature of your business, including the size and type of business, how it is organised, operated and managed.</p>

<p>Some activities can increase the risk of catching or passing on COVID-19. This happens where people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe heavily, such as singing, dancing, exercising or raising their voices. You should consider the specific risks of your facility or event, and take additional care to manage situations where there is a higher risk of catching or passing on COVID-19.</p>

<p>This applies to sport facilities as well as to events you may hold at your facility. If you are organising events, you should also consider the risk factors identified by the Events Research Programme when undertaking risk assessments for their particular event or premises. These are set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a>, along with options for managing and reducing these risks and a risk management template to help you plan your event.</p>

<p>Your risk assessment should also include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An up-to-date plan for what you will do in the event of an outbreak in your workplace. This includes nominating a member of staff as the single point of contact who will contact local public health teams. You can find more information and resources on handling outbreaks in the section on COVID-19 cases in the workplace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensuring that workers, customers and visitors who feel unwell do not come to the workplace. By law, businesses must not require a worker who is legally required to self-isolate to work anywhere other than where they are self-isolating (normally their home).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Risks arising from periods of closure. If your building is unoccupied or has reduced occupancy during a period of restrictions, you should take steps to manage any risks that could arise when reopening (for example, by reviewing <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/legionella-risks-during-coronavirus-outbreak.htm">HSE’s guidance on the risk of legionella</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact of your policies on groups who have protected characteristics, and to those who are more at risk of being infected with COVID-19 or have a higher risk of serious illness.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Risks to consider</strong></p>

<p><strong>Aerosol and droplet transmission</strong></p>

<p>The main way of spreading COVID-19 is through close contact with an infected person. When someone with COVID-19 breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they release particles (droplets and aerosols) containing the virus that causes COVID-19. These particles can be breathed in by another person.</p>

<p>To reduce aerosol transmission, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How best to increase ventilation in your facility. There are different ways of providing ventilation, including mechanical ventilation using fans and ducts, natural ventilation which relies on passive flow through openings (doors, windows, vents) or a combination of the two. Open doors, windows and air vents where possible, to improve natural ventilation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identifying any poorly ventilated spaces and taking steps to improve fresh air flow in these areas. A CO2 monitor could help you assess whether a space is poorly ventilated, and if you should switch on additional mechanical ventilation or open windows. If you can’t improve ventilation in poorly ventilated spaces, consider restricting the number of people in these spaces or stop using them if possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encouraging the use of outdoor space wherever possible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce droplet transmission, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Putting in place measures to reduce contact between people, particularly between customers and workers. Where practical, measures could include: <br> - Keeping the activity time involved as short as possible <br> - Using screens or barriers to separate people (which can be beneficial if placed between people who will come into close proximity with each other) or using back-to-back or side-to-side working for your staff, instead of face-to-face. <br> - Reducing the number of people your workers have contact with, for example by using fixed teams, partnering or cohorting, so that each person works with only a few others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommending the use of face coverings by workers or customers, particularly in enclosed and crowded spaces. There is no longer a legal requirement for staff and customers to wear face coverings in any setting, so you should review the section on face coverings to understand what this would mean for your business.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Surface transmission</strong></p>

<p>Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated with COVID-19, when people who are infected cough or sneeze near them or if they touch them.
To reduce surface transmission, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Advising customers and workers to wash their hands or use hand sanitiser frequently. This is particularly important before and after touching shared objects or surfaces that other people touch regularly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintaining regular cleaning of surfaces, particularly surfaces that people touch regularly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providing additional handwashing facilities and hand sanitiser, particularly in high-traffic or higher-risk areas, such as reception and entrance foyers, doorways, lifts and bathroom facilities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Managing your workplace</h3>

<h4>Testing and vaccination</h4>

<p><strong>You should continue to put measures in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission</strong>. This is important even if your workers have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>received a recent negative test result</li>
  <li>had the vaccine (either 1 or 2 doses)</li>
  <li>natural immunity. This is proof of a positive PCR within 180 days (and after the 10 days isolation period).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider asking your employees or volunteers to get tested regularly.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Anyone with symptoms should get a</strong> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test"><strong>free NHS test</strong></a> <strong>as soon as possible.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employees who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 can access regular testing free of charge at home or at a test site. <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Read guidance on accessing tests if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can also pay an approved provider to provide tests or run a test site for your workplace. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-workplace-coronavirus-tests">Read guidance on getting COVID-19 tests for your employees</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers-and-third-party-healthcare-providers" class="govuk-link">options for workplace testing</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Regular testing could help identify more positive cases of COVID-19 in the workplace. Read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers-and-third-party-healthcare-providers" class="govuk-link">further guidance on your options for workplace testing</a>, or call 119 for more information.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 cases in the workplace</h4>

<p><strong>Ensure that you have an up-to-date plan setting out the steps to take if a case of COVID-19 is reported in your facility</strong>. This should be set out in your risk register, and should include the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People who are fully vaccinated, or (1) are aged under 18 and 6 months, (2) have taken part in, or are currently part of, an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial, or (3) are unable to get vaccinated due to medical reasons do not need to self-isolate if they’ve had <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-workplace-guidance#close-contacts" class="govuk-link">close contact</a> with someone who has COVID-19. If they get any COVID-19 symptoms, they should self-isolate immediately and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">get a PCR test</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that any workers who have symptoms leave the facility immediately to take a PCR test, and self-isolate while they wait for the result.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a customer presents with symptoms, or you become aware of a case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 on-site, they should not be admitted or should be asked to leave the facility or event, unless they need to be transported to hospital for treatment. The customer should be advised to self-isolate in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" rel="external">NHS guidelines</a> and to take a PCR test.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Where possible, the customer should be assessed on-site (by a medical professional, if you have this provision). Unless they are in need of urgent medical attention and need to be transported to hospital for treatment, they should be encouraged to take a supervised lateral flow test. Any customer returning a positive result from a lateral flow test must be required to leave the facility or event. They should be advised to self-isolate in line with <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS guidelines</a> and to take a PCR test.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inform your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">local authority public health team</a>. Where possible, nominate a single point of contact to lead on contacting local public health teams. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure your facility is thoroughly cleaned. Follow the measures set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance for cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ensure that you and your staff are aware of any relevant guidance,</strong> such as the guidance for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>People who have been in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19</a>
</li>
      <li>People who <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">live with someone who has or might have COVID-19</a>
</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-workplace-guidance" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace in the workplace</a></li>
      <li>Statutory sick pay due to COVID-19 (there is different guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay">employers</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay" class="govuk-link">employees</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If the local health protection team declares an outbreak:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You will be asked to record details of staff with symptoms of COVID-19 and assist with identifying contacts. You should therefore ensure all employment records are up to date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will be provided with information about the outbreak management process. This will help you to implement control measures, assist with communications to staff and reinforce prevention messages.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Clearly set out that workers who have symptoms or who are self-isolating should not come into the workplace.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is illegal to knowingly allow someone who is being required to self-isolate to come to work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can enable workers to work from home while self-isolating, if this is appropriate and they are feeling well enough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Review guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay" class="govuk-link">employers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay">employees</a> on statutory sick pay due to COVID-19.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure you and your staff are familiar with the symptoms of COVID-19 (a high temperature, a new and persistent cough, or a loss of/change to their sense of taste or smell). If a staff member (or someone in their household) has coronavirus symptoms, they should self-isolate and get a test, even if these symptoms are mild. Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a free NHS test</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>People who test positive but have no symptoms must also self-isolate. You can find more information in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infections</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Going to the workplace</h4>

<p>Since Step 4, we have seen a gradual return to offices and workplaces. As workers return to their workplaces, employers should continue to follow the Working Safely guidance. When considering a return to the workplace, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>reflect this in your risk assessment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take action to manage the risks of transmission in line with this guidance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We recognise that ways of working have shifted through the pandemic, and many employers are looking at hybrid models which include an element of home working. You should discuss the timing and phasing of any return with workers and unions, to make working arrangements that meet both business and individual needs. To help them to feel safe returning to work, consult them on any measures you have put in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.</p>

<p>You should remain responsive to employee needs, and continue to use measures that help to reduce the risks to individuals in the workplace, giving extra consideration to people at higher risk and to workers facing mental and physical health difficulties.</p>

<h4>Reducing risk to your workers</h4>

<p><strong>Reduce the number of people your workers come into contact with</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Review layouts and processes to reduce the number of people your workers come into contact with. In particular, consider whether you can reduce contact between workers and customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This might include using screens or barriers to separate people (which can be beneficial if placed between people who will come into close proximity with each other) or using back-to-back or side-to-side working for your staff, instead of face-to-face.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider the impact of your policies on your workers.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide clear, consistent and regular communication to workers of any relevant safety measures or changes to policy/procedure. Engage with workers and worker representatives to explain and agree any changes in working arrangements.</li>
  <li>Consider how this will affect staff with protected characteristics, and any adjustments you should make to take account of your duties under the equalities legislation.</li>
  <li><strong>It is breaking the law to discriminate, directly or indirectly, against anyone because of a protected characteristic such as age, ethnicity, sex or disability. Employers also have particular responsibilities towards disabled workers and those who are new or expectant mothers.</strong></li>
  <li>Discuss with disabled employees what reasonable adjustments can be made to the workplace so they can work safely.</li>
  <li>Assess the health and safety risks for new or expectant mothers.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the steps you take do not have an unjustifiable negative impact on some groups compared to others, for example, those with caring responsibilities or those with religious commitments.</li>
  <li>Involve and communicate appropriately with workers whose protected characteristics might either expose them to a different degree of risk, or might make any steps you are thinking about inappropriate or challenging for them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Encourage attendees to wear face coverings,</strong> for example through signage, if your facility or event is likely to include enclosed and crowded spaces.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Face coverings are no longer required by law. However, people should wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed settings where they come into contact with people they do not normally meet.</strong> Where worn correctly, this can reduce the risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Your workers may choose to wear a face covering in the workplace.</strong> You should support them in doing so, and ensure they are aware of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">guidance on using face coverings safely</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consider recommending the use of face coverings by workers and customers as a safety measure,</strong> in enclosed and crowded spaces where they may come into contact with people they don’t normally meet. When deciding whether you will recommend that workers or customers wear face coverings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You need to consider the reasonable adjustments needed for workers and customers with disabilities. You also need to carefully consider how this fits with other obligations to workers and customers arising from the law on employment rights, health and safety and equality legislation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You should not ask people to wear face coverings while taking part in any strenuous activity or sport.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remember that some people are not able to wear face coverings, and the reasons for this may not be visible to others. Please be mindful and respectful of such circumstances. Be aware that face coverings may make it harder to communicate with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider through your risk assessment whether your workers need personal protective equipment (PPE).</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If your event includes staff providing close contact services (such as medical personnel, massage therapists, security staff, hair and makeup technicians and beauticians), you may decide that clients and/or staff should wear a face covering, especially where practitioners are conducting treatments which require them to be in close proximity to a person’s face, mouth and nose. You should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/shops-branches-and-close-contact-services">guidance for close contact services</a> and take account of the risks to staff and customers.</li>
  <li>Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non-COVID-19 risks, you should keep doing so.</li>
  <li>Do not encourage the precautionary use of extra PPE to protect against COVID-19 unless you are in a clinical setting or responding to a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. Unless you’re in a situation where the risk of COVID-19 spreading is very high, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that PPE has an extremely limited role in providing extra protection.</li>
  <li>If your risk assessment does show that PPE is required, you must provide this PPE free of charge to workers who need it. Any PPE provided must fit properly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing your customers</h3>

<h4>Communications and guidance</h4>

<p><strong>Take steps to ensure that customers who have symptoms or who are self-isolating do not attend your facility.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly communicate that customers should not come to your facility if they need to self-isolate or because they are displaying any COVID-19 symptoms (a high temperature, new and persistent cough, or a loss of/change in sense of taste or smell), even if these symptoms are mild.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Customers should be informed that if they, or anyone they live with, have one or more of these symptoms should follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">guidance on testing and self-isolation</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ensure customers know how to visit your venue or event safely.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider how you can inform visitors of any changes to processes in advance of their visit, for example on your website, when booking by phone or email, and in your digital marketing.</li>
  <li>Ensure you make any entry requirements clear to customers before booking, and at the point of sale.</li>
  <li>Take steps to remind visitors of special measures if they are complex, varied or likely to be forgotten. For example, you could reinforce messages on signs through spoken communication from reception staff.</li>
  <li>Think about how to communicate important information to all of your customers, for example those who do not speak English as a first language, and those with protected characteristics (such as people who are hard of hearing or visually impaired).</li>
  <li>Encourage customers to follow good hygiene practices, such as using hand sanitiser when they enter the building and washing their hands regularly. Consider how to ensure safety messages reach those with hearing or vision impairments.</li>
  <li>Pre-event communications can be a particularly effective measure for events. You can find further advice about communications for events in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">events and attractions guidance</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reducing risk to customers</h4>

<p><strong>Do not admit customers who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>If a customer presents with symptoms, or you become aware of a case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 on-site,</strong> they should not be admitted or should be asked to leave the facility or event, unless they need to be transported to hospital for treatment. The customer should be advised to self-isolate in line with <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/">NHS guidelines</a> and to take a PCR test.</li>
  <li>Where possible, the customer should be assessed on-site (by a medical professional, if you have this provision). Unless they are in need of urgent medical attention and need to be transported to hospital for treatment, they should be encouraged to take a supervised lateral flow test. Any customer returning a positive result from a lateral flow test must be required to leave the facility or event. They should be advised to self-isolate in line with <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS guidelines</a> and to take a PCR test.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider displaying an</strong> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster"><strong>NHS QR code poster</strong></a> <strong>so that customers can check in using the NHS COVID-19 app.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You are no longer required to collect customer contact details, or keep a record of your staff and visitors.</li>
  <li>However, you are advised to continue to display an NHS QR code for customers wishing to check in using the app, as this will help to reduce the spread of the virus and protect your customers, visitors and staff. You do not have to ask customers to check in, or turn them away if they refuse.</li>
  <li>If you display an NHS QR code, you should also have a system to collect (and securely store) names and contact details, for those who ask to check in but who do not have access to a smartphone or who prefer not to use the app.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider how best to reduce risks to customers.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimise unnecessary contact. You could do this by using online booking and pre-payment, and encouraging contactless payments wherever possible.</li>
  <li>Ensure that any measures you put in place are suitable for your site or event. There will be additional factors to consider if you are holding sporting events with large numbers of spectators. You can find additional information in the section on <a href="#spectators" class="govuk-link">managing customers and spectators</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing customers and spectators</h4>

<p><strong>Capacity</strong></p>

<p>There are no capacity caps on the number of people who can enter a sport facility or attend a sport event, beyond your facility’s usual operating capacity. However, you may wish to take steps to ensure customers can attend as safely as possible, for example by introducing one-way systems to minimise crowding.</p>

<p>These are likely to be specific to your type of venue or event, so you should think about the most appropriate steps you could take to manage risk.</p>

<p>For example, you could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Consider how you can reduce risk to staff who work with large numbers of guests.</strong> For example, installing screens can be beneficial if placed between people who will come into close proximity with each other. You could consider installing screens at receptions, and providing hand sanitiser for staff and customers.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Consider using a CO2 monitor to assess whether there is sufficient ventilation in your venue.</strong> If you identify that ventilation is poor you should take steps to improve fresh air flow. If you cannot increase the supply of fresh air, you should consider whether you can reduce the number of people in your venue or the relevant area. For example, you may wish to limit capacity in enclosed spaces where high intensity exercise takes place, as strenuous activities pose an increased risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Identify areas of crowding and consider what steps can be taken to avoid congestion,</strong> if they present a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission. For example, you could limit the number of people using a small weights room or studio, or shower and changing facilities, at the same time. You could also reduce class sizes or amend timetabling to prevent crowding and allow for cleaning studios or equipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>In stadiums, auditoriums and theatre-style settings, consider:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Providing allocated seating where possible.</strong> You should ensure that your facility is accessible (in line with your responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010) and that seating arrangements take into account the needs of people with disabilities and wheelchair users, and support from carers. You should also consider how seating arrangements work with any other accessibility services you offer, such as access to captioning or audio description services.</li>
      <li>
<strong>Where allocated seating is not possible, consider other ways to reduce these risks,</strong> such as additional stewarding. You can find more information in the section on crowd management and events.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Crowd management and events</strong></p>

<p>If you are hosting events, including grassroots sport events with large numbers of spectators, you should also review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>. This guidance recommends taking additional steps to manage risk if the event site or venue includes one or more of the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is taking place indoors;</li>
  <li>is taking place outdoors, but also has indoor spaces;</li>
  <li>includes congested areas;</li>
  <li>involves free movement between people;</li>
  <li>includes crowd density; or</li>
  <li>has a large number of attendees.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find further advice about the types of measures you can put in place (such as crowd movement strategies and stewarding) to manage risks in these types of events in the events and attractions guidance, along with a risk management template to help you plan your event.</p>

<h3>Managing your facility</h3>

<h4>Cleaning</h4>

<p>Frequent cleaning of surfaces, particularly those that people touch often, reduces the potential for COVID-19 to spread and is a critical part of working safely.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure you are maintaining clean workspaces</strong> through regular use of your usual cleaning products.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Frequently clean surfaces, particularly those that people touch often.</strong> Pay particular attention to those in high-traffic areas, such as door handles, lift buttons and handrails.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Frequently clean changing rooms, showers and toilet facilities.</strong> Set clear use and cleaning guidance to ensure they are kept clean, including putting up a visible and up-to-date cleaning schedule. Special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets and larger toilet blocks.</li>
  <li>
<strong>You should take particular care to clean water fountains,</strong> and ask customers to use them to fill up personal containers and not for face-to-tap drinking.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Regularly clean shared equipment,</strong> between users where this is practical. For example, cleaning saunas, steam rooms and equipment used in exercise classes between sessions.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure that customers are aware of relevant cleaning measures.</strong> If you expect customers to clean gym equipment (such as fixed machines, ballet bars and large equipment handles), place visible notices to remind them to do so, and ensure they have the materials they will need (such as sprays and paper towels).</li>
  <li>
<strong>Physios and other medical personnel should ensure that equipment and surfaces are frequently cleaned and disinfected,</strong> and maintain hygiene standards when treating participants. Where close face-to-face contact is required, medical personnel and patients may wish to wear face coverings.</li>
  <li>
<strong>If you are cleaning after a known or suspected case of COVID-19,</strong> follow the measures set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">guidance for cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hygiene</h4>

<p>Good hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing, play a crucial role in reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Put in place hygiene measures to reduce the risk of transmission. This should include providing handwashing facilities and hand sanitiser,</strong> particularly in high-traffic or higher-risk areas, such as reception and entrance foyers, doorways, lifts and bathroom facilities. This could include placing hand sanitiser stations at the entrances of different buildings or areas within your event site.</li>
  <li><strong>Ensure handwashing facilities or hand sanitiser stations are available near shared facilities, equipment and objects.</strong></li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure that handwashing and hand sanitiser facilities are checked and refilled regularly,</strong> and that any equipment placed is accessible to (and does not impede) wheelchair users.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Maintain good hygiene practices, such as encouraging staff and customers to use hand sanitiser and wash their hands regularly.</strong> You could use signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing technique, the need to increase handwashing frequency, and good hygiene practices like avoiding touching your face and coughing or sneezing into your arm. Consider how to ensure safety messages reach those with hearing or vision impairments.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Put in place measures to address hygiene risks in your facility.</strong> For example, you should prohibit face-to-tap drinking from water fountains, and ensure customers are aware they should be used only to refill personal bottles or containers. You should advise customers that water bottles or other refreshment containers should not be shared.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Consider customer behaviour and take steps to address any high-risk or unhygienic activity.</strong> For example, spitting could increase the risk of transmission, so you should ask customers not to spit when using pitches or other facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ventilation</h4>

<p>In enclosed spaces (such as indoor settings, or indoor areas of outdoor venues), ventilation is an important control measure to reduce the risk of aerosol transmission of COVID-19. You should consider how best to increase ventilation in your facility, to maximise the supply of fresh or cleaned air. However, ventilation will not reduce the risk of droplet or surface transmission, so you should also put in place other control measures such as cleaning.</p>

<p>Steps you should take:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Open doors, windows and air vents</strong> where possible, to improve natural ventilation, and ensure extractor fans work effectively. You should take particular care to keep toilets and shower facilities well-ventilated, as these can be areas of higher risk.</li>
  <li>
<strong>If using mechanical ventilation, ensure that your systems are set to maximise fresh air and minimise air recirculation.</strong> Maximising the amount of fresh or cleaned air the system draws in will help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Take particular care to keep toilets and shower facilities well-ventilated,</strong> as these can be areas of higher risk, especially where these are shared facilities. Open doors, windows and air vents where possible, and ensure extractor fans work effectively.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Identify any poorly ventilated spaces and taking steps to improve fresh air flow in these areas.</strong> The priority for your risk assessment is to identify areas of your workplace that are usually occupied, and poorly ventilated. You should prioritise these areas for improvement to reduce the risk of aerosol transmission. A CO2 monitor could help you assess whether a space is poorly ventilated, and if you should use additional mechanical ventilation or open windows (see the box below for further information on CO2 monitors). If you can’t improve ventilation in poorly ventilated spaces, consider whether it is safer to restrict the number of people in these spaces or stop using them if possible.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Encourage the use of outside space where practical,</strong> in particular for higher-risk activity such as strenuous exercise or sports involving close face-to-face contact between participants.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information and advice relating to ventilation in the workplace can be found in the Health and Safety Executive’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation.htm" rel="external">guidance on ventilation and air conditioning</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO2) monitors</strong></p>

<p><strong>Using Carbon Dioxide (CO2) monitors</strong></p>

<p>People exhale carbon dioxide (CO2) when they breathe out. If there is a build-up of CO2 in an area it can indicate that ventilation needs improving.</p>

<p>Although CO2 levels are not a direct measure of possible exposure to COVID-19, checking levels using a monitor can help you identify poorly ventilated areas. <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/identifying-poorly-ventilated-areas.htm" class="govuk-link">Read HSE advice on how to use a CO2 monitor</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How the measurements can help you take action</strong></p>

<p>CO2 measurements should be used as a broad guide to ventilation within a space rather than treating them as safe thresholds.</p>

<p>Outdoor levels are around 400ppm and indoors a consistent CO2 value less than 800ppm is likely to indicate that a space is well ventilated.</p>

<p>A CO2 concentration of above 1500ppm in a space is an indicator of poor ventilation. You should take action to improve ventilation where CO2 readings are consistently higher than 1500ppm.</p>

<p>Where there is continuous talking or singing, or high levels of physical activity (such as dancing, playing sport or exercising), providing ventilation sufficient to keep CO2 levels below 800ppm is recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Where CO2 monitors can help</strong></p>

<p>CO2 monitors can be used to check ventilation in a wide range of settings.</p>

<p>In large areas such as concert halls or event spaces, multiple sensors may be required to provide meaningful information.</p>

<p>There are some spaces where CO2 monitors are less likely to provide useful readings. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Areas occupied by people for short periods or for varying amounts of time. For example, a railway station or an atrium.</li>
  <li>Areas where air cleaning units are in use. Filtration can remove contaminants (such as COVID-19) from the air but will not remove CO2.</li>
  <li>Spaces like changing rooms, toilets or small meeting rooms.</li>
  <li>Spaces used by low numbers of people.</li>
  <li>Areas where CO2 is produced as part of a work process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Businesses and event organisers should still provide adequate ventilation in areas where CO2 monitors are less likely to be useful.</p>
