<h2>What’s changed</h2>

<p>Guidance updated to remove remaining legal regulations.</p>

<p>People who test positive for COVID-19, and contacts who are not fully vaccinated, are no longer legally required to self-isolate. People who test positive for COVID-19 should continue to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Fully vaccinated contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19 are no longer advised to test for 7 days.</p>

<p>Organisations are no longer recommended to display NHS QR posters or collect contact details from visitors.</p>

<h2>How to use this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance sets out information for the public and sport providers on how to organise and participate in grassroots sport and physical activity as safely as possible. This includes advice on steps you can take to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the sporting environment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> How to participate safely</h2>

<p>There are no restrictions on how many people can take part in sport and physical activity, or on the activities they can do.</p>

<p>However, there are some steps you should take to reduce the risk of transmission when you are participating.</p>

<h3>Check for COVID-19 symptoms and health conditions</h3>

<p>Before attending any sport or physical activity, all participants, officials, volunteers and spectators should self-assess for symptoms of COVID-19. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a new, continuous cough</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change to, your sense of taste or smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any of these symptoms you should order a PCR test. You are advised to stay at home, avoid contact with other people, and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">guidance for people with COVID-19 and their contacts</a> while you wait for your test result.</p>

<h3>Take part safely</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You should continue to follow any relevant advice from your activity provider or national governing body (NGB) on how to participate safely in your sport or activity. They may set out different ways to organise matches or tournaments, or measures you should follow, like regular breaks to sanitise the ball or other equipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should continue to follow good hygiene practices to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For example, you should not spit or rinse out your mouth on or around the playing area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should avoid sharing water bottles or other refreshment containers. Where possible, you should take your own drink, in a container that’s labelled or easy to recognise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should avoid sharing equipment (where it is possible and practical), particularly equipment which is used around the head and face, such as masks and helmets. If equipment needs to be shared, it should be cleaned between users, where possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People are not legally required to wear face coverings, but it is recommended that you wear one when you are in a crowded and enclosed setting where you may come into contact with people you do not normally meet when rates of transmission are high</p>
    <ul>
      <li>People should not generally wear face coverings while taking part in sport or other strenuous activities, unless advised to do so by a doctor.</li>
      <li>However, you may wish to put on a face covering before or after your sporting activity, for example if you are in a crowded indoor facility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> How to provide sport and physical activity safely</h2>

<p>This guidance sets out the key principles that you should follow and communicate to providers and participants in your sport or physical activity.</p>

<p>These principles apply to all types of sport and physical activity, but additional advice is provided below for <a class="govuk-link" href="#teams">team sports</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#combat">contact combat sports</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#spevents">sport participation events</a>.</p>

<h3>Key principles</h3>

<p>You should think about the best way to ensure that people can participate safely in your sport or physical activity. This could include issuing guidance (if you are an NGB or activity provider), following any relevant guidance from the sport’s NGB, the sport provider or facility, or by choosing to make your own changes to operating models to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</p>

<h3>Communications and guidance</h3>

<p>You should consider how you can inform participants of important information and any changes to processes in advance of the activity, for example on your website, when booking by phone or email, and in your digital marketing. You should consider how to do this in a way that works best for your sport or physical activity provision and is accessible to all, including those with disabilities.</p>

<p>Your communication to participants should include the following points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Self-assessment:</strong> Before attending any sporting or physical activities, all participants, officials, volunteers and spectators should self-assess for COVID-19 symptoms (a high temperature; a new, continuous cough; a a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia)). Advise participants that there is no longer a legal requirement for people to self-isolate in connection with COVID-19. Anyone with any of these symptoms should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">order a PCR test</a> and are advised to stay at home, avoid contact with other people, and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">guidance for people with COVID-19 and their contacts</a> while they wait for their test result.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Informed decisions:</strong> You should advise participants to consider their own health and circumstances (for example, if they are not yet double-vaccinated or they live with somebody at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19), so they can make an informed choice about whether they wish to participate. In addition to considering asking participants to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#consider-taking-a-test-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms">take a test if they do not have symptoms</a>, you should set out the safety measures you have put in place, and how you will mitigate any specific risks associated with your sporting activity. For example, you could advise participants that you are following your NGB’s guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Safety measures:</strong> Make sure participants are informed about any safety measures that will affect the activity, such as changes to the venue or activity, or how matches will operate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>NHS Test and Trace</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Participants, visitors and staff are no longer asked to check into venues either by using the NHS COVID-19 app, or by leaving their contact details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Venues are no longer requested to display NHS QR codes or collect staff, customer and visitor contact details but have been asked to delete any data they recorded to share with NHS Test and Trace, in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/global/data-protection-and-coronavirus-information-hub/coronavirus-recovery-data-protection-advice-for-organisations/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-for-contact-tracing-purposes/" rel="external">Information Commissioner’s Office guidance</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hygiene</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You should continue to follow good hygiene practices to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For example, you should ask participants not to spit or rinse out their mouths on or around the playing area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think about whether there are any changes you can make to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For example, you could ask teams not to shake hands after the match.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Face coverings</h3>

<ul>
  <li>While there is no legal requirement to wear a face covering, it is suggested that people wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed settings where they come into contact with others they do not normally meet when rates of transmission are high. Where worn correctly, this can reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
    <ul>
      <li>You should not ask people to wear face coverings while they are taking part in any strenuous activity or sport.</li>
      <li>However, you may want to recommend that participants, officials and spectators wear face coverings when they are not participating, if they are in a crowded and enclosed setting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a sport facility or venue where your provision takes place recommends the use of face coverings (when not participating in sport or physical activity), ensure this is communicated to your staff and participants.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Medical provision</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Physios and other medical personnel should ensure that equipment and surfaces are frequently cleaned and disinfected, and maintain hygiene standards when treating participants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Physios and other staff may need to take additional precautions, such as wearing face coverings or other protective equipment like gloves, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
    <ul>
      <li>Where close face-to-face contact is required, medical personnel may decide that they and patients should wear face coverings. This is particularly important when they are conducting treatments which require them to be in close proximity to a person’s face, mouth and nose.</li>
      <li>People who work in close contact with others may need additional protective equipment (such as gloves) or personal protective equipment (PPE) if there is a very high risk to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After contact with an injured participant, physios and other medical personnel should clean their hands thoroughly with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser at the earliest opportunity. This applies in all situations, regardless of whether there was close contact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Those working at a sport event should familiarise themselves with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov">guidance for first responders</a>, in case of emergency situations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Facilities</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you operate a sport facility, you should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">events and attractions guidance</a> which sets out important information on how you can operate a sport facility safely. This includes advice on ventilation, cleaning and what you need to do to keep your staff and customers safe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your activity takes place at a sport facility you don’t operate, you should speak to the sport facility operator about their COVID-19 safety measures, and check whether there is anything you and your participants should do to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where there is no facility operator (such as sport in a public park), the provider should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">events and attractions guidance</a> and consider following any relevant advice to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Events and spectators</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you are organising grassroots sport events, or expect spectators at your activity, you should review the guidance for events and attractions and follow any relevant measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This includes advice on how to manage events, and ways that you can reduce the risks of crowding and COVID-19 transmission when you have a busy event or a lot of spectators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also includes a risk management template you can use to help you plan your event, and advice on other things you can do to reduce risk, such as using COVID-19 status checks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Advice for specific sports and events</h3>

<h4>Team sports</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are no restrictions on how many people can take part in sport and physical activity, or on the activities they can do. This means there are no restrictions on how team sports can take place, and how sports such as rugby union, rugby league and netball can be organised.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NGBs and activity providers may wish to consider setting out alternative ways for people to participate, for those who do not feel comfortable with full versions of your sport but still wish to take part. For example, this could include training but not taking part in matches, or providing an alternative activity or light-contact version for some participants while others take part in full contact activity. You should consider what  approach works best for your sport, and encourage providers to discuss and agree an approach with their participants that works for them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Contact combat sports</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are no restrictions on contact combat sport activities, which can provide full contact training and competitions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may also wish to set out the different ways people can participate, or different types of activity they can do. For example, if people do not wish to take part in full contact activity, it may be helpful to have a framework for the different ways of participating in your sport. The following framework may be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>non-contact training: training individually, no activity with others, including with equipment (such as pad work).</li>
      <li>equipment training: training with others, using handheld and wearable equipment (such as pad work).</li>
      <li>contact training: contact training which includes some direct physical contact between participants.</li>
      <li>full contact / competition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Sport participation events</h4>

<p>In addition to your usual event organisation processes, organisers of sport participation events should ensure that you take steps to keep people safe, and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission at your events.</p>

<p>You should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>, which sets out advice on the risks you should take into account when managing events, and how to do a risk assessment. It also includes a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-management-template-for-event-organisers">risk management template</a> you can use to help you plan your event.</p>

<p>When planning your event, you should take into account the key principles for event planning set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>, such as taking steps to reduce the risk of transmission at the event, putting in place cleaning and hygiene protocols, engaging with local authorities and other relevant bodies, and considering how best to communicate information to attendees. You should ensure that any safety measures are communicated clearly and consistently to all participants and support staff, including volunteers.</p>

<p>In particular, you should also think about how to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading in your venue or event.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If there will be large crowds at your event, or people are likely to mix in close contact, you may want to check the COVID-19 status of attendees and workers, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 being transmitted. Read more about COVID-19 status checks in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carrying-out-covid-19-status-checks-at-your-venue-or-event">guidance on carrying out COVID-19 status checks</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may also want to ask or recommend that people wear face coverings in areas of your event that are crowded and enclosed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You should not ask people to wear face coverings while they are taking part in any strenuous activity or sport.</li>
      <li>Read more about face coverings in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<span class="number">3. </span> Specific guidance for sport events</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Specific guidance for sport events</strong></p>

<p>Discuss your event with the venue operator and ensure you follow any relevant safety measures.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you operate a sport facility, you should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">events and attractions guidance</a> which sets out important information on how you can operate a sport facility safely. This includes advice on ventilation, cleaning and what you need to do to keep your staff and customers safe.</li>
  <li>If your activity takes place at a sport facility you don’t operate, you should speak to the sport facility operator about their COVID-19 safety measures, and check whether there is anything you and your participants should do to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</li>
  <li>If your activity takes place at another kind of venue, check whether there is guidance you should follow, such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">guidance on working safely during COVID-19</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>You should also ensure that any amenities at the event follow the relevant guidance, such as hospitality services (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/restaurants-pubs-bars-nightclubs-and-takeaway-services">guidance for restaurants, pubs, bars, nightclubs and takeaway services</a>) and retail outlets (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/shops-branches-and-close-contact-services">guidance for shops, branches, and close contact services</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Think about the way your event is organised and how you can reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, you could consider ways to distribute chips and medals which don’t require contact between large groups of people.</li>
  <li>You could also consider organising bag-drops and equipment storage to minimise crowding and shared handling, and ensure hand sanitiser is provided.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider how best to provide refreshments during the event. Water bottles or other refreshment containers should not be shared between participants.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If participants are expected to bring their own refreshments, advise them to use labelled water or refreshment bottles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are providing water or other beverages, ensure that these are provided to individuals and are not expected to be shared.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consider how any safety measures will affect participants, staff and attendees with protected characteristics, and any adjustments you should make. You should also consider whether any special provisions should be made for children and young people under the age of 18 and vulnerable adults, if this is relevant to your event.</p>

<p>Ensure that there is sufficient access to toilet facilities (particularly for those with special needs and disabilities), and that they are well-ventilated and frequently cleaned. Particular care should be taken to clean portable toilets and larger toilet blocks.</p>
