<p><strong>The rules on self-isolation for people with COVID-19 have changed. <br><br>From Monday 17 January, people with COVID-19 are still required to self-isolate for 10 full days, but can end their self-isolation after 5 full days if they test negative for COVID-19 on two consecutive days. The first test cannot be taken before day 5.<br><br>This guidance will be updated shortly to include this change.

<h2>What’s changed</h2>

<p>England has moved to ‘Plan B’ of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-autumn-and-winter-plan-2021/covid-19-response-autumn-and-winter-plan-2021" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 Autumn/Winter Plan</a>, in response to the risks of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529). This guidance was updated on 23 December to include the following changes:<br><br>- Face coverings are legally required in most public indoor venues, including many types of events and businesses. Read the section on <a href="#facecoverings" class="govuk-link">face coverings</a> to find out what you need to do. <br><br>- Anyone who can work from home (such as office workers who do not need to be in the workplace) should do so. Anyone who cannot work from home should continue to go to the workplace. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#work-from-home-if-you-can">who should go to the workplace</a>. <br><br>- Some types of venues and events are required by law to check visitors’ COVID status as a condition of entry. If there is a nightclub or similar venue in your hotel or guest accommodation facility, or you hold certain types of events, you are legally required to check that all visitors (18 years and over) to these venues or events are fully vaccinated, have proof of a negative COVID-19 test result in the last 48 hours, or are exempt from these requirements. It is also strongly recommended that you check the COVID status of workers in customer-facing roles. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carrying-out-mandatory-covid-19-status-checks-at-your-venue-or-event">checking people’s COVID status</a> to check if this applies to your business, and what you need to do. <br><br>- There have also been recent changes to the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#get-tested-and-self-isolate-if-required">testing and self-isolation</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#travelling-in-the-uk-and-abroad" class="govuk-link">international travel</a>. <br><br>- There may be other changes which affect some organisations.

<p>Information for the public on how to take part safely in grassroots sport and physical activity.</p>

<p>2. <a class="govuk-link" href="#provision"><strong>How to organise grassroots sporting activities safely</strong></a></p>

<p>Information for sport providers on factors to consider when organising grassroots sport and physical activity, whether this is your work, a volunteer role or a personal activity. This includes advice for national governing bodies (NGBs) and other organisations on factors to consider when developing advice or guidance for your sport, including individual sports, team sports, contact combat sports, and sport participation events (such as races and organised walking groups).</p>

<p>3. <a href="#facilities" class="govuk-link"><strong>How to manage a sport or leisure or community facility safely</strong></a></p>

<p>Guidance on how to operate your sport facility safely while reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19, including practical considerations on principles to apply in the workplace.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> How to participate safely</h2>

<p>There are no restrictions on how many people can take part in sport and physical activity, or on the activities they can do. Sport participation events such as races and walks can take place provided participants and spectators can be safely accommodated. You are not legally mandated to show your COVID-19 status to participate in sporting activity, regardless of the number of participants or whether the activity is indoors or outdoors.</p>

<p>However, there are some steps you should take to reduce the risk of transmission when you are participating.</p>

<h3>Check for COVID-19 symptoms and health conditions</h3>

<p>Before attending any sport or physical activity, all participants, officials, volunteers and spectators should self-assess for symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a new, continuous cough</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change to, your sense of smell or taste</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have one or more of these symptoms you should not attend any sporting activity, even if your symptoms are mild. You should follow <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">NHS guidance on testing and self-isolation</a>.</p>

<h3>Follow your sport provider’s safety measures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Your sport facility or provider may ask you to ‘check in’ using the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.covid19.nhs.uk/">NHS COVID-19 app</a> to scan their QR code. This supports NHS Test and Trace, and helps to reduce the spread of the virus.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Take part safely</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You should continue to follow any relevant advice from your NGB or activity provider on how to participate safely in your sport or activity. This may set out different ways to organise matches or tournaments, or measures you should follow like regular breaks to sanitise the ball or other equipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should continue to follow good hygiene practices, to reduce the risk of transmission. For example, you should not spit or rinse out your mouth on or around the playing area. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread">guidance on how to stay safe</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should avoid sharing water bottles or other refreshment containers. Where possible, you should take your own drink, in a labelled or highly distinguishable container.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Face coverings should not be worn when people are exercising (including dancing) or taking part in strenuous activity, unless this is advised by a medical practitioner. This exemption also applies to the workforce.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sport and exercise facilities, including gyms, fitness studios, dance studios, leisure centres, swimming pools, water or aqua parks, face coverings are not required. However, you should follow advice from the venue operator on wearing a face covering in areas that are not for exercising, such as reception areas or social/lounge areas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other venues, if part of the premises is used for exercise (e.g. a community centre) then a face covering is required in the venue, except when you are in the part of the premises where the activity is taking place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should avoid sharing equipment where possible and practical, particularly equipment which is used around the head and face (such as masks and helmets). If equipment needs to be shared, it should be cleaned between users, where possible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> How to provide sport and physical activity safely</h2>

<p>This guidance sets out the key principles that you should follow and communicate to providers and participants in your sport or physical activity. This advice applies to all types of sport and physical activity, but further advice is also provided below for team sports, contact combat sports and mass participation events.</p>

<h3>Key principles</h3>

<p>You should ensure that people can participate in your sport or physical activity. You should consider the best way to approach this for your sport or physical activity, including by issuing guidance (if you are a NGB or activity provider), following any relevant guidance from the sport’s NGB, the sport provider or facility, or by choosing to make your own changes to operating models to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The key principles below should form the basis of any provided guidance.</p>

<h4>1. Communications and guidance</h4>

<p>You should consider how you can inform participants of important information and any changes to processes in advance of the activity, for example on your website, when booking by phone or email, and in your digital marketing. You should consider how to do this in a way that works best for your sport or physical activity provision and is accessible to all, including those with disabilities.</p>

<p>For example, you could email registered participants in advance of a league starting to set out the operational information they should be aware of and safety measures you have chosen to put in place. Then include a brief reminder of any key points or steps they must take in your follow-up communications or social media engagement.</p>

<p>Your communication to participants should include the following points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Self-assessment:</strong> Before attending any sporting or physical activities, all participants, officials, volunteers and spectators should self-assess for COVID-19 symptoms (a high temperature; a new, continuous cough; a loss of, or change to, their sense of smell or taste). If they have one or more of these symptoms (even if they are mild), you should advise them not to attend any sporting or physical activity, and to follow <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">NHS guidance on testing and self-isolation</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Informed decisions:</strong> You should advise participants to consider their own health and circumstances (for example, if they are not yet double-vaccinated or they live with somebody at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19), so they can make an informed choice about whether they wish to participate. You should set out the safety measures you have put in place, and how you will mitigate any specific risks associated with your sporting activity. For example, you could advise participants that you are following your NGB’s guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Self-isolation:</strong> Clearly communicate to participants that they should not take part in your activity if they need to self-isolate (for example, because they have tested positive or are asked to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace). You may also wish to share guidance on what they should do if they <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">live with</a>, or have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">close contact with</a>, a positive case.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>2. NHS Test and Trace</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Sport and activity providers are no longer required to collect participants’ contact details, or keep records of your staff and visitors.</li>
  <li>However, you can continue to display an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster" class="govuk-link">NHS QR code</a> for participants wishing to check in using the app, to support NHS Test and Trace. You do not have to ask participants to check in, or turn them away if they refuse.</li>
  <li>If you display an NHS QR code, you should also have a system to collect (and securely store) names and contact details for those who ask to check in but do not have the app.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Hygiene</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You should continue to follow good hygiene practices, to reduce the risk of transmission. For example, participants should not spit or rinse out your mouth on or around the playing area. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread">guidance on how to stay safe</a>.</li>
  <li>Water bottles or other refreshment containers should not be shared. Advise participants to bring their own water bottle or refreshment container, in a labelled or highly distinguishable container. If you are providing water or other beverages, ensure that these are provided to individuals and are not expected to be shared.</li>
  <li>You should consider whether there are any changes you can make to your provision, to reduce the risk of transmission. For example, you could ask teams not to shake hands after the match.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Equipment</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Organise your sport or physical activity sessions to avoid sharing equipment where it is possible and practical, particularly that used around the head and face. Where equipment needs to be shared, it should be cleaned between users where possible.</li>
  <li>You may wish to encourage teams to sanitise balls or other equipment at regular intervals, for example before and after each match, and in half-time or a suitable break in play.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Face coverings</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Face coverings should not be worn when people are exercising (including dancing) or taking part in strenuous activity, unless this is advised by a medical practitioner. This exemption also applies to the workforce.</li>
  <li>In sport and exercise facilities, including gyms, fitness studios, dance studios, leisure centres, swimming pools, water or aqua parks, face coverings are not required. However, you should follow advice from the venue operator on wearing a face covering in areas that are not for exercising, such as reception areas or social/lounge areas.</li>
  <li>In other venues, if part of the premises is used for exercise (e.g. a community centre) then a face covering is required in the venue, except when you are in the part of the premises where the activity is taking place.</li>
  <li>If a sport facility or venue where your provision takes place recommends the use of face coverings (when not participating in sport or physical activity), ensure this is communicated to your staff and participants.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Medical provision</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Physios and other medical personnel should ensure that equipment and surfaces are frequently cleaned and disinfected, and maintain hygiene standards when treating participants.</li>
  <li>Where close face-to-face contact is required, medical personnel may decide that they and patients should wear a face covering. This is particularly important when they are conducting treatments which require them to be in close proximity to a person’s face, mouth and nose.</li>
  <li>After contact with an injured participant, physios and other medical personnel should clean their hands thoroughly with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser at the earliest opportunity. This applies in all situations, regardless of whether there was close contact.</li>
  <li>If any of your staff work in close contact with guests (such as medical personnel, massage therapists, security staff, hair and makeup technicians and beauticians), or work in contaminated areas (such as cleaners and housekeeping staff) you should also think about whether they need additional protection or personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</li>
  <li>Those working at a sport event should familiarise themselves with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov" class="govuk-link">guidance for first responders</a>, in case of emergency situations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>7. Facility usage</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Providers which work with or operate facilities should ensure they are familiar with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-coronavirus-covid-19-measures-for-grassroots-sport-participants-providers-and-facility-operators/guidance-on-coronavirus-covid-19-measures-for-grassroots-sport-participants-providers-and-facility-operators#facilities" class="govuk-link">guidance for sport facilities</a> below. This sets out information on ventilation and other important steps you can take to reduce transmission.</li>
  <li>Where there is no facility operator (such as sport in a public park), the provider should review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">events and attractions guidance</a> and consider following any relevant advice to reduce the risk of transmission.</li>
</ul>

<h4>8. Grassroots sporting events</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If you are organising grassroots sport events, or expect spectators, you should review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a> and follow any relevant measures to reduce the risk of transmission at your event. You can also use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-management-template-for-event-organisers">risk management template</a> to help you plan your event.</li>
  <li>All outdoor grassroots sports events held in a public outdoor place where spectators do not have to buy a ticket or pay to enter/watch the event, are not required to have proof (such as their NHS COVID Pass) that spectators are fully vaccinated or have tested negative for COVID-19 in the previous 48 hours as a condition of entry. Other outdoor events might require certification and you should check the guidance for events and attractions.</li>
  <li>If you are organising indoor grassroots sports event, you should review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a> and follow any relevant measures to reduce the risk of transmission at your event. You can also use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-management-template-for-event-organisers">risk management template</a> to help you plan your event.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advice for specific sports and events</h3>

<h4>Team sports</h4>

<ul>
  <li>There are no restrictions on how many people can take part in sport and physical activity, or on the activities they can do. This means there are no restrictions on how team sports can take place, and how sports such as rugby union, rugby league and netball can be organised.</li>
  <li>NGBs and activity providers should maintain COVID-specific guidance for participants on how to participate safely in your sport, which should be reviewed and updated as required to ensure that sport providers and participants are clear on the current advice and best practice. This guidance does not need to be reviewed by the government.</li>
  <li>NGBs and activity providers may wish to consider setting out alternative ways for people to participate, for those who do not feel comfortable with full versions of your sport but still wish to take part. For example, this could include training but not taking part in matches, or providing an alternative activity or light-contact version for some participants while others take part in full contact activity. You should consider the approach which works best for your sport, and encourage providers to discuss and agree an approach with their participants that works for them.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Contact combat sports</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Contact combat sport activities can resume full contact training and competitions for adults and children both indoors and outdoors.</li>
  <li>NGBs for contact combat sports should maintain COVID-specific guidance for participants on how to participate safely in your sport, which should be reviewed and updated as required to ensure that providers and participants are clear on the current advice and best practice. This guidance does not need to be reviewed by the government.</li>
  <li>NGBs and activity providers should consider whether it is necessary to provide guidance on measures to reduce risk. For example, you could consider:
    <ul>
      <li>Advising those in supporting roles (e.g. holding pads) to wear face coverings, where this is possible and practical.</li>
      <li>Advising participants to consider the number of different people they engage in full contact activity with.</li>
      <li>Advising coaches or officials to limit the number of groups or facilities they work with.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You may also wish to set out the different ways people can participate, or different types of activity they can do. For example, if people do not wish to take part in full contact activity, it may be helpful to have a framework for the different ways of participating in your sport. The following framework may be helpful:
    <ul>
      <li>Non-contact training: training individually, no activity with others, including with equipment (such as pad work).</li>
      <li>Equipment training: training with others, using handheld and wearable equipment (such as pad work).</li>
      <li>Contact training: contact training which includes some direct physical contact between participants.</li>
      <li>Full contact / competition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Sport participation events</h4>

<p>In addition to your usual event organisation processes, you should ensure that you take steps to keep everyone safe, and reduce the risk of transmission at your events so you can continue to provide sport and physical activity safely.</p>

<p>As there continues to be a risk of infection from COVID-19, employers still have a legal duty to manage risks to those affected by their business. The way to do this is to carry out a health and safety risk assessment including the risk of COVID-19, and put in place measures to reduce the risks you identify. You should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>, which sets out advice on the risks you should take into account when managing events, along with options for managing and reducing these risks and a risk management checklist to help you plan your event. You can also use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-management-template-for-event-organisers" class="govuk-link">risk management template</a> to help you plan your event.</p>

<p>When planning your event, you should take into account the following factors:</p>

<p><strong>Do not admit participants or spectators who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>If a participant or spectator presents with symptoms</strong> they should not be admitted. If you become aware of a case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 on-site, the participant or spectator should be asked to leave the facility or event, unless they need to be transported to hospital for treatment. They should be advised to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">guidance on testing and self-isolation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Check whether spectators need to show evidence of their COVID status.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Anyone participating in an organised sporting event or fitness activity is exempt from the requirement to show evidence of their COVID status.</li>
  <li>All outdoor grassroots sports events in a public outdoor place where spectators do not have to buy a ticket or pay to enter/watch the event, are not required to have proof (such as their NHS COVID Pass) that spectators are fully vaccinated or have tested negative for COVID-19 in the previous 48 hours as a condition of entry.</li>
  <li>If you are organising an indoor grassroots sports event, you should review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a> and follow any relevant measures to reduce the risk of transmission at your event.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Check whether face coverings are required in areas of your facility.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Consider whether you should put in place safety measures to reduce the risk of transmission.</strong> For example, you could consider ways to distribute chips and medals which don’t require contact between large groups of people. You could also consider organising bag-drops and equipment storage to minimise crowding and shared handling, and ensure hand sanitiser is provided. You can find more advice on the types of measures which may be appropriate for your event in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance on events and attractions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ensure that any safety measures are communicated clearly and consistently</strong> to all participants and support staff, including volunteers. You can find advice about how to do this in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance on events and attractions</a>.
 <strong>Consider how any safety measures will affect participants, staff and attendees with protected characteristics, and any adjustments you should make.</strong> You should also consider whether any special provisions should be made for children and young people under the age of 18 and vulnerable adults, if this is relevant to your event.</p>

<p><strong>Ensure that there is sufficient access to toilet facilities (particularly for those with special needs and disabilities), and that they are well-ventilated and frequently cleaned.</strong> Particular care should be taken to clean portable toilets and larger toilet blocks.</p>

<p><strong>Consider how best to provide refreshments during the event.</strong> Water bottles or other refreshment containers should not be shared between participants.</p>

<p><strong>Ensure that any amenities at the event follow the relevant guidance,</strong> such as hospitality services (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/restaurants-offering-takeaway-or-delivery">guidance for restaurants, pubs, bars, nightclubs and takeaway services</a>) and retail outlets (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/shops-and-branches">guidance for shops, branches, and close contact services</a>).</p>

<h3>Priority actions to take</h3>

<p>There are 7 main actions you can take to protect yourself, your staff and your customers during coronavirus (COVID-19). These are called priority actions as they are important steps that will apply to most businesses. Read the full guidance for advice on how to do this in a way that works for your workplace.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Complete a health and safety risk assessment that includes risks from COVID-19. This should consider the points below in the rest of this guidance. It should also take into account any reasonable adjustments needed for staff and customers with disabilities. You should share your risk assessment with your staff. Read about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions#risk-1" class="govuk-link">risk assessments</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your workplace has good enough ventilation. Make sure there is enough fresh air in areas people use. This can be natural ventilation (windows, doors and vents), mechanical ventilation (fans and ducts), or a combination of both. You should identify any poorly ventilated areas that people normally use (a CO2 monitor may help in some cases) and think about how to improve fresh air flow in these areas. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions#facility-3">ventilation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remind your staff and customers to wear face coverings in indoor spaces where it is required by law (unless they are exempt or have a reasonable excuse to remove them). Customers are legally required to wear face coverings in most indoor public places, and on transport services open to the public. Staff must also wear face coverings in areas where they are likely to come into contact with a member of the public. You must notify people if face coverings are required in areas of your business, for example by putting up signs. Download and print a poster you can put up in your business. Read about <a href="#facecoverings2" class="govuk-link">face coverings</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clean more frequently. It is especially important to clean surfaces that people touch a lot. You should ask your staff and your customers to use hand sanitiser and to clean their hands frequently. Read about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions#facility-1" class="govuk-link">cleaning and hygiene</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn away people with COVID-19 symptoms. Staff members or customers should self-isolate immediately if they show any symptoms of COVID-19 and take a PCR test as soon as possible, even if they are fully vaccinated. They must also self-isolate if they are informed by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, unless they are exempt (see more on when people need to self-isolate (link)). If you know that a worker is legally required to self-isolate, you must not allow them to come to work - it is against the law. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions#workforce-4">COVID-19 cases in the workplace</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading in your workplace. Some venues and events are legally required to check the COVID status of all attendees aged 18 and over. For those venues or events, you can only admit people who are fully vaccinated, have proof of a negative COVID-19 test result in the last 48 hours, or are exempt from these requirements. You are strongly advised to check that workers (aged 18 and over) in customer-facing roles meet these requirements. You can also choose to display an NHS QR code so people can check in at your venue, to help NHS Test and Trace to reduce the spread of the virus. Read about how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions#customers-2">reduce the risk of people with COVID-19 coming to your workplace</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate and train. Tell workers and customers how to visit your workplace safely, and keep them updated on your safety measures. Think about how to organise your workplace to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading. If your venue gets very busy, or you have a lot of customers at the same time, you should think about ways to reduce the risk of crowding. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions#workforce-6">communicating with workers</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions#customers-1" class="govuk-link">communicating with customers</a>, and <a href="#crowds" class="govuk-link">managing crowds</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Sport and physical activity specific information</h3>

<h4>Face coverings</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Face coverings should not be worn when people are exercising (including dancing) or taking part in strenuous activity, unless this is advised by a medical practitioner.</li>
  <li>In premises where exercise is the main activity (e.g. gyms, leisure centres, swimming pools, etc) face coverings are not required, unless there is part of the facility where you are required to wear a face covering (e.g. a shop within a leisure centre).</li>
  <li>If only part of the premises is used for exercise (e.g. a community centre) then a face covering is required, except when you are in the part of the premises where the activity is taking place. It is not advised that participants wear face coverings while taking part in sport and physical activity. This exemption also applies to the workforce.</li>
  <li>If a sport facility or venue where your provision takes place recommends the use of face coverings (when not participating in sport or physical activity), ensure this is communicated to your staff and participants.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Crowd management and events</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Anyone participating in an organised sporting event is always exempt from the requirement to show the NHS COVID Pass.</li>
  <li>All outdoor grassroots sports events where spectators do not have to buy a ticket or pay to enter/watch the event, are not required to have proof (such as their NHS COVID Pass) that spectators are fully vaccinated or have tested negative for COVID-19 in the previous 48 hours as a condition of entry. Other outdoor events might require certification and should check the guidance for events and attractions.</li>
  <li>If you are hosting events, including grassroots sport events with large numbers of spectators, you should also review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>. This guidance recommends taking additional steps to manage risk if the event site or venue includes one or more of the following features:
    <ul>
      <li>is taking place indoors</li>
      <li>is taking place outdoors, but also has indoor spaces</li>
      <li>includes congested areas</li>
      <li>involves free movement between people</li>
      <li>includes crowd density or</li>
      <li>has a large number of attendees</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can find further advice about the types of measures you can put in place (including support with COVID-status checks, such as crowd movement strategies and stewarding) to manage risks in these types of events in the events and attractions guidance, along with a risk management template to help you plan your event.</li>
