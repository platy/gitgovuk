<p>This guidance including additional donning and doffing guidance is also available through the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee (<abbr title="Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee">JRCALC</abbr>) plus app (if available within your Trust).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures recommended are underpinned by the National Infection Prevention and Control Manual practice guide and associated <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.nipcm.hps.scot.nhs.uk/">literature reviews</a>.</p>

<h4>Summary of changes in this version:</h4>

<p>This guidance has been updated to reflect changes made to the overarching <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control">COVID-19: infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) guidance</a> for all healthcare services, as part of maintaining services within healthcare settings.</p>

<p>The key updates within this guidance area as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the introduction of COVID-19 risk pathways (High, Medium and Low) for staff awareness as patients will be triaged into the appropriate care pathway by the receiving facility</li>
  <li>clarification of changes to patient cohorting aligned to new COVID-19 risk pathways</li>
  <li>no changes to <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> levels for direct patient care or when performing <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>,
    <ul>
      <li>level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for direct patient contact, no <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> performed</li>
      <li>level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> when undertaking <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>no changes to procedures within the <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> list, but includes a statement of clarification that oral/pharyngeal suction and insertion of basic airway adjuncts are not deemed as <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>reinforcing the requirement for patients to wear a surgical mask, providing it does not compromise their clinical care, such as when receiving oxygen therapy.</li>
  <li>no changes to decontamination requirements</li>
  <li>the identification of new variants of concern (VOC-202012/01 and VOC-202012/02) across parts of the UK has been considered in this revision</li>
  <li>inclusion of recommended good practice precautions in the event of delay hospital handovers</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Identification of possible cases</h2>

<p>Whilst the UK remains in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and, as it becomes endemic; guidance for working in a new healthcare environment will need to be developed and updated based upon emerging evidence, experience and expert opinion.</p>

<p>This guidance will support returning services using COVID risk pathways which are based on transmission risks using the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/">local and national data</a>. The identification of new variants of concern (VOC-202012/01 and VOC-202012/02) across parts of the UK has been considered in this revision.</p>

<p>This guidance is for all patient contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic, where an ambulance response is required, including both emergency and non-emergency provision.</p>

<p>COVID-19 infection should be considered in all cases of respiratory infection. A travel history will form part of the risk assessment to determine the patient risk pathway. The latest list of countries in which the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not unacceptably high for British travellers is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initial-investigation-of-possible-cases/investigation-and-initial-clinical-management-of-possible-cases-of-wuhan-novel-coronavirus-wn-cov-infection" class="govuk-link">case definition</a> symptom criteria (below) should be considered as part of the risk assessment to determine the most appropriate risk pathway.</p>

<p>If patients meet the following case definition criteria, they are to be classified as a possible case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>high temperature (of 37.8°C or higher)<br>OR</li>
  <li>new onset continuous cough<br>OR</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where possible or confirmed cases are identified, this information must be passed to the responding resources (ambulance, Patient Transport Service (<abbr title="Patient Transport Service">PTS</abbr>) or response car) prior to arrival on scene.</p>

<p>A wide variety of clinical symptoms have been associated with COVID-19, refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initial-investigation-of-possible-cases/investigation-and-initial-clinical-management-of-possible-cases-of-wuhan-novel-coronavirus-wn-cov-infection" class="govuk-link">investigation and initial clinical management</a> of possible COVID-19 cases for further information.  </p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> COVID-19 care pathways</h3>

<p>These pathways are specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and are aligned to the patient risk pathways outlined in the COVID-19 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Implementation strategies must be underpinned by patient/procedure risk assessment, appropriate testing regimens (as per organisations or country specific) and epidemiological data.</p>

<p>Additional information on specific settings can be found in: NICE (2020) <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng179/resources/covid19-rapid-guideline-arranging-planned-care-in-hospitals-and-diagnostic-services-pdf-66141969613765">COVID-19 rapid guideline: arranging planned care in hospitals and diagnostic services</a>.</p>

<p>These care pathways are difficult to determine in the pre-hospital setting; however, staff must be aware of them to enable appropriate conveyance and to support handover to other healthcare facilities.</p>

<p>On arrival at the receiving facility, triage will be undertaken by staff who are trained and competent in the application of the clinical case definition, thereby allocating patients to the appropriate pathway. This should include screening for other infections/multi-drug resistant organisms, as per national screening requirements. Infection risk and infection prevention and control precautions for example, standard infection control precautions (<abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr>) or transmission based precautions (<abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr>) must be communicated between staff and care areas/organisations.</p>

<h4>High - Risk COVID-19 pathway</h4>

<p>Any care facility where:</p>

<p>a) Untriaged individuals present for assessment or treatment (symptoms unknown).</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>b) Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) positive individuals are cared for.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>c) Symptomatic or suspected COVID-19 individuals including those with a history of contact with a COVID-19 case, who have been triaged/clinically assessed and are waiting test results.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>d) Symptomatic individuals who decline testing</p>

<h4>Medium Risk COVID-19 pathway</h4>

<p>Any care facility where:</p>

<p>a) Triaged/clinically assessed individuals are asymptomatic and are waiting a SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) test result.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>b) Triaged/clinically assessed individuals are asymptomatic with COVID-19 contact/exposure identified.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>c) Testing is not required or feasible on asymptomatic individuals and infectious status is unknown.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>d) Asymptomatic individuals decline testing.</p>

<h4>Low Risk COVID-19 pathway</h4>

<p>Any care facility where:</p>

<p>a) Triaged/clinically assessed individuals with no symptoms or known recent COVID-19 contact.</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>Have a negative SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) test within 72 hours of treatment, and for planned admissions, have self-isolated for the required period or from the test date.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>b) Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and have had at least 48 hours without fever or respiratory symptoms.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>c) Patients or individuals are part of a regular formal NHS testing plan and remain negative and asymptomatic.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Infection prevention and control precautions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Standard infection prevention and control precautions (<abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr>): all patient pathways/settings</h3>

<p><abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> are the basic infection prevention and control measures necessary to reduce the risk of transmitting infectious agents from both recognised and unrecognised sources of infection and are required across ALL COVID-19 pathways.</p>

<p><abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> must therefore be used by all staff, in all care settings, at all times and for all patients, whether infection is known or not, to ensure the safety of patients, staff and visitors. This section highlights the key measures for the COVID-19 pathways. Please refer to the practice guide* for additional information on the other elements which remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The elements of <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>patient placement and assessment for infection risk (screening/triaging)</li>
  <li>hand hygiene</li>
  <li>respiratory and cough hygiene</li>
  <li>personal protective equipment</li>
  <li>safe management of the care environment</li>
  <li>safe management of care equipment</li>
  <li>safe management of healthcare linen</li>
  <li>safe management of blood and body fluids</li>
  <li>safe disposal of waste (including sharps)</li>
  <li>occupational safety: prevention and exposure management</li>
  <li>maintaining social/physical distancing (new SICP due to COVID-19)</li>
</ul>

<p>*Practice guides and literature reviews to support <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr> can be found for <a href="http://www.nipcm.hps.scot.nhs.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">England and Scotland</a>, <a href="https://phw.nhs.wales/services-and-teams/harp/infection-prevention-and-control/nipcm/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.niinfectioncontrolmanual.net/" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Transmission based precautions (<abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Transmission based precautions (TBP) are additional measures (to <abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr>) required when caring for patients/individuals with a known or suspected infection such as COVID-19.</p>

<p>Transmission based precautions are based upon the route of transmission and include:</p>

<h4>a)  Contact precautions</h4>

<p>Used to prevent and control infections that spread via direct contact with the patient or indirectly from the patient’s immediate care environment (including care equipment). This is the most common route of cross-infection transmission. COVID-19 can be spread via this route.</p>

<h4>b)  Droplet precautions</h4>

<p>Used to prevent and control infections spread over short distances (at least 3 feet/1 metre) via droplets (&gt;5μm) from the respiratory tract of individuals directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Droplets penetrate the respiratory system to above the alveolar level. COVID-19 is predominantly spread via this route and the precautionary distance has been increased to 2 metres.</p>

<h4>c)  Airborne precautions</h4>

<p>Used to prevent and control infection spread without necessarily having close patient contact via aerosols (≤5μm) from the respiratory tract of one individual directly onto a mucosal surface or conjunctivae of another individual. Aerosols penetrate the respiratory system to the alveolar level. COVID-19 can spread via this route when aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>) are undertaken.</p>

<h4>Transmission characteristics</h4>

<p>Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 implications for infection prevention precautions is contained within the WHO <a rel="external" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions" class="govuk-link">scientific briefing paper</a> and <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-sars-cov-2.html">CDC’s scientific brief</a> (5 October 2020).</p>

<p>Literature reviews to support <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://hpspubsrepo.blob.core.windows.net/hps-website/nss/2985/documents/1_covid-19-rapid-review-ipc-for-covid-19.pdf">evidence for transmission characteristics</a> and <a href="http://www.nipcm.hps.scot.nhs.uk/resources/literature-reviews/" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr></a> are available.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Personal protective equipment</h2>

<p>For the purpose of this document, the term ‘personal protective equipment’ is used to describe products that are either <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> or medical devices that are approved by the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) as protective solutions in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>This guidance is for clinical care environments and is intended for use when in direct contact with patients, or patient care areas. There is further guidance specific to the ambulance sector available in the Working Safely during COVID-19 in Ambulance sector non-clinical areas, which must be followed in non-clinical areas for example, wearing surgical masks in vehicle cabs.</p>

<p>Local or national uniform policies should be considered when wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>located close to the point of use (where this does not compromise patient safety, for example mental health/learning disabilities)</li>
  <li>stored safely and in a clean, dry area to prevent contamination</li>
  <li>within expiry date (or had the quality assurance checks prior to releasing stock outside this date)</li>
  <li>single use unless specified by the manufacturer or as agreed for extended/sessional use including surgical facemasks</li>
  <li>changed immediately after each patient and/or after completing a procedure or task</li>
  <li>disposed into the correct waste stream depending on setting for example, domestic waste/offensive (non-infectious) or infectious clinical waste</li>
  <li>discarded if damaged or contaminated</li>
  <li>safely doffed (removed) to avoid self-contamination. <a rel="external" href="https://aace.org.uk/resources/resource-category/infection-prevention-control/" class="govuk-link">Guidance on donning (putting on) and doffing (removing) <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>decontaminated after each use following manufactures guidance if reusable <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is used, such as non-disposable goggles/face shields/visors</li>
  <li>contaminated <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, that has been used during the care of a patient must not be worn within the cab of the vehicles</li>
</ul>

<p>Gloves must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be worn when exposure to blood and/or other body fluids, non-intact skin or mucous membranes is anticipated or likely</li>
  <li>be changed immediately after each patient and/or after completing a procedure/task even on the same patient (remembering the importance of performing hand hygiene before donning and after doffing)</li>
  <li>never be decontaminated with Alcohol Based Hand Rub (ABHR) or soap between use</li>
</ul>

<p>NB: double gloving is NOT required or recommended for routine clinical care of COVID-19 cases.</p>

<p>Aprons must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>worn to protect uniform or clothes when contamination is anticipated or likely</li>
  <li>worn when providing direct care within 2 metres of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases</li>
  <li>changed between patients and/or after completing a procedure or task</li>
</ul>

<p>Fluid repellent coveralls or full body gowns must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>worn when there is a risk of extensive splashing of blood and/or body fluids</li>
  <li>worn when undertaking aerosol generating procedures</li>
  <li>worn when a disposable apron provides inadequate cover for the procedure or task being performed</li>
  <li>changed between patients and immediately after completing a procedure or task unless sessional use is advised due to local/national data</li>
</ul>

<p>Eye or face protection (including full-face visors) must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be worn if providing direct care to a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient</li>
  <li>be worn if blood and/or body fluid contamination to the eyes or face is anticipated or likely and always during aerosol generating procedures. Regular corrective spectacles are not considered eye protection</li>
  <li>not be impeded by accessories such as piercings or false eyelashes</li>
  <li>not be touched when being worn</li>
</ul>

<p>Fluid resistant surgical face (<abbr title="fluid repellent surgical facemask">FRSM</abbr> TYPE IIR) masks must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be worn with eye protection if splashing or spraying of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions onto the respiratory mucosa (nose and mouth) is anticipated or likely</li>
  <li>be worn when delivering direct care within 2 metres of a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case</li>
  <li>be well-fitting and fit for purpose, fully cover the mouth and nose (manufacturers’ instructions must be followed to ensure effective fit and protection)</li>
  <li>not touched once put on or allowed to dangle around the neck</li>
  <li>be replaced if damaged, visibly soiled, damp, uncomfortable or difficult to breathe through</li>
</ul>

<h4>Respiratory protective equipment (<abbr title="Respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr>)/<abbr title="filtering face piece respirator">FFP3</abbr> (filtering face piece respirator/facemask or powered respirator hood):</h4>

<p>Respirators are used to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles arising from aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>).</p>

<p>Respiratory protective equipment should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be well fitting, covering both nose and mouth</li>
  <li>always worn when undertaking an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> on a COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient</li>
  <li>not be allowed to dangle around the neck of the wearer after or between each use</li>
  <li>not be touched once put on</li>
  <li>be removed outside the patient area</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Respiratory protective equipment">RPE</abbr> can be single use or single session use (disposable) and fluid resistant</li>
  <li>valved respirators are not fully fluid resistant unless they are also ‘shrouded’. Valved non-shrouded <abbr title="filtering face piece respirator">FFP3</abbr> respirators should be worn with a full-face shield if blood or body fluid splashing is anticipated</li>
  <li>all staff who are required to wear an <abbr title="filtering face piece respirator">FFP3</abbr> respirator must be fit tested for the relevant model, or a manufacturer recommended direct equivalent model, to ensure an adequate seal or fit. Fit checking  is necessary when a respirator is put on (donned) to ensure an adequate seal has been achieved</li>
  <li>where fit testing fails, suitable alternative equipment must be provided, or the healthcare worker moved to an area where <abbr title="filtering face piece respirator">FFP3</abbr> respirators are not required</li>
  <li>respirators should be compatible with other facial protection used (protective eyewear) so that this does not interfere with the seal of the respiratory protection</li>
  <li>the respirator should be discarded and replaced and NOT be subject to continued use if the facial seal is compromised, it is uncomfortable, or it is difficult to breathe through</li>
  <li>reusable respirators can be utilised by individuals if they comply with <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> recommendations. Reusable respirators should be decontaminated according to the manufacturer’s instructions</li>
  <li>although <abbr title="filtering face piece respirator">FFP3</abbr> masks are effective for longer periods, the general recommendation would be to wear the <abbr title="filtering face piece respirator">FFP3</abbr> face masks for up to 3 hours. However, the duration of wear is dependent on the outcome of a dynamic risk assessment conducted by the staff member taking into consideration a number of factors such as the environment, personal comfort/tolerance and the activity or task that is being undertaken</li>
  <li>powered respirator hoods can be utilised in place of <abbr title="filtering face piece respirator">FFP3</abbr> face masks, and do not require FIT testing. However, staff are required to be trained in their safe use and the correct tests/checks must be carried out prior to use. Refer to local guidance for the procedures and confidence/safety checks required for the specific units.</li>

<p>Head/footwear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>headwear is not routinely required in clinical areas (even if undertaking an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>headwear worn for religious reasons (for example turban, kippot veil, headscarves) are permitted provided patient safety is not compromised. These must be washed and/or changed between each shift or immediately if contaminated and comply with local and <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/about/equality/equality-hub/uniforms-and-workwear/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">national uniform policies</a>
</li>
  <li>foot/shoe coverings are not required or recommended for the care of COVID-19 cases</li>
</ul>

<p>NB. Personal protective equipment may restrict communication with patient groups and other ways of communicating to meet their needs should be considered for example clear masks if available, voice-to-text apps to display conversation. The Association of Ambulance Chief Executives has also issued additional guidance when wearing a mask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be aware that speech is muffled, and verbal requests could be misunderstood leading to errors for example, medication doses. Ensure that the MEDCHECK process is followed, and other instructions are repeated back</li>
  <li>non-verbal facial cues are reduced, making empathy and other emotions difficult to convey</li>
  <li>communication may be particularly difficult for people with impaired hearing</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Ambulance Service <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> levels</h3>

<p>The appropriate level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn following a dynamic risk assessment of the presenting risks.</p>

<p>Use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as described below should not detract from the usual <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> risk assessments that staff carry out routinely to underpin all clinical practice and decision making. Staff must also ensure the correct level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is worn dependant on the patient presentation and the clinical skills that are required during patient care.</p>

<p>The ambulance sector <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for COVID-19 is categorised by level:</p>

<h4>Level 1: Standard infection control precautions</h4>

<p>Consider if any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is required based on risk of contact or splashing with blood or bodily fluids.</p>

<h4>Level 2:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>disposable gloves</li>
  <li>disposable apron</li>
  <li>fluid resistant surgical mask (Type IIR) (<abbr title="fluid repellent surgical facemask">FRSM</abbr>)</li>
  <li>eye protection/face shield (if risk of splashing and for all suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Level 3:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>disposable gloves</li>
  <li>fluid repellent coveralls/long sleeved apron/gown</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="filtering face piece respirator">FFP3</abbr> or powered respirator hood</li>
  <li>eye protection/face shield (not required with a powered respirator)</li>
</ul>

<p>Care should be taken to ensure that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is donned and doffed correctly to avoid inadvertent contamination. <a href="https://aace.org.uk/resources/resource-category/infection-prevention-control/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Donning and Doffing guidance</a> is available.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>)</h2>

<p>An aerosol generating procedure (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>) is a medical procedure that can result in the release of airborne particles (aerosols) from the respiratory tract when treating someone who is suspected or known to be suffering from an infectious agent transmitted wholly or partly by the airborne or droplet route.</p>

<p>This is the list of medical procedures for COVID-19 that have been reported to be aerosol generating and are associated with an increased risk of respiratory transmission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>respiratory tract suctioning*</li>
  <li>upper ENT airway procedures that involve respiratory suctioning*</li>
  <li>manual ventilation</li>
  <li>tracheal intubation and extubation</li>
  <li>tracheotomy or tracheostomy procedures (insertion or removal)</li>
  <li>bronchoscopy</li>
  <li>dental procedures (using high speed devices for example, ultrasonic scalers/high speed drills</li>
  <li>Non-invasive ventilation (<abbr title="Non-invasive ventilation">NIV</abbr>); Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation (<abbr title="Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation">BiPAP</abbr>) and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation (<abbr title="Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation">CPAP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>High Flow Nasal Oxygen (<abbr title="High Flow Nasal Oxygen">HFNO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (<abbr title="High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation">HFOV</abbr>)</li>
  <li>induction of sputum using nebulised saline</li>
  <li>uper gastro-intestinal endoscopy where open suction of the upper respiratory tract occurs</li>
  <li>high speed cutting in surgery/post-mortem procedures if respiratory tract/paranasal sinuses involved</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are not considered as an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chest compressions</li>
  <li>defibrillation</li>
  <li>medication administration via nebulisation for example, nebulised salbutamol</li>
  <li>oral/pharyngeal suctioning*</li>
  <li>insertion of basic airway adjuncts, for example nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal airways</li>
</ul>

<p>Certain other procedures or equipment may generate an aerosol from material other than patient secretions but are not considered to represent a significant infectious risk. Procedures in this category include administration of humidified oxygen, Entonox or medication via nebulisation.</p>

<p>The New and Emerging Respiratory Viral Threat Assessment Group (<abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Viral Threat Assessment Group">NERVTAG</abbr>) advised that during nebulisation, the aerosol derives from a non-patient source (the fluid in the nebuliser chamber) and does not carry patient-derived viral particles. If a particle in the aerosol coalesces with a contaminated mucous membrane, it will cease to be airborne and therefore will not be part of an aerosol. Staff should use appropriate hand hygiene when helping patients to remove nebulisers and oxygen masks. In addition, the current expert consensus from <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Viral Threat Assessment Group">NERVTAG</abbr> is that chest compressions are not considered to be procedures that pose a higher risk for respiratory infections including COVID-19.</p>

<p>*The available evidence relating to Respiratory Tract Suctioning is associated with ventilation.  In line with a precautionary approach open suctioning of the respiratory tract regardless of association with ventilation has been incorporated into the current (COVID-19) <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> list. It is the consensus view of the UK <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> cell that only open suctioning beyond the oro-pharynx is currently considered an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>, ie oral/pharyngeal suctioning is not an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>.  The evidence on respiratory tract suctioning is currently being reviewed by the <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> Panel which is an independent panel set up by the 4 CMOs to review new or further evidence for consideration.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://hps.scot.nhs.uk/web-resources-container/sbar-assessing-the-evidence-base-for-medical-procedures-which-create-a-higher-risk-of-respiratory-infection-transmission-from-patient-to-healthcare-worker/" class="govuk-link">Literature review</a> for <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> during COVID-19 is available.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Clinical application</h2>

<p>The recommended advice for possible COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms is for them to stay at home until they are well. Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home advice</a> for more information.</p>

<p>It is strongly advised that all patients  are to wear a surgical facemask throughout, providing it does not compromise their clinical care, such as when receiving oxygen therapy. This will help to minimise the dispersal of respiratory secretions and reduce environmental contamination.</p>

<p>Staff should perform a dynamic risk assessment which should be based on information provided prior to arrival at scene as well as any additional information gained on arrival.</p>

<p>The correct level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be worn by all staff who have direct contact with a possible or confirmed COVID-19 patient and within 2 metres of the patient. The required level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to be used as a minimum for the care of all patient’s contacts including possible or confirmed COVID-19 cases is:</p>

<p>†Can be worn sessionally if providing care for COVID-19 cohorted patients. For example, <abbr title="Patient Transport Service">PTS</abbr> staff.</p>

<p>*Risk assess eye/face protection</p>

<p>NB:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the patient is suspected/confirmed COVID-19 then eye/face protection should be worn for all care.</li>
  <li>If the patient is not suspected/confirmed COVID-19 risk assess whether eye/face protection is required for the care procedure/task where there is an anticipated risk of blood/body fluids spraying/splashes.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Maintaining physical distancing and patient placement</h4>

<p>All staff and other care workers must maintain physical distancing of 2 metres where possible. Where this is not possible, a surgical mask must be worn. Medium-risk patients requiring conveyance should be restricted to one patient per vehicle, wearing a surgical mask. If a distance of 1 metre can be maintained between patients in larger vehicles, 2 patients may be transported together as per local risk assessment. These patients must not be cohorted with patients who are categorised as low-risk or confirmed as COVID-19 positive.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Considerations for cardiac arrests</h3>

<p>The majority of patients who get COVID-19 will have mild symptoms, and it is estimated about 4% to 5% may be critically ill.</p>

<p>If a patient experiences a witnessed cardiac arrest in front of ambulance responders, commence compression only resuscitation using level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. If there is more than one responder on-scene, those trained in level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should move to be at least 2 metres from the patient and don level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> before proving advanced life support assistance.</p>

<p>Commence resuscitation where this is indicated by local clinical guidance. Minimise the delay in undertaking time-critical interventions. It is acceptable for the first person to enter the scene wearing level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. Where trained and equipped to use level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, this may be used initially where it will not cause a delay in commencing defibrillation and/or chest compressions.</p>

<p>Considerations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commence chest compressions, attach the defibrillator and defibrillate if indicated. none of these tasks are considered as <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> and can be undertaken in level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>do not place your face near the patient to assess breathing</li>
  <li>do not progress to airway management or ventilation until you have donned level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>where available, place a surgical mask or oxygen mask on the patients face</li>
  <li>if required and not already available on-scene, request back up from a level 3 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> trained response</li>
  <li>if resuscitation is not commenced, or is terminated before the arrival of other resources, provide an early sit-rep to reduce the number of responders who need to enter the scene</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Care of the deceased</h3>

<p>Those handling bodies should be aware that there is likely to be a continuing risk of infection from the body fluids and tissues of cases where COVID-19 is identified. The usual principles of standard infection control precautions (<abbr title="standard infection control precautions">SICPs</abbr>) and transmission-based precautions (<abbr title="transmission based precautions">TBPs</abbr>) apply for bodies that are possible or confirmed COVID-19.</p>

<p>As a minimum, the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> required for handling a deceased possible or confirmed COVID-19 patient is Level 2 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, as detailed above.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Conveyance and patient handover</h2>

<p>It is important to follow the local guidance specific to the Trust/area. This may require contact with the receiving unit prior to departure or on arrival to have a discussion regarding where to take the patient as this may not be the usual area within the hospital.</p>

<p>Confirmed cases with a positive result – confirmed by Public Health England or a positive testing result: can be transported in the same vehicle wearing surgical masks (social distancing between patients while in the vehicle is not required).</p>

<p>Possible cases (ie symptomatic or suspected): should be restricted to one patient per vehicle. Patients should wear surgical masks. If a distance of one metre can be maintained between patients in larger vehicles, 2 patients may be transported together. The required distance may equate to one empty seat between patients in the same row, and one empty row between rows of patients, but needs to be measured.</p>

<p>Asymptomatic cases who have not experienced COVID-19 symptoms in the past 10 days: may be conveyed in the same vehicle provided they wear surgical masks and must sit over one metre apart. The required distance may equate to one empty seat between patients in the same row, and one empty row between rows of patients, but this needs to be measured.</p>

<p>During peaks of infection those who are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">shielding and/or are clinically extremely vulnerable</a> should be restricted to one patient per vehicle, unless it is possible to maintain a distance of over one metre between patients as outlined above. These patients should wear a surgical mask. Please note as evidence about risk to these patients develops, guidance is likely to evolve and any changes to the recommended level of protection should be followed. This may mean increasing or decreasing the level of social distancing required during transit.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for ambulance clinicians to change or upgrade their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for the purposes of entering the <abbr title="Emergency department">ED</abbr>, or the receiving unit, to conduct patient handover.</p>

<h4>Patient Distress</h4>

<p>Clinicians should be aware that for some survivors of sexual assault or rape, being asked to wear a mask or face covering may trigger flash backs of past events or cause severe distress and anxiety. Charities supporting survivors are promoting the use of cards which an individual can show to highlight that they cannot wear a mask, as it may be distressing for them to have to explain the reasoning.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Utilising the most appropriate conveying resource</h3>

<p>Note: Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases must not be conveyed by rapid response vehicle.</p>

<p>For vehicles where there is no closed bulkhead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all occupants of the vehicle that are not protected by a bulkhead are required to wear a surgical mask</li>
  <li>the patient must, wherever possible, wear a surgical mask during transportation</li>
</ul>

<p>The following guidance applies whenever a patient is conveyed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Avoid opening cupboards and compartments unless essential, if equipment is likely to be required then remove from the cupboard prior to loading patient.</li>
  <li>Air conditioning or ventilation must be set to extract and not recirculate the air within the vehicle (where possible).</li>
  <li>Essential escorts/carers/support workers should not be restricted from travelling with the patient where their support is necessary for the benefit of the patient for example, disabled patients.</li>
  <li>Non-essential persons (such as observers, family members) are not to travel within the patient compartment with a suspected or confirmed case, unless the patient is a child who requires conveyance, in this case it is acceptable for a parent or guardian to accompany the child.</li>
  <li>Family members and relatives of these patients accompanying these patients may be restricted depending on the identified risk pathway for the patient. All visitors/patient escorts will be required to wear a face covering within the ambulance and should remain in the vehicle saloon.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Use of aviation for transfer of COVID-19 patients</h3>

<p>There are circumstances where it is appropriate for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients to be flown, for example during transfer by air ambulance. Organisations responsible for these operations should evaluate options and take measures to minimise risk of transmission from contact, droplet and airborne routes to attending medical staff and to aircrew.</p>

<p>On occasions, <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> will be necessary during the airborne transfer of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients (for example, in emergency airway suction). Despite measures being taken to avoid <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> being routinely delivered on the aircraft, planning must be made for this eventuality. Including consideration of donning the appropriate level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> prior to take-off.</p>

<p>Organisations should consider whether the cockpit can be isolated from the medical cabin sufficiently to prevent contact, droplet and airborne transmission, for example using an ‘air-tight’ bulkhead seal and separating cabin and cockpit ventilation systems1. Where this can be achieved, the aircraft may be considered in a similar way to a land ambulance with a closed bulkhead between attending medical personnel and ambulance driver. In such circumstances, the same advice in terms of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and subsequent disinfection should be followed.</p>

<p>If the cockpit and medical cabin cannot be separated, organisations must consider whether other measures to avoid transmission are feasible. This includes contact and droplet avoidance, maintaining a distance from pilot(s) to the patient of &gt;2 metres or appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> against these modes of transmission (which may or may not be practicable). Additionally, for the avoidance of airborne transmission, fit-tested <abbr title="filtering face piece respirator">FFP3</abbr> respiratory protection would need to be donned before any <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>. As donning <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> quickly in flight may be impossible for pilots, they may have to wear <abbr title="filtering face piece respirator">FFP3</abbr> throughout a patient transfer flight. Trials have shown this is feasible but individual organisations may have to determine if these measures are operationally acceptable.</p>

<p>Some organisations may consider the use of ‘isolation pods’ with appropriate air filtration where cabin separation is not possible. Careful assessment must be made to the practicality of emergency management of patients in such ‘pods’ and whether an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> can be delivered safely without breaking the seal of the device. If not, other precautions must be in place as above.</p>

<p>Organisations should also consider ACH[^2] with respect to the medical cabin to determine post-<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> procedure for their particular aircraft type[^3].</p>

<p>Following the carriage of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient, it is recommended that both aircraft cabin and equipment are decontaminated. This should be done with disinfectants approved for use on the aircraft type and equipment concerned.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Hospital Handover</h3>

<p>In the event of a delay in handing over your patient at the receiving facility, clinicians must follow the local processes in place with regards to arrival notification and escalations. Where, under exceptional circumstances, if is necessary for the patient to remain in the ambulance whilst awaiting hospital handover, the following <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> precautions should be considered as good practice and adopted where reasonably practical:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that the patient and any essential escorts wear surgical facemasks throughout, providing it does not compromise the patients clinical care, such as when receiving oxygen therapy. This will help to minimise the dispersal of respiratory secretions, reduce environmental contamination and virus particles in the air</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>minimise the number of individuals within the patient compartment. Only essential escorts and the minimum number of clinicians to provide a safe level of care to the patient should remain in the patient compartment. This will help to minimise the dispersal of respiratory secretions, reduce environmental contamination, and reduce virus particles in the air</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider patient positioning and where practical/possible avoid sitting face to face</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintain ventilation systems operating (set on extract where possible), this may require the vehicle to remain running or started periodically to allow the ventilation system to operate. This will help to dilute the level of virus particles and maintain air circulation within the patient compartment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where more than one clinician is available, the clinician providing care to the patient should be rotated regularly, if  possible. This will prevent prolonged exposure time and allow individuals the opportunity to safely change <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and rehydrate, whilst ensuring safe care for the patient</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decontaminate contact surfaces more frequently, where practical this should be carried out during the delay to reduce the environmental contamination levels</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There is no requirement to increase the level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> worn by the clinicians unless the level of care/clinical interventions indicate that a different level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is required. This should be based upon the individuals dynamic risk assessment, with consideration of the transmission route and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> guidance. There is no evidence that increasing the level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in non-<abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> scenarios provides any additional protection. The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://hpspubsrepo.blob.core.windows.net/hps-website/nss/2985/documents/1_covid-19-rapid-review-ipc-for-covid-19.pdf">literature review</a> is available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> Post conveyance</h3>

<p>All linen should be managed as per local policy for the management of infectious linen at the receiving unit.</p>

<p>All waste should be segregated and disposed as per local procedure following the guidance within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-the-safe-management-of-healthcare-waste">HTM07:01 Safe management of Healthcare waste</a>. Waste generated during the care of patients confirmed or suspected as COVID-19 should be disposed of as category B clinical waste, as per local policy, at the receiving unit.</p>

<p>The crew are to remove <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the designated area identified within the receiving unit.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Decontamination</h2>

<p>As coronaviruses have a lipid envelope, a wide range of disinfectants are effective. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and good infection prevention and control precautions are effective at minimising risk but can never eliminate it.</p>

<p>It is possible that these viruses can survive in the environment with the amount of virus contamination on surfaces likely to have decreased significantly by 72 hours, so thorough environmental decontamination is vital.</p>

<p>Decontamination of equipment must be performed using either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a combined detergent/disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million available chlorine (ppm available chlorine (av.cl.))</li>
  <li>a general-purpose neutral detergent solution of warm water followed by a disinfectant solution of 1,000 parts per million available chlorine (ppm.av.cl)</li>
  <li>an alternative combined detergent/disinfectant wipe which is effective against enveloped viruses and has been approved by the local Trust <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> Team</li>
</ul>

<p>If an alternative disinfectant is used within the organisation, the local Infection Prevention and Control Team (<abbr title="Infection Prevention and Control Team">IPCT</abbr>) should be consulted on this to ensure that this is effective against enveloped viruses.</p>

<p>Where equipment is used on-scene for assessing/treating patients, which are not conveyed the equipment can be decontaminated using universal sanitising wipes or equivalent approved disinfectant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Any vehicle when no <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> procedures have been performed</h3>

<p>The vehicle will require an enhanced between patient clean, ensuring thorough decontamination of all exposed surfaces, equipment and contact areas before it is returned to normal operational duties, with the locally approved disinfectant.</p>

<p>Appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be worn to decontaminate the vehicle – as a minimum, this should include apron and gloves.</p>

<p>Any exposed equipment (that is not within closed compartments) including a stretcher on the vehicle will require decontamination with a combined detergent/disinfectant wipe or equivalent, as per the standard between patient clean.</p>

<p>All contact surfaces (cupboards, walls, ledges), working from top to bottom in a systematic process, will require decontamination.</p>

<p>Pay special attention to all touch points.</p>

<p>The vehicle floor should be decontaminated with a detergent solution. This should be at a minimum of the end of every shift and more frequently where facilities exist. Where possible, hospitals should support this practice by working with ambulance colleagues to identify access to appropriate sluice facilities and designated mop and bucket storage for ambulance use.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Any vehicle when <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> procedures have been performed (such as intubation, suctioning, or full ALS cardiopulmonary resuscitation)</h3>

<p>The vehicle will require an enhanced decontamination of all exposed surfaces, equipment and contact areas before it is returned to normal operational duties, with a chlorine-based product (or approved equivalent).</p>

<p>Appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be worn to decontaminate the vehicle – as a minimum, this should include apron and gloves (follow COSHH guidance for protective equipment when using chlorine).</p>

<p>Working from top to bottom in a systematic process, all exposed surfaces and any exposed equipment (that is not within closed compartments) on the vehicle will require decontamination with the locally approved disinfectant.</p>

<p>Pay special attention to all touch points
.
Ensure that the stretcher is fully decontaminated, including the underneath and the base.</p>

<p>The vehicle floor should be decontaminated with a detergent solution followed by a chlorine-based solution at 1,000 parts per million (or approved equivalent), this should be facilitated by the receiving department. Where possible hospitals should support this practice by working with ambulance colleagues to identify access to appropriate sluice facilities and designated mop and bucket storage for ambulance use.</p>
