<p>Changing to a 2-dose NHS human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination schedule for eligible adolescents and adults starting the course after they turn 15 years old, including men who have sex with men (MSM)</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p>Dear Colleague,</p>

<p>This letter provides information about a change to the national NHS universal (<abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>) vaccination programme from 1 April 2022, when those eligible adolescents and adults who start the course on or after they turn 15 years old, will require 2 doses of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine at least 6 months apart – instead of 3 doses – to complete the course. The same applies to anyone receiving the vaccine through the NHS <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme. This is based on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>).</p>

<p>This letter is aimed at health professionals who are responsible for commissioning and operationally delivering the national NHS Universal <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme and the NHS <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr> <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme. We encourage you to share this guidance with all those involved in delivering the programme in your area.</p>

<p>Key points about the change to the programme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>from 1 April 2022, those individuals who would have been eligible to receive 3 doses of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine ( eligible <abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>, and those aged from 15 to 25 years of age who are completely unvaccinated and remain eligible under the adolescent programme), will only require 2 doses at least 6 months apart to be fully vaccinated</li>
  <li>a 3-dose schedule should still be offered to individuals who are known to be <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>-infected, including those on antiretroviral therapy, or are known to be immunocompromised at the time of vaccination</li>
  <li>individuals who start the NHS <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme prior to April 2022 should continue on the planned 3-dose schedule – those who commence prior to April 2022 whose schedule is interrupted or delayed such that they had an interval of 6 months or more between their first and second dose only need a 2-dose schedule (do not require a third dose)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hpv-immunisation-programme-introduction-of-gardasil-9-letter">as set out in our previous letter</a>, the vaccine for both groups eligible for the national NHS <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme is changing from Gardasil® to Gardasil® 9 during 2022 with more information to follow</li>
  <li>there is no change to the eligibility criteria for the programme</li>
</ul>
