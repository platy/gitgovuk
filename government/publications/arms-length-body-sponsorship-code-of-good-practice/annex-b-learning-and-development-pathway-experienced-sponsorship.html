<p>You’ll investigate the impact of assertiveness on your day-to-day working life, as well as the most typical barriers to being assertive. The learning activities will help you determine where you currently stand on the ‘assertiveness continuum’ and identify the emotional triggers that affect your behaviour. You’ll also understand how you come across to different people in different situations, and how you can begin to stretch and flex your personal style in response.</p>

<h3>Strategy &amp; Objectives</h3>

<p><strong><a class="govuk-link" href="https://learn.civilservice.gov.uk/courses/T8yE8o2LSyGcay95Z-gJBQ" rel="external">Start with Why</a></strong></p>
