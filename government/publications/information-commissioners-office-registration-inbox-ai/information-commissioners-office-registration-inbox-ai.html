      <td>This algorithmic tool helps to categorise emails sent to the ICO’s registration inbox and sends out auto-replies in specific cases. The registration inbox generally receives queries from organisations or sole traders who are registered, or are looking to register, with the ICO. Every organisation or sole trader who processes personal information needs to pay a data protection fee to the ICO, unless they are exempt. Typical queries may be about registering with the ICO, how to make a&nbsp; payment, or how to change or update details about a registration.<br><br>The ICO’s registration team often manages high volumes of queries. Assigning members of the team to respond to every request takes time and can lead to high caseloads for Data Protection Fees Officers (DP Fees Officers).<br><br>To reduce the burden on caseloads and ensure we respond in a timely manner to customers, the ICO, alongside selected third parties, have developed an algorithmic tool that categorises emails that are sent to the inbox and sends out auto-replies in specific cases. The algorithm takes into account the content of the email being sent to the inbox and detects whether it is a request about changing a business address. In cases where it detects this kind of request, the algorithm sends out an autoreply that directs the customer to a new online service and points out further information required to process a change request. Only emails with an 80% certainty of a change of address request will be sent an email containing the link to the change of address form.</td>

      <td>Reading an email, understanding the request being made and adequately responding takes time. If more emails were received than the amount that could be sufficiently answered, a backlog would develop. This would lead to delayed responses and reduced customer satisfaction. In a significant proportion of emails received, a simple redirection to an online service is all that is required. However, sifting these types of emails out would also require time if done by a human. The algorithm helps to sift out some of these types of emails that it can then automatically respond to. This enables greater capacity for DP Fees Officers in the registration team, who can, consequently, spend more time on more complex requests.<br><br>Key benefits:<br><br>* Improves efficiency in answering requests sent to the registration inbox<br>* Helps to avoid backlog of emails<br>* Provides case officers with more time to respond to more complex requests</td>
