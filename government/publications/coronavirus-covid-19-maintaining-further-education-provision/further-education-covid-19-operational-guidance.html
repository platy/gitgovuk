<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guidance sets out what <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> and skills providers need to know so that students of all ages can benefit from their education and training in full.</p>

<p>It explains the actions leaders should take to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in their setting. This includes public health advice, endorsed by Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>). This guidance is for leaders and staff in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sixth form colleges</li>
  <li>general <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> colleges</li>
  <li>independent training providers</li>
  <li>designated institutions</li>
  <li>adult community learning providers</li>
  <li>special post-16 institutions</li>
</ul>

<p>It also covers expectations for students with education, health and care (<abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr>) 
plans in mainstream <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> settings and special post-16 institutions. Special post-16 institutions should also read the guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-full-opening-special-schools-and-other-specialist-settings" class="govuk-link">special schools and other specialist settings</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers that have students undertaking other qualifications (such as HE qualifications) should follow <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> guidance for these students, and the same prioritisation for attendance should be given to these students.</p>

<p>Apprenticeship providers should also read the current guidance on providing 
apprenticeships.</p>

<p>We use the terms ‘must’ and ‘should’ throughout the guidance. We use the 
term ‘must’ when the person in question is legally required to do something 
and ‘should’ when the advice set out should be followed unless there is good 
reason not to.</p>

<p>We will keep this guidance under review and update, as necessary.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The government will continue to manage the risk of serious illness from the spread of the virus. We have moved away from stringent restrictions on everyone’s day-to-day lives, towards advising people on how to protect themselves and others, alongside targeted interventions to reduce risk.</p>

<p>As COVID-19 becomes a virus that we learn to live with, there is now an imperative to reduce the disruption to young people’s education - particularly given that the direct clinical risks to young people are extremely low, every adult has been offered the opportunity for 2 doses of the vaccine and all children aged 12 and over are now eligible for vaccination. However, as set out in the autumn and winter plan, the government will remain vigilant and take action where necessary to support and protect the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Our priority is for you to deliver face-to-face, high quality education to all students. The evidence is clear that being out of education causes significant harm to educational attainment, life chances, mental and physical health.</p>

<p>We have worked closely with the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) and Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) to revise this guidance.</p>

<h2>Changes to guidance since the last publication</h2>

<ul>
  <li>update to provide additional clarity on the position for clinically extremely vulnerable staff and students</li>
  <li>new guidance for unaccompanied minors from red list countries</li>
  <li>updated information on connectivity grants</li>
  <li>exam support service for the 2021 autumn exam series</li>
  <li>updated information on <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> grant funding</li>
  <li>updated information on high needs funding</li>
  <li>awarding of vocational and technical qualifications in 2021 to 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk assessment</h2>

<p>You must comply with health and safety law and put in place proportionate control measures.</p>

<p>You must regularly review and update your risk assessments - treating them as ‘living documents’ - as the circumstances in your setting and the public health advice changes. This includes having active arrangements in place to monitor whether the controls are effective and working as planned.</p>

<p>For more information on what is required of leaders in 
relation to health and safety risk assessments and managing risk, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-safety-advice-for-schools/responsibilities-and-duties-for-schools" class="govuk-link">health and safety responsibilities and duties for schools</a>.</p>

<h3>Mixing and ‘bubbles’</h3>

<p>It is no longer necessary to keep students in consistent groups (‘bubbles’).</p>

<p>You should make sure your outbreak management plans cover the possibility that it may become necessary to reintroduce ‘bubbles’ for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups.</p>

<p>Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of ‘bubbles’ would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education.</p>

<h3>Tracing close contacts and self-isolation</h3>

<p>Close contacts will be identified via <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace and education settings will no longer be expected to undertake contact tracing.</p>

<p>As with positive cases in any other setting, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace will work with the positive case to identify close contacts. Contacts from a setting will only be traced by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace where the positive case specifically identifies the individual as being a close contact. This is likely to be a small number of individuals who would be most at risk of contracting COVID-19 due to the nature of the close contact. You may be contacted in exceptional cases to help with identifying close contacts, as currently happens in managing other infectious diseases.</p>

<p>Individuals are not required to self-isolate if they live in the same household as someone with COVID-19, or are a close contact of someone with COVID-19, and any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they’re fully vaccinated</li>
  <li>they’re below the age of 18 years 6 months</li>
  <li>they’ve taken part in or are currently part of an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial</li>
  <li>they’re not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace will contact individuals to let them know that they have been identified as a contact and check whether they are legally required to self-isolate. If they’re not legally required to self-isolate, they will be provided with advice on testing and given guidance on preventing the spread of COVID-19. Even if they do not have symptoms, they will be advised to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible. If they are symptomatic they should stay at home.</p>

<p>Adults who do not need to isolate and young people aged under 18 years 6 months who usually attend an education or childcare setting, and who have been identified as a close contact, should continue to attend the setting as normal. They do not need to wear a face covering within the setting, but it is expected and recommended that these are worn when travelling on public or dedicated transport.</p>

<p>18-year-olds will be treated in the same way as children until 6 months after their 18th birthday, to allow them the opportunity to get fully vaccinated. At this point, they will be subject to the same rules as adults and so if they choose not to get vaccinated, they will need to self-isolate if identified as a close contact.</p>

<p>You will continue to have a role in working with health protection teams in the case of a local outbreak. If there is an outbreak in a setting or if central government offers the area an enhanced response package, a director of public health might advise a setting to temporarily reintroduce some additional control measures.</p>

<h3>Face coverings</h3>

<p>Face coverings are no longer advised for students, staff and visitors either in classrooms or in communal areas. You can find more information on the use of face coverings in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">face coverings including when to 
wear one, exemptions and how to make your own</a>.</p>

<p>The government has removed the requirement to wear face coverings in law but expects and recommends they are worn in enclosed and crowded spaces where an individual may come into contact with people they do not normally meet. This includes public transport and dedicated transport to college.</p>

<h4>In circumstances where face coverings are recommended</h4>
<p>If you have an outbreak in your setting a director of public health might advise you that face coverings should temporarily be worn in communal areas or classrooms (by students, staff and visitors, unless exempt). You should make sure your outbreak management plans cover this possibility.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, transparent face coverings, which may assist communication with someone who relies on lip reading, clear sound or facial expression to communicate, can also be worn. Transparent face coverings 
may be effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. However, the evidence to support this is currently very limited. Face coverings (whether transparent or cloth) should fit securely around the face to cover the nose and mouth and be made with a breathable material capable of filtering airborne particles.</p>

<p>The main benefit from a transparent face covering is that they can aid communication, for example enabling lip-reading or allowing for the full visibility of facial expressions, but this should be considered alongside the 
comfort and breathability of a face covering that contains plastic, which may mean that the face covering is less breathable than layers of cloth.</p>

<p>Face visors or shields can be worn by those exempt from wearing a face covering but they are not an equivalent alternative in terms of source control of virus transmission. They may protect the wearer against droplet spread in specific circumstances but are unlikely to be effective in preventing the escape of smaller respiratory particles when used without an additional face covering. They should only be used after carrying out a risk assessment for the specific situation and should always be cleaned appropriately.</p>

<p>The use of face coverings may have a particular impact on those who rely on visual signals for communication. Those who communicate with or provide support to those who do, are exempt from any recommendation to wear face coverings in education settings.</p>

<p>You have a duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled students, to support them to access education successfully. Where appropriate, you should discuss with students and parents the types of reasonable adjustments that are being considered to support an individual.</p>

<p>No student should be denied education on the grounds of whether they are, or are not, wearing a face covering.</p>

<h3>Stepping measures up and down</h3>
<p>You should have outbreak management plans outlining how you would operate if there were an outbreak in your setting or local area. Given the detrimental impact that restrictions on education can have on students, any 
measures in settings should only ever be considered as a last resort, kept to the minimum number of settings or groups possible, and for the shortest amount of time possible.</p>

<p>Central government may offer local areas of particular concern an enhanced response package to help limit increases in transmission.</p>

<p>For most settings, it will make sense to think about taking extra action if the number of positive cases substantially increases. Information on what circumstances might lead you to consider taking additional action, and the steps you should work through, can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-local-restrictions-in-education-and-childcare-settings/contingency-framework-education-and-childcare-settings" class="govuk-link">contingency framework</a>.</p>

<p>You should call the dedicated advice service who will escalate the issue to your local health protection team where necessary and advise if any additional action is required, such as implementing elements of your outbreak 
management plan. You can reach them by calling the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> helpline on 0800 046 8687 and selecting option 1 for advice on the action to take in response to a positive case.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-local-restrictions-in-education-and-childcare-settings/contingency-framework-education-and-childcare-settings">contingency framework</a> describes the principles of managing local outbreaks of COVID-19 in education and childcare settings. Local authorities, directors of public health (DsPH) and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> health protection teams (HPTs) can recommend measures described in the contingency framework in individual education and childcare settings – or a small cluster of settings – as part of their outbreak management responsibilities.</p>

<h2>Control measures</h2>

<p>You should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure good hygiene for everyone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintain appropriate cleaning regimes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep occupied spaces well ventilated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow public health advice on testing, self-isolation and managing confirmed cases of COVID-19.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. Ensure </span> good hygiene for everyone</h3>

<h4>Hand hygiene</h4>
<p>Frequent and thorough hand cleaning should now be regular practice. You should continue to ensure that students clean their hands regularly. This can be done with soap and water or hand sanitiser.</p>

<h4>Respiratory hygiene</h4>
<p>The ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach continues to be very important. The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://e-bug.eu/eng_home.aspx?cc=eng&amp;ss=1&amp;t=Information%20about%20the%20Coronavirus">e-Bug COVID-19 website</a> contains free resources for you, including materials to encourage good hand and respiratory hygiene.</p>

<h4>Use of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Most staff in providers will not require <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond what they would normally need for their work.</p>

<p>The guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care" class="govuk-link">safe working in education, childcare and children’s social 
care</a> provides more information on the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for COVID-19.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Maintain appropriate cleaning regimes using standard products such as detergents</h3>

<p>You should put in place and maintain an appropriate cleaning schedule. This could include regular cleaning of areas and equipment (for example twice per day), with a particular focus on frequently touched surfaces.</p>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> has published guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">cleaning of non-healthcare settings</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Keep occupied spaces well ventilated</h3>

<p>When your setting is in operation, it is important to ensure it is well ventilated and that a comfortable teaching environment is maintained.</p>

<p>You should identify any poorly ventilated spaces as part of your risk assessment, and take steps to improve fresh air flow in these areas, giving particular consideration to holding events where visitors are on site.</p>

<p>Mechanical ventilation is a system that uses fans to draw fresh air into rooms and/or extract the room air. 
Where mechanical ventilation systems exist, you should ensure that they are maintained in accordance with the manufacturers’ recommendations.</p>

<p>These should be adjusted to increase the ventilation rate wherever possible and checked to confirm that normal operation meets current guidance and that only fresh outside air is circulated.</p>

<p>If possible, systems should be adjusted to full fresh air or, if this is not possible, then systems should be operated as normal as long as they are within a single room and supplemented by an outdoor air supply.</p>

<p>Opening external windows can improve natural ventilation, and in addition, opening internal doors can also assist with creating a throughput of air. If necessary external opening doors may also be used (if they are not fire doors and where safe to do so).</p>

<p>You should balance the need for increased ventilation while maintaining a comfortable temperature.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation.htm" class="govuk-link">Health and Safety Executive guidance on air conditioning and ventilation 
during the coronavirus outbreak</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.cibse.org/coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">CIBSE COVID-19 advice</a> provides more 
information.</p>

<p>CO2 monitors will be provided to state-funded education settings from September, so staff can quickly identify where ventilation needs to be improved. As the monitors are rolled out the department will provide guidance on their use.</p>

<p>The government has also launched a trial of air purifiers in 30 schools in Bradford, which is designed to assess the technology in education settings and whether they could reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Follow public health advice on testing, self-isolation and managing confirmed cases of COVID-19</h3>

<h4>When an individual develops COVID-19 symptoms or has a positive test</h4>

<p>Students, staff and other adults should follow public health advice on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do/">when to self isolate</a>. They should not come into the setting if they have <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">symptoms</a> or other reasons requiring them to stay at home due to the risk of them passing 
on COVID-19 (for example, they are required to quarantine or have a positive test).</p>

<p>If anyone in your setting develops COVID-19 symptoms, however mild, you should send them home and they should follow public health advice.</p>

<p>If a student in a residential setting shows symptoms, they should initially self-isolate in their residential setting household, so that their usual support can continue, others may benefit from self-isolating in their family home.</p>

<p>For everyone with symptoms, they should avoid using public transport and, wherever possible, be collected by a member of their family or household.</p>

<p>In non-residential settings, if a student displays COVID-19 symptoms, or has a positive test, while at their setting they should avoid using public transport and, wherever possible, be collected by a member of their family or household.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if safe, they should walk, ride, cycle or drive wherever possible. If driving they should try to be the only person in the vehicle, but can share a car with their household if necessary. They should open windows, wear a face covering and sit far away from others if sharing a car. They should not use public transport or a taxi or private hire vehicle to return home.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances alternative arrangements may need to be organised by the setting. The local authority may be able to help source a suitable vehicle which would provide appropriate protection for the driver, who must be made aware that the individual has tested positive or is displaying symptoms.</p>

<p>If a student is awaiting collection they should be left in a room on their own if possible and safe to do so. A window should be opened for fresh air ventilation if possible. Appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should also be used if close contact is necessary. Further information on this can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care" class="govuk-link">use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> guidance</a>. Any rooms they use should be cleaned after they have left.</p>

<p>The household (including any siblings) must follow <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> guidance - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">Stay at home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>.</p>

<h5>Asymptomatic testing</h5>

<p>Testing remains important in reducing the risk of transmission of infection within settings. That is why, whilst some measures are relaxed, others will remain, and if necessary, in response to the latest epidemiological data, we all need to be prepared to step measures up or down in future depending on local circumstances.</p>

<p>Staff and students should continue to test twice weekly at home, with lateral flow device (<abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test kits, 3 to 4 days apart. Testing remains voluntary but is strongly encouraged.</p>

<p><abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers, except <abbr title="independent training providers">ITPs</abbr>/<abbr title="Adult Community Learning Providers">ACLPs</abbr>, should also retain a small Asymptomatic Testing Site (<abbr title="Asymptomatic Testing Site">ATS</abbr>) on-site until further notice so they can offer testing to students who are unable to test themselves at home.</p>

<h5>Confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests</h5>

<p>Staff or students who receive a positive <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result should self-isolate in 
line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>. They will also need to get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">free <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test to check if they have COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst awaiting the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result, the individual should continue to self-isolate.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is taken within 2 days of the positive <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test, and is negative, it overrides the <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result and the student can return to their setting, as long as the individual does not have COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<p>Additional information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-home-test-kits-for-schools-and-fe-providers/coronavirus-covid-19-home-test-kits-for-schools-and-fe-providers" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits for schools and further 
education providers</a> is available.</p>

<h5>Other considerations</h5>

<p>Clinical studies have shown that children and young people, including those previously considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable (<abbr title="Clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>), are at very low risk of serious illness if they catch the virus. The UK Clinical Review Panel has recommended that no children and young people under the age of 18 should be considered <abbr title="Clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> and under-18s should be removed from the Shielded Patient List. The chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency and head of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace has written to parents of these children to inform them.</p>

<p>Young people previously considered <abbr title="Clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> should attend their setting and should follow the same <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">guidance</a> as the rest of the population. However, if a young person has been advised to isolate or reduce their social contact by their specialist, due to the nature of their medical condition or treatment, rather than because of the pandemic, they should continue to follow the advice of their specialist.</p>

<p>You should ensure that key contractors are aware of the setting’s control measures and ways of working.</p>

<h5>Admitting students and staff back to the setting</h5>

<p>In most cases, parents and carers will agree that a student with symptoms should not attend the setting, given the potential risk to others. If a parent or carer insists on a student attending your setting, you can take the decision to refuse the student if, in your reasonable judgement, it is necessary to protect other students and staff from possible infection with COVID-19. Your decision would need to be carefully considered in light of all the circumstances and current public health advice.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 vaccination</h2>

<p>All young people aged 12 to 17 years are now eligible for the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Children and young people aged 12 to 17 years who are at increased risk from infection, or who are living with someone who is immunosuppressed, have also been offered 2 doses of the vaccine, 8 weeks apart. These children will be contacted by a local <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> service such as their GP surgery to arrange their appointments. All other 12 to 15 year olds will be offered the vaccine via the school-based programme.  Young people aged 16 to 17 will be invited to a local <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> service such as a GP surgery or can access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/find-a-walk-in-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-site/" rel="external">vaccine via some walk-in COVID-19 vaccination sites</a>.</p>

<p>More information on how to get a vaccine can be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> website</a>. Local areas may also work with partners to set up “pop up” temporary clinics at locations convenient for students to access. Students registered with a GP can book their appointment at a larger vaccination centre, a community pharmacy run site or at some GP run sites through the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">National Booking Service</a> if 18 or over or by phoning 119.</p>

<p>Individuals can request to book COVID-19 vaccination appointments as an unregistered patient through a local GP practice. You should encourage students to consult the <a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/covid-19-vaccination-faqs-students-in-higher-education-institutions/" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 vaccination FAQs for students in Higher Education Institutions</a> and is also relevant for any student aged 18 and over. This has been published by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England and provides a range of important information.</p>

<p>Some employers are requiring staff to be vaccinated to work in their settings, and in some health and care settings this will be a legal requirement. We therefore advise you to discuss this with employers to confirm what they will expect from placement students. Further information can be found on ACAS website <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.acas.org.uk/working-safely-coronavirus/getting-the-coronavirus-vaccine-for-work">getting the COVID-19 vaccine for work</a>.</p>

<h2>Site safety and estates</h2>

<h3>Site safety</h3>
<p>Some <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> courses, such as vocational training, healthcare-related courses and the performing arts may pose particular risks of aerosol, droplet and surface transmission and may therefore warrant increased consideration, for example, face coverings, ventilation or cleaning in accordance with guidance issued for the relevant <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">professional working arrangements</a>.</p>

<h4>Measures elsewhere</h4>
<p>If your setting operates commercial training environments such as hairdressing, barbering and beauty salons, sports and fitness facilities or restaurants, external catering, they must comply with guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">working 
safely</a>.</p>

<p>Where settings have kitchens on-site, they and any external catering contractors must comply with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance in working safely</a>.</p>

<h2>Off-site provision and work placements</h2>

<h3>External work placements</h3>
<p>It is important that you involve staff, students and the organisations who provide work placements to co-produce guidance, student charters or agreements, making clear the responsibilities for staying safe and protecting others. By involving others, the guidance is more likely to be adhered to. Where relevant, other outside bodies that may be affected (for example, suppliers, transport providers) may also be involved.</p>

<p>We are committed to ensuring that all young people undertaking a traineeship can spend time on a work placement with an employer. The work placement is fundamental to a traineeship, which is a work-focused route. We have given you further flexibilities to tailor traineeships during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes reducing the number of required work placement hours from 100 to 70 and extending the duration of the programme from 6 months to 12 months. The work placement can be delivered flexibly over the full programme duration.</p>

<h2>Physical activity, sports and extra curricular activities</h2>

<p>Activities for performing arts should be undertaken in line with the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts">working safely during COVID-19 in the performing arts</a>.</p>

<h2>Education and training delivery</h2>

<h3>What we expect of <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers</h3>

<p>On-site delivery allows students of all ages to benefit from their education and training in full. This means we expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fully deliver planned hours for students of all ages including those with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> (with or without an <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plan)</li>
  <li>ensure that students have the opportunity to spend a similar amount of time on-site every week as they did prior to COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mode of delivery</h3>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers have made extensive use of remote and online learning to maintain delivery, and in doing so have significantly increased their capability to deliver online and utilise education technology and digital resources to support delivery.</p>

<p>While <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers have been highly successful in delivering remote and online education during the pandemic, we know that it is not a full replacement for on-site education. Remote and online education, however well delivered, cannot replicate the building of relationships between students and teachers nor the close supervision and hands-on training vital to developing vocational competence. For these reasons we strongly expect on-site education to be the norm for the large majority of 16 to 19 study programme planned hours for the remainder of the 2021 academic year.</p>

<p>Guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-study-programmes-guide-for-providers/16-to-19-study-programmes-guidance-2021-to-2022-academic-year" class="govuk-link">use of remote and online learning</a> with respect to study programme delivery in the 2021 to 2022 academic year has been published.</p>

<p>Adult students have always been offered a wider variety of delivery models in comparison to 16 to 19 year olds. You should continue to judge the right balance between on-site and remote delivery for adult students in order to provide high-quality education and training.</p>

<h3>Provision of remote learning to students unable to attend on-site for COVID-19 related reasons</h3>

<p>For students unable to attend on-site for COVID-19 related reasons, for example, because they need to self-isolate, we expect you to provide remote education to minimise disruption to their learning.</p>

<p>While students are unable to attend on-site, you should use your best endeavours to deliver as much of students’ planned hours as possible and meet the expectations set out below concerning participation, live teaching, feedback, assessment, attendance and engagement.</p>

<p>We recognise that for some students the full delivery of planned hours may not be possible, for example where a student is undertaking a course involving practical teaching and training which necessitates the use of specialist equipment and supervision or with respect to work experience and placements.</p>

<p>So that students (and parents of students aged 19 and below) know what to expect if they need to learn remotely, you should set out details of your remote education offer on your website.</p>

<h2>Contingency planning</h2>
<p>For individuals or groups of self-isolating students following local or national government guidance related to COVID-19, remote education plans should be in place.</p>

<p>You should continue to operate as normally as possible. In the event that restrictions in education are needed to help contain the spread of the virus, you may be asked to revise your delivery models for a short period of time. To help with this, we have published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-contingency-framework-for-education-and-childcare-settings/contingency-framework-education-and-childcare-settings-excluding-universities" class="govuk-link">contingency framework</a>, which outlines how you should operate in the event of any restrictions.</p>

<p>Any decision that there should be local restrictions in any education settings will be made by central government on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>Remote delivery expectations</h2>
<p>In circumstances where you need to deliver remotely for COVID-19 related reasons, the following minimum expectations should be met.</p>

<h3>Expectations on participation</h3>
<p>Set clear expectations of students concerning their participation in the remote elements of their programme, so they know when and how they are expected to engage and demonstrate their learning.</p>

<h4>Live teaching</h4>
<p>As far as possible provide live online teaching. This is advised because Ofsted and many providers have found that learners generally prefer interactive ‘live’ online lessons and that it results in greater engagement. Alternatives to live lessons may include recorded lessons.</p>

<h4>Feedback and assessment</h4>
<p>Confirm with students the different ways in which they will receive individual assessment and feedback when learning remotely to support their progression. The nature and frequency of remote assessment and feedback 
should reflect the individual need and the courses they are enrolled on.</p>

<p>It should be at least:</p>

<ul>
  <li>once every week for academic study programmes</li>
  <li>fortnightly if undertaking technical or applied general study 
programmes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Monitoring attendance</h4>

<p>Have systems in place to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check, at least weekly, for persistent non-attendance or lack of 
engagement with remote education</li>
  <li>quickly agree ways in which attendance and participation can be 
improved</li>
</ul>

<p>You should give particular consideration on how best to support vulnerable and disadvantaged students and students with special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>). We recognise that some students with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> may not be able to access remote education without support and expect <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers to work with families to deliver an ambitious curriculum for their level of need.</p>

<p>You should have a named senior leader with overarching responsibility for the quality and delivery of remote education, who should ensure that provision meets the above expectations.</p>

<h3>Support for students who are unable to access remote digital education</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-help-with-technology-for-remote-education">get help with technology</a> service is providing support with devices and connectivity for 16 to 19 year olds. This forms part of a £400 million investment to help children and young people continue their education at home and access online social care services. Connectivity grants will be available in the event of COVID-19 disruption to education. These will be to help young people in further education who do not otherwise have access to adequate internet connectivity at home.</p>

<p>Further detail on who is eligible and how to access support is available on the <a href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">get help with technology service</a>.</p>

<p>You can also continue to use the 16 to 19 bursary fund to provide financial support to help students overcome specific financial barriers to participation so that they can remain in education. This may include the provision of devices and connectivity support. As set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2020-to-2021-academic-year">16 to 19 bursary fund guidance</a>, you should decide what support a student needs on the basis of individual assessment, in line with bursary fund rules.</p>

<p>For adults aged 19 and over we introduced a change to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2020-to-2021">adult education budget (<abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr>) funding rules</a> for the 2020 to 2021 academic year. This was to enable you to use learner support funds to purchase <abbr title="information technology">IT</abbr> devices or internet access for disadvantaged students to help them meet technology costs, where these costs are a barrier to accessing or continuing in their training. This change has been continued in the 2021 to 2022 academic year. This flexibility is only for providers funded by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>. In areas where the <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> is devolved, contact the relevant mayoral combined authority or the Greater London Authority concerning adult student support arrangements.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Transport</h3>
<p>The government has removed the requirement to wear face coverings in law but expects and recommends that they are worn in enclosed and crowded spaces where individuals may come into contact with people they do not normally meet. This includes public transport and dedicated transport to college.</p>

<h3>Wider public transport</h3>
<p>We encourage students and staff to continue to walk, cycle or drive wherever it is possible and safe to so. Where students and staff use public transport, they should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">safer travel guidance for passengers</a>.</p>

<h3>Safe behaviour off-site</h3>
<p>You should consider how to reinforce public health messaging to students and staff, particularly at the point where they are entering and leaving college and heading into the community each day.</p>

<p>People are more likely to follow guidance on how to behave if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they understand the reasons they are asked to take certain actions</li>
  <li>it is co-produced with the staff and students who will be affected by it</li>
</ul>

<p>You should develop guidance to promote safe behaviour in the wider community with local community leaders as well as staff and students. You can encourage student organisations to lead in promoting COVID-19 safety.</p>

<h3>Educational visits</h3>
<p>Given the likely gap in COVID-19 cancellation related insurance, if considering booking a new visit you are advised to ensure that any new bookings have adequate financial protection in place.</p>

<h3>International visits</h3>

<h4>International educational exchanges, study abroad or volunteering programmes</h4>

<p>For students who may have plans for study or volunteering abroad that are organised by providers in England, for example placements receiving <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-turing-scheme-to-support-thousands-of-students-to-study-and-work-abroad" class="govuk-link">Turing Scheme</a> funding from September, or those receiving Erasmus+ funding from projects successfully bid for under the 2014 to 2020 programme.</p>

<p>You should refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-transport-and-travel-guidance#international-travel" class="govuk-link">guidance on international travel</a> before booking and travelling.</p>

<p>We expect that students and providers will comply with travel advice given by Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr>) that sets out COVID-19 and other risks from travel abroad.</p>

<h2>Workforce</h2>
<p>You are best placed to determine the workforce required to meet the needs of your students.</p>

<h3>Staff who are clinically extremely vulnerable</h3>

<p>Social distancing measures ended in the workplace on 19 July and it is no longer necessary for the government to advise people to work from home.</p>

<p>The shielding programme has now come to an end and adults previously considered <abbr title="Clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> should, as a minimum, continue to follow the same guidance as everyone else. It is important that everyone adheres to this guidance but people previously considered <abbr title="Clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> may wish to consider taking extra precautions. In some circumstances, staff may have received personal advice from their specialist or clinician on additional precautions to take and they should continue to follow that advice.</p>

<p>Employers should be able to explain the measures they have in place to keep  staff safe at work. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has published guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/protect-people.htm" class="govuk-link">protecting vulnerable workers</a>, including advice for employers and employees on <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/talking-to-your-workers/index.htm" class="govuk-link">how to talk about reducing risks in the workplace</a>.</p>

<p>We welcome your support in encouraging vaccine take up and enabling staff who are eligible for a vaccination to attend booked vaccine appointments where possible, even during term time.</p>

<h3>Staff and students who are pregnant</h3>
<p>You will need to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees" class="govuk-link">specific guidance for pregnant employees</a>. We recommend that you follow the same principles for pregnant students, in <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/">guidance and advice on COVID-19 and pregnancy from the Royal 
College of Gynaecologists</a>.</p>

<h3>Supporting staff</h3>
<p>All employers have a duty of care to their employees, and this extends to their 
mental health.</p>

<p>Because some staff may be particularly anxious about attending, you may need extra systems in place to support staff wellbeing. Read about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/extra-mental-health-support-for-pupils-and-teachers" class="govuk-link">extra mental health support for pupils and teachers</a>.</p>

<h3>Supporting vulnerable students</h3>
<p>Vulnerable students are those who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are assessed as being in need under section 17 of the Children Act 
1989, including students who have a child in need plan, a child 
protection plan or who are a looked-after child</li>
  <li>have an <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plan</li>
  <li>have been assessed as otherwise vulnerable by educational providers 
or local authorities (including children’s social care services) - this 
includes:
    <ul>
      <li>students on the edge of receiving support from children’s social care 
services</li>
      <li>adopted children</li>
      <li>those at risk of becoming <abbr title="not in employment, education or training">NEET</abbr>
</li>
      <li>those living in temporary accommodation</li>
      <li>those who are young carers</li>
      <li>those who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at home 
(for example due to a lack of devices or quiet space to study)</li>
      <li>others at the provider and local authority’s discretion, including 
students who need to attend to receive support or manage risks to their 
mental health</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, young people with a social worker or <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plans are expected to attend provision (subject to public health advice), because of their safeguarding and welfare needs.</p>

<p>If vulnerable students do not attend, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work together with the local authority and social worker (where 
applicable) to follow up with the parent or carer to explore the reason 
for absence and discuss their concerns</li>
  <li>work closely with other professionals, where appropriate, to support 
attendance</li>
  <li>notify the student’s social worker, if they have one, particularly where 
the social worker (where applicable) agrees that the student’s 
attendance would be appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>If the vulnerable student wishes to be absent from face-to-face education during local or national restrictions, they should let their setting know. The young person should not be included in the COVID-19 attendance monitoring 
data as ‘expected to attend’. Further guidance is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-complete-the-educational-setting-status-form" class="govuk-link">how to complete the educational setting status form</a>.</p>

<p>Where you have had to close, you should inform the local authority to discuss alternative arrangements for vulnerable students and work towards reopening as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You should work collaboratively with other education providers and local partners to maximise opportunities for face-to-face provision for vulnerable students. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the local authority</li>
  <li>social workers</li>
  <li>police</li>
  <li>youth services</li>
  <li>key workers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transition in and out of <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr>
</h3>
<p>You should continue to work with schools and local authorities to support transitions. This includes sharing any relevant welfare and child protection information. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">Keeping children safe in education</a> sets out responsibilities for sharing information.</p>

<p>Some young people might need additional mental health and wellbeing support. Use external support where necessary and possible. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Mental-health">mental health and wellbeing section</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You should assess where students are in their learning and agree on a plan to support catch up. This is supported through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund" class="govuk-link">16 to 19 tuition fund</a>. For looked-after children and care leavers, this may mean working with the virtual school head or personal adviser to review personal education and pathway plans.</p>

<h3>Supporting students with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Given the importance of therapists (for example speech and language, physiotherapy, occupational therapy) and other health professionals in supporting young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>, all <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers are reminded that 
specialists, therapists, clinicians and other support staff for students with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> should provide interventions as usual.</p>

<p>Many students will have found restrictions exceptionally difficult socially and emotionally. Speak to the student or their parents, to find out if any challenging behaviours or social or emotional challenges are a response to restrictions. If they are, you should offer additional support. Reasonable adjustments should be provided to support a disabled young person to access education successfully.</p>

<p>Where young people with <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plans are not attending their education setting because they are following public health advice, multi-agency professionals should collaborate to agree how to deliver the provision set out in the <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plan. This may include face-to-face visits to the home, or virtual support by means of video or telephone calls, or via email.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding young people</h3>
<p>Your staff should be particularly vigilant about new and additional safeguarding concerns. You should make staff and volunteers aware of what they should do if they have any concerns about a student. It is important that they act immediately on any safeguarding concerns. Check that the safeguarding and welfare information you hold on all students is accurate and ask parents and carers to tell you about any changes in welfare, health and wellbeing. Continue to work with and support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>young people’s social workers</li>
  <li>the local authority virtual school head for looked-after and previously looked-after children</li>
  <li>personal advisers for care leavers</li>
  <li>any other relevant safeguarding and welfare partners</li>
</ul>

<p>You have a statutory duty with regards to 16 and 17 year olds to provide information to local authority services to enable them to track and maintain contact with these young people. This will help local authorities to identify those not participating so that they can provide those students with the support they need to reach their potential.</p>

<p>Continue following statutory guidance on inter-agency working, set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2" class="govuk-link">working together to safeguard children</a>. You should also refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">keeping children safe in education</a>.</p>

<p>External resources that can support the safeguarding of young people include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/safecall-service">SafeCall</a>, which offers support to victims of exploitation – young people

one to one activity with under 18s, developed by Kirklees College and 
the National Association for Managers of Student Services (<abbr title="National Association for Managers of Student Services">NAMSS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mental health and wellbeing</h3>

<p>Many students and staff members will be feeling uncertain and anxious at this time. It is important to support positive mental health and wellbeing, which is necessary for young people to engage in learning.</p>

<p>You should identify young people and members of staff who may need additional support and engage with them and their representatives to understand their needs and ensure they have appropriate mental health and 
wellbeing support in place. Vulnerable young people are particularly likely to need additional support with their mental health and wellbeing. The guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2">mental health and behaviour in schools</a> might be helpful with this.</p>

<p>Work with local authorities and voluntary sector mental health organisations to ensure that support is in place. Contact your local authority to see if they have a list of services in your area that provide support for young people. In some cases support can be given over the phone for students self-isolating from 
specialist staff or support services.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> children and young people’s mental health services may also be able to provide support remotely. Professionals involved with children and young people, including teachers, special educational needs coordinators (<abbr title="special educational needs co-ordinator">SENCO</abbr>) social workers, youth workers and educational psychologists should continue referring young people to their local <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> children and young people’s mental health services where needed. Self-referral options are commonly available and many services offer single points of access. Young people or their parents or carers can also contact their GP or refer to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> 111 online.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> trusts have also established 24-hour urgent mental health helplines in most parts of England for people of all ages. If you have urgent concerns about a young person, find your local helpline to discuss your concerns with a 
mental health professional. You should also ensure that students are aware of this service. The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> has published advice on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/supporting-others/childrens-mental-health/" class="govuk-link">looking after a child or young person’s mental health</a>.</p>

<p>Wellbeing for Education Recovery is providing funding to local authorities so they can provide ongoing support and advice for schools and colleges that need it and helping them establish sustainable ways of working together and with longer term services. This builds on the <a href="https://www.minded.org.uk/Component/Details/662137" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Wellbeing for Education 
Return</a> programme in 2020 to 2021, which provided free expert training, support and resources for staff. These resources remain available for education staff to supplement existing local offers.

<h2>International students</h2>
<p>If you have any international students, aged 18 or over, follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses" class="govuk-link">higher education COVID-19 operational guidance</a>. This applies to international students in <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> too.</p>

<h3>Unaccompanied minors travelling from a red list country</h3>

<p>If you have any students who are under 18 and are travelling to study from a red list country, please follow the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses/quarantine-arrangements-for-unaccompanied-minors-joining-higher-education-providers-in-england" class="govuk-link">Quarantine arrangements for unaccompanied minors from red list countries joining a course of higher education in England</a>.</p>

<p>Having read through the guidance above and if you can offer arrangements of an equivalent standard for unaccompanied minors attending an <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> setting, then contact your territorial lead to see if we can agree. If you cannot or do not wish to deliver equivalent quarantine arrangements, your students should contact the managed quarantine services on +44 (0) 207 429 9732 to arrange to be taken there as there are rooms available for them with additional safeguarding.</p>

<h3>Funding, assessment and accountability</h3>
<p>We have issued the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">16 to 19 funding regulations and funding rates and formula guidance</a> for 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022. Given the unprecedented circumstances, we will continue to review the guidance and will notify you of changes.</p>

<h2>Education recovery</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">16 to </span> 19 tuition fund</h3>
<p>We provided extra funding for the academic year 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help mitigate the disruption to learning arising from COVID-19</li>
  <li>support students to catch up with missed learning</li>
</ul>

<p>The funding is provided to support small group tuition for 16 to 19 students who have not achieved a grade 4 or 5 in English and/or maths or who have a grade 4 or above in English and/or maths, but are from an economically disadvantaged background and would need catch-up support. The small group tuition can be in English, maths, or other elements of technical or academic study programmes to help address gaps in knowledge required for 16 to 19 qualifications.</p>

<p>We have issued guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund">how the funding should be used</a> and allocations. Carry over of unspent 2020 to 2021 funds into the 2021 to 2022 year is permitted subject to following <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund#carrying-over-of-funds-in-2021-to-2022">this guidance</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the previously announced extension of the 16 to 19 tuition fund  for the 2021 to 2022 academic year, a further £222m is available to continue the 16 to 19 tuition fund for an additional 2 years from the 2022 to 2023 academic year, allowing access to one-to-one and small group catch up tuition. Young people will be able to catch up in subjects that will benefit them the most, including maths, English and vocational courses.</p>

<p>The 16 to 19 tuition fund continues to support students with special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>) and 19 to 24 year olds with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) through the provision of one to one and small group tuition. Providers may choose to use this funding to support eligible learners with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> to catch up on vocational and academic skills, and skills and learning that are important for their preparation for adulthood, subject to them meeting the eligibility for the fund.</p>

<p>Providers of 16 to 19 education have the option of offering students in year 13 or equivalent the opportunity of repeating up to one more year if they have been particularly severely affected by the pandemic. Some students with education, health and care plans may meet the criteria to repeat a year. Students with EHCPs are already able to receive more time to complete and consolidate their learning where necessary and any decision to repeat a year would have to be agreed by the local authority, as part of the EHCP review process.</p>

<p>We will undertake a review of the evidence on extending the school and college day, to conclude in time for the spending review, alongside continuing to monitor how effectively students are catching up.</p>

<h3>Exam support service for the 2021 autumn exam series</h3>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) will provide an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/responsibility-for-autumn-gcse-as-and-a-level-exam-series/dfe-exam-support-service-autumn-exam-fees-sites-and-invigilators">exam support service</a> for the autumn exam series which will allow centres to claim for essential costs associated with running exams in the autumn, including additional venue space, invigilation, invigilator training and exam fees charged by awarding organisations. 
Centres supporting condition of funding students will be able to claim for costs relating to additional venue space and invigilation. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/responsibility-for-autumn-gcse-as-and-a-level-exam-series/dfe-exam-support-service-autumn-exam-fees-sites-and-invigilators#support-for-invigilation"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Funding for 16 to 19 students</h4>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">16 to 19 funding regulations</a> set out the principles that need to be met to count towards planned hours. 16 to 19 funding is allocated based on planned 
hours regardless of how those hours are delivered. If you are planning to combine time in the classroom or workshop with remote delivery, this will not affect the funding you receive.</p>

<h3>T Levels</h3>
<p>Allocations have been made to providers that will be delivering T Levels in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, based on planned T Level student numbers. We have published the approach for applying a tolerance if the number of students enrolled on T Levels is below the planned number.</p>

<p>Read more about the tolerance and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-are-funded" class="govuk-link">how T Levels are funded</a>.</p>

<p>We will monitor this approach and communicate any revision for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<h4>T Level industry placements</h4>
<p>We are closely monitoring the situation regarding the continuing impact of COVID-19 on industry placements.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">industry placements delivery guidance</a> for information about delivering high-quality industry placements.</p>

<h3>Free meals in further education</h3>

<p>You should continue to support students who are eligible for free meals.</p>

<p>You should provide support even if students are studying remotely due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>Read further guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/free-meals-in-further-education-funded-institutions-guide-for-the-2021-to-2022-academic-year">free meals in further education funded institutions for 2021</a>.</p>

<h3>Funding claims and reconciliation</h3>
<p>Information is available for education and skills training providers on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-funding-claims">submitting funding claims</a> to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Advanced learner loans</h3>
<p>The Student Loans Company (<abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>) will continue to make scheduled fee payments to all providers with an advanced learner loan facility.</p>

<p>Contact <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> if a student’s circumstances change.</p>

<h3>Adult education budget (<abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr>) funding (grant-funded providers)</h3>

<p>Currently, approximately 60% of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-devolution"><abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> is devolved</a> to 9 mayoral combined authorities (MCAs) and delegated to the Mayor of London.</p>

<p>These authorities are now responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr>-funded adult education for their residents</li>
  <li>allocating the <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> to providers</li>
  <li>considering any provider flexibilities in their areas</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> will continue to be responsible for the remaining <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> in non-devolved areas.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> grant funded providers</h4>

<p>In March, we <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lower-reconciliation-threshold-for-esfa-grant-funded-providers" class="govuk-link">announced</a> that due to the impact of COVID-19, we would lower the reconciliation threshold for <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> grant funded adult education budget (<abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> adult skills including non-formula funded community learning and 19 to 24 traineeships) and advanced learner loan bursary fund (<abbr title="Advanced Learner Loan Bursary">ALLB</abbr>) providers for 2020 to 2021, from 97% and 100% respectively to 90%.</p>

<p>Allocations for the covid skills offer, including funding for the new level 3 adult offer, are ringfenced and the reconciliation threshold for under-delivery of this provision remain at 97%.</p>

<p>We based this figure on the latest data from providers at the time and the knowledge that many grant funded providers have been able to continue remote delivery successfully during lockdown.</p>

<p>Following the year-end claims submissions, whilst the 90% threshold remains unchanged, we are developing arrangements to allow <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> grant funded providers to apply for support on one or both of the following grounds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that local circumstances made it impossible for the provider to deliver at or close to the 90% level and recovery of funds based on the 90% threshold would lead to the provider’s costs of <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> delivery not being covered</li>
  <li>that applying the full amount of <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> clawback would cause significant financial difficulties for the provider</li>
</ul>

<p>The evidence supplied in any business case will be assessed against criteria to determine whether support should be provided, and if so, how much. The details of the new arrangements, including how this will operate, are being finalised and we expect to publish these in early September 2021.These arrangements will be in addition to the existing scheme for supporting providers in financial difficulties.</p>

<p>In areas where the <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> has been devolved to Mayoral Combined Authorities (MCAs), or delegated to the Mayor of London , they are responsible for determining the approach to reconciliation in their areas.</p>

<h3>Traineeships</h3>
<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/a-plan-for-jobs-2020" class="govuk-link">Plan for Jobs</a>, the Chancellor announced a significant expansion of traineeships to help an increased number of young people to prepare for and find work. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-young-people-to-develop-the-skills-for-apprenticeships-and-sustainable-employment-framework-for-delivery">traineeships framework for delivery</a> sets out these reforms.</p>

<p>Whilst these reforms enable providers to deliver a more flexible and tailored programme during the COVID-19 pandemic, training and assessment should happen remotely wherever possible during periods of local or national

<h3>Supported Internships and Access to Work</h3>
<p>Supported internships are structured study programmes for young people with an education, health and care plan, based primarily at an employer. During periods of local or national restrictions, placements should happen remotely wherever possible. The young people can continue to attend COVID-secure settings for work placements where they, the learning provider and the employer all agree this is necessary.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work" class="govuk-link">Access to Work</a> funds workplace support for young people who are 
completing a government-funded supported internship, where they need support or adaptations beyond the reasonable adjustments.</p>

<p>Contact the Access to Work helpline on 0800 121 7479 for more information.</p>

<h4>Supported internships returners</h4>
<p>Supported interns who were not able to meet the core aim of their internship in the 2020 to 2021 academic year may continue their internship into the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<p>Where necessary and appropriate, priority for accessing work placements in the 2021 to 2022 academic year should be given to supported interns who were enrolled on a supported internship in 2020 to 2021.</p>

<h4>Recording returning supported internships in the school census and individualised learner record (<abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Record these supported internship students in the <abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr> or school census as completed at the end of the academic year 2020 to 2021. You must then set them up with a new programme covering the additional planned activity in the continuing year with start and planned end dates in the academic year 2021 to 2022. This will ensure that students continue to be funded in the unplanned funding year. Students must be on their new programme for the minimum qualifying period to count as a funded student.</p>

<p>You must only use this recording flexibility for supported internships at the boundary of academic years 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022. Do not use it for any other students or academic years.</p>

<h3>High needs funding</h3>
<p>You should discuss any requirement for high needs funding with your local authority. Students who have high needs will occupy places funded at £6,000 per place (£10,000 per place in special schools) in the normal way. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link">high needs operational guide for 2021 to 2022</a>, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs operational guide for 2022 to 2023</a> which is relevant for the current academic year as well as the forthcoming financial and academic years.</p>

<h3>Awarding of vocational and technical qualifications (<abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr>) in 2021 to 2022</h3>

<p>The approach for 2021 to 2022 builds on the framework and approach to assessment and awarding already in place.</p>

<p>The government’s intention is that exams and assessments for vocational and technical qualifications, including T Levels and functional skills qualifications, will go ahead in 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>Adaptations will continue to be permitted as in 2020 to 2021, where necessary and appropriate.</p>

<p>Provisions for teacher-assessed grades (TAGs) will be retained only to allow awarding organisations to manage students who are going through appeals where results are based on TAGs or who had been expecting a TAG that they have not received.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and Ofqual ran a joint consultation on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/arrangements-for-the-assessment-and-awarding-of-vocational-technical-and-other-general-qualifications-2021-to-2022">arrangements for assessing and awarding <abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr> and other general qualifications in the academic year 2021 to 2022</a>. The response was published on 6 August.</p>

<p>Awarding organisations will publish information on their websites detailing any adaptations for individual qualifications.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and Ofqual have been working together on what the contingency arrangements should be for 2021 to 2022 should the public health situation worsen leading to significant further disruption. These arrangements will be published in the autumn.</p>

<h4>Autumn series for <abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr> students who received a teacher assessed grade (TAG) in 2020 to 2021</h4>

<p>As many <abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr> already have opportunities in the autumn and winter to take an assessment, these will be available to learners who want to use them to improve their grade.</p>

<p>If awarding organisations do not already offer assessment opportunities in the autumn or winter, they must decide whether or not to offer any additional assessment opportunities, based on an analysis of likely need and taking into account manageability for themselves and centres.</p>

<p>Awarding organisations will communicate their arrangements for individual qualifications on their websites.</p>

<h4>Performance data</h4>

<p>We will not publish results data based on exams and assessments from summer 2021 on school and college performance tables or publish qualification achievement rates.</p>

<p>See guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-school-and-college-performance-measures">school and college performance measures</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualification-achievement-rates-and-minimum-standards" class="govuk-link">qualification achievement rates</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Results from qualifications achieved in 2021 to 2022 will be published on school and college performance tables, using our normal suite of accountability measures, as far as that is possible. See guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-school-and-college-performance-measures" class="govuk-link">school and college accountability in 2021 to 2022</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Institution-level qualification achievement rates for post-16 providers will be published for Education and Training, Traineeships and Apprenticeships. These will be published through <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Explore education statistics</a>.</p>

<h3>Inspection</h3>

<p>Ofsted restarted their full programme of inspections at the start of September 2021 and will aim to inspect all providers within the timescales set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif" class="govuk-link">Further education and skills inspection handbook</a>.</p>

<p>Ofsted sets out in its handbook how it will reflect the COVID-19 context when making judgements.</p>
