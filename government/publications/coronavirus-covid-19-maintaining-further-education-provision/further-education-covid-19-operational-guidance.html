<h2>Steps out of lockdown</h2>

<p>Following the successful return to on-site education from 8 March, this guidance has been updated to focus on priorities for the summer term as restrictions are eased in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 response - spring 2021</a>.</p>

<p>The steps out of lockdown will be guided by data, not dates, so that we do not risk a surge in infections that would put unsustainable pressure on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>. For that reason, all the dates in the roadmap are indicative and subject to change. There will be a minimum of 5 weeks between each step, 4 weeks for the scientific data to reflect the changes in restrictions and to be analysed, followed by one week’s advance notice of the restrictions that will be eased.</p>

<p>Only when the government is sure that it is safe to move from one step to the next will the final decision be made.</p>

<p>Alongside the return to face-to-face teaching, the planned easing of restrictions, guided at all stages by data, will allow you to fully reintroduce:</p>

<ul>
  <li>face-to-face extra-curricular activity</li>
  <li>work placements</li>
  <li>education visits</li>
  <li>reopening of commercial training facilities on-site such as hairdressing salons, gyms and restaurants</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of the summer term, we hope providers will be able to open their doors to prospective students for familiarisation events ahead of starting their post-16 study in September.</p>

<p>Subject to the data and the 4 tests set out in the Prime Minister’s roadmap, we expect that the following additional activities will be allowed in <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> settings in line with the steps in wider society.</p>

<h3>Step 1 - 29 March</h3>

<p>As part of Step 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>outdoor sports and leisure facilities such as tennis courts and open-air swimming pools are open</li>
  <li>all students regardless of age can participate in formally organised outdoor sports</li>
  <li>wraparound provision for any reason can take place outdoors for students aged under 18</li>
  <li>clinically extremely vulnerable staff and students have returned to work and their education setting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2 - 12 April</h3>

<p>As part of Step 2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students have returned to industry placements, where working from home is not reasonably possible, and commercial activity within colleges has reopened as the corresponding businesses have begun to open in wider society, for example, personal care and retail</li>
  <li>indoor leisure facilities including gyms have reopened to the public for individual or household use</li>
  <li>on-site hospitality facilities have reopened to the public for table service if they can serve outside</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3 - 17 May</h3>

<p>As part of Step 3:</p>

<ul>
  <li>indoor adult group sport can return, meaning recreational group sport is permitted on all <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> premises</li>
  <li>indoor hospitality on-site can reopen to the public for table service</li>
</ul>

<h3>Review of social distancing</h3>

<p>Before Step 4 begins, the government will complete a review of social distancing and other long-term measures that have been put in place to reduce transmission. This will inform decisions on the timing and circumstances under which the advice on 1 metre plus, and other measures may be lifted.</p>

<h3>Step 4 - not before 21 June</h3>

<p>As part of Step 4 open days can be planned.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance sets out what <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> and skills providers need to know so that students of all ages can benefit from their education and training in full.</p>

<p>It explains the actions leaders should take to minimise the risk of transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19) in their setting. This includes public health advice, endorsed by Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>). This guidance is for leaders and staff in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sixth form colleges</li>
  <li>general <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> colleges</li>
  <li>independent training providers</li>
  <li>designated institutions</li>
  <li>adult community learning providers</li>
  <li>special post-16 institutions</li>
</ul>

<p>It also covers expectations for students with education, health and care (<abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr>) plans in mainstream <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> settings and special post-16 institutions. Special post-16 institutions should also read the guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-full-opening-special-schools-and-other-specialist-settings" class="govuk-link">special schools and other specialist settings</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers that have students undertaking other qualifications (such as HE qualifications) should follow <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> guidance for these students, and the same prioritisation for attendance should be given to these students.</p>

<p>Apprenticeship providers should also read the current guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-apprenticeship-programme-response">providing apprenticeships during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>We will keep this guidance under review and update, as necessary.</p>

<h2>Minimising COVID-19 risks</h2>

<h3>Public health advice</h3>

<p>We have worked closely with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) to develop this guidance.</p>

<p>Implementing the <a href="#system-of-controls" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a> creates a safer environment for students and staff where the risk of transmission of infection is substantially reduced. The way to control this virus is the same, even with the current new variants. Working with <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, we continually review the measures, which are informed by the latest scientific evidence and advice, and update our guidance accordingly.</p>

<h3>Risk assessment</h3>

<p>You have various duties to protect people from harm, as employers, occupiers or due to other responsibilities. This includes taking reasonable steps to protect staff, students and others from COVID-19 within your setting.</p>

<p>You should have active arrangements in place to monitor that the controls are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>effective</li>
  <li>working as planned</li>
  <li>updated appropriately considering any issues identified and changes in public health advice</li>
</ul>

<p>More information on what <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers need to do is available in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-further-education-provision" class="govuk-link">annex A</a>.</p>

<h2>System of controls</h2>

<p>In this section where something is essential for public health reasons, as advised by Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>), we have said ‘must’. Where there is a legal requirement we have made that clear. This guidance does not create any new legal obligations.</p>

<p>This is the set of actions you must take. They are grouped into ‘prevention’ and ‘response to any infection’.</p>

<p>If you follow the system of controls, you will effectively reduce risks in your setting and create an inherently safer environment.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Prevention</h3>

<p>You must always:</p>

<p>1. Minimise contact with individuals who are required to self-isolate by ensuring they do not attend the setting.</p>

<p>2. Make sure face coverings are used in recommended circumstances.</p>

<p>3. Make sure everyone is advised to clean their hands thoroughly and more often than usual.</p>

<p>4. Encourage good respiratory hygiene by promoting the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach.</p>

<p>5. Maintain enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often, using standard products such as detergents.</p>

<p>6. Consider how to minimise contact across the site and maintain social distancing wherever possible.</p>

<p>7. Keep occupied spaces well ventilated.</p>

<p><strong>In specific circumstances:</strong></p>

<p>8. Make sure individuals wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) where necessary.</p>

<p>9. Promote and engage in asymptomatic testing.</p>

<h3>Response to any infection</h3>

<p>You must always:</p>

<p>10. Promote and engage with the NHS Test and Trace process.</p>

<p>11. Manage and report confirmed cases of COVID-19 amongst the setting community.</p>

<p>12. Contain any outbreak by following local health protection team advice.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Minimise contact with individuals who are required to self-isolate by ensuring they do not attend the setting</h3>

<h4>When an individual develops COVID-19 symptoms or has a positive test</h4>

<p>Students, staff and other adults must not come into the setting if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have one or more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works#part-1-people-who-develop-symptoms-of-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 symptoms</a>
</li>
  <li>a member of their household (including someone in their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubble</a> or childcare bubble if they have one) has COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>they are legally required to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control/self-isolating-when-you-arrive" class="govuk-link">isolate having recently visited countries outside the Common Travel Area</a>
</li>
  <li>they have had a positive test</li>
</ul>

<p>They must immediately cease to attend and not attend for at least 10 full days from the day after:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the start of their symptoms</li>
  <li>the test date if they didn’t have any symptoms but have had a positive test (whether this was a <a href="/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#tests-for-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Lateral Flow Device (<abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) or Polymerase Chain Reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must follow this process and ensure everyone on-site or visiting is aware of it.</p>

<p>Anyone told to isolate by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace or by their public health protection team, has a legal obligation to self-isolate, but you may leave home to avoid injury or illness or to escape the risk of harm. More information can be found on <a href="/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace: how it works</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone in your setting develops a new and continuous cough or a high temperature, or has a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia), you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send them home to begin isolation - the isolation period includes the day the symptoms started and the next 10 full days</li>
  <li>advise them to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection</a>
</li>
  <li>advise them to arrange to have a test as soon as possible to see if they have COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>Other members of their household (including any siblings and members of their support or childcare bubble if they have one) should self-isolate. Their isolation period includes the day symptoms started for the first person in their household, or the day their test was taken if they did not have symptoms, whether this was a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#tests-for-covid-19">Lateral Flow Device (<abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) or Polymerase Chain Reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test</a>, and the next 10 full days. If a member of the household starts to display symptoms while self-isolating, they will need to restart the 10-day isolation period and book a test.</p>

<p>If anyone tests positive whilst not experiencing symptoms but develops symptoms during the isolation period, they must restart the 10-day isolation period from the day they developed symptoms.</p>

<p>In non-residential settings, if a student displays COVID-19 symptoms, or has a positive test, while at their setting they should avoid using public transport and, wherever possible, be collected by a member of their family or household.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if safe, they should walk, ride, cycle or drive wherever possible. If driving they should try to be the only person in the vehicle, but can share a car with their household or support bubble if necessary. They should open windows, wear a face covering and sit far away from others if sharing a car. They should not use public transport or a taxi or private hire vehicle to return home.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, alternative arrangements may need to be organised by the setting. The local authority may be able to help source a suitable vehicle which would provide appropriate protection for the driver, who must be made aware that the individual has tested positive or is displaying symptoms.</p>

<p>If a student is awaiting collection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they should be moved, if possible, to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door, depending on the needs of the student, with appropriate adult supervision if required</li>
  <li>a window should be opened for fresh air ventilation if it is safe to do so</li>
  <li>if it is not possible to isolate them, move them to an area which is at least 2 metres away from other people</li>
  <li>if they need to go to the bathroom while waiting to be collected, they should use a separate bathroom if possible, the bathroom must be cleaned and disinfected using standard cleaning products before being used by anyone else</li>
  <li>personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) must be worn by staff caring for the student while they await collection if a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained (such as for a student with complex needs).</li>
</ul>

<p>More information on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> use can be found in the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care" class="govuk-link">safe working in education, childcare and children’s social care settings</a>.</p>

<p>In an emergency, call 999 if someone is seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk.</p>

<p>Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms should not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital unless advised to.</p>

<p>If a student in a residential setting shows symptoms, they should initially self-isolate in their residential setting household. Most will benefit from remaining in self-isolation in their residential accommodation so that their usual support can continue. Others will benefit more from self-isolating in their home.</p>

<p>The individual should not use public transport if they are symptomatic. If arranging their return to their family home to isolate, settings should follow advice on transport arrangements in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care" class="govuk-link">safe working in education, childcare and children’s social care settings</a> guidance.</p>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) has good evidence that routinely taking the temperature of students is not recommended as this is an unreliable method for identifying COVID-19.</p>

<p>Further information is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">how to report COVID-19 lateral flow test results</a>.</p>

<h4>When an individual has had close contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms</h4>

<p>Any member of staff who has provided close contact care to someone with symptoms, regardless of whether they are wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, and all other members of staff or students who have been in close contact with that person, do not need to go home to self-isolate unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the symptomatic person subsequently tests positive</li>
  <li>they develop symptoms themselves (in which case, they should self-isolate immediately and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested" class="govuk-link">arrange to have a test</a>).</li>
  <li>they are requested to do so by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace or the Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) advice service (or <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection team if escalated), which is a legal obligation</li>
  <li>they have tested positive from an <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test as part of a community or worker programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone must wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and running water or use hand sanitiser after any contact with someone who is unwell. The area around the person with symptoms must be cleaned after they have left, to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people. See the guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">cleaning of non-healthcare settings</a>.</p>

<p>If you are contacted by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace, or your local health protection team, and told to self-isolate because you have been a close contact of a positive case, you have a legal obligation to do so.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Make sure face coverings are used, in recommended circumstances</h3>

<p>Based on the current state of the pandemic and the positive progress being made, the additional precautionary measures put in place from the 8 March for public health reasons are no longer recommended.</p>

<p>From 17 May, in line with Step 3 of the roadmap, face coverings will no longer be recommended for pupils and students in classrooms or communal areas, in all schools and <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers. Face coverings will also no longer be recommended for staff in classrooms.</p>

<p>In all schools and <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers, we continue to recommend that face coverings should be worn by staff and visitors in situations outside of classrooms where social distancing is not possible (for example, when moving around in corridors and communal areas).</p>

<p>Recognising that <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> teaching environments are diverse and can include vocational and workplace training environments, <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers can have the discretion to recommend the use of face coverings by students and staff, if it is appropriate for their particular circumstances. <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers may consider recommending the use of face coverings where teaching settings are more reflective of a workplace environment, such as a training kitchen.</p>

<p>The reintroduction of face coverings for students or staff may be advised for a temporary period in response to particular localised outbreaks, including variants of concern. In all cases, any educational drawbacks should be balanced with the benefits of managing transmission. The Local Action Committee structure (Bronze/Silver/Gold) should be used in such circumstances to re-introduce the use of face coverings. Immediate outbreak response (at the level of individual settings or a cluster of settings) remains for local Directors of Public Health to advise on.</p>

<p>If your education setting operates commercial training environments, such as hairdressing, barbering and beauty salons, sports and fitness facilities or restaurants, they must comply with relevant sector guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">working safely during COVID-19</a> and the current restriction guidance.</p>

<p>The use of face coverings in general may have a particular impact on those who rely on visual signals for communication. Those who communicate with or provide support to those who do, are exempt from any requirement to wear face coverings in education settings or in public places.</p>

<p>Where our guidance recommends face coverings, transparent face coverings, which may assist communication with someone who relies on lip reading, clear sound or facial expression to communicate, can also be worn. Transparent face coverings may be effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. However, the evidence to support this is currently very limited. Face coverings (whether transparent or cloth) should fit securely around the face to cover the nose and mouth and be made with a breathable material capable of filtering airborne particles.</p>

<p>The main benefit from a transparent face covering is that they can aid communication, for example enabling lip-reading or allowing for the full visibility of facial expressions, but this must be considered alongside the comfort and breathability of a face covering which contains plastic which may mean that the face covering is less breathable than layers of cloth.</p>

<p>Face visors or shields should not be worn as an alternative to face coverings. They may protect against droplet spread in specific circumstances but are unlikely to be effective in preventing aerosol transmission. In an education setting they are unlikely to offer appropriate protection to the wearer and should only be used after carrying out a risk assessment for the specific situation and should always be cleaned appropriately.</p>

<p><abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers have duties to make <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">reasonable adjustments for disabled pupils and students</a>, to support them to access education successfully.</p>

<h4>Exemptions</h4>

<p>Some individuals are exempt from wearing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">face coverings</a>. This includes (but is not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>people who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical impairment or disability, illness or mental health difficulties</li>
  <li>people who speak to or provide help to someone who relies on lip reading, clear sound or facial expression to communicate</li>
</ul>

<p>The same exemptions will apply in education and childcare settings and you should be sensitive to those needs. Some people are less able to wear face coverings and the reasons for this may not be visible to others.</p>

<p>Where you are delivering further education in community premises, for example a library or community centre, staff and students are exempt from the legal requirement to wear a face covering if they are in a private area set aside for the sole use of people participating in education and training.</p>

<h4>Access to face coverings</h4>

<p>It is reasonable to assume that people will now have access to face coverings due to their use in wider society.</p>

<p>You should have a small contingency supply available for people who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are struggling to access a face covering</li>
  <li>are unable to use their face covering as it has become damp, soiled or unsafe</li>
  <li>have forgotten their face covering</li>
</ul>

<h4>Safe wearing and removal of face coverings</h4>

<p>You should have a process for when face coverings are worn within your setting and how they should be removed, for example when students arrive at college. You should communicate this process clearly to students, staff and visitors and allow for adjustments to be made for those who may be distressed if required to remove a face covering against their wishes.</p>

<p>Safe wearing of face coverings necessitates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cleaning hands before and after touching face coverings – including to remove or put them on</li>
  <li>safely storing face coverings in individual, sealable plastic bags between use</li>
  <li>not touching the front of face coverings during use or when removing them</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a face covering becomes damp, it should not be worn, and the face covering should be replaced carefully. Staff and students may consider bringing a spare face covering to wear if their face covering becomes damp during the day.</p>

<p>If students arrive wearing a face covering, you must instruct them to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not touch the front of their face covering when removing it</li>
  <li>dispose of temporary face coverings in a ‘black bag’ waste bin (not recycling bin)</li>
  <li>place reusable face coverings in a plastic bag they can take home with them</li>
  <li>wash their hands regularly</li>
</ul>

<p>More information is available on preventing and controlling infection including the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care">safe working in education, childcare and children’s social care settings</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Make sure everyone is advised to clean their hands thoroughly and more often than usual</h3>

<p>COVID-19 is an easy virus to kill when it is on the skin. This can be done with soap and water or hand sanitiser. You must ensure that students clean their hands regularly, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when they arrive at the setting</li>
  <li>when they return from breaks</li>
  <li>when they change rooms</li>
  <li>before and after eating</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider how often students and staff will need to wash their hands and incorporate time for this.</p>

<p>Staff working with students who spit uncontrollably may want more opportunities to wash their hands than other staff.</p>

<p>Students who use saliva as a sensory stimulant or who struggle with ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ may also need more opportunities to wash their hands.</p>

<p>Continue to help students with complex needs to clean their hands properly.</p>

<p>Frequent and thorough hand cleaning should now be regular practice. You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether you have enough hand washing or hand sanitiser stations available so that all students and staff can clean their hands regularly</li>
  <li>if you need to supervise hand sanitiser use given the risks around ingestion – skin friendly skin cleaning wipes can be used as an alternative</li>
  <li>building these routines into your culture, supported by behaviour expectations and helping ensure those with complex needs understand the need to follow them</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Encourage good respiratory hygiene by promoting the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach</h3>

<p>The ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach continues to be very important. Make sure enough tissues and bins are available to support students and staff to follow this routine. As with hand cleaning, you must ensure students with complex needs are helped to get this right, and all students understand that this is now part of how the setting operates. The <a href="https://e-bug.eu/eng_home.aspx?cc=eng&amp;ss=1&amp;t=Information%20about%20the%20Coronavirus" class="govuk-link" rel="external">e-Bug COVID-19 website</a> contains free resources, including materials to encourage good hand and respiratory hygiene.</p>

<p>Some students with complex needs will struggle to maintain as good respiratory hygiene as their peers, for example, those who spit uncontrollably or use saliva as a sensory stimulant. This should be considered in risk assessments to support these students and the staff working with them and is not a reason to deny these students face-to-face education.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Maintain enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often, using standard products, such as detergents</h3>

<p>In line with the risk assessment and timetabling of the day, put in place and maintain an enhanced cleaning schedule. This should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more frequent cleaning of rooms or shared areas that are used by different groups</li>
  <li>frequently touched surfaces being cleaned more often than normal</li>
  <li>cleaning toilets regularly</li>
  <li>encouraging students to wash their hands thoroughly after using the toilet</li>
  <li>if your site allows it, allocating different groups their own toilet blocks</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> has published guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">cleaning non-healthcare settings</a>. This contains advice on the general cleaning required in addition to the existing advice on cleaning when there is a suspected case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Consider how to minimise contact across the site and maintain social distancing wherever possible</h3>

<p>Minimising contacts and mixing between people reduces transmission of COVID-19. This is important in all contexts, and you must consider how to implement this. You must do everything possible to minimise contacts and mixing while delivering a broad and balanced curriculum.</p>

<p>The overarching principle to apply is reducing the number of contacts between students and staff. This can be achieved through keeping groups separate (in ‘bubbles’) and through maintaining distance between individuals. These are not alternative options and both measures will help, but the balance between them will change depending on the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>student’s ability to distance</li>
  <li>layout of the building</li>
  <li>feasibility of keeping distinct groups separate while offering a broad curriculum</li>
</ul>

<p>All <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers are different, and some measures will be more appropriate for certain age groups, or more easily manageable in certain buildings.</p>

<h4>How to group students</h4>

<p>Where class-sized groups are not possible in order to deliver the full programme of study, or to manage the practical logistics within and around the site, other measures from the <a href="#system-of-controls" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a> become even more important. We strongly recommend that, as a minimum, you plan to keep your year groups or cohorts of students separate from each other during the day. You will need to think about whether you can group students into smaller groupings and still deliver a full programme of study. However, there is no set requirement to make cohorts smaller than normal class size. By limiting contact between different groups, this means that if one person in a group tests positive for COVID-19, you can be confident that they have only had close contact with some or all of that group, rather than the whole year group. These are considerations you will need to make when reaching your decision.</p>

<p>Once groups are established, they should be kept apart and logistics such as start and finish times, lunch and break times, should be reviewed to ensure this.</p>

<p>Although passing briefly in the corridor or external areas is low risk, you should avoid creating very busy corridors or entrances and exits. You should also consider staggered break times and lunch times (and time for cleaning surfaces in the canteens and restaurants between groups). Avoiding big gatherings is strongly recommended, such as meetings with more than one group you are otherwise trying to keep apart.</p>

<p>Both the approaches of separating groups and maintaining distance are not ‘all or nothing’ options and will still bring benefits, even if implemented partially. You may keep students in their groups for most of the time, but also allow mixing into wider groups for specialist teaching, wraparound care and transport. Siblings may also be in different groups.</p>

<p>We recognise that some staff will need to move between groups, for example, teachers delivering maths and English for students studying a broad range of vocational and academic subjects. You should take steps to minimise the movement of staff between groups where possible, but if they need to teach multiple groups, they should adhere to broader protective measures such as maintaining distance from students wherever possible.</p>

<h4>Teaching and learning environment measures within rooms and workshops</h4>

<p>Maintaining a distance between people whilst inside and reducing the amount of time they are in face-to-face contact lowers the risk of transmission. It is strong public health advice that staff maintain distance from their students, staying at the front of the room, and away from their colleagues where possible.</p>

<p>Ideally, staff should maintain 2 metre distance from each other and from students. We know that this is not always possible, particularly when working with students with complex needs, or those who need close contact care. Provide educational and care support for these students as normal, with other increased hygiene protocols in place to minimise the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>Students should also be supported to maintain distance and not touch staff and their peers where possible. This will not be possible for some students with complex needs and it is not feasible in some sites where space does not allow. Doing this where you can, and even doing this some of the time, will help.</p>

<p>When staff or students cannot maintain distancing, for example, when students are required to work in close proximity or where there is high use of items such as apparatus and machinery which cannot be washed down between uses, additional mitigation measures should be put in place.</p>

<h4>Additional mitigation measures</h4>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning</li>
  <li>keeping the activity time involved as short as possible</li>
  <li>using screens or barriers to separate students from each other</li>
  <li>seating students side-by-side and facing forwards, rather than face-to-face or side on</li>
  <li>moving unnecessary furniture out of rooms to make more space</li>
</ul>

<p>Some <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> courses, such as vocational training, healthcare-related courses and the performing arts may pose particular risks of aerosol, droplet and surface transmission and may therefore warrant increased consideration, for example, face coverings, ventilation or cleaning in accordance with guidance issued for the relevant <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">professional working arrangements</a>.</p>

<h4>Measures elsewhere</h4>

<p>Avoid large gatherings such as meetings with more than one group.</p>

<p>When timetabling, groups should be kept apart and movement around the site kept to a minimum. While passing briefly in the corridor or outdoor communal areas is low risk, you should avoid creating busy corridors, entrances and exits. You should also consider staggered break times and lunch times (and time for cleaning surfaces in the canteen or restaurant between groups).</p>

<p>You should also plan how shared staff spaces are set up and used to help staff to distance from each other. You can read <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/social-distancing/index.htm" class="govuk-link">social distancing to make your workplace COVID-secure</a> to help you plan. Use of staff rooms should be minimised although staff must still have a break of a reasonable length during the day.</p>

<p>If your setting operates commercial training environments such as hairdressing, barbering and beauty salons, sports and fitness facilities or restaurants, they must comply with relevant sector guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">working safely during COVID-19</a> and the current restriction guidance.</p>

<p>Where settings have kitchens on-site, these are able to operate as normal, but they and any external catering contractors must comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-food-businesses">guidance for food businesses on COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Restaurants and food service facilities continue to be open for use by staff and students and hospitality can reopen, in line with Step 3, to the public with a requirement to order (in venues that serve alcohol), eat and drink while seated.</p>

<p>Other on-site facilities such as gyms, swimming pools, and 3G pitches can remain open for use by staff and students. They may open to the public when the corresponding premises and businesses are permitted to open to the public.</p>

<h4>Public facing facilities</h4>

<p>Public facing facilities that are used for the purposes of training can operate in line with any local or national restrictions. Regardless of any local or national restrictions you can remain open for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>education and training, including where education providers use sports, leisure and community facilities where that is part of their normal provision</li>
  <li>childcare purposes and supervised activities for those children eligible to attend</li>
  <li>use by elite sports persons to train and compete</li>
</ul>

<p>A full list of exemptions can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">national lockdown guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Moving between settings</h4>

<p>Specialists, therapists, clinicians and other support staff for students with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/children-with-special-educational-needs" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr></a> should provide interventions as usual. They, as well as supply teachers, peripatetic teachers or other temporary staff, can move between settings. They should ensure they minimise contact and maintain as much distance as possible from other staff. Such specialists will be aware of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> most appropriate for their role.</p>

<p>Consider whether you need any additional processes in place for students who regularly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attend more than one site or different providers</li>
  <li>move between a training provider and workplace as part of an apprenticeship</li>
</ul>

<p>As apprenticeship delivery can be extremely flexible, it is up to you, the employer and the end-point assessment organisation to agree on how apprenticeship training is delivered, and how assessments are undertaken. You should consider whether you want to take advantage of more than one delivery method to balance minimising any risks from COVID-19 with providing a full educational experience. For example, a block release delivery method may be better at reducing movement between sites.</p>

<p>However, where it is essential for workers to attend their workplace, on-the-job and off-the-job training and assessment can continue in the workplace for apprentices.</p>

<p>See current guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-apprenticeship-programme-response" class="govuk-link">providing apprenticeships during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Keep occupied spaces well ventilated</h3>

<p>Good ventilation reduces the concentration of the virus in the air, which reduces the risks from airborne transmission. This happens when people breathe in small particles (aerosols) in the air after someone with the virus has occupied an enclosed area.</p>

<p>When the setting is in operation, it is important to ensure it is well ventilated and a comfortable teaching and learning environment is maintained.</p>

<p>This can be achieved by a variety of measures including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mechanical ventilation systems – these should be adjusted to increase the ventilation rate wherever possible and checked to confirm that normal operation meets current guidance and that only fresh outside air is circulated, if possible, systems should be adjusted to full fresh air or, if not, then systems should be operated as normal as long as they are within a single room and supplemented by an outdoor air supply</li>
  <li>natural ventilation – opening windows (in cooler weather windows should be opened just enough to provide constant background ventilation, and opened more fully during breaks to purge the air in the space), opening internal doors can also assist with creating a throughput of air</li>
  <li>natural ventilation – if necessary external opening doors may also be used (as long as they are not fire doors and where safe to do so)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm" class="govuk-link">air conditioning and ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.cibse.org/coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">CIBSE COVID-19 advice</a> provides more information.</p>

<p>To balance the need for increased ventilation while maintaining a comfortable temperature, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>opening high level windows in colder weather in preference to low level to reduce draughts</li>
  <li>increasing the ventilation while spaces are unoccupied (for example, between classes, during break and lunch, when a room is unused)</li>
  <li>providing flexibility to allow additional, suitable indoor clothing</li>
  <li>rearranging furniture where possible to avoid direct draughts</li>
</ul>

<p>Heating should be used as necessary to ensure comfort levels are maintained particularly in occupied spaces.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span> Make sure individuals wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) where necessary</h3>

<p>Face coverings are not classified as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (personal protective equipment)</a>. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is used in a limited number of settings to protect wearers against hazards and risks, such as surgical masks or respirators used in medical and industrial settings. A face covering is a covering of any type which covers your nose and mouth.</p>

<p>Most staff in <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> settings will not require <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond what they would normally need for their work. If a student already has routine intimate care needs that involve the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, the same <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should continue to be used.</p>

<p>Additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for COVID-19 is only required in a very limited number of scenarios, for example, when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a student becomes ill with COVID-19 symptoms, and only then if a 2 metre distance cannot be maintained</li>
  <li>performing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#aerosol-generating-procedures-agps" class="govuk-link">aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)</a>.</li>
  <li>working with students who cough, spit or vomit but do not have COVID-19 symptoms, only any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that would be routinely worn should be worn.</li>
</ul>

<p>The guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care" class="govuk-link">safe working in education, childcare and children’s social care settings</a> provides more information about preventing and controlling infection. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when and how <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be used</li>
  <li>what type of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to use</li>
  <li>how to source it</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9. </span> Promote and engage in asymptomatic testing</h3>

<h4>Asymptomatic testing</h4>

<p>Around 1 in 3 individuals with COVID-19 do not display symptoms. Opening testing up to catch those showing no symptoms will help to find positive cases earlier and to break the chains of transmission. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-lateral-flow-antigen-testing-for-people-without-symptoms"><abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing</a> is a fast and simple way to test people who do not have symptoms of COVID-19, but who may still be spreading the virus. The tests are easy to use, give results in 30 minutes and do not require a laboratory to process the result. Those who test positive must immediately self-isolate to avoid passing the virus on to others.</p>

<p>Anyone who does not have symptoms can now get regular rapid lateral flow tests to check for COVID-19 including the following people in England who have access to regular rapid lateral flow testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> students - this includes adult students (aged 19+)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> staff - includes any adult working on site</li>
  <li>households, childcare and support bubbles of <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> staff and students</li>
</ul>

<p>Should you encounter any problems with orders and deliveries you should contact the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> coronavirus (COVID-19) helpline on 0800 046 8687.</p>

<p>Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-asymptomatic-testing-in-schools-and-colleges">asymptomatic testing in secondary schools and colleges</a> is available.</p>

<p>Independent Training Providers (<abbr title="independent training providers">ITPs</abbr>) and Adult Community Learning Providers (<abbr title="Adult Community Learning Providers">ACLPs</abbr>) have access to home testing kits through the COVID-19 education testing programme.</p>

<p>Providers can order test kits online for staff and students so they can test twice a week, at home. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all staff working in <abbr title="independent training providers">ITPs</abbr>/<abbr title="Adult Community Learning Providers">ACLPs</abbr> - this means any adult working onsite</li>
  <li>all students at <abbr title="independent training providers">ITPs</abbr>/<abbr title="Adult Community Learning Providers">ACLPs</abbr> - this means any student attending onsite without access to testing elsewhere</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no need to provide testing for students and staff that already have access to testing, for example through their workplace.</p>

<p>Providers can order 3 weeks’ worth of stock every 2 weeks, and are asked to consider expected up-take among staff and students is when placing an order. Providers can order different amounts each time.  </p>

<h4>Home testing</h4>

<p>Both students and staff will be supplied with <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test kits to self-swab and test themselves twice a week at home, regardless of whether they are full-time or part-time.</p>

<p>Colleges should retain a small on-site asymptomatic testing site so they can offer testing to students who are unable or unwilling to test themselves at home. We have provided further information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-schools-and-colleges-grant-funding">funding available to support this</a>.</p>

<p>Staff and students must report their result, whether positive, negative or void to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace as soon as the test is completed. Report the result online or by telephone as given in the instructions in the home test kit. Staff and students should also share their result, whether positive, negative or void with their college or <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> provider to help with contact tracing.</p>

<p>Students aged 18 and over should self-test and report the result, with assistance if needed. Adolescents aged under 17 (and over 12) should self-test and report with adult supervision. The adult may conduct the test if necessary.</p>

<p>Staff or students who receive a positive <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result will need to self-isolate immediately along with close contacts and other household members, in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay-at-home guidance</a>. All positive results from <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, whether conducted at home or at college need to be confirmed with a lab-based polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test within two days of the positive <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test. A confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test should be booked immediately either online or by calling 119. Whilst awaiting the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result, students and staff and close contacts should continue to self-isolate. If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is negative, provided it was taken within two days of the positive <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result, it overrides the self-test <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and the student can return to their <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> provider. Those with a negative <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result can continue to attend college or their <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> provider and use protective measures.</p>

<p>Testing remains voluntary but is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>It is important to keep testing going through the holidays to manage the spread of COVID-19 and encourage staff and students to get into the regular habit of testing themselves every 3 to 4 days (twice a week).</p>

<h4>Specialist settings</h4>

<p>We recognise specialist settings will have additional considerations to take into account when delivering asymptomatic testing. We recognise that self-swabbing may cause significant concerns for some students with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>.</p>

<p>See the additional guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-full-opening-special-schools-and-other-specialist-settings">asymptomatic testing in specialist settings</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Testing is voluntary and no student will be tested unless informed consent has been given by the appropriate person.</p>

<h4>Symptomatic testing</h4>

<p>The asymptomatic testing programme does not replace the current testing policy for those with symptoms. Anyone with one or more symptoms of COVID-19 – a high temperature, a new continuous cough; or a loss or change in sense of smell or taste (even if they recently had a negative <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result) – should self-isolate immediately, in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay-at-home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Those with symptoms are also expected to take a lab-based polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test to check if they have the virus. This test should be ordered <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">online</a>, or by calling 119 in England and Wales, or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Alternatively, you can visit your local symptomatic test centre.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Providers may also offer a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit</a> to the parent or guardian of any student (or to students over 18) who becomes symptomatic onsite, if they believe that the individual faces significant barriers to testing through the usual routes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10. </span> Promote and engage with the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace process</h3>

<p>Staff members, students, parents and carers will need to:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested" class="govuk-link">book a test</a> if they or their child has symptoms - the main symptoms are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">self-isolate</a> immediately and not come to the setting if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they develop symptoms</li>
  <li>they have been in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19</li>
  <li>anyone in their household or support or childcare bubble develops symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <li>they are required to do so having <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control/self-isolating-when-you-arrive">recently travelled from certain other countries</a>
</li>
  <li>they have been advised to isolate by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> test and trace or the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection team, which is a legal obligation</li>
  <li>provide details of anyone they have been in close contact with, if they test positive for COVID-19 or if asked by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace</li>
</ul>

<h4>Booking a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test through 119</h4>

<p>Anyone who displays symptoms of COVID-19 can and should get a test. Tests for symptomatic illness can be booked online through the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> testing and tracing for COVID-19</a> website, or ordered by telephone via <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> 119 for those without access to the internet.</p>

<p>Essential workers, which includes anyone involved in education or childcare, including students undertaking work placements in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/essential-workers-prioritised-for-covid-19-testing" class="govuk-link">essential occupations</a>, have priority access to testing.</p>

<p>Any student can be tested if they have symptoms.</p>

<h4>Polymerase Chain Reaction tests (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) for symptomatic testing</h4>

<p>Separate to the asymptomatic testing regime, all <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers were sent an initial supply of 10 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits before the start of the autumn term in 2020. You can replenish these kits when they run out by making an order through the online portal. You should call the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace helpdesk on 119 if the kits that you have ordered have not arrived.</p>

<p>Having a test at a testing site will deliver the fastest results for symptomatic cases. These <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits are provided to be used in the exceptional circumstance that an individual becomes symptomatic and you believe they may have barriers to accessing testing elsewhere.</p>

<p>You will need to decide how to prioritise the distribution of your test kits.</p>

<p>These kits can be given directly to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff</li>
  <li>parents or carers collecting a student who has developed symptoms on site</li>
</ul>

<p>These <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests kits will also help ensure that symptomatic staff can get a test. If they test negative, they can return to work as soon as they are well and no longer have symptoms of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Further information is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-test-kits-for-schools-and-fe-providers">COVID-19: test kits for schools and <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers</a>.</p>

<p>Ask parents, students and staff to inform you what their result was as soon as they get their results.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app is available to anyone aged 16 and over to download if they choose. For some young people, particularly some with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>, parents will need to decide whether their use of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app is appropriate.</p>

<p>Staff members are also able to use the app.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-the-nhs-covid-19-app-in-schools-and-further-education-colleges" class="govuk-link">guidance for schools and further education colleges in England</a> provides information about how the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app works and guidance for its use.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11. </span> <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers’ role in the management of confirmed cases of COVID-19</h3>

<p>You must take swift action when you become aware that someone who has attended your premises or has travelled on dedicated college transport has tested positive for COVID-19. You can contact the dedicated advice service introduced by Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) and delivered by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Business Services Authority. This can be reached by calling the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> helpline on 0800 046 8687 and selecting option 1 for advice on the action to take in response to a positive case. You will be put through to a team of advisers who will inform you what action is needed based on the latest public health advice.</p>

<p>The advice service will carry out a rapid risk assessment to confirm who has been in close contact with the person during the period that they were infectious, and ensure they are asked to self-isolate. If, following triage, further expert advice is required the adviser will escalate your call to the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection team.</p>

<p>The advice service (or <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection team if escalated) will work with you to guide you through the actions you need to take. Based on their advice, you must send home those people who have been in close contact with the person who has tested positive, advising them to self-isolate immediately and for the next 10 full days counting from the day after contact with the individual who tested positive. It is a legal requirement for an individual to self-isolate if they have been told to do so by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace.</p>

<p>A risk assessment may be undertaken to determine this, but a close contact can be anyone who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lives in the same household as someone with COVID-19 symptoms or who has tested positive for COVID-19</li>
  <li>has had face-to-face contact including being coughed on or had a face-to-face conversation within one metre of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test</li>
  <li>has been within one metre of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 for one minute or longer without face-to-face contact</li>
  <li>been within 2 metres of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 for more than 15 minutes (either as a one-off contact, or added up together over one day)</li>
  <li>travelled in the same vehicle or a plane as someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title=" lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test</li>
</ul>

<p>If someone who uses transport tests positive, the assessment is likely to take account of factors such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicle size</li>
  <li>degree of face-to-face contact</li>
  <li>length of time in close proximity</li>
  <li>whether a perspex screen is in place</li>
</ul>

<p>The advice service (or <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection team if escalated) will provide definitive advice to you on who must be sent home. To support them in doing so, we recommend you keep a record of students and staff in each group and include a check-in system for anyone using communal or shared areas such as libraries. This should be a proportionate recording process. You do not need to ask students to record everyone they have spent time with each day or ask staff to keep definitive records in a way that is overly burdensome.</p>

<p>A template letter will be provided to you, on the advice of the advice service (or <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection team if escalated), to send to parents, students and staff if needed. You must not share the names or details of people with COVID-19 unless essential to protect others.</p>

<p>Household members of those contacts who are sent home do not need to self-isolate themselves unless the student or staff member who is self-isolating subsequently develops symptoms, or they have been told to self-isolate by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace or their public health protection team, in which case they must self-isolate, this is a legal obligation. If someone in a group that has been asked to self-isolate develops symptoms themselves within 10 days from the day after the individual tested positive, they should follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection</a>.</p>

<p>They should get a test, and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if someone who is self-isolating because they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 starts to feel unwell and gets a test for COVID-19 themselves, and the test delivers a negative result, they must remain in isolation for the remainder of the 10 days from the day the individual, with who they had close contact, tested positive - this is because they could still develop COVID-19 within the remaining days</li>
  <li>if the test result is positive, they should inform their setting immediately, and must isolate for at least 10 days from the onset of their symptoms - their household should self-isolate from the day the individual in their household first had symptoms and the next 10 full days, following guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not request evidence of negative test results or other medical evidence before admitting students or welcoming them back after a period of self-isolation.</p>

<p>The local public health team will also contact you directly if they become aware that someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 attended your setting, as identified by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace or <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection.</p>

<h4>Test and Trace Support Payments</h4>

<p>Some <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> staff and some students may be eligible for a one-off Test and Trace Support Payment of £500. This is payable in one lump sum from your local authority.</p>

<p>To be eligible for a Test and Trace Support Payment, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on a low income</li>
  <li>be unable to work from home</li>
  <li>be at risk of losing income as a result of self-isolating</li>
  <li>be living in England</li>
  <li>meet the eligibility criteria</li>
  <li>have been formally advised to self-isolate by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace, who will provide you with an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace Account ID</li>
</ul>

<p>The Department for Health and Social Care has launched a self-isolation service hub (020 3743 6715). The phone line is open 7 days a week, 8am to 8pm, allowing an <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> provider to provide contact details of those individuals who have been asked to self-isolate and are likely to be eligible for the Test and Trace Support Payment or discretionary payment.</p>

<p>By providing these details, close contacts of positive cases identified at the setting will be formally advised to self-isolate by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace and provided with an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace Account ID. Individuals who have not been formally advised to self-isolate by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace will not receive an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace Account ID and will not be able to claim from the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme.</p>

<p>In order for any of your staff or students who may be eligible for a payment from the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme to be able to claim, you must follow these steps:</p>

    <p>Ensure that you collate a list of appropriate close contacts for the person who has tested positive within your establishment and inform these close contacts that they now need to self-isolate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call the service hub on 020 3743 6715 as soon as you have the eight-digit <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace Account ID (sometimes referred to as a <abbr title="contacts on the Test and Trace system">CTAS</abbr> number) of the person who has tested positive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide the details of the person who has tested positive, along with the details of the relevant close contacts you have identified. If you do not have <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace Account ID for the person who has tested positive, Hub staff will assist in tracing the person in order to register their contacts on the Test and Trace system (<abbr title="contacts on the Test and Trace system">CTAS</abbr>).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace will then contact individuals to formally advise them of their need to self-isolate and provide them with an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace Account ID.</p>

<p>Following this, individuals who are employed or self-employed, on a low income, unable to work from home and losing income, as a result, may qualify for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support" class="govuk-link">Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</a> through their local authority.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12. </span>  Contain any outbreak by following <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection team advice</h3>

<p>If you have 2 or more confirmed cases within 14 days, or an overall rise in sickness absence where COVID-19 is suspected, you may have an outbreak.</p>

<p>You should call the dedicated advice service who will escalate the issue to your local health protection team where necessary and advise if any additional action is required. You can reach them by calling the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> helpline on 0800 046 8687 and selecting option 1 for advice on the action to take in response to a positive case.</p>

<p>In some cases, health protection teams may recommend that a larger number of other students self-isolate at home as a precautionary measure. This could be the whole site, class or year group.</p>

<p>If you are implementing the <a href="#system-of-controls" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a>, addressing any issues you have identified and therefore reducing transmission risks, whole site closure will not generally be necessary. You should not consider closing except on the advice of health protection teams.</p>

<h4>Admitting students and staff back to the setting</h4>

<p>The student or staff member who tested positive for COVID-19 can return to their normal routine and stop self-isolating after they have finished their isolation period and their symptoms have gone or if they continue to have only a residual cough or anosmia. This is because a cough or anosmia can last for several weeks once the infection has gone. If they still have a high temperature after 10 days or are otherwise unwell, you should advise them to stay at home and seek medical advice.</p>

<p>You should not request evidence of negative test results or other medical evidence before admitting students or welcoming them back after a period of self-isolation.</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases, the student, parents and carers will be in agreement that those with symptoms should not attend the setting, given the potential risk to others. In the event that a parent or carer insists on a student attending your setting, you can take the decision to refuse the student if, in your reasonable judgement, it is necessary to protect your students and staff from possible infection with COVID-19. Your decision would need to be carefully considered in light of all the circumstances and current public health advice.</p>

<h2>Site safety and estates</h2>

<h3>Site safety</h3>

<p>You should take account of public health guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19">staying safe outside one’s home and in public spaces</a></p>

<h3>Estates</h3>

<p>You should look to maximise the use of your site and any associated available space.</p>

<p>Following a risk assessment, you may determine that small adaptations to your site are required, such as additional wash basins. This will be at your discretion, based on your circumstances.</p>

<p>Additional advice on safely reoccupying buildings can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.cibse.org/coronavirus-covid-19/emerging-from-lockdown">CIBSE guidance on emerging from lockdown</a>.</p>

<h2>Off-site provision and work placements</h2>

<h3>External work placements</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/social-distancing/index.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Minimising contact and mixing between people</a> reduces transmission of COVID-19. Training providers and employers must do everything possible to minimise contacts and mixing while delivering training and assessment.</p>

<p>You should consider how students on placements, from different workplaces, mix with other students and staff when training in an educational setting. Information on <a class="govuk-link" href="#group-students">how to group students</a> can be found in the <a href="#system-of-controls" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a> section.</p>

<p>It is important that you involve staff, students and the organisations who provide work placements to co-produce guidance, student charters or agreements, making clear the responsibilities for staying safe and protecting others. By involving others, the guidance is more likely to be adhered to. Where relevant, other outside bodies that may be affected (for example, suppliers, transport providers) may also be involved.</p>

<p>We are committed to ensuring that all young people undertaking a traineeship can spend time on a work placement with an employer. The work placement is fundamental to a traineeship, which is a work-focused route. We have given you further flexibilities to tailor traineeships during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes reducing the number of required work placement hours from 100 to 70 and extending the duration of the programme from 6 months to 12 months. The work placement can be delivered flexibly over the full programme duration.</p>

<h2>Performing arts</h2>

<p>This section will help you understand how to minimise risk during the COVID-19 pandemic for performing arts provision.</p>

<p>Studies have indicated that it is the cumulative aerosol transmission from both those performing in and attending events that is likely to create risk. This is particularly evident for singing and shouting, but with appropriate safety mitigation and consideration, singing, wind and brass teaching can still take place.</p>

<p>Activities should be undertaken in line with this guidance and the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts" class="govuk-link">working safely during COVID-19 in the performing arts</a>.</p>

<p>Performing arts courses, in normal circumstances, may involve a considerable amount of practical face-to-face teaching and assessment.</p>

<h3>Performances</h3>

<p>You should not host any performances with an audience until stage 3 of the performing arts roadmap.</p>

<p>If planning an indoor or outdoor face-to-face performance in front of a live audience (under Step 3 of the roadmap out of lockdown, from 17 May), you should follow the latest advice in the DCMS <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts">performing arts guidance</a>, which provides details of how to manage audiences as well as carry out performing arts safely. If planning an outdoor performance you should also give particular consideration to the guidance on delivering <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.eventsindustryforum.co.uk/index.php/11-features/14-keeping-workers-and-audiences-safe-during-covid-19">outdoor events</a>.</p>

<p>See the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts">working safely during COVID-19 in the performing arts</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Consider alternatives such as live streaming and recording performances, subject to the usual safeguarding considerations and permission.</p>

<h3>Music teaching in colleges including singing and playing wind and brass instruments in groups</h3>

<p>Students and staff can engage in singing and playing wind and brass instruments in line with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts" class="govuk-link">working safely during COVID-19 in the performing arts</a> for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-suggested-principles-of-safer-singing" class="govuk-link">suggested principles for safer singing</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Until the relevant stage in the performing arts roadmap, routine 2 metre social distancing should be maintained.</p>

<p>Until the relevant stage in the performing arts roadmap, you should observe strict social distancing between each singer or player and between singers or players and any other people such as conductors, other musicians, or accompanists. Current guidance advises that if the activity is face-to-face and without mitigating actions, 2 metre distance is appropriate. You should use seating where appropriate to maintain social distancing.</p>

<p>Further measures that you can take include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>playing instruments and singing in groups should take place outdoors wherever possible</li>
  <li>if indoors, use a room with as much space as possible, for example, larger rooms, rooms with high ceilings are expected to enable dilution of aerosol transmission</li>
  <li>if playing indoors, limiting the numbers to account for ventilation of the space and the ability to maintain social distancing - it is important to ensure good ventilation, advice on this can be found in the <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm" rel="external" class="govuk-link">HSE guidance on air conditioning and ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>
</li>
  <li>students should be positioned back-to-back or side-to-side when playing or singing (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible</li>
  <li>position wind and brass players so that the air from their instrument does not blow into another player</li>
  <li>use microphones where possible or encourage singing quietly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extra-curricular provision</h3>

<p>From 17 May students of all ages can access indoor or outdoor extra-curricular provision, including sport and physical activity but the same care should be taken to implement the <a href="#system-of-controls" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a> and in line with government guidance on sport and physical activity in education settings.</p>

<p>All indoor sports facilities should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/providers-of-grassroots-sport-and-gym-leisure-facilities" class="govuk-link">providers of grassroots sport and gym leisure facilities guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Extra-curricular provision is varied and includes activity which supports a student’s achievement in their main programme of study, or future course of study, or job is considered as part of a student’s education and training provision. For example, provision that contributes to working towards an additional qualification, essential life skills training, preparing for work, catch up learning or helps a student build life skills.</p>

<p>Activity which is not extra-curricular, for example a kickabout at lunch time, should continue to adhere to any restrictions in place in the wider community, for example, limits on group sizes as set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">(COVID-19) Coronavirus restrictions: what you can and cannot do</a> guidance.</p>

<h2>Physical activity and sports</h2>

<p>Organised indoor and outdoor sport continues to be permitted where it is part of education or training provision for the student.</p>

<p>Disability sports provision and disabled student’s participation in sports provision continues to be permitted both indoors and outdoors. </p>

<p>From 17 May, students of all ages are allowed to access indoor and outdoor sport and physical activity.</p>

<p>All indoor sports facilities should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-the-public-and-sport-providers">providers of grassroots sport and gym leisure facilities guidance</a>.</p>

<p>In line with wider easing of national restrictions, all students may continue to use indoor sports and leisure facilities for purposes not related to education and training but will need to adhere to social distancing restrictions that apply to leisure activity.</p>

<p>Residential students who stay in residential accommodation provided by you overnight, during the week and at weekends, may whilst staying in their education accommodation use on-site indoor and outdoor facilities and amenities (for example film rooms, swimming pools, gyms, golf, tennis courts and 3G pitches) outside of timetabled lessons.</p>

<p>Outdoor recreational and social activity should be prioritised where possible, and large indoor spaces used where it is not. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maximise distancing between consistent student household groups</li>
  <li>pay scrupulous attention to cleaning and hygiene</li>
  <li>use maximum fresh air ventilation through either opening doors and windows or ventilation systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Student residential groups should adhere to social distancing restrictions in place at the time whilst using college facilities.</p>

<p>Further detail on national current restrictions in place for sport and physical activity can be found in the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-the-public-and-sport-providers">grassroot sports for public and sport providers</a>.</p>

<p>You have the flexibility to decide how sport and physical activity will be provided while following the measures in your <a class="govuk-link" href="#system-of-controls">system of controls</a>. Students should be kept in consistent groups and sports equipment thoroughly cleaned between each use by different individual groups. You can hold sports and activity lessons indoors, including those that involve activities related to team sports, for example practising specific techniques, within your own system of controls.</p>

<p>For sport provision, outdoor sports should continue to be prioritised where possible, and large indoor spaces used where it is not. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maximise natural ventilation flows (through opening windows and doors or using air conditioning systems wherever possible)</li>
  <li>ensure there is distancing between students</li>
  <li>pay scrupulous attention to cleaning and hygiene</li>
</ul>

<p>This is particularly important in a sport setting because of the way in which people breathe during exercise.</p>

<p>External facilities can also be used in line with government guidance for the use of, and travel to and from, those facilities. You should only consider team sports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whose national governing bodies have developed guidance under the principles of the government’s guidance on team sport</li>
  <li>which have been approved by the government such as sports on the list for safe provision including team sport, contact combat sport and organised sport events</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p>You can work with external coaches, clubs and organisations for curricular and extra-curricular activities. You must be satisfied that it is safe to do.</p>

<h2>Education and training delivery</h2>

<h3>What we expect of <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers</h3>

<p>From 8 March, on-site delivery resumed, allowing students of all ages to benefit from their education and training in full. This means we expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fully deliver planned hours for students of all ages including those with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> (with or without an <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plan)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that students return to the normal balance of on-site education delivery, including all 16 to 19 students spending time on-site every week</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This may be supplemented by high-quality remote delivery recognising that some providers delivered aspects of provision remotely prior to COVID-19</p>

<h3>Mode of delivery</h3>

<p>While <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers have been highly successful in delivering remote education during the pandemic, we know that remote education is not a full replacement for on-site education. Remote education, however well delivered, cannot replicate the building of relationships between students and teachers nor the close supervision and hands-on training vital to developing vocational competence. Ofsted has also found in their interim visits during the COVID-19 pandemic that some students have struggled to engage with remote education and have suffered from feelings of isolation at home, impacting their mental health.</p>

<p>Therefore, whilst <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers should build on the significant strides made during the pandemic in remote delivery and the wider use of technology in education, with <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers now open to all students, on-site delivery should be the primary mode of delivery, with all 16 to 19 students benefiting from on-site education every week. Any <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers operating a ‘week on, week off’ rota for face-to-face learning should move as quickly as possible to all students having time on-site every week.</p>

<p>The following guidelines seek to encourage providers to maximise the ability for students to receive face-to-face education whilst also ensuring that innovation in digital learning can continue to be capitalised on where remote provision is high quality, meets students’ needs, is proportionate and complements face-to-face delivery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on-site delivery should count for the large majority of planned learning hours for all 16 to 19 students (other than in exceptional circumstances such as when restrictions are in place to contain local outbreaks or if individuals need to self-isolate)</li>
  <li>where there are elements of remote delivery, providers should:
    <ul>
      <li>ensure they enhance the overall quality of education and are designed to add educational value to a course.</li>
      <li>meet the expectations set out in remote and blended education expectations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Adult students have always been offered a wider variety of delivery models in comparison to 16 to 19 year olds. You should continue to judge the right balance between on-site and remote delivery for adult students in order to provide high-quality education and training.</p>

<h2>Remote and blended education expectations</h2>

<p>If you deliver aspects of your curriculum remotely, you should ensure you meet the following expectations.</p>

<h3>Expectations on participation</h3>

<p>Set clear expectations of students concerning their participation in the remote elements of their programme, so they know when and how they are expected to engage and demonstrate their learning.</p>

<h4>Live teaching</h4>

<p>As far as possible provide live online teaching. This is advised because Ofsted and many providers have found that learners generally prefer interactive ‘live’ online lessons and that it results in greater engagement. Alternatives to live lessons may include recorded lessons.</p>

<h4>Feedback and assessment</h4>

<p>Confirm with students the different ways in which they will receive individual assessment and feedback when learning remotely to support their progression. The nature and frequency of remote assessment and feedback should reflect the individual need and the courses they are enrolled on.</p>

<p>It should be at least:</p>

<ul>
  <li>once every week for academic study programmes</li>
  <li>fortnightly if undertaking technical or applied general study programmes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Monitoring attendance</h4>

<p>Have systems in place to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check, at least weekly, for persistent non-attendance or lack of engagement with remote education</li>
  <li>quickly agree ways in which attendance and participation can be improved</li>
</ul>

<p>When opting for blended delivery, you should teach planned and well sequenced education and training programmes to give students the best chance to build their knowledge and skills. You should also ensure that fundamental principles of effective face-to-face teaching are deployed in the delivery of remote education, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing frequent, clear explanations of new content, delivered by a teacher or through high-quality curriculum resources</li>
  <li>providing opportunities for interactivity and intentional dialogue, including questioning, eliciting and reflective discussion</li>
  <li>enabling students to receive timely and frequent feedback on how to progress, using digitally facilitated or whole-class feedback where appropriate</li>
  <li>using assessment to ensure teaching is responsive to students’ needs</li>
</ul>

<p>You should give particular consideration on how best to support vulnerable and disadvantaged students and students with special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>). We recognise that some students with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> may not be able to access remote education without support and expect <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers to work with families to deliver an ambitious curriculum for their level of need.</p>

<p>You should have a named senior leader with overarching responsibility for the quality and delivery of remote education, who should ensure that provision meets the expectations for remote education.</p>

<p>Ofsted will inspect schools and further education &amp; skills (<abbr title="further education &amp; skills">FES</abbr>) providers in the summer term to provide reassurance about how well students are catching up. As set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif" class="govuk-link"><abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> and skills inspection handbook</a> all publicly funded provision is in scope for an inspection regardless of the mode of delivery deployed, for example face-to-face, remote or online, or blended learning. Inspectors may visit any sessions involving learners either on-site, or at other locations, including online.</p>

<h3>Provision of remote learning to students unable to attend on-site for COVID-19 related reasons</h3>

<p>For students unable to attend on-site for COVID-19 related reasons, for example, because they need to self-isolate or are shielding, we expect you to provide remote education to minimise disruption to their learning.</p>

<p>While students are unable to attend on-site, you should use your best endeavours to deliver as much of students’ planned hours as possible and meet the expectations set out above concerning participation, live teaching, feedback, assessment, attendance and engagement.</p>

<p>We recognise that for some students the full delivery of planned hours may not be possible, for example where a student is undertaking a course involving practical teaching and training which necessitates the use of specialist equipment and supervision or with respect to work experience and placements.</p>

<h4>Publication of remote education offers</h4>

<p>So that students (and parents of students aged 19 and below) know what to expect if they need to learn remotely, you should set out details of your remote education offer on your website.</p>

<p>Your offer could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what remote education is available for different learner cohorts (14 to 16, 16 to 19, apprentices, adult learners)</li>
  <li>delivery arrangements, such as timetabling, assessment and use of digital platforms, sometimes referred to as virtual learning environments</li>
  <li>expectations of students</li>
  <li>arrangements for students studying courses that require specialist equipment or facilities</li>
  <li>support for students without devices, connectivity or a suitable environment for learning</li>
  <li>support for students with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> who may not be able to access remote education without support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contingency planning</h2>

<p>For individuals or groups of self-isolating students following government guidance related to COVID-19, remote education plans should be in place.</p>

<p>You should continue to operate as normally as possible. In the event that restrictions in education are needed to help contain the spread of the virus, you may be asked to revise your delivery models for a short period of time. To help with this, we have published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-local-restrictions-in-education-and-childcare-settings">contingency framework</a>, which outlines how you should operate in the event of any restrictions.</p>

<p>Any decision that there should be local restrictions in any education settings will be made by central government on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>Circumstances where it may be necessary to restrict on-site delivery and move to greater remote delivery</h3>

<p>You should only restrict on-site delivery if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have received written public health advice to do so</li>
  <li>it is strictly necessary for operational reasons, with all other mitigations having been exhausted</li>
</ul>

<p>In such circumstances, you should put into action your contingency plans to quickly move to remote delivery of education and training for all students affected to minimise disruption to their learning.</p>

<h3>Decisions to restrict on-site delivery for public health reasons due to a local outbreak</h3>

<p>Decisions to restrict opening for public health reasons should only take place where there has been clear public health advice to do so, and this is provided in writing. This is to ensure clarity around the basis on which the decision has been made. This is normal practice for <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, and both local <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> teams and local authority public health directors should be aware of this expectation.</p>

<p>Where you have been advised by local health teams to substantially reduce on-site attendance in response to local outbreaks or community transmission, contact your <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> territorial lead or caseload manager.</p>

<p>It is important for you to inform <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> so that we understand the contingency plans and plans for communicating the decision. This should not delay any urgent decisions which may need to be implemented quickly.</p>

<h3>Decisions to restrict on-site delivery for operational reasons</h3>

<p>We recognise that providers may have operational reasons where for a short period of time, the level of on-site learning for students may be less than 50%. Such a reduction should only take place where necessary, and for a short period. Over a longer period (for example, the term), students should continue to receive a majority of their learning on-site and on-site delivery should count for the majority of planned learning hours for all 16 to 19 students.</p>

<p>If it is strictly necessary for you to significantly reduce on-site delivery, contact your <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> territorial leads or caseload managers. You should do this before communicating any decision, so they can understand the position and discuss the mitigations you are putting in place.</p>

<h3>Examples of circumstances in which providers may find it necessary to make adjustments</h3>

<p>A planned reduction of the number of 16 to 19 students who are on-site during busy exam and assessment periods when it would otherwise be more difficult to implement established infection control measures. Any restrictions should be proportionate to the need, and we would normally expect significant restrictions to last no longer than the period of exams and assessments.</p>

<p>In the event of a very high level of staff absence. It may be appropriate to consider a mixed model, with some teachers delivering lessons remotely to students who are on-site and supervised by other staff. A reduction in on-site delivery should be proportionate to the scale of the staffing challenge.</p>

<h3>Support for students who are unable to access remote digital education</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-help-with-technology-for-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">get help with technology</a> service is providing support with devices and connectivity for 16 to 19 year olds. This forms part of a £400 million investment to help children and young people continue their education at home and access online social care services.</p>

<p>Although students are now benefiting from on-site education, this offer may continue to be important for students who, for example, need to self-isolate or shield during this period.  Further detail on who is eligible and how to access support is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">get help with technology service</a>.</p>

<p>Ownership of laptops and tablets provided under this scheme rests with <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers. You may lend these to publicly funded students aged 16 to 19 and those aged 19 and over with an education, health and care plan.</p>

<p><abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers eligible to receive devices can also receive connectivity support for financially disadvantaged students who do not have broadband at home.</p>

<p>The majority of mobile networks are offering free data uplifts to students aged 16 to 19 and those aged 19 to 25 with an <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plan until the end of July 2021. You can visit the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/">get help with technology service</a> for further details on eligibility and to check which network providers are supporting requests for free data uplifts. If increasing mobile data is not a suitable option, or if a request for additional data is unsuccessful, you can also request 4G wireless routers through the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/">get help with technology service</a>. The sim cards in 4G wireless routers provided through this service will remain active until the end of July 2021.</p>

<p>You can also continue to use the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund to provide financial support to help students overcome specific financial barriers to participation so that they can remain in education. This may include the provision of devices and connectivity support. As set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2020-to-2021-academic-year" class="govuk-link">16 to 19 Bursary Fund</a> guidance, you should decide what support a student needs on the basis of individual assessment, in line with bursary fund rules.</p>

<p>For adults aged 19 and over we introduced a change to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2020-to-2021">Adult Education Budget (<abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr>) funding rules</a> for the 2020 to 2021 academic year. This enables you to use learner support funds to purchase <abbr title="information technology">IT</abbr> devices or internet access for disadvantaged students to help them meet technology costs, where these costs are a barrier to accessing or continuing in their training. The introduction of this additional flexibility into the funding rules will be accommodated within your existing <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> for 2020 to 2021. This flexibility is only for providers funded by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>. In areas where the <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> budget is devolved, contact the relevant mayoral combined authority or Greater London Authority concerning adult student support arrangements.</p>

<h3>Transport</h3>

<p>The guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-to-school-and-other-places-of-education-autumn-term-2020">transport for schools and other places of education</a> provides information about the steps local transport authorities are taking to ensure that students can travel to their setting. It also includes information on the measures you should take where you provide dedicated transport for students.</p>

<p>We advise you to work with your local transport authority to identify when it might be necessary to manage demand on public transport or to arrange additional transport. Local transport authorities have received additional funding for school and college dedicated transport to support children and students in their region.</p>

<h3>Dedicated <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> and skills provider transport</h3>

<p>Students on dedicated transport services do not mix with the general public on those journeys and dedicated transport generally carry the same group of students on a regular basis. This helps limit the number of other people with whom they come into contact and therefore the risk of transmission of COVID-19 are likely to be lower.</p>

<p>Local authorities are not required to uniformly apply the social distancing guidelines for public transport on dedicated <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> transport. However, social distancing should still be put in place within vehicles wherever possible. This will help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>minimise disease transmission risks</li>
  <li>maintain consistent reinforcement of public health messaging to students and staff, particularly at the point where they are leaving college and heading back into the community each day</li>
</ul>

<p>Dedicated provider transport services may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>coaches regularly picking up the same students each day</li>
  <li>minibuses</li>
  <li>services that are consistently used by different groups of students on different specified days</li>
  <li>services for students with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The approach that you take will need to reflect the range of measures that are reasonable in the different circumstances.</p>

<p>Speak to your transport provider to confirm the approach they are adopting. Check it follows the <a href="#system-of-controls" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a>. It is important, wherever possible, that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>social distancing is maximised within vehicles</li>
  <li>students are grouped together on transport</li>
  <li>organised queuing and boarding is in place</li>
  <li>students should clean their hands before boarding transport and again on disembarking</li>
  <li>additional cleaning of vehicles is put in place</li>
  <li>ventilation of fresh air from outside the vehicle is maximised, particularly through opening windows and ceiling vents</li>
</ul>

<p>In accordance with advice from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, young people aged 11 and over must wear a face covering when travelling on dedicated college transport. This does not apply to those who are exempt from wearing a face covering. A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> is a covering of any type which covers your nose and mouth.</p>

<h3>Wider public transport</h3>

<p>In many areas, students make extensive use of the wider public transport system, particularly public buses, to travel to education. Students’ use of public transport should be kept to an absolute minimum, particularly in peak times.</p>

<p>Where possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider staggered start times</li>
  <li>encourage students and staff to walk or cycle where possible</li>
  <li>refer students and staff using public transport to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">safer travel guidance for passengers</a>
</li>
  <li>remind students and staff that it is the law that they wear a face covering when travelling in England on public transport unless they are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#exemptions-face-coverings">exempt from wearing face coverings</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Work with your local authority to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider alternative safe transport arrangements where you have concerns about students’ ability to access public transport</li>
  <li>consider the transport needs of students with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> and those with an <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plan</li>
</ul>

<h3>Safe behaviour off-site</h3>

<p>You should consider how to reinforce public health messaging to students and staff, particularly at the point where they are entering and leaving college and heading into the community each day.</p>

<p>People are more likely to follow guidance on how to behave if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they understand the reasons they are asked to take certain actions</li>
  <li>it is co-produced with the staff and students who will be affected by it</li>
</ul>

<p>You should develop guidance to promote safe behaviour in the wider community with local community leaders as well as staff and students. You can encourage student organisations to lead in promoting COVID-19 safety.</p>

<h3>Temporary staff and visitors</h3>

<p>Consider how to minimise the number of visitors to your setting where possible. Supply staff and visitors such as sports coaches must follow your arrangements for managing and minimising risk based on the <a href="#system-of-controls" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a>. A record should be kept of all visitors with sufficient detail to support rapid contact tracing if required by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace.</p>

<p>To help you minimise the numbers of temporary staff entering your premises, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using longer assignments with supply staff</li>
  <li>agreeing to a minimum number of hours across the academic year</li>
</ul>

<h2>Educational visits</h2>

<p>We recognise the significant benefits of educational visits for educational development as well as mental health and wellbeing. We are taking steps to allow students to enjoy visits in line with the Government’s roadmap.</p>

<p>Advice will continue to be updated in line with the roadmap.</p>

<h3>Educational day visits</h3>

<p>Any educational day visits must be conducted in line with relevant COVID-secure guidelines in place at that time, such as maintaining consistent groups, and the COVID-secure measures in place at the destination.</p>

<p>You should undertake full and thorough risk assessments in relation to all educational visits to ensure they can be done safely. As part of this risk assessment, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider what control measures need to be used</li>
  <li>ensure you are aware of wider advice on visiting indoor and outdoor venues</li>
  <li>consult the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-safety-on-educational-visits" class="govuk-link">health and safety guidance</a> when considering visits</li>
</ul>

<h3>Domestic residential educational visits</h3>

<p>From 17 May, domestic residential education visits that are already booked may go ahead. Any domestic residential educational visits must be conducted in line with relevant COVID-secure guidance in place at the destination.</p>

<p>For new bookings, whilst there are still gaps in the traditional insurance market regarding COVID-19 cancellation cover, you should be able to secure appropriate travel insurance for other aspects of the visit.</p>

<p>Given the likely gap in COVID-19 cancellation related insurance, if considering booking a new visit you are advised to ensure that any new bookings have adequate financial protection in place.</p>

<p>You can plan for new domestic residential educational visits. From 17 May, in line with Step 3 of the Roadmap, educational residential visits are permitted where they are within the general indoor social contact limits (up to 6 people or 2 households/bubbles) or where an exception applies, for example where the trip is reasonably necessary for the purposes of a <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> course of study or for work or training purposes. However, we recommend that trips are kept to a minimum and groups are limited to no more than 30 students to help manage transmission risks. Where larger groups are needed, you should organise your staff and students into separate self-contained groups, with mixing between the groups being prohibited. You should consider the number of individuals attending the visit as part of your risk assessment.</p>

<p>In addition, and as part of the recommended twice weekly testing, students and staff should ensure they get tested before and after the visit. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-asymptomatic-testing-in-schools-and-colleges">asymptomatic testing</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Overnight sleeping arrangements place students and staff at the most risk of exposure to COVID-19. As a consequence, if an organised residential visit contains more than 6 people, you must ensure that the numbers of students are broken down into smaller groups for sleeping arrangements. It is also recommended that members of staff have their own single room and do not share with other members of staff. Your risk assessment should, amongst other things, manage the numbers in each room, space between beds, space between groups of beds and the quality of ventilation.</p>

<p>You, hotels and other accommodation providers that are hosting these visits should have in place the protective measures as outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/hotels-and-other-guest-accommodation">Working Safely: Hotels and Other Accommodation</a> guidance. You should request this information prior to any visit. You should pay particular attention to how the centre will manage any COVID-19 outbreaks during your stay and what arrangements you will need to have in place should a student or a members of staff become symptomatic and need to return home.</p>

<h4>Risk Assessment</h4>

<p>You should undertake full and thorough risk assessments in relation to all educational visits to ensure they can be undertaken safely and you may find it helpful to refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">schools guidance</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/hotels-and-other-guest-accommodation" class="govuk-link">Working Safely: Hotels and Other Accommodation</a> guidance.</p>

<h2>International Visits</h2>

<h3>International educational exchanges, study abroad or volunteering programmes</h3>

<p>For students who may have plans for study or volunteering abroad that are organised by providers in England, for example placements receiving <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-turing-scheme-to-support-thousands-of-students-to-study-and-work-abroad" class="govuk-link">Turing Scheme</a> funding from September, we expect that students and providers will comply with travel advice given by Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr>) that sets out COVID-19 and other risks from travel abroad.</p>

<h3>Workforce</h3>

<p>We expect that most staff will be able to attend work.</p>

<p>All staff working on-site should follow the <a href="#system-of-controls" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a> to minimise the risks of transmission. Some roles, such as some administrative roles, may be conducive to home working, and you should consider what is feasible and appropriate.</p>

<p>Explain to staff the measures you are putting in place to reduce risks.</p>

<p>Discuss any concerns individuals may have around their circumstances with them. We encourage you to be flexible and try to accommodate additional measures if appropriate.</p>

<h4>Staff who are clinically extremely vulnerable</h4>

<p>Clinically extremely vulnerable (<abbr title="Clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>) individuals are no longer advised to shield but must continue to follow the rules in place for everyone under the current national restrictions. People who are clinically extremely vulnerable are advised to work or volunteer from home where possible, but can attend their place of work or volunteering if they cannot do so from home. </p>

<h4>Staff who are clinically vulnerable</h4>

<p>Clinically vulnerable staff can attend work. While in the workplace, they should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="#system-of-controls">system of controls</a> to minimise the risks of transmission.</p>

<p>People who live with those who are clinically vulnerable can attend the workplace.</p>

<p>If clinically vulnerable staff have concerns around their individual circumstances, you should discuss those concerns and be flexible in seeking to address them.</p>

<h4>Staff who are pregnant</h4>

<p>You will need to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees">specific guidance for pregnant employees</a> because pregnant women are considered clinically vulnerable. In some cases, pregnant women may also have other health conditions that mean they are considered <abbr title="Clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>, where the advice for clinically extremely vulnerable staff will apply. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-women-of-childbearing-age-currently-pregnant-planning-a-pregnancy-or-breastfeeding" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 vaccination: a guide for women of childbearing age, pregnant or breastfeeding</a> contains vaccination advice.</p>

<p>Your workplace risk assessment should already consider any risks to female employees of childbearing age and, in particular, risks to new and expectant mothers. If you are notified that an employee is pregnant, breastfeeding, or has given birth within the last 6 months, you should check the workplace risk assessment to see if any new risks have arisen. An assessment may help identify any additional action that needs to be taken to mitigate risks.</p>

<p>Any risks identified at that point, or later during the pregnancy, in the first 6 months after birth, or while the employee is still breastfeeding, must be included and managed as part of the general workplace risk assessment. You must take appropriate sensible action to reduce, remove or control the risks.</p>

<p>As part of your risk assessment, you should consider whether adapting duties or facilitating home working may be appropriate to mitigate risks.</p>

<p>You should be aware that pregnant women from 28 weeks’ gestation, or with underlying health conditions at any point of gestation, may be at greater risk of severe illness if they catch COVID-19. This is also the case for pregnant women with underlying health conditions that place them at greater risk of severe illness if they catch COVID-19.</p>

<p>We recommend that you follow the same principles for pregnant students, in line with your wider health and safety obligations.</p>

<p>Read more <a href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance and advice on COVID-19 and pregnancy from the Royal College of Gynaecologists</a>.</p>

<h3>Health and safety, and first aid</h3>

<p>Employers have a legal obligation to protect their employees, and others from harm and should continue to assess health and safety risks (alongside COVID-19 risks) in the usual way. Following the steps in this guidance will mitigate the risks of COVID-19 to students and staff and help you to meet your legal duties to protect employees and others from harm.</p>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive published <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/first-aid-and-medicals/first-aid-certificate-coronavirus.htm" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on first aid during COVID-19</a> which will support local risk assessments and provides guidance for first aiders. It is clear that treating any casualty properly should be the first concern. Where it is necessary for first aid provision to be administered in close proximity, those administering it should pay particular attention to sanitation measures immediately afterwards including washing hands.</p>

<p>You should continue to ensure that you comply with legal obligations, including duties of care towards staff, students and visitors, including under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<h2>Recruitment</h2>

<p>You can continue recruiting members of staff.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.et-foundation.co.uk/supporting/support-teacher-recruitment/taking-teaching-further" class="govuk-link">register for the Taking Teaching Further programme</a>. This programme supports the recruitment of industry professionals to teaching roles in the <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> sector.</p>

<p>If you are recruiting English, maths or <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> teachers, you can apply for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fe-funding-initial-teacher-education-ite-academic-year-2020-to-2021">in-service initial teacher education (<abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr>) grants</a> of £18,200.</p>

<h2>Teacher training</h2>

<p>We strongly encourage you to continue delivering initial teacher education (<abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr>) including hosting initial teacher training in education trainees during any type of restrictions. <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> trainees are included in the definition of a critical worker. This means that trainees can continue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>with their qualifications</li>
  <li>to go into their provider on placement</li>
</ul>

<p>Trainees who continue to go into their host provider should be offered COVID-19 testing in the same way as the wider staff.</p>

<p>Trainees can also support in other ways, including supporting remote education, developing lesson materials and offering pastoral support. <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> providers should continue to provide theoretical input for trainees that enables them to deliver education using a range of different approaches to teaching, learning and assessment. This should enable them to provide high quality learning through a range of different methods and approaches.</p>

<p>Where you are hosting placements <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> providers may be able to give extra support to host trainees at this time. You should contact relevant <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> providers directly to discuss what support is available. Trainees will be expected to follow your control measures.</p>

<p>Consider the advice issued by the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.feadvice.org.uk/file/etf-ite-qualification-mitigations-guidance-2-oct-2020pdf">Education and Training Foundation on <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> practice placements</a> which is intended to support a consistent approach across all programmes whilst maintaining quality.</p>

<h2>Supporting staff</h2>

<p>All employers have a duty of care to their employees, and this extends to their mental health.</p>

<p>Because some staff may be particularly anxious about attending, you may need extra systems in place to support staff wellbeing. Read about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/extra-mental-health-support-for-pupils-and-teachers">extra mental health support for pupils and teachers</a>.</p>

<h2>Supporting vulnerable students</h2>

<p>Vulnerable students are those who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are assessed as being in need under section 17 of the Children Act 1989, including students who have a child in need plan, a child protection plan or who are a looked-after child</li>
  <li>have an <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plan</li>
  <li>have been assessed as otherwise vulnerable by educational providers or local authorities (including children’s social care services) - this includes:</li>
  <li>students on the edge of receiving support from children’s social care services</li>
  <li>adopted children</li>
  <li>those at risk of becoming <abbr title="not in employment, education or training">NEET</abbr>
</li>
  <li>those living in temporary accommodation</li>
  <li>those who are young carers</li>
  <li>those who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at home (for example due to a lack of devices or quiet space to study)</li>
  <li>others at the provider and local authority’s discretion, including students who need to attend to receive support or manage risks to their mental health</li>
</ul>

<p>During any restrictions to in-person education delivery, you will remain open to vulnerable students, including vulnerable adult students such as adults with learning difficulties and disabilities. Vulnerable students are strongly encouraged to attend on-site provision. In particular, young people with a social worker or <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plans are expected to attend provision (subject to public health advice), because of their safeguarding and welfare needs.</p>

<p>If vulnerable students do not attend, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work together with the local authority and social worker (where applicable) to follow up with the parent or carer to explore the reason for absence and discuss their concerns</li>
  <li>work closely with other professionals, where appropriate, to support attendance</li>
  <li>notify the student’s social worker, if they have one, particularly where the social worker (where applicable) agrees that the student’s attendance would be appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>If the vulnerable student wishes to be absent from face-to-face education during local or national restrictions, they should let their setting know. The young person should not be included in the COVID-19 attendance monitoring data as ‘expected to attend’. Further guidance is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-complete-the-educational-setting-status-form">how to complete the educational setting status form</a>.</p>

<p>Where you have had to close, you should inform the local authority to discuss alternative arrangements for vulnerable students and work towards reopening as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You should work collaboratively with other education providers and local partners to maximise opportunities for face-to-face provision for vulnerable students. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the local authority</li>
  <li>social workers</li>
  <li>police</li>
  <li>youth services</li>
  <li>key workers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transition in and out of <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Students cease to be of compulsory school age on the last Friday of June in the year in which they turn 16. That means that those students (most of whom will be in year 11) are not required to attend school after this date.</p>

<p>We know that this year, many <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers will already have plans in place for the last half of the summer term to support their current students and to welcome prospective students. We would strongly encourage all <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers to maximise opportunities that meet the progression needs of their students during this period.</p>

<p>When planning any transition programme you should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>design and plan content to support students to study remotely or independently to embed curriculum content in which they are less secure - use video lessons and summer education recovery resources from Oak National Academy for up to year 11 or other high-quality resources (see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-further-education-provision" class="govuk-link">digital curriculum content and resources</a>), including the free digital resources in <a href="https://theskillstoolkit.campaign.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">the skills toolkit</a>
</li>
  <li>liaise with local schools to support students’ transition to A level study or VTQs at your college by helping them identify and prioritise delivery of content deemed essential for the course to cover either in the classroom, remotely, or for students to follow up themselves</li>
  <li>seek access to all year 11 students ahead of the summer to inform their options and choices, and provide taster sessions or induction activities (schools guidance will set out that post-16 providers should be given access to year 11 students)</li>
  <li>work with local authorities and schools to agree how those at risk of being ‘not in employment, education or training’ (<abbr title="not in employment, education or training">NEET</abbr>) can be referred for intensive support, drawn from the range of education and training support services available locally</li>
  <li>consider extra support for students at high risk of being <abbr title="not in employment, education or training">NEET</abbr>. A trusted adviser can help young people to sustain engagement, overcome barriers and achieve their goals.</li>
  <li>provide support on study skills, other enrichment activity, careers advice and guidance on the options available and other support for students’ mental health and wellbeing for all students progressing to further study or employment. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/careers-guidance-for-colleges--2">Guidance on careers</a> information is available and support is also available from <a rel="external" href="https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/explore-careers" class="govuk-link">the National Careers Service</a>
</li>
  <li>support application and preparation for work, in partnership with employers, including providing work experience, as far as COVID-19 restrictions apply</li>
  <li>make staff available to support and mentor students who need guidance and direction</li>
  <li>allow students to keep loaned laptops until the end of July where students will need these to engage with preparatory or catch-up support designed to support their progression</li>
  <li>collaborate with universities to ensure a smooth transition for students that have already received offers and those that haven’t but may apply through clearing</li>
</ul>

<p>You should continue to work with schools and local authorities to support transitions. This includes sharing any relevant welfare and child protection information. Keeping children safe in education sets out responsibilities for sharing information.</p>

<p>Some young people might need additional mental health and wellbeing support. Use external support where necessary and possible. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-further-education-provision/further-education-coronavirus-covid-19-operational-guidance#mental-health-and-wellbeing">mental health and wellbeing section</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You should assess where students are in their learning and agree on a plan to support catch up. This is supported through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund" class="govuk-link">16 to 19 tuition fund</a>. For looked-after children and care leavers, this may mean working with the virtual school head or personal adviser to review personal education and pathway plans.</p>

<h2>Students who are clinically extremely vulnerable</h2>

<p>Clinically extremely vulnerable (<abbr title="Clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>) students should attend their college unless they are one of the very small number of students under paediatric or other specialist care and have been advised by their GP or clinician not to attend.</p>

<p>Where a student is unable to attend education because they are complying with clinical or public health advice, we expect you to offer them access to remote education.</p>

<p>Students who live with someone who is clinically extremely vulnerable, but who are not clinically extremely vulnerable themselves should still attend their educational setting if eligible for face-to-face education.</p>

<p>There are some groups who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. These people have been told directly by their GP or hospital clinician, or have received a letter, confirming that they are ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’. See guidance on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/who-is-at-high-risk-from-coronavirus-clinically-extremely-vulnerable/">who is at higher risk from COVID-19</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19" class="govuk-link">protecting people who are clinically extremely vulnerable</a>.</p>

<h3>Clinically vulnerable students</h3>

<p>Clinically vulnerable students can attend their setting.</p>

<h2>Supporting students with special education needs (<abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>)</h2>

<h3>Special post-16 institutions</h3>

<p>We expect that every 16 to 19 student (or 19 to 25 with an <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plan) undertakes the majority of their planned hours on site. Special post-16 institutions should continue to allow students to attend as per their usual timetable.</p>

<p>Where a young person at a special post-16 institution or their parent or legal guardian has decided that they will not attend their education setting, the education provider should keep a record of how the decision on attendance was made. Further information is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-complete-the-educational-setting-status-form">how to complete the educational setting status form</a>.</p>

<p>You may encounter instances where you cannot provide your usual interventions and provision at adequate staffing ratios, or with staff with vital specialist training. You may need to alter the way in which you deploy your staff and use existing teaching and support staff more flexibly. If having pursued all the immediate options available, you still have concerns about staffing capacity, you should talk to your local authority. You should continue to work collaboratively with families to agree on an approach that is in the young person’s best interests</p>

<h3>Supporting students with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> to attend college</h3>

<p>Many students will have found restrictions exceptionally difficult socially and emotionally.</p>

<p>Speak to the student or their parents, to find out if any challenging behaviours or social or emotional challenges are a response to restrictions. If they are, you should offer additional support. Reasonable adjustments should be provided to support a disabled young person to access education successfully.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding young people</h3>

<p>Your staff should be particularly vigilant about new and additional safeguarding concerns. You should make staff and volunteers aware of what they should do if they have any concerns about a student. It is important that they act immediately on any safeguarding concerns.</p>

<p>Check that the safeguarding and welfare information you hold on all students is accurate. Ask parents and carers to tell you about any changes in welfare, health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Continue to work with and support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>young people’s social workers</li>
  <li>the local authority virtual school head for looked-after and previously looked-after children</li>
  <li>personal advisers for care leavers</li>
  <li>any other relevant safeguarding and welfare partners</li>
</ul>

<p>You have a statutory duty with regards to 16 and 17 year olds to provide information to local authority services to enable them to track and maintain contact with these young people. This will help local authorities to identify those not participating so that they can provide those students with the support they need to reach their potential.</p>

<p>Continue following statutory guidance on inter-agency working, set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2">working together to safeguard children</a>. You should also refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">keeping children safe in education</a>.</p>

<p>External resources that can support the safeguarding of young people include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/get-help">SafeCall</a>, which offers support to victims of exploitation – young people can contact SafeCall directly or can be referred to SafeCall by professionals</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="https://www.barnardos.org.uk/support-hub" class="govuk-link">See, Hear, Respond service</a> provided by Barnardo’s to help young people in England who are experiencing harm and increased adversity during lockdown</li>

</ul>

<h2>Mental health and wellbeing</h2>

<p>Many students and staff members will be feeling uncertain and anxious at this time. It is important to support positive mental health and wellbeing, which is necessary for young people to engage in learning.</p>

<p>You should identify young people and members of staff who may need additional support and engage with them and their representatives to understand their needs and ensure they have appropriate mental health and wellbeing support in place. Vulnerable young people are particularly likely to need additional support with their mental health and wellbeing. The guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-and-behaviour-in-schools--2" class="govuk-link">mental health and behaviour in schools</a> might be helpful with this.</p>

<p>Work with local authorities and voluntary sector mental health organisations to ensure that support is in place. Contact your local authority to see if they have a list of services in your area that provide support for young people.</p>

<p>Support can be given over the phone for any students self-isolating from specialist staff or support services.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> children and young people’s mental health services may be able to provide support remotely. Professionals involved with children and young people, including teachers, special educational needs co-ordinators (<abbr title="special educational needs co-ordinator">SENCO</abbr>) social workers, youth workers and educational psychologists should continue referring young people to their local <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> children and young people’s mental health services where needed. Self-referral options are commonly available and many services offer single points of access. Young people or their parents or carers can also contact their GP or refer to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> 111 online.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> trusts have also established 24-hour urgent mental health helplines in most parts of England for people of all ages. If you have urgent concerns about a young person, find your local helpline to discuss your concerns with a mental health professional. You should also ensure that students are aware of this service. Public Health England has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-supporting-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-and-wellbeing">guidance on supporting children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/Component/Details/662137" class="govuk-link">Wellbeing for Education Return</a> is intended to help local areas to support schools and colleges promote wellbeing and good mental health, responding to the impacts of COVID-19. The £8 million initiative comprises training materials and funding for local experts to support the delivery of training and resources into all schools and colleges in each local area, and ongoing support, until the end of March 2021.</p>

<p>In recognition of the significant pressures on your staff, local areas are tailoring their support, and offering interactive training sessions on key themes to support the mental health and wellbeing of staff and pupils in response to COVID-19.</p>

<p>The training will give staff increased confidence to support their colleagues, young people, and local knowledge so that they know how and where to access appropriate specialist support where needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/Component/Details/662137" rel="external">Wellbeing for Education Return</a> resources are available for education staff who do not have access to locally adapted training and support or to supplement existing local offers. These include a short, recorded webinar - <a rel="external" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/Component/Details/685525" class="govuk-link">Every interaction matters</a>. It introduces a simple framework for promoting wellbeing, resilience and mental health, building on education staff’s existing roles, skills and personal qualities. It is intended for use by education leaders with all staff in staff or <abbr title="in-school training">INSET</abbr> sessions, or for education staff to work through individually. This sits alongside the original <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/Catalogue/Index?HierarchyId=0_48943_49165&amp;programmeId=48943" rel="external">Wellbeing for Education Return</a> content covering issues such as bereavement, loss, anxiety, stress and trauma and signposting to free information and resources for education staff, young people, parents and carers.</p>

<p>The Department for Education, Public Health England and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England also hosted a <a rel="external" href="https://bit.ly/3aZaXMr" class="govuk-link">webinar for school and <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers staff</a> to set out how to support returning pupils and students.</p>

<p>Consider supporting students with their mental health and wellbeing through:</p>

  <li>encouraging participation in sport, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.aocsport.co.uk/">AOC Sport</a> promotes and supports sports in further education</li>
</ul>

<h2>Residential providers</h2>

<p>If you have any students travelling from or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19">through a red or amber list country</a>, please follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/quarantine-arrangements-for-boarding-school-students-from-red-list-countries" class="govuk-link">quarantine arrangements for boarding school students from red or amber list countries</a> which also covers <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> residential providers.</p>

<p>If a student in a residential setting develops symptoms of COVID-19:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a test should be booked immediately to confirm whether they have COVID-19</li>
  <li>you should make sure they and their residential group self-isolate</li>
</ul>

<p>Where you provide residential provision, you are under a legal duty to ensure that your students are safe and well looked after during a period of restriction or their self-isolation period.</p>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-prevent-germs-from-spreading/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> guidance on how to prevent germs from spreading</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to put in place arrangements to bring meals and other essential commodities to the areas where students are self-isolating.</p>

<p>If a student with symptoms gets a test and the result is positive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> advice service immediately and follow their advice, this can be reached via the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> coronavirus helpline on 0800 046 8687 and selecting option 1</li>
  <li>staff should wear <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for activities requiring close contact</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of any localised outbreaks, we expect you to keep your residential provision open where necessary. Decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>You will need to remain open to those who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have particular needs that cannot be accommodated safely at home</li>
  <li>do not have suitable alternative accommodation</li>
</ul>

<p>Where students normally travel between their <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> education setting and home during term time for the purpose of education this can continue but students should minimise travel wherever possible.</p>

<p>Where non-residential staff need to leave and enter the residential facility, the manager of the accommodation should operate a staff rota that minimises the risk of transmission by keeping the same staff together with the same students as far as that is possible.</p>

<h3>Defining who should self-isolate in your residential setting</h3>

<p>Residential <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> providers are considered as educational accommodation and will have residential groups similar to class groups and bubbles that can be used to determine who should self-isolate if a positive case is identified.</p>

<p>Your approach to deciding what constitutes a residential group and who should self-isolate because they are part of this group will depend on the physical layout of the residential educational setting.</p>

<p>Consider who shares a kitchen, bathroom, dormitories, and staffing arrangements.</p>

<h2>International students</h2>

<p>If you have any international students, aged 18 or over, please follow the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses">higher education providers: COVID-19</a>. This applies to international students in <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> too.</p>

<h2>Funding, assessment and accountability</h2>

<p>We have issued the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance" class="govuk-link">16 to 19 funding regulations and funding rates and formula guidance</a> for 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022. Given the unprecedented circumstances, we will continue to review the guidance and will notify you of changes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16 to 19 </span> tuition fund</h3>

<p>We have provided extra funding for the academic year 2020 to 2021 to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help mitigate the disruption to learning arising from COVID-19</li>
  <li>support students to catch up</li>
</ul>

<p>The funding is provided to support small group tuition for 16 to 19 students in English, maths, or other elements of technical or academic study programmes to help address gaps in knowledge required for 16 to 19 qualifications.</p>

<p>We have issued guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund">how the funding should be used</a> and allocations have been made.</p>

<p>A further round of funding is available for the academic year 2021 to 2022 and details will be announced in due course.</p>

<h3>Funding for remote delivery to 16 to 19 students</h3>

<p>The 16 to 19 funding regulations set out the principles that need to be met to count towards planned hours. 16 to 19 funding is allocated based on planned hours regardless of how those hours are delivered. If you are planning to combine time in the classroom or workshop with remote delivery, this will not affect the funding you receive.</p>

<p>You must make sure virtual or distance learning elements of the study programme are planned, timetabled and organised. The planned hours have to be realistic and deliverable for each individual student. You must be able to give evidence of this to funding auditors.</p>

<h4>Examples of eligible provision</h4>

<p>As with classroom-based delivery, to attract funding, you should plan, develop and oversee remote or online delivery as part of the timetable you have developed. This could include lessons delivered online within your normal working pattern.</p>

<p>If students are unable to attend timetabled remote delivery for a good reason, such as caring responsibilities or not having access to a device or connectivity, you can pre-record timetabled lessons and allow them to study outside the normal working pattern. You must get evidence of participation and make sure you support and supervise time-shifted delivery appropriately.</p>

<p>As is currently the case for on-site delivery, you can also include set work in planned hours subject to organising and supervising it. For example, you could set tasks or coursework for a student, either by email or a digital learning platform or virtual learning environment. You must make sure students can access support and receive regular feedback on their progress as they study.</p>

<p>Tasks or coursework may use or incorporate externally sourced educational resources if this has been planned by the teacher as part of a student’s study programme and is supervised. Other types of remote delivery will be eligible if they meet the principles set out in the funding regulations.</p>

<p>The number of hours a student may study during a week should not be greater than 40 hours per week. The planned hours and planned dates will need to reflect this.</p>

<h4>Ineligible provision</h4>

<p>You cannot record students’ private study (homework) as planned hours. For example, it would not be acceptable to provide a student with course materials or access to external online content with minimal or no support from a teacher. The funding regulations allow for marking time to be included in planned hour calculations if this is both reasonable and a small proportion of overall planned hours.</p>

<p>Planned hours timetabled outside your normal working pattern cannot be recorded as planned hours. For example, asking all students on a course to watch a video in advance of their next timetabled class could not count towards planned hours.</p>

<h4>Evidence</h4>

<p>During a funding audit, we want you to be able to provide evidence that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students have been engaged in structured learning</li>
  <li>you have been delivering classes and other teacher-led activity to a regular timetable</li>
  <li>you can deliver provision remotely</li>
  <li>students are meeting their learning aims</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have evidence that the planned hours you record on data returns are timetabled and exist. This could include timetables and learning agreements. For remote delivery, we also expect to see evidence of engagement and participation. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>records showing that both students and tutors have been logged on when learning is being delivered</li>
  <li>meeting invites for students to join online learning sessions</li>
  <li>evidence of the length of the session that supports the planned delivery details on the timetable</li>
  <li>communications between students and tutors such as feedback or reflections on sessions</li>
</ul>

<p>If students are accessing pre-recorded material, we expect evidence that recordings have been accessed. Retain any evidence of meaningful engagement with remote learning, such as the results of tests to check a student’s understanding of the material covered.</p>

<h2>T Levels</h2>

<p>Allocations have been made to providers that will be delivering the first wave of T Levels in 2020 to 2021 based on planned T Level student numbers. We have published the approach for applying a tolerance if the number of students enrolled on T Levels is below the planned number.</p>

<p>Read more about the tolerance and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-will-be-funded-in-academic-year-2020-to-2021">how T Levels will be funded in 2020 to 2021</a>.</p>

<p>We will monitor this approach and communicate any revision for 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h3>T Level industry placements</h3>

<p>We are closely monitoring the situation regarding the impact of COVID-19 on industry placements.</p>

<p>We are working with providers and delivery partners to establish whether further support is needed.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">industry placements delivery guidance</a> for information about delivering high-quality industry placements.</p>

<p>We are committed to ensuring all T Level students spend time in the workplace on an industry placement because we know from international evidence and feedback from employers and students that such placements add real value.</p>

<p>We have structured the roll-out of T Levels so that the first cohort is relatively small, and the majority of these students will not undertake their placements until the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<h2>Asymptomatic mass testing funding</h2>

<p>Funding is available to eligible colleges to support the costs of set up and delivery of on-site testing as part of the national testing programme. We expect that this funding will primarily be used to cover workforce costs, however, institutions will have discretion to spend this in order to meet other reasonable testing costs. Other relevant expenditure may include minor incidental expenses and additional waste disposal. </p>

<p>Following on from the publication of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in schools and colleges: grant funding <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-schools-and-colleges-grant-funding">Conditions of Grant</a>, <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> has published the initial allocations for mass testing funding which includes a technical note explaining how the allocations have been calculated.  The allocations are based on tests delivered on site and recorded through the test sites results service for the period 4 January to 5 March 2021.  Payment was made to colleges at the end of April.  A further payment covering Asymptomatic Testing Site (<abbr title="Asymptomatic Testing Site">ATS</abbr>) tests recorded from 6 March to 1 April will be made to colleges at the end of May with the allocations published shortly beforehand.  Payment arrangements for <abbr title="Asymptomatic Testing Site">ATS</abbr> testing carried out from 2 April will be confirmed in due course.</p>

<p>In addition to the grant funding allocations, an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges-spring-2021-payment-technical-note">exceptional claims</a> process is available for colleges to submit claims for specific costs related to <abbr title="Asymptomatic Testing Site">ATS</abbr> that cannot be covered by their allocation.  The process covers situations where it has been necessary to make temporary changes to or hire premises to carry out testing or where costs were incurred on the basis that full testing would be required from 4 January 2021 following the announcement on that day that on-site attendance would be restricted to vulnerable young people and the children of critical workers.  Claims for this second category of costs should only be made on the basis that resources were unable to be re-used or arrangements cancelled. All claims will need documentary evidence uploaded at the point of claim, such as invoices, and further <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges" class="govuk-link">detailed guidance</a> is available to assist in making appropriate claims.

<h2>College collaboration fund</h2>

<p>The College Collaboration Fund (<abbr title="College Collaboration Fund">CCF</abbr>) is a national programme of competitive grant funding for all statutory (<abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr>) providers.</p>

<p><abbr title="College Collaboration Fund">CCF</abbr> enables colleges to collaborate and share good practice and expertise to address common quality improvement priorities. The fund builds on the previous <abbr title="College Collaboration Fund">CCF</abbr> round in 2020 to 2021 and its predecessor, the Strategic College Improvement Fund (<abbr title="Strategic College Improvement Fund">SCIF</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/college-collaboration-fund-ccf" class="govuk-link">completed application form will need to be submitted by 5pm on 21 May</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="College Collaboration Fund">CCF</abbr> will run for the financial year 2021 to 2022 and there is one application round. You must complete all grant-funded activity by 31 March 2022. If you are successful, you will receive your grant on or around 18 August 2021.</p>

<h2>Free meals in further education</h2>

<p>You should continue to support students who are eligible for, and usually receive, free meals. This includes students in further education, who are newly eligible.</p>

<p>You should provide support even if students are studying remotely due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>On 8 March, students returned to their 16 to 19 providers and normal free meals in <abbr title=" further education">FE</abbr> arrangements apply. However, where students eligible for free meals are self-isolating at home, institutions should seek to ensure they continue to be supported for the short period where they are unable to attend in person</p>

<p>Read further guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/free-meals-in-further-education-funded-institutions-guide-for-the-2020-to-2021-academic-year" class="govuk-link">free meals in further education funded institutions for 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities have received funding through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-winter-grant-scheme" class="govuk-link">COVID Winter Grant Scheme</a> to provide support to vulnerable children and families (with a focus on food and utilities). This includes young people up to the age of 19.</p>

<p>The funding will be ring-fenced, with at least 80% earmarked to support food and essential utility costs.</p>

<h2>Funding claims and reconciliation</h2>

<p>Information is available for education and skills training providers on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-funding-claims" class="govuk-link">submitting funding claims</a> to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Advanced learner loans</h2>

<p>The Student Loans Company (<abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>) will continue to make scheduled fee payments to all providers with an advanced learner loan facility.</p>

<p>Contact <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> if a student’s circumstances change.</p>

<h2>Adult education budget (<abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr>) funding (grant-funded providers)</h2>

<p>Currently, approximately 50% of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-devolution"><abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> is devolved</a> to 7 mayoral combined authorities (MCAs) (Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Tees Valley, North of Tyne, Greater Manchester, Liverpool, West Midlands, East of England) and the Mayor of London (acting where appropriate through the Greater London Authority (<abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>).</p>

<p>These authorities are now responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr>-funded adult education for their residents</li>
  <li>allocating the <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> to providers</li>
  <li>considering any provider flexibilities in their areas</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> will continue to be responsible for the remaining <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> in non-devolved areas.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> Adult Education Budget (<abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr>) grant funded providers</h3>

<p>We are lowering the reconciliation threshold for <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> grant funded Adult Education Budget (<abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> adult skills including non-formula funded community learning and 19-24 Traineeships) and Advanced Learner Loan Bursary fund (<abbr title="Advanced Learner Loan Bursary">ALLB</abbr>) providers for 2020 to 2021, from 97% and 100% respectively to 90%.</p>

<p>Allocations for the Covid Skills Offer, including funding for the new Level 3 adult offer, are ringfenced and the reconciliation threshold for under-delivery of this provision will remain at 97%.</p>

<p>Our primary aim is to support providers to continue to deliver as much quality provision as possible, including above the 90% threshold, whether that be face-to-face where permitted, online or otherwise remotely, and including through sub-contracting (for <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr>-funded provision only) where that is in line with our subcontracting conditions set out in the rules and contracts.</p>

<p>We acknowledge the situation is still difficult for providers but equally we know that many providers have been able to deliver very successfully remotely during lockdown and the return to face to face learning should enhance further providers’ ability to deliver.</p>

<p>We are announcing this change now, to help providers plan their provision better for the remainder of the 2020 to2021 academic year.</p>

<p>For those providers who are eligible and are at risk of insolvency, they would be referred to the Insolvency Regime or Emergency funding process.</p>

<p>In areas where the <abbr title="Adult Education Budget">AEB</abbr> has been devolved, MCAs/<abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> are responsible for considering any provider flexibilities in their areas.</p>

<h2>Traineeships</h2>

<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/a-plan-for-jobs-2020" class="govuk-link">Plan for Jobs</a>, the Chancellor announced a significant expansion of traineeships to help an increased number of young people to prepare for and find work. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-young-people-to-develop-the-skills-for-apprenticeships-and-sustainable-employment-framework-for-delivery" class="govuk-link">traineeships framework for delivery</a> sets out these reforms.</p>

<p>Whilst these reforms enable providers to deliver a more flexible and tailored programme during the COVID-19 pandemic, training and assessment should happen remotely wherever possible during periods of local or national restrictions.</p>

<h2>Supported Internships and Access to Work</h2>

<p>Supported internships are structured study programmes based primarily at an employer. During periods of local or national restrictions, placements should happen remotely wherever possible. The young people can continue to attend COVID-secure settings for work placements where they, the learning provider and the employer all agree this is necessary.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work" class="govuk-link">Access to Work funds</a> workplace support for young people who are completing a government-funded supported internship, where they need support or adaptations beyond the reasonable adjustments.</p>

<h3>Supported internships returners</h3>

<p>Supported interns who were not able to meet the core aim of their internship in the 2020 to 2021 academic year may continue their internship into the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<p>It is not envisaged that all supported interns will need to extend their internship for a full year. Providers should determine the length of time that a learner will require based on the needs of the individual, and in agreement with the local authority. Please note that the legislative and funding arrangements for <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plans do not allow for a plan to be extended beyond the age of 25.</p>

<p>Where necessary and appropriate, priority for accessing work placements in the 2021 to 2022 academic year should be given to supported interns who were enrolled on a supported internship in 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>Returning students taking part in a supported internship who are unable to attend their work placements due to COVID-19 can apply for Access to Work funding until 31 August 2022 for work-related activities where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a job coach leads the activity</li>
  <li>the activities develop employability skills</li>
</ul>

<p>Access to Work can be claimed whether those activities are delivered face-to-face or via digital methods.</p>

<p>Access to Work is not available to support academic learning activities such as English and maths.</p>

<p>Contact the Access to Work helpline on 0800 121 7479 for more information.</p>

<h4>Recording returning supported internships in the school census and individualised learner record (<abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Record these supported internship students in the <abbr title="individualised learner record">ILR</abbr> or school census as completed at the end of the academic year 2020 to 2021. You must then set them up with a new programme covering the additional planned activity in the continuing year with start and planned end dates in the academic year 2021 to 2022. This will ensure that students continue to be funded in the unplanned funding year. Students must be on their new programme for the minimum qualifying period to count as a funded student.</p>

<p>You must only use this recording flexibility for supported internships at the boundary of academic years 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022. Do not use it for any other students or academic years.</p>

<h2>High needs funding</h2>

<p>Discuss any requirement for high needs funding with your local authority. Students who have high needs will occupy places funded at £6,000 per place (£10,000 per place in special schools) in the normal way. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link">high needs operational guide</a> for the year beginning April 2021.</p>

<p>Local authorities should continue to pay high needs top-up funding for the students with high needs whose placements they have agreed, following completion or any necessary review of their <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plans, if a plan is required, and appropriate risk assessments.</p>

<p>Where you need to make temporary changes to the education and support of young people with <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plans due to staff absence, self-isolation or the closure or partial closure of a setting on public health grounds, let the local authority’s <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> team know and keep these changes as short as possible.</p>

<p>For high needs placements and top-up funding that has not been confirmed before the start of the term in which the student is expected to start or continue their education or training programme, you should speak to the commissioning local authorities to see if you can be paid on account, with later reconciliation of top-up funding amounts when the placements and funding levels are finally agreed. This will ensure staff can remain in employment and be available for when the special provision is needed. Local authorities should confirm the funding associated with high needs placements as soon as possible after the placements are agreed.</p>

<h2>Awarding qualifications for summer 2021</h2>

<p>Many schools and colleges might normally incorporate a period of independent study leave in the summer term as exams approach. However, this year the needs of the cohort will be different and this may not be applicable for all. The 2021 exams approach for GCSEs, AS and A levels requires teachers to submit grades by 18 June 2021. This process requires considerable resource and we recognise that in practice, for many students, work done after the May half term will not contribute towards their grades.</p>

<p>For students taking vocational and technical qualifications (VTQs), different approaches are being taken for different groups of qualifications. Ofqual published its <a rel="external" href="https://analytics.ofqual.gov.uk/apps/AllQualifications/summer2021tool/" class="govuk-link">summer 2021 qualification explainer tool</a> on 24 March, which shows what approach will be taken for individual qualifications. Students can search for their specific qualification to see how it will be assessed. Additionally, Ofqual’s revised regulatory framework (the <abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr> Contingency Regulatory Framework) was published on 24 March, which sets out the expectations on awarding organisations for awarding this year.</p>

<p>Since 25 February, awarding organisations have been sharing information on their approach to awarding for VTQs with schools, colleges and other providers, as well as providing information at individual qualification level on their websites. They will have also published guidance for centres and relevant materials on teacher assessed grades.</p>

<p>For those VTQs most similar to GCSE, AS and A levels that are used for progression to further or higher education, students will receive teacher assessed grades.  This also includes other general qualifications such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>International Baccalaureate</li>
  <li>Pre-U</li>
  <li>Core Maths</li>
  <li>Advanced Extension Awards</li>
  <li>Extended Project Qualifications</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all qualifications taking this approach will require submission of grades by 18 June 2021. Details of final submission dates will be made available on individual awarding organisations’ (AOs) websites.</p>

<p>For VTQs that require students to demonstrate occupational or professional competency, exams and assessments will be going ahead in the summer term in line with public health guidelines, and so work for these qualifications will continue throughout the remainder of the academic year. Where the assessment cannot take place safely it will need to be delayed.</p>

<p>For VTQs that are used for progression to further or higher education but are not like GCSEs or A levels in their structure, such as Functional Skills qualifications (FSQs) and English for Speakers of Other Languages (<abbr title="English for Speakers of Other Languages">ESOL</abbr>), exams and assessments for these will also continue in line with public health measures, including remotely, but with alternative arrangements available for those who cannot access the assessments. All details of which approach is being used for individual qualifications can be found on the relevant AOs’ websites.</p>

<p>It is expected that the need for teacher assessed grades will be identified on a case-by-case basis. It is not expected that eligibility for teacher assessed grades will be determined for large cohorts of students.</p>

<p>Ofqual has published details of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/awarding-of-functional-skills-in-2021">different assessment arrangements available for Functional Skills qualifications in 2021</a>.</p>

<h4>How <abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr> students can appeal their results</h4>

<p>Schools, colleges and other providers wishing to appeal a <abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr> result on behalf of a student should follow the process set out by the individual awarding organisation concerned.</p>

<h2>Performance data</h2>

<p>All exams that were due to take place in schools and colleges in England in summer 2020 were cancelled. We will not publish any provider-level educational performance data based on tests, assessments or exams for 2020. This includes the 2019 to 2020 qualification achievement rates. No provider will be judged on data based on exams and assessments from 2020.</p>

<p>We will not publish data based on exams and assessments from summer 2021 on school and college performance tables or publish qualification achievement rates.</p>

<p>See guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-school-and-college-performance-measures" class="govuk-link">school and college performance measures</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualification-achievement-rates-and-minimum-standards">qualification achievement rates</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Inspection</h2>

<p>During the summer term, new provider monitoring visits (NPMVs) will continue to new providers that have not received a monitoring visit. Full inspections of new providers that have had a <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr>, and monitoring visits to requires improvement and inadequate providers, will also resume in the summer term under Ofsted’s Education Inspection Framework (<abbr title="Education Inspection Framework">EIF</abbr>).</p>

<p>Ofsted will continue to conduct emergency monitoring visits or full inspections of providers where serious concerns are identified.</p>

<p>Ofsted has published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif">updated inspection handbook</a> which takes account of the challenges raised by COVID-19.</p>
