<p>This notice sets out how we will use your personal data for monitoring, evaluation and research to support ‘public tasks’ related to the Renewable Heat Incentive (<abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr>). It also sets out your rights.</p>

<h2>The data</h2>

<p>We will process the following personal data:</p>

<h3>Domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr>
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>contact details including your name, email address and telephone number</li>
  <li>residential, Installation, and Correspondence Addresses (including postcodes). For applications from private or social landlords, there is also address and postcode for their organisation</li>
  <li>identification numbers, such as the <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> number, the <abbr title="Microgeneration Certification Scheme">MCS</abbr> and <abbr title="energy performance certificate">EPC</abbr> certificate numbers, and the Renewable Heat Premium Payment Scheme Number (if applicable).

  <li>details about the current and past heating system including information on the <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> supported system such as the manufacturer, cost and model, capacity, system type and fuel</li>
  <li>property data, such as whether new or self-built, property type, floor space, and deemed heat demand for space and water heating taken from the <abbr title="energy performance certificate">EPC</abbr> (required to calculate payments)</li>
  <li>occupancy details, such as ownership type (whether owner occupier, private landlord or social landlord), the number of days the property is occupied, and the number of occupants</li>
</ul>

<h3>Non-domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr>
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>contact details including your name, email address and telephone number</li>
  <li>name and address of the location of the heating installation, and of the associated company</li>
  <li>payment details, including tariffs and the amount of heat generated (this does not include details of the account into which you receive <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> tariff payments)</li>
  <li>administrative details regarding your application, including <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> number, dates of submission, accreditation, and commission, application statuses and company <abbr title="standard industrialisation classification">SIC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>details about the heating system including technology type, capacity, installation costs, expected feedstock and expected heat/biomethane generation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purposes for which we are processing your personal data are:</p>

<p>1. The evaluation of the domestic and non-domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr>. Your data will be processed for activities including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sampling – the activity of using your personal data to contact you, to invite you to consent to participate in research activities, including but not limited to surveys and interviews</li>
  <li>data analysis – the activity of carrying out statistical activities on your personal data, either in isolation or combined with other datasets</li>
  <li>tailoring - the activity of including your personal data on research apparatus to make it more specific to you, such as the inclusion of your name on the introductory message of a survey</li>
</ul>

<p>2. For monitoring of the <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr>, your data will be processed for activities including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the publication of Official Statistics</li>
  <li>the preparation of financial forecasts and monitoring of payments made to applicants</li>
  <li>auditing</li>
</ul>

<p>3. For analysis, research and future policy development, your data will be processed for activities including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>research for the development of policies on clean heat and any related activities, e.g., the <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr>, the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, the National Energy Efficiency Data-Framework (NEED) etc</li>
  <li>data analysis – the activity of carrying out statistical activities on your personal data, either in isolation or combined with other datasets, and analysis of your metering data</li>
  <li>to conduct research and analysis to support related policies</li>
  <li>linking: your data may be linked to other datasets in which your data is stored for evaluation, monitoring and analytical purposes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal basis of processing</h2>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is public task (Article 6(1)(e) UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>). Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, such as the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown, or a government department; the exercise of a function conferred on a person by an enactment; the exercise of a function of either House of Parliament; or the administration of justice.</p>

<p>In this instance, one of the tasks which <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> needs to complete is an evaluation of the domestic and non-domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr>. A proper evaluation of the <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> is required to assess the value-for-money of public spending, the extent to which it has met its aims and whether it has resulted in the expected impacts. The Public Value Framework published by HM Treasury makes clear the necessity of evaluation to public policy (this is particularly clear on page 47).</p>

<p>In addition, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> needs to monitor the scheme and how it is functioning, from an operational, financial and a policy development perspective. This is done by producing Official Statistics, financial forecasts and other analysis. The statistics provide transparent information on the scheme, e.g., the number of applicants. The financial forecasts enable control of spend of the scheme as well as payments to applicants. Financial auditing is also done by the National Audit Office. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> also carries out research to inform the development of <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> and other policies, for example new policies to support renewable heat after the closure of the <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Recipients</h2>

<p>For evaluation purposes, your personal data will be shared by us with any contractor or sub-contractor with whom <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> deem necessary for undertaking evaluation activities as part of the <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> evaluation.</p>

<p>For monitoring and research purposes, data will be shared by us with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Welsh Government</li>
  <li>Scottish Government</li>
  <li>Office for National Statistics</li>
  <li>other government departments and agencies as required for monitoring and research purposes, for example of air quality by DEFRA</li>
  <li>the National Audit Office</li>
  <li>the Energy Savings Trust (working as a contractor to Scottish government)</li>
  <li>the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GEMA)</li>
  <li>any contractor or sub-contractor we deem necessary for undertaking research activities</li>
</ul>

<p>In accordance with Principle (C): Data Minimisation, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will limit the sharing of your personal data to what is necessary and relevant. We will limit the data sharing to those who require it to undertake their contractual obligations in completing work as part of the evaluation or monitoring of the <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr>. We only share personal data when that is essential for the research activity. Where personal data is not essential for the monitoring, evaluation or research we may instead share extracts of data.</p>

<p>As your personal data will be stored on our IT infrastructure it will also be shared with our processors Microsoft and Amazon Web Services.</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>

<p>Your personal data will be kept by us for no longer than it is needed to fulfil our functions in evaluating and monitoring the domestic and non-domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> scheme. Extracts of property-level data (for example that a dwelling has received <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> funding to install an air source heat pump) may be retained for wider analysis purposes.</p>

<p>The domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> evaluation is set to conclude in January 2023, at which point a final analysis of the non-domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> will also conclude. Following publication of the domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> synthesis report and non-domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> analysis and upon conclusion of the evaluation, the evaluation team will destroy any of your data that they hold. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will also seek confirmation from its contractors and subcontractors that your data held in connection with the evaluation has been destroyed.</p>

<p>Your data will be retained separately by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> for monitoring, statistical and/or research purposes. Data will be retained to monitor payments and make financial forecasts until all payments on the schemes have been made (for at least 7 years after the closure of the domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> to new applications and 20 years after the closure of the non-domestic <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> to new applications). While the full raw data will then be destroyed, extracts of property-level data records may be kept as part of models such as the National Energy Efficiency Data-Framework (NEED).</p>

<h2>Where personal data has not been obtained from the data subject</h2>

<p>Your personal data are obtained by us from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). Ofgem are legally compelled to supply data to <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> under <abbr title="renewable heat incentive">RHI</abbr> regulations when <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> request it. If you signed up for a Metering and Monitoring Service Package, your metering data was obtained by us from data storage platforms or installers.</p>
