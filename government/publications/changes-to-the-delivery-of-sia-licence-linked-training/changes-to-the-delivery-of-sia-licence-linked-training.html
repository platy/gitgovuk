<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Will there be any changes to the trainer requirements in order to deliver security qualifications?</h3>
<p>Yes. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assessor qualification and yearly counter-terrorism training from the National Counter Terrorism Security Office (NaCTSO)</li>
  <li>an increased continuing professional development requirement for current trainers (now 40 hours)</li>
  <li>new trainers for cash and valuables in transit will need at least 12 months’ experience from within the last 3 years</li>
  <li>new trainers for close protection, door supervision, public space surveillance (CCTV), security guarding and vehicle immobilising will need at least 2 years’ experience from within the last 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more about these changes in our ‘Get Training’ document.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Will trainers need to do any additional training to deliver the new close protection qualification?</h3>
<p>Yes. Please contact your awarding organisation for further information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Will physical intervention trainers need to upskill, or is this covered in the yearly refresher?</h3>
<p>We are not requiring any upskilling for physical intervention for door supervisor trainers apart from their annual refresher.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>How can we deliver the new qualifications?</h3>
<p>You can deliver the new qualifications using a mixture of self-study, virtual classroom, and face-to-face training. Your awarding organisation can give you more details on delivery methods.</p>

<p>You must deliver the practical elements of physical intervention face-to-face.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Have you considered that the increase in course length will increase the costs for training providers?</h3>
<p>Yes. We did a full impact assessment, which was approved by the Home Office.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>What other skills do learners need to have before they take the new qualifications?</h3>
<p>You can find the pre-requisite requirements for students in our ‘Get Training’ document.</p>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring that your learners are competent in English and/or Welsh.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span>Why are the security guard and door supervisor courses a day longer than they were?</h3>
<p>There are more practical assessments in the new content, which take longer. Everyone will need to do at least one physical search. We have added more content including personal safety, knowledge of physical intervention for security guards, and knowledge of door supervision equipment for door supervisors. We have removed any repeated content.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9 </span>Does the SIA have a strategy to reduce the potential gaps in training between existing licence holders and new licence holders?</h3>
<p>Yes. The purpose of the top-up training that takes effect from 1 October is to bridge the gap for existing holders of Door Supervisor and Security Guard licences.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.10 </span>Will the contact hours be the same for blended learning as for face-to-face learning?</h3>
<p>The contact hours will be the same but you should allow additional time for any training that is delivered remotely, as you will need to allow for screen breaks, problems with the technology you are using, and so on.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.11 </span>Can trainers deliver all of the new CCTV and security guarding qualifications remotely?</h3>
<p>The new CCTV and security guarding training can be delivered using a blended delivery - so, not delivered entirely remotely or face to face. We may change our approach depending on the course of the pandemic.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.12 </span>Do we need to film practical assessments??</h3>
<p>Yes. You must take video recordings of practical assessments unless the learner is under 18 years of age. Video recordings must be retained for a minimum of 1 year for audit purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.13 </span>Why is protective driving not included in the new close protection training?</h3>
<p>The expert working group considered this to be above the minimum requirement for a close protection licence and felt that it should not be included.  It will be down to the individual and/or their employer to determine if further training is required for the role undertaken.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.14 </span>Why has the sector competence requirement for close protection changed from 3 years within the last 10, to 2 years within the last 5?</h3>
<p>The sector competence requirements have changed to bring them into line with best practice in training environments.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.15 </span>Why was ‘legislation’ not added to the close protection training as a virtual training element?</h3>
<p>This content can be delivered by virtual learning.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.16 </span>If you are allowing close protection operatives to work as door supervisors, where is the common unit?</h3>
<p>The content for the new close protection qualification includes safety critical elements from the door supervisor qualification. This is so that licence integration can continue. The expert working group and awarding organisations felt that it should be the employer’s responsibility to ensure that operatives are trained in any further skills required for specific roles (for example, fire safety awareness).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Top-up training</h2>

<p>Questions in this section:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#top-up-who">Who needs to do the top-up training?</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#top-up-length">How long will it take to do the top-up training?</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#top-up-assessment">How will the top-up training be assessed?</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Who needs to do the top-up training?</h3>
<p>We explain this on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-the-training-you-need-for-an-sia-licence">Changes to the training you need for an SIA licence</a> page.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>How long will it take to do the top-up training?</h3>
<p>It depends on which licence the learner wants to apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Door supervisor = 2 days</li>
  <li>Security guard = 0.5 days</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases they will need to complete first aid training (Emergency First at Work or equivalent) before they take the top-up training. The first aid training is 1 day.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>What is included in the top-up training?</h3>
<p>An Emergency First Aid at Work qualification (or equivalent) must be completed before taking the top-up training.</p>

<p>Door supervisors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use of equipment</li>
  <li>updated terror threat awareness</li>
  <li>physical intervention skills refresher training (knowledge and practical)</li>
  <li>knowledge around critical incidents eg. where to access government guidance on pandemic responses</li>
</ul>

<p>Security guards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>knowledge of physical intervention</li>
  <li>updated terror threat awareness</li>
  <li>knowledge around critical incidents eg. where to access government guidance on pandemic responses</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>How can we deliver the top-up training?</h3>
<p>You can deliver the new qualifications using a mixture of self-study, virtual classroom, and face-to-face training. Your awarding organisation can give you more details on delivery methods.</p>

<p>You must deliver the practical elements of physical intervention face-to-face.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>How will the top-up training be assessed?</h3>
<p>The security guard top-up training will be assessed by 2 exams (security guarding knowledge and terror threat awareness). The door supervisor top-up training will be assessed by 3 exams (door supervisor knowledge, terror threat awareness and physical intervention knowledge) plus a practical physical intervention assessment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>General</h2>

<p>Questions in this section:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#general-materials">Where can I find training materials for theoretical and practical training/assessments or equipment such as body worn video camera and breathalyser requirements?</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#general-recordings">We have seen guidance that suggests the practical assessments must be recorded for 15 minutes each. Is this recording in addition to contact hours?</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#general-apl">Will there be any accreditation for prior learning for current physical intervention level 3 to level 3 physical intervention (close protection) or any fast track training for existing trainers?</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#general-malpractice">What are you doing to prevent training malpractice?</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Where can I find training materials for theoretical and practical training/assessments or equipment such as body worn video camera and breathalyser requirements?</h3>
<p>Your awarding organisation may provide you with training materials.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>We have seen guidance that suggests the practical assessments must be recorded for 15 minutes each. Is this recording in addition to contact hours?</h3>
<p>The recording is within the contact hours. We expect that some training providers might combine the searching and use of communication devices practical assessments. We suggest a duration of 15 minutes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Will there be any accreditation of prior learning for the level 3 physical intervention skills for close protection, or any fast-track training for existing trainers?</h3>
<p>Yes. If you have a level 3 ‘deliverers of physical intervention’ qualification (for Door Supervision) you will only need to take the Level 3 close protection physical intervention skills training. Your level 3 deliverers of physical intervention will be taken into account.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>What are you doing to prevent training malpractice?</h3>
<p>We have increased the amount of practical assessments for each learner in the new requirements (for example: observation of the use of communication devices, searching and physical intervention techniques). Practical assessments for each learner must be visually recorded.</p>
