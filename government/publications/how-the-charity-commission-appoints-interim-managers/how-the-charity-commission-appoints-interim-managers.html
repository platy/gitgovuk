<span class="number">1. </span> Definitions</h2>

<p>The Commission – the Charity Commission for England and Wales.</p>

<p>The Act – the Charities Act 2011.</p>

<p>Interim Manager – ‘IM’ – the Commission can, under section 76(3)(g) of the Act appoint an Interim Manager to act as a receiver and manager in respect of the property and affairs of a charity when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it has opened a statutory inquiry under section 46 of the Act, and</li>
  <li>it is satisfied either that there has been misconduct and/or mismanagement in the administration of a charity, or that it is necessary or desirable to protect the charity’s property</li>
</ul>

<p>The appointment may set out specific functions or specific tasks or may require  them to administer the charity to the exclusion of the charity trustees – <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/78" rel="external">section 78 (4)(a) and (b)</a> of the Act refer.</p>

<p>Misconduct – includes, but is not limited to, any act, (or failure to act), that the person committing it knew (or ought to have known) was criminal, unlawful or improper.</p>

<p>Mismanagement – includes, but is not limited to, any act, (or failure to act), that may result in charitable resources being misused, or the people who benefit from the charity to be put at risk. A charity’s reputation may be regarded as the property or resources of the charity.</p>

<p>Practitioner – an individual who applies to join the Commission’s list of approved practitioners from which we usually make an IM appointment.</p>

<p>The approved list - the Commission’s list of approved practitioners from which we usually make an IM appointment.</p>

<p>The Regulations - the Charities Receiver and Manager Regulations 1992.</p>

<p>The Code – this Practitioner and Interim Manager Code of Practice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This Code sets out the principles of conduct between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Commission and practitioners on the approved list</li>
  <li>the Commission and appointed IMs</li>
</ul>

<p>Practitioners must sign the Code before joining the approved list. By signing this Code, practitioners are confirming their agreement to its terms.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Code is to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>practitioners and IMs process information, including personal data, to an agreed standard and in accordance with the law</li>
  <li>IMs conduct themselves in accordance with the Regulations and that their work:
    <ul>
      <li>is proportionate in terms of potential loss to charity funds, harm to beneficiaries, and damage to the reputation of the charity or charities generally</li>
      <li>provides a sound basis to address and remedy the identified regulatory issues affecting a charity</li>
      <li>is practical, robust, and performed in a consistent manner</li>
      <li>delivers measurable outcomes that demonstrate value for money</li>
      <li>demonstrates due professional care</li>
      <li>complies fully with the Commission’s appointment Order and any subsequent variations of its terms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Status</h2>

<p>The appointment of an IM under the Act does not constitute a contract between the Commission and the IM, or the charity and the IM.</p>

<p>Individuals seeking appointment should be resident within England or Wales.</p>

<p>We will usually invite individuals from the approved practitioners list to tender for a specific IM appointment.</p>

<p>However approved status does not constitute any guarantee of appointment. On occasion, we may appoint an individual who is not on the list.</p>

<p>The appointment of an IM does not signal the end of the Commission’s statutory inquiry, which will remain open and progress in tandem with it.</p>

<p>The Commission cannot, except for some limited circumstances, legally exercise the functions of a charity trustee or be directly involved in the administration of a charity. However, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/78" rel="external">under section 78(3)</a> of the Act we have a statutory duty to supervise IMs to ensure that they satisfactorily discharge their functions as set out in the appointment Order.</p>

<p>Further information can be found in the Commission’s Operational Guidance Appointment of Interim Managers – OG5.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> The aim of an IM appointment</h2>

<p>The aim of an IM appointment is to help resolve specific regulatory issues affecting a charity by, for example, detecting, preventing, or disrupting misconduct and/or mismanagement.  As each charity subject to a statutory inquiry is different and has unique challenges, when setting out the functions of an IM appointment in an Order, we have flexibility to target the specific issues that need addressing.</p>

<p>We regularly review all IM appointments under section 76(6) of the Act. Following a review, we may amend their functions to reflect case developments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> The Commission’s supervision of IMs</h2>

<p>The Regulations authorise the Commission to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>require the IM to give evidence of their insurance to us</li>
  <li>decide the IM’s remuneration</li>
  <li>allow the IM to draw remuneration from the charity’s funds</li>
  <li>give notice where we are considering disallowing remuneration, removing the IM from office, or both, because the IM has failed to:
    <ul>
      <li>give evidence of their insurance in the manner required, or</li>
      <li>discharge satisfactorily any function imposed on them, including the submission of reports</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When we discharge an IM from a specific appointment for one of the above reasons, we will usually also remove that individual from our approved list. If we consider it appropriate, we may also remove their firm from the list.</p>

<p>Under the Regulations an IM must report to the Commission (see section 14.3). We use these reports to monitor and assess the effectiveness of individual appointments. We may also carry out an evaluation at the end of each IM appointment to make sure that any lessons learnt are taken on board.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Applying to join the list of approved practitioners</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> How to apply</h3>

<p>Applications to join the approved list can be made annually between 1-31 May. We will not consider applications received after the stated deadline unless exceptional circumstances can be evidenced, such as a change in an IM appointment.</p>

<p>We will accept a minimum of two and a maximum of four applicants per firm. Firms must have the authority to send us this third-party data and must ensure that all named applicants have read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/practitioner-and-interim-manager-privacy-notice">Commission’s Practitioner and Interim Manager Privacy Notice</a>. An IM appointment is a personal appointment of an individual practitioner, however, they may draw on their firm’s expertise and resources to support them.</p>

<p>Firms should submit their application in a covering email, with the following documents, each of which must be a separate attachment to enable us to manage data protection issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an overview of the firm and the additional required information, in a Word document of no more than eight pages (see section 6.2 and section 6.4)</li>
  <li>the completed application checklist - areas of expertise (see section 6.3)</li>
  <li>the practitioners’ applications - to include their CVs and biography, (maximum of two pages long each). There should be a separate attachment for each practitioner applying (See section 6.5 for details on what these should include)</li>
  <li>the complete Code of Practice individually signed by each practitioner applying</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> An overview of the firm</h3>

<p>This should include:</p>

<ul>

    <p>name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>telephone number</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>email and postal address</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>website link</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a summary of the firm’s field of work, experience and specialisms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>its size</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the reason the firm is willing to support the practitioners to be on the approved list</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Areas of expertise</h3>

<p>The circumstances where we are most likely to appoint an IM are set out below. Often an appointment will require an IM to have expertise in more than one of these areas. Those wanting to join the list of approved practitioners should complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1069468/IM_table.odt" rel="external">application checklist: areas of expertise</a>, indicating (with an ‘X’) their areas of specialism and whether they have the capacity to operate on a national, regional, or international level. The application should also evidence experience and expertise relevant to these categories.</p>

<h4>Legal, financial, and administrative expertise</h4>

<ul>
  <li>insolvency/dissolution/winding up and transferring business entities</li>
  <li>governance issues, including running board or committee elections, resolving internal disputes/managing conflicts of interest</li>
  <li>breaches of trust and recovery of charitable funds, if necessary, through legal proceedings</li>
  <li>financial management/ ensuring proper internal controls</li>
  <li>charity law expertise, including: trustee benefits; the public benefit requirement; self-dealing issues; compliance with disposal of charity property requirements and trustee duties and responsibilities</li>
</ul>

<h4>Specialist charity or sector experience, such as issues connected with:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>safeguarding issues, particularly in connection with children and at-risk beneficiaries</li>
  <li>delivery of humanitarian aid overseas, particularly in conflict zones</li>
  <li>care home expertise</li>
  <li>animal welfare</li>
</ul>

<h4>Trading and fundraising</h4>

<ul>
  <li>charitable and non-charitable trading issues (trading subsidiaries)/ improving complex group structures</li>
  <li>management of fundraising and control of associated costs</li>
  <li>managing investments/property portfolios</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other areas (not exclusive)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>accountancy, internal or external audit/ business planning/ advisory work to trustees/ risk management</li>
  <li>dealing with HMRC/Police and law enforcement agencies, particularly relating to financial mismanagement</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> Additional information</h3>

<h4>Case management</h4>

<p>Applications should explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the appointment supervision processes (such as case reviews) and how necessary corrective action would be identified and promptly acted on</li>
  <li>how conflicts of interest would be identified and managed</li>
  <li>how effective cover would be provided for IM appointments should individuals working on a case be unexpectedly absent</li>
</ul>

<h4>Staff management</h4>
<p>Applications should explain how anyone appointed as an IM would monitor and supervise any other staff at the firm who are supporting them in their appointment. They must ensure that these individuals have ready access to appropriate information in relation to an IM appointment, and that they receive timely updates about any relevant changes in regulatory policy, practice and the law as required.</p>

<h4>Fee and discount structures</h4>

<p>We acknowledge that certain professional service providers, for example legal and accountancy firms, typically calculate fees based on the time spent by the individual working on the case. However, we expect IMs to work to pre-planned and approved budgets, even if assessed on total hours worked. Details of fee structures for an individual IM appointment are discussed during the tender process.</p>

<p>Applicants to the approved list should therefore indicate the charging bands and discount structures that they would apply to hourly rates, based on seniority and specialism.</p>

<h4>Office management</h4>
<p>Applicants must be able to deal with business electronically, on secure systems, and use only the firm’s email when communicating via email.</p>

<p>Comprehensive procedures must be in place to ensure proper standards of document management. Applicants should explain how they would identify all documents relating to IM work and how they would ensure that these are properly stored and readily accessible.</p>

<p>Applicants must have a system in place to ensure that time-recording and billing would be attributed accurately and should describe how this would be verified.</p>

<h4>Data handling</h4>
<p>Applicants should explain how they would process data, and in particular, sensitive, special category, or criminal conviction and offences data, in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulations (‘GDPR’) and the law. This should include as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the technical and organisational measures in place to safeguard personal data</li>
  <li>how compliance with the principles of the UK GDPR (Article 5) will be achieved</li>
  <li>a description of the training undertaken by staff who will be processing personal data</li>
  <li>what provisions exist to comply with data subject rights and how data incidents that threaten to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data will be managed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Complaints procedure</h4>

<p>Applicants should summarise their complaints procedure and confirm that this is publicly available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> Firms’ named applicants’ information</h3>

<h4>Contact details</h4>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>job title</li>
  <li>telephone number</li>
  <li>email</li>
</ul>

<h4>Suitability</h4>

<p>A CV and biography summarising the applicants’ overall capability and suitability. This should include applicants’ relevant experience; qualifications; expertise; specialisms, and management and supervision capability, with specific supporting examples and evidence. It should also state if they have previously held an IM appointment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>  The assessment process to join the approved list</h2>

<p>We form an assessment panel to review applications to join the approved list. This comprises Commission senior managers and a Commission lawyer.</p>

  <li>experience of assignment or project-based work</li>
  <li>professional qualifications and/or recognition of expertise, including relevant awards or publications</li>
  <li>any other relevant indicators</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Requirements for firms in the event of a merger or practitioner change</h2>

<p>Approved practitioners have a responsibility to inform us, via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:IMrosterenquiries@charitycommission.gov.uk">IMrosterenquiries@charitycommission.gov.uk</a>, if their firm merges with another firm. If the practitioners want to remain on the approved list and the new firm supports this, they can continue to do so until the next annual application window, when the firm will need to submit a fresh application to the Commission. This also applies if there is a current IM appointment at the time of the merger, in which case the IM should immediately inform the relevant Commission case officer.</p>

<p>An approved practitioner should inform us if they leave the firm or want to be removed from the approved list. If as a result, the firm’s number of approved practitioners falls below the minimum requirement of two, and the firm wants to continue to have practitioners on the approved list, then it should apply for at least one additional practitioner to join. This should be done during the annual application window.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Exclusion from the approved list</h2>

<p>We retain the right to exclude a practitioner, now or at a later date, if there is evidence of criminal convictions; professional negligence, or misconduct; bankruptcy; or issues in connection with the reputation or standing of the practitioner, which if known, may impact adversely on public trust and confidence in the sector and/or us as a regulator.</p>

<p>We also retain the right to discharge an appointed IM if they fail to perform adequately, including in accordance with the Code and/or the Regulations. We may also take the decision, either during or after an appointment, to remove them and/or the firm from the approved list.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Confidentiality and Privacy</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Privacy and the right to be informed</h3>

<p>We will treat all commercially sensitive information provided by and relating to applicants, practitioners on the approved list, and appointed IMs, in strict commercial confidence. We will process the personal data of practitioners in accordance with UK data legislation. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission/about/personal-information-charter">general Privacy Notice</a> provides information about how the Commission processes personal data. This is supplemented by our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/practitioner-and-interim-manager-privacy-notice">Practitioner and Interim Manager Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Published information about individual appointments</h3>

<p>A charity’s entry on the public Register of Charities will be updated as and when appropriate, to show that we have appointed an IM. This:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provides the IM’s name and contact details</li>
  <li>links to our press statement, (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statements-on-live-cases-charity-commission">if published on our Website</a>), about the IM appointment. This also provides an IM’s name, firm and reason for appointment</li>
</ul>

<p>We remove this information from the charity’s Register entry at the end of the IM appointment and in its place, we usually link to our published ‘statement of results of the inquiry’. This published statement generally names the IM and includes a summary of the IM’s findings, fees and disbursements. It remains on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/inquiry-reports-charity-commission">Website for two years</a>, after which time it is archived and the Register link removed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Requirements of practitioners and appointed IMs</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span> Requirements of practitioners on the approved list</h3>

<p>Practitioners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>should inform us immediately if their contact information changes</li>
  <li>must sign the Code of Practice annually, and within one month of our request</li>
  <li>should respond promptly to our invitations to tender for a specific IM appointment by submitting case proposals. If this is not possible, they should give reasons for not doing so (for example, conflicts of interest or lack of capacity/availability to undertake work)</li>
  <li>must comply with their statutory obligations under the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 with respect to any case information that we provide as part of an invitation to express an interest or a tender exercise for a specific IM appointment. Wherever possible we will seek to minimise personal data, for example through redaction or anonymisation, and only include what is necessary for the purpose of the selection process</li>
  <li>must, if not appointed, immediately destroy, through secure means, any case information that we have provided as part of the invitation process and confirm this to us in writing</li>
  <li>must ensure that they maintain and adhere to any specific professional standards. They should inform us immediately if they:
    <ul>
      <li>are subject to regulatory action by their professional body or other public authority</li>
      <li>are convicted of a criminal offence</li>
      <li>become bankrupt</li>
      <li>are subject to any action which would impact on their ability to act as an IM. They are not required to disclose details of the regulatory action</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There may be occasional circumstances where a practitioner and the Commission become joint data controllers of a charity’s information. In this instance, a joint controller agreement will be agreed by each party in accordance with Article 26 of the UK GDPR.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span> Requirements of appointed IMs</h3>

<h4>12.2.1 Data protection</h4>

<p>In most circumstances, an IM will be a data controller in respect of the personal data they process that is held by the charity to which they have been appointed. IMs must comply with their statutory obligations as a data controller under the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 with respect to all case and charity information relating to the IM appointment.</p>

<p>IMs should maintain adequate records and information documenting their compliance with UK data protection legislation. They must also ensure that appropriate organisational and technical measures are in place to safeguard the personal data that they process during their appointment.</p>

<p>IMs must comply with legal and professional requirements concerning confidentiality and disclosure. Disclosures will include report requirements under the Terrorism Act 2000, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and the Money Laundering Regulations 2020.</p>

<p>Information obtained through an IM appointment should not be used for personal or commercial gain.</p>

<h4>12.2.2 General requirements</h4>

<p>IMs should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>demonstrate their integrity through honest and fair dealings with the charity community and all external contacts</li>
  <li>undertake not to receive (or agree to receive) or offer to give to any person, any gift or consideration as an inducement or reward for doing or not doing anything, or for showing favour or disfavour, in the discharge of their functions</li>
  <li>establish and maintain effective lines of communication with the Commission’s case officer</li>
  <li>provide concise written information and reports in a timely manner and meet deadlines</li>
  <li>give sufficient resource, time and commitment to the appointment and put in place contingency arrangements to ensure the continuity of work, including emergency cover for individuals’ unplanned absence</li>
  <li>where a charity relies wholly or in part on public donations, ensure that donors’ trust in the charity is not misplaced. Where possible keep donors informed, either on a collective or individual basis, regarding the current and future position of the charity</li>
  <li>inform us immediately if they or a person assisting them to carry out their IM appointment, is subject to regulatory action by their professional body or other public authority, or are convicted of a criminal offence, or become bankrupt, or are subject to any action which would impact on their ability to continue to act as an IM. They are not required to disclose details of the regulatory action</li>
</ul>

<p>When an IM appointment is discharged, if the charity wants to instruct the same approved practitioner to carry out additional services, this relationship will be managed by the contract between both parties, and the Commission will not be involved in any way. It will be the practitioner’s responsibility to ensure that any potential conflicts of interest are identified and managed.</p>

<p>Appointed IMs should be aware that they may be required to attend and give evidence to the First Tier Tribunal (Charity) or to the courts, either during their appointment, or after they have been discharged. Unless associated costs have been agreed by the Commission in advance, they will not be able to charge for this work.</p>

<h4>12.2.3 Conflicts of interest</h4>

<p>IMs and anyone involved in assisting them in their appointment should be sufficiently independent to perform the work impartially. Objectivity is presumed to be impaired, and a conflict of interest must be declared, when an individual or firm has within the last three years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acted as the auditor, reporting accountant, or independent examiner for the charity or any of its related parties</li>
  <li>been retained to act as a professional advisor or consultant to the charity or any of its related parties (for any purpose)</li>
  <li>been a connected person in respect of the charity, its assets or its trustees (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/118/enacted" rel="external">Section 118</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/188" rel="external">Section 188</a>  of the Act)</li>
</ul>

<p>Adequate records and checks should be in place to identify potential conflicts of interest before individuals are nominated for case appointments.</p>

<h4>12.2.4 Cases involving at-risk beneficiaries</h4>

<p>Certain cases involving children and at-risk beneficiaries will require checks of individuals through the Disclosure and Barring Service (‘DBS’).</p>

<p>Practitioners should be willing to obtain a DBS check appropriate to the role of the particular IM appointment (which will be set out in the scope of the appointment) and to disclose this to the Commission. The appointed IM should also ensure that appropriate DBS checks are obtained and disclosed to the Commission for those on their team, who because of the role they will be undertaking, are also eligible for a specific level of DBS check.</p>

<h4>12.2.5 Discrimination</h4>

<p>In performing their roles, IMs should respect the sensitivity, customs and diversity of a charity’s community and its representatives.</p>

<p>Appointed IMs must not engage in unfair discrimination on any basis proscribed by law. This includes not behaving in a way that is harassing or demeaning based on factors such as age; gender; gender identity; race; religion or belief; marriage and civil partnership; religion; sexual orientation; disability; pregnancy and maternity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>  Application process for IM appointments</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span> Invitation to tender</h3>

<p>When we have identified that a charity requires an IM appointment, we form an assessment panel comprising a selection of Commission staff to agree the scope of the appointment and to identify the skill set required. We take into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type of charity and the regulatory concerns</li>
  <li>the match of experience, qualifications, and expertise of practitioners</li>
  <li>the prevailing fee options, fee structure, and maximum fee rates</li>
  <li>regional/ national/ international considerations and needs</li>
  <li>timing and availability</li>
  <li>whether the appointment is to the exclusion of the trustees or for a specific task where the IM can work alongside the trustees</li>
  <li>past performance as an IM (where applicable)</li>
</ul>

<p>We will then usually invite a small number of approved practitioners to tender for the appointment. This may be after an initial expression of interest exercise. Our invitation will include general information about the charity, which might not, at this stage be identified, and our regulatory concerns.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span> Response to an invitation to tender for an IM appointment</h3>

<p>Practitioners who have been invited to tender for an IM appointment should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>detail their approach to the work and ability to achieve the Commission’s case specification within the given timeframe</li>
  <li>provide details of the lead nominated IM(s) and of individuals who would also conduct the work, including their respective roles</li>
  <li>provide a full costing proposal for the specified work which should represent good ‘value for money’ and where appropriate identify various possible exit strategies with costings for each</li>
  <li>confirm that potential conflicts of interest have been reviewed and that no conflict exists for the specified work</li>
  <li>provide, when requested, relevant DBS checks</li>
  <li>explain how, when required, they will obtain legal, accountancy, or other professional advice, including a breakdown of any additional costs anticipated. If this advice will be from an external firm, (which may not necessarily be on the Commission’s approved list), practitioners should include that firm’s estimated fees in the tender documentation. However, practitioners must obtain our prior approval before disclosing to any third parties the case information that we have provided. They and the third party must comply with the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 when processing the case information</li>
</ul>

<p>Practitioners tendering for appointments may then be invited to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and experience at Commission case selection interviews.</p>

<p>No individual should tender for, accept, or perform work that they are not competent, or do not have the time and capacity, to undertake.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.3 </span> Professional indemnity arrangements</h3>

<p>Approved practitioners should ensure that their firm has the appropriate insurance in place to indemnify a charity against loss by negligent administration or by misappropriation of funds.</p>

<p>Prior to any Order for an appointment, the practitioner should provide us with evidence of this insurance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span> Performance and supervision of IM appointments</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span> Obtaining instructions</h3>

<p>We will make the IM appointment by an Order under section 76(3)(g) of the Act. The Order will name the appointed individual(s) and set out the scope of the appointment and the functions to be discharged. We will send to the appointed IM a copy of the appointment Order; a Statement of Reasons (as required by section 86 of the Act); and a copy of the Regulations that govern IM appointments.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span> Commission undertakings</h3>

<p>We will supervise IM appointments by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing case information and updates in a timely manner</li>
  <li>conducting regular case reviews</li>
  <li>conducting formal reviews of the appointment Order as required by section 76(6) of the Act, and will inform the IM and charity of the outcome of the review</li>
  <li>assessing the impact of decisions in terms of the future of the charity</li>
  <li>considering reports provided by the IM</li>
  <li>maintaining open communications with the IM</li>
  <li>monitoring case outcomes</li>
  <li>holding a debrief with the IM at the end of the appointment</li>
</ul>

<p>We:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm that the IM is independent of the Commission and has a duty to form their own views</li>
  <li>may offer general advice based on our experience to inform the IM’s views</li>
  <li>may, on request by the IM, give advice or our opinion on any matter affecting the performance of their duties under section 78(5)(a) of the Act</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.3 </span> IM Reporting</h3>

<p>IMs must comply with the reporting requirements to the Commission relating to their appointment as set out in the Regulations. This includes submitting an initial report to the case officer within three months of the appointment, or a within a shorter period (usually one month) if considered appropriate by us. This report should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide an estimate of the total value of the property</li>
  <li>set out the strategy for discharging the functions (the ‘exit strategy’)</li>
  <li>incorporate information about the property and affairs (the ‘status report’)</li>
  <li>include particulars of any matters to be brought to the attention of the Commission case officer (the ‘highlight’ report)</li>
</ul>

<p>IMs should then provide monthly reports, to be submitted within 12 days of each month end, that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>update the status report and property value estimates (as necessary)</li>
  <li>include a monthly highlight report</li>
  <li>provide a statement of charity funds spent in the month on their appointment</li>
</ul>

<p>IMs should also attend regular progress review meetings with the case officer as required. Any substantive change to the IM’s exit strategy should also be discussed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.4 </span> IM fees</h3>

<p>The charging structure is split into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IM fees - these are the charges for discharging the role, including carrying out the functions set out in the appointment Order</li>
  <li>IM disbursements – this is the incidental expenditure incurred by the IM  when discharging the role (for example, travel costs)</li>
  <li>professional expenses - these are additional costs incurred to facilitate the discharge of the role, and usually conducted by professional third parties (e.g. lawyers and accountants) on behalf of the IM. These should be discussed and agreed with the Commission prior to incurring them. Routine office administrative costs (such as photocopying and postage) are considered a normal part of an IM’s overheads and will not be chargeable to the charity</li>
</ul>

<p>Some appointments might attract a fixed or capped fee, or a fee which is a fixed percentage of the value of funds recovered on the charity’s behalf.</p>

<p>Others may be on a ‘no win/ no fee’ arrangement. This may be used where there is anticipated litigation to recover charity money, and we appoint an IM on the basis that they will receive payment only if the anticipated litigation is successful. This type of fee arrangement is typically used when the charity cannot meet the cost of the appointment. In the event of success, it is likely that the IM would receive an enhanced fee in recognition of the inherent risks of a no win/ no fee arrangement.</p>

<p>IMs must obtain our prior written approval before increasing the maximum fee rate, for example, if the scope of the appointment needs to be expanded, or if they want to change the fee structure. Fee rates must not be adjusted retrospectively.</p>

<p>IM billing information should contain enough detail and be presented in such a way that fees, expenses and disbursements can be verified against the original cost proposal.</p>

<p>Remuneration may be paid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as a staged progression of the appointment</li>
  <li>upon completion of a specific action</li>
  <li>upon formal discharge of the appointment</li>
</ul>

<p>Our assessment of an IM’s remuneration will form part of our on-going case monitoring and scheduled case reviews. We may disallow remuneration under the Regulations if an IM has failed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give us evidence of their insurance in the manner specified</li>
  <li>discharge satisfactorily any function imposed on them, including the submission of reports</li>
</ul>

<p>IM appointments can be appealed to the Tribunal and can be quashed. If the Tribunal quashes the Order, the IM will be paid for fees/costs incurred for work carried out during the appointment in accordance with Regulation 3 of The Charities (Receiver and Manager) Regulations 1992.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.5 </span> Dealing with complaints</h3>

<p>An IM and the Commission both agree to acknowledge, record and disseminate any complaints resulting from the IM appointment, and commit to a timetable for response in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission/about/complaints-procedure">Commission’s complaints handling procedures</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.6 </span> Debriefing</h3>

<p>We may hold a debriefing meeting with an IM after we discharge them. The purpose of this is to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the impact of the appointment, including reviewing the case outcomes against the exit strategy</li>
  <li>the IM’s use of resources, timeliness, and performance</li>
  <li>challenges encountered and lessons learnt</li>
  <li>opportunities for continuous improvement in the IM process to inform our policy and practice</li>
</ul>
