<h2>About the On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme</h2>

<p>Our vision is to have one of the best electric vehicle (<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>) infrastructure networks in the world. This means a network for current and prospective <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> drivers that is affordable, reliable, accessible and secure.</p>

<p>Local authorities have a crucial role to play in enabling the transition to EVs in their areas, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proactively supporting and delivering the rollout of electric vehicle chargepoints</li>
  <li>helping to ensure the transition is integrated into wider local transport and community needs</li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities across the United Kingdom are invited to <a class="govuk-link" href="#application-process-and-anticipated-timetable">submit applications to the On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (<abbr title="On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme">ORCS</abbr>)</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-local-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-levi-pilot-funding">£10 million local <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> Infrastructure fund pilot</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of the scheme is to increase the availability of on-street chargepoints in residential streets where off-street parking is not available, thereby ensuring that on-street parking is not a barrier to realising the benefits of owning an <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>.</p>

<p>The scheme gives local authorities access to grant funding that can be used to part-fund the procurement and installation of on-street <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint infrastructure for residential needs, in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="#minimum-technical-specs">minimum technical specifications</a>. We encourage local authorities to apply for and take advantage of this funding, while it is available, to help prepare for and support the transition towards zero-emission vehicles.</p>

<p>As demand for on-street charging infrastructure grows, we expect the private sector to invest more to build and operate a thriving, self-sustaining public network. It is essential that local authorities facilitate commercial models being put in place to ensure networks can continue to expand and improve, to serve residents needs. Local authorities are encouraged to explore all commercial options available to them when planning <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> infrastructure.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-help-for-local-authorities">Greater information and guidance on the rollout of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging infrastructure</a> is available.</p>

<h3>The role of our support body</h3>

<p>Energy Saving Trust, Cenex and PA Consulting are administering this scheme on our behalf.</p>

<p>The support body can provide free, impartial advice and guidance to local authorities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>throughout the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on the preparation of an eligible and successful <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/transport/local-authorities/street-residential-chargepoint-scheme" rel="external">On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme</a> application</li>
  <li>throughout the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on best practice and technological options for chargepoint installations</li>
  <li>in England on developing an <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint strategy through Energy Saving Trust’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/service/local-government-support-programme/" rel="external">Local Government Support Programme</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes made to this guidance for the 2022 to 2023 financial year</h3>

<p>Amendments have been made to the scheme to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure more local authorities benefit from the funding</li>
  <li>improve the consumer experience of charging</li>
  <li>allow for chargepoint installations on more types of suitable land</li>
</ul>

<p>The changes are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To reflect market developments and to ensure funding is available for more projects, the scheme will now provide up to a maximum of 60% of project <a class="govuk-link" href="#cost-eligible">capital costs</a>. We anticipate that many projects will require less than 60% public funding, particularly in areas of high <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> uptake where commercial investment is more viable. Applications, both draft and final, submitted to Energy Saving Trust prior to 1 April 2022 are eligible for funding up to the previous level of 75%.</li>
  <li>All chargepoints installed through this scheme must have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#minimum-payment-method">minimum payment method</a>, such as contactless, as we are working to make <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging as accessible as possible. This requirement will apply to all applications approved after the date that regulations mandating the minimum payment method for chargepoints above 7.1 <abbr title="kilowatts">kW</abbr> are laid in Parliament (currently scheduled for later in 2022).</li>
  <li>Chargepoints may be installed on land not owned by a local authority. It is hoped this is particularly beneficial for rural local authorities, where community-owned land (for example, a village hall car park) is often well suited to providing charging infrastructure. This will be considered on a discretionary basis where it can be demonstrated that a lack of suitable local authority land poses a barrier to the installation of residential chargepoints.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Funding and eligibility</h2>

<h3>Funding available</h3>

<p>We have allocated £20 million of funding in 2022 to 2023 for the scheme. This funding is available to local authorities for <a class="govuk-link" href="#who-apply">eligible projects</a> as specified.</p>

<p>Funding is for up to 60% of&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="#cost-eligible">eligible capital costs</a>. We expect many projects to require less funding. Total funding provided will not exceed £7,500 per chargepoint unless electrical connection costs are exceptionally high. In these cases, funding up to £13,000 per chargepoint may be provided.</p>

<p>Any applications, draft or final, received by Energy Saving Trust prior to 1 April 2022 will be eligible for funding at the previous level of up to 75% of the capital costs.</p>

<p>There is no strict maximum or minimum project size.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cap the amount that will be funded in any one project to ensure funds are available to as many authorities as possible</li>
  <li>offer funding below the amount requested</li>
  <li>refuse to provide any funding where we consider the proposals entail unacceptable risk, offer poor value for money or are viewed to be undeliverable in the proposed project timescales</li>
  <li>require any funds awarded towards the project to be returned, in the unlikely event that a project is not completed</li>
  <li>terminate or change the grant scheme at any time. In these cases, we will aim to provide 4 weeks’ notice</li>
  <li>stop considering applications for chargepoints located in car parks at any point</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional funding beyond the £20 million for this financial year and for subsequent financial years is not guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Remaining capital costs</h3>

<p>The residential <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging market is developing quickly. Many chargepoint operators are now willing to invest capital into local authority projects, provided terms are offered that will allow investment to be recovered over time. Before completing an application to the scheme, market testing is recommended to understand the level of public funding required for your project.</p>

<p>Our support body is well placed to advise on attracting investment into chargepoint projects.</p>

<p>The remaining costs can also come from local authority budget, if, for example, the local authority is going to own and operate the infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Who can apply</h3>

<p>Applicants must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/contents" rel="external">relevant local authority or authorities</a> within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have the explicit support of the relevant highway authority (or landowner) with responsibility for maintenance of the areas where the chargepoints are to be located</li>
  <li>inform us of any other funding received for <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging infrastructure, for example, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/lessons-learned-from-the-go-ultra-low-cities-scheme/" rel="external">Go Ultra Low Cities Scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>agree, once funding is accepted, that the sites of the proposed chargepoints must not change without permission from us – <a class="govuk-link" href="#change-location-site">information on altering chargepoint location is available</a>
</li>
  <li>be able to complete projects by 31 March 2024</li>
</ul>

<p>Where projects span multiple local authorities the application must be made by an allocated ‘lead’ authority.</p>

<h3>How we allocate funding</h3>

<p>We will assess the relative merits of applications against <a class="govuk-link" href="#application-criteria">our application criteria</a>.</p>

<p>This scheme is demand-led and we reserve the right to prioritise applications that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are installing infrastructure in areas with particular air quality challenges (where this is made clear within the application)</li>
  <li>have not received <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/lessons-learned-from-the-go-ultra-low-cities-scheme/" rel="external">Go Ultra Low Cities Scheme</a> or other sources of funding for on-street residential infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costs eligible for funding</h3>

<p>Capital funding will be provided for the installation of the chargepoints. The capital items that are eligible for claim are limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the purchase cost of the chargepoint up to 22 <abbr title="kilowatts">kW</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the purchase cost of electrical components related to the chargepoint, including distribution network operator (<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>) connection costs</li>
  <li>the cost of civil engineering works related to the installation</li>
  <li>labour costs of the installation</li>
  <li>hardware costs of the installation</li>
  <li>where applicable, the capital costs of a parking bay and traffic regulation orders (<abbr title="traffic regulation orders">TROs</abbr>) (paint and signage)</li>
</ul>

<p>This scheme does not cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non-capital costs</li>
  <li>the upgrade or maintenance of existing chargepoints</li>
  <li>the installation of passive charging infrastructure</li>
  <li>the installation of chargepoints for the primary use of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> car clubs, taxi fleets or other commercial undertakings, given the residential focus of the scheme</li>
  <li>the installation of chargepoints connected to an individual’s domestic electricity supply</li>
</ul>

<h3>Car park-based projects</h3>

<p>The scheme is primarily focused on the installation of chargepoints in on-street locations. However,&nbsp;we&nbsp;recognise the pressures that may be faced by local authorities when allocating parking spaces for EVs on residential streets.</p>

<p>Therefore,&nbsp;we will consider applications for chargepoints situated in car parks owned by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the local authority</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>another group, where long term leasing agreements are in place between the landowner and the local authority (for example, village hall associations). This will be considered on a discretionary basis where it can be demonstrated that a lack of suitable local authority land poses a barrier to the installation of residential chargepoints</li>
</ul>

<p>Such applications will be assessed against the <a class="govuk-link" href="#application-criteria">application criteria detailed</a>.</p>

<h2>Application criteria</h2>

<p>All the following criteria must be met and evidenced as part of your application.</p>

<p>1. Applications must be made for one or more chargepoints, up to 22 <abbr title="kilowatts">kW</abbr>.</p>

<p>2. The chargepoints will be located in residential areas, this may, for example, be demonstrated by providing maps indicating the relevant use classes of the surrounding buildings. Where areas include a mixture of residential and commercial buildings local authorities must be satisfied that the chargepoints will be used primarily to meet the needs of local residents.</p>

<p>The scheme does not support chargepoints intended to be used primarily by commuters or visitors to destination-style locations such as shopping centres.</p>

<p>3. The proposed location or locations must lack off-street parking. For example, this can be done through provision of photographs or maps.</p>

<p>4. The location or locations will meet current or anticipated future demand. For example, a record of the multiple requests for charging infrastructure from local residents wishing to purchase plug-in vehicles or strategic plans to promote <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> ownership in a particular area.</p>

<p>5. The chargepoints will be accessible to local residents. The local authority must be satisfied that any plans will ensure local residents will be able to access the chargepoints.</p>

<p>This may be via resident parking schemes or permits to ensure that local residents are assured that they will be able to charge their vehicles on a regular basis.</p>

<p>6. The chargepoints must be available for use on a 24/7 basis. Arranging a dedicated parking bay in residential streets is not required, but we would strongly encourage local authorities to consider it, especially in locations where residents who own a plug-in vehicle may have problems accessing the point due to parking congestion.</p>

<p>Dedicated <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> bays would require a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.britishparking.co.uk/write/Documents/TIR%20Board/BPA_TRO_Best_Practice_Guide_2019.pdf" rel="external">traffic regulation order (<abbr title="traffic regulation order">TRO</abbr>)</a> that could restrict access to EVs only. If you wish to claim any of the capital costs for the <abbr title="traffic regulation order">TRO</abbr>, you must wait for it to be completed before making your final claim.</p>

<p>You must commit to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keeping usage under review</li>
  <li>consider restricting access to EVs only, for some or all the time, if residents are struggling to access the chargepoints</li>
</ul>

<p>7. The chargepoints must adhere to <a class="govuk-link" href="#minimum-technical-specs">our technical specifications</a>.</p>

<p>8. From later in 2022, the chargepoints must have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#minimum-payment-method">minimum payment method</a>, such as contactless.</p>

<p>9. Must <a class="govuk-link" href="#procurement-rules">adhere to procurement rules and value-for-money considerations</a>.</p>

<p>10. Provide details of <a class="govuk-link" href="#expected-operating-arrangements">operating arrangements</a>.</p>

<p>11. The <a class="govuk-link" href="#timescales">project being completed within reasonable timescales</a>.</p>

<p>12. <a class="govuk-link" href="#ongoing-commitments">Meet ongoing commitments</a>.</p>

<p>13. For <a class="govuk-link" href="#car-parks">car park installations additional requirements exist</a>.</p>

<h3>Procurement rules and value-for-money considerations</h3>

<p>Demonstrating that you have considered value for money is crucial. Costs and the way that you plan to engage the market will be scrutinised.</p>

<p>Full evidence will be required in the form of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>quotes including <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr> quotes</li>
  <li>cost breakdowns</li>
  <li>evidence of discussions with suppliers</li>
  <li>invoices (if available)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is our view that double-headed chargepoints, capable of charging 2 vehicles at once, should be installed wherever possible to maximise value for money.</p>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring that your projects comply with procurement and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities/technical-guidance-on-the-uks-international-subsidy-control-commitments">subsidy control rules</a>.</p>

<p>Procurement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>timelines should be considered before submitting an application, and details should be outlined within the application</li>
  <li>of any third party should not involve any exclusivity arrangements for infrastructure provision in the wider local authority area</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:onstreetchargepoints@est.org.uk">Our support body can provide advice on engaging the market and procurement best practice</a>.</p>

<h3>Minimum payment method</h3>

<p>Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-consumer-experience-at-public-electric-vehicle-chargepoints">response to the consumer experience at public electric vehicle chargepoints</a>, announced with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-strategy"><abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> Infrastructure Strategy</a>, includes mandating a minimum payment method (a non-proprietary, non-phone payment method, such as contactless) for all new chargepoints at or above 7.1 <abbr title="kilowatts">kW</abbr>.</p>

<p>We have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1062271/government-response-to-the-2021-consultation-on-consumer-experience-at_public-chargepoints.pdf#page=19" rel="external">subsequently announced our intention to consult on similar requirements for chargepoints below 7.1 <abbr title="kilowatts">kW</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The regulations mandating a minimum payment method will be laid in Parliament later in 2022 and come into effect about 3 months later. From the date the regulations are laid, we will require that all chargepoints installed through <abbr title="On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme">ORCS</abbr> (including those below 7.1 <abbr title="kilowatts">kW</abbr>) have a minimum payment method such as contactless.</p>

<p>This means that for any new <abbr title="On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme">ORCS</abbr> applications approved after this date, the proposed chargepoints must have a minimum payment method, such as contactless.</p>

<p><abbr title="On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme">ORCS</abbr> applications for the installation of 7.1 <abbr title="kilowatts">kW</abbr> chargepoints and above without a minimum payment method that are approved before this date will be subject to the regulatory requirements, unless they are installed before the regulations come into effect</p>

<h3>Provide details of expected operating arrangements</h3>

<p>We require grant recipients to report on the arrangements put in place between the local authority, <abbr title="chargepoint operator">CPO</abbr> and end user. This includes reporting on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type of operating model which will be used for the infrastructure (for example, is there a concession agreement in place?)</li>
  <li>how much drivers will be charged to use the infrastructure</li>
  <li>any agreed revenue shares between local authority and <abbr title="chargepoint operator">CPO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the ownership of the assets, both above ground and below ground</li>
</ul>

<p>Applicants are required to provide information to the best of their ability at application, and agree to provide this information in full upon project completion, as part of the claims process.</p>

<h3>The project must be completed in reasonable timescales</h3>

<p>Projects must be completed by the 31 March 2024, and should take between 6 to 12 months from making an application to installing the chargepoints. Local authorities will be challenged on their timescales to ensure robust delivery plans.</p>

<p>Delivery plans must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a high-level project or programme plan providing timescales and milestones, project dependencies and their impact on deliverability</li>
  <li>a Gantt chart</li>
  <li>a risk register</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think a project will take longer than 6 to 12 months, provide rationale for this in your application.</p>

<h3>Meeting ongoing commitments</h3>

<p>It is a condition of the funding that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any chargepoint must be maintained in a serviceable condition and accessible for 7 years from the date of installation</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#data">usage data</a> is made available to the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>) directly from the chargepoints or <abbr title="chargepoint operator">CPO</abbr> systems for at least 3 years, you must ensure that your delivery partners can supply this information</li>
</ul>

<p>We require grant recipients to report on the arrangements put in place between the local authority, <abbr title="chargepoint operator">CPO</abbr> and end user as per <a class="govuk-link" href="#expected-operating-arrangements">expected operating arrangements</a>.</p>

<p>You must also ensure <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> and our support body are kept informed of changes of lead staff.</p>

<p>For audit purposes, participating local authorities must retain the following for a period of 6 years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence that a chargepoint was appropriately procured</li>
  <li>a record of expenditure funded partly or wholly by the grant and all income generated by the project</li>
</ul>

<p>You will make this information available at any reasonable time for inspection by officials from us or by the comptroller and Auditor General (or their representatives).</p>

<h3>Chargepoints installed in car parks</h3>

<p>For installing chargepoints in locally owned car parks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you must explain or show why they are not being installed in residential streets</li>
  <li>you must either own the car park, or have a long-term lease arrangement in place for chargepoints to be installed in the car park</li>
  <li>they must be accessible on a 24/7 basis</li>
  <li>local residents must be able to access the car parks for free overnight between 6pm and 8am</li>
  <li>each chargepoint must have its own dedicated <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> bay enforced by a <abbr title="traffic regulation order">TRO</abbr>

<p>In this situation you will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commit to keeping usage under review and consider restricting access to local residents for some or all the time if residents are struggling to access them</li>
  <li>produce a communications strategy that raises awareness of chargepoints to local residents</li>
</ul>

<h2>Application process and anticipated timetable</h2>

<p>The application process is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:onstreetchargepoints@est.org.uk">our support body</a> to discuss your application needs.</li>
  <li>After discussion <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1065185/orcs-application-form.odt" rel="external">complete the application form</a>.</li>
  <li>Send application by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:onstreetchargepoints@est.org.uk">onstreetchargepoints@est.org.uk</a>.</li>

<h3>Our decision</h3>

<p>If your application is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accepted you will receive a grant offer letter from us</li>
  <li>rejected we will explain the reasons for this decision allowing you the opportunity to amend your application and reapply</li>
</ul>

<h3>Delivery phase and payment</h3>

<p>Upon acceptance, we will pay 75% of the grant within around 25 working days.</p>

<p>The remaining 25% of the grant will be paid in arrears upon completion of the project, which you can claim by once again contacting our support body, which will supply the appropriate guidance and grant claim form.</p>

<p>The grant claim form requires you to provide an itemised breakdown of capital costs, including invoices obtained from chargepoint operators, installers and the <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>, of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Chargepoint hardware costs – this includes the cost of the chargepoint units and any associated hardware (such as guard rails or barriers).</li>
  <li>Labour and installation costs – this includes the costs associated with installing the hardware and civil engineering.</li>
  <li>Electrical connection costs and associated labour – this includes the <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr> cost, the labour involved in installing an electrical connection and associated civil engineering work (such as trenching).</li>
</ol>

<p>Chargepoints must be added to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-and-use-data-on-public-electric-vehicle-chargepoints">National Chargepoint Registry (<abbr title="National Chargepoint Registry">NCR</abbr>)</a>, which is an open resource listing publicly accessible chargepoints in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> designed for use by website and smartphone app developers, as well as satellite navigation system (sat nav) manufacturers.</p>

<p>The relevant field on the <abbr title="National Chargepoint Registry">NCR</abbr> must also be populated to inform users when the chargepoint is restricted to residents or subject to parking restrictions, such as ‘residents only’ parking zones or time limits.</p>

<p>If, for unexpected reasons, you do not spend your full grant amount, any unspent funds must be sent back to us.</p>

<h4>Changing chargepoint locations</h4>

<p>To obtain permission for a chargepoint or chargepoints site change, you must submit to our support body as soon as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the new site location or locations</li>
  <li>parking details</li>
  <li>photographs</li>
  <li>maps</li>
  <li>evidence of demand</li>
  <li>the reason or reasons for the site change or changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Site change requires our explicit approval for any grant funding to be paid with the new location required to meet all of the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="#application-criteria">conditions of the grant</a>.</p>

<h3>Help with wider responsibilities of property owners and managers</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" rel="external">Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005</a> requires property managers and owners to assess potential fire risks and put in place adequate and proportionate fire protection measures to mitigate against the risk to life from fire and then maintain them. This should be updated when installing <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints.</p>

<p>We are producing guidance to aid this assessment for electric vehicle fires. This will identify mitigations and measures that can be taken when installing electric vehicle chargepoints in enclosed car parks. As such, it will help building owners meet their existing duties under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.</p>

<h4>Location</h4>

<p>When installed in an outdoor location, the charging equipment must meet at least the most onerous <abbr title="ingress protection">IP</abbr> and <abbr title="impact protection">IK</abbr> ratings set out in BS EN 61851-1:2019 and the relevant parts of BS 7671:2018.</p>

<h2>Usage data requirements</h2>

<p>This section sets out <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>’s chargepoint usage data requirements.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the local authority to ensure that a process is in place to deliver the required utilisation data in the correct format to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> and that their <abbr title="chargepoint operator">CPO</abbr> is capable of doing so.</p>

<h3>Data fields</h3>

<p>On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme grant recipients are required to make appropriate arrangements with CPOs to collect and submit data on each charging event under each of the following data headings for all their grant-funded chargepoints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chargepoint <abbr title="identifier">ID</abbr>
</li>
  <li>plug in date and time</li>
  <li>unplug date and time</li>
  <li>charge start date and time</li>
  <li>charge end date and time</li>
  <li>total energy drawn (<abbr title="kilowatt hours">kWh</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The definition of each data field can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#data-field-definitions">Data field definitions</a></p>

<p>It is expected all data points will be recorded at up to 95% accuracy. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will accept data supplied from units that record energy consumption at intervals of up to a maximum of 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>Process of providing data to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You must provide the data on a quarterly basis directly to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:chargepoint.grants@ozev.gov.uk">chargepoint.grants@ozev.gov.uk</a>. For monitoring purposes, please also copy <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:onstreetchargepoints@est.org.uk">onstreetchargepoints@est.org.uk</a> into the email.</p>

<h4>How to format your data</h4>

<p>Data should be reported to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> in .csv format as exemplified in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#data-template">Data reporting template</a>.</p>

<p>To help <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> log and amalgamate the data efficiently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the subject header for emailed submissions must be in the following format: ‘YYMMDD – On-Street CP usage data – Chargepoint operator name – Local authority’</li>
  <li>the .csv file containing the data should be named using the following format: ‘YYMMDD – On-Street CP usage data – Chargepoint operator name – Local authority’</li>
  <li>all data should be consolidated within one tab of the spreadsheet and not across multiple tabs</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> expects local authorities to arrange for the data to be submitted in the required format automatically, without requiring a person to access and draw down the data. This is to ensure that the data is reliably received without prompting. CPOs should work with applicants to enable this.</p>

<h4>When to submit data to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Submission should be provided on the following dates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 April – data submitted for January to March</li>
  <li>1 July – data submitted for April to June</li>
  <li>1 October – data submitted for July to September</li>
  <li>1 January – data submitted for October to December</li>
</ul>

<p>Data should be provided to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> for 3 years, starting on the date the chargepoint became operational.</p>

<p>In order for the usage data to be utilised, it is important that <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> receives data in full on the relevant due dates. If the data is incomplete, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> is unable to identify trends, develop insights and evaluate policy.</p>

<p>Should data be incomplete, or fail to be submitted as per the schedule above, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to require repayment of funding from the grant recipient.</p>
