<h2>DRCF Terms of Reference (ToR)</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum (DRCF) brings together 4 UK regulators tasked with regulating digital services to collectively drive greater regulatory co-operation and deliver coherent approaches to digital regulation.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<h4>Statement of ambition</h4>

<p>The DRCF aims to support cooperation and coordination between member regulators on digital regulatory matters. By enabling coherent, informed and responsive regulation of the UK digital economy we can serve citizens and consumers better, reduce regulatory burdens for industry where appropriate, and enhance the global impact and position of the UK.</p>

<h2>Goals and objectives</h2>

<h4>Goals</h4>

<p>The goals of the DRCF are threefold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to promote greater coherence, so that where regulatory regimes intersect the DRCF helps to resolve potential tensions, offering clarity for people and industry;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to work collaboratively on areas of common interest and jointly address complex problems; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to work together to build the necessary capabilities, learning from what each regulator is doing and striving to be best in class, both now and in the future.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Objectives</h4>

<p>The objectives of the DRCF include:</p>

<p>Objective 1: Promote coherent regulatory policy making, using the collective expertise of its member regulators to explore and respond to policy challenges in the digital space.</p>

<p>Objective 2: Collaborate to ensure that regulation and other enforcement tools applied to the digital landscape are implemented by its member regulators in a coherent way.</p>

<p>Objective 3: Enhance regulatory capabilities by pooling knowledge and resources to ensure that its member regulators have the skills, expertise and tools needed to carry out their functions effectively in digital markets.</p>

<p>Objective 4: Anticipate future developments by developing a shared understanding of emerging digital trends, to enhance regulator effectiveness and inform strategy.</p>

<p>Objective 5: Promote innovation by sharing knowledge and experience, including regarding innovation in the approaches of regulators.</p>

<p>Objective 6: Strengthen international engagement with regulatory bodies to exchange information and share best practice regarding approaches to the regulation of digital markets.</p>

<h3>Status and accountability</h3>

<p>The DRCF is a voluntary cooperation forum that facilitates engagement between regulators on digital policy areas of mutual interest.</p>

<p>It is not a statutory or incorporated entity and does not provide formal advice or direction to member regulators, who remain individually accountable for the delivery of their functions.</p>

<h3>Membership</h3>

<h4>Founding membership</h4>

<p>The DRCF was established by the CMA, ICO and Ofcom in June 2020, with the FCA becoming a full member in April 2021.</p>

<h4>Eligibility for membership</h4>

<p>Membership is open to&nbsp;independent public sector bodies with statutory powers for regulating digital services,&nbsp;where these have significant intersection with those of DRCF member regulators.</p>

<p>Where this eligibility criterion is met, membership is at the discretion of the existing member regulators, having regard to the likely net benefit in&nbsp;respect of delivery of the&nbsp;goals and objectives of the DRCF.&nbsp;Decisions on membership require unanimous agreement from member regulators.</p>

<p>Member regulators will revisit&nbsp;membership decisions on an annual basis.</p>
