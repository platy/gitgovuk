<h2>Instruction</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>1. This detention services order (DSO) provides information for all staff and suppliers on the process for dealing with <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> offenders in immigration detention in England and Wales.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> is a set of arrangements which provides a common framework for the identification, assessment and management of certain offenders <b>in the community</b>. For those convicted in England and Wales <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/multi-agency-public-protection-arrangements-mappa--2">the <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> Guidance</a> sets out a list of the relevant sexual and violent offences.</p>

<p>3. This DSO clarifies the procedures to be adopted by all immigration removal centres (<abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>) that receive time served foreign national offenders (<abbr title="time served foreign national offenders">TSFNOs</abbr>) from the Prison Service who have been convicted of offences which bring them into <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>4. Two different Home Office teams operate in <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detention and Escorting Services Compliance team (Compliance team)</li>
  <li>Immigration Enforcement Detention Engagement team (<abbr title="detention engagement team">DET</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Compliance team are responsible for all on-site commercial and contract monitoring work. The DETs interact with detainees face-to-face on behalf of responsible officers within the detention centres. They focus on communicating and engaging with people detained at <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>, helping them to understand their cases and detention. DETs are managed by an on-site Home Office <abbr title="detention engagement team">DET</abbr> manager.</p>

<p>There are no DETs at residential STHFs, functions which are the responsibility of the <abbr title="detention engagement team">DET</abbr> in RSTHFs are carried out by the Detainee Monitoring and Population Management unit (<abbr title="detainee monitoring and population management unit">DEPMU</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>5. The purpose of this order is to ensure that all <abbr title="time served foreign national offenders">TSFNOs</abbr> subject to <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> who are transferred to the detention estate are located appropriately and are only released into the community when the appropriate arrangements are in place for such release and not before.</p>

<h3>Procedures</h3>

<p>6. Any foreign national offender (FNO) who is imprisoned for an offence which brings them into <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> should be flagged as a <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> “nominal” on the Prison-NOMIS system. However, being identified as a <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> nominal does not indicate the risk of serious harm that the offender poses, or the <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> level at which the offender will be managed if released into the community. There are three categories of <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> offender, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<b>Category 1</b>: sexual offenders subject to notification requirements (often called registered sex offenders).</li>
  <li>
<b>Category 2</b>: violent offenders who have been sentenced to 12 months or more in custody or a hospital or guardianship order. This category also includes some sexual offenders who do not qualify for category 1.</li>
  <li>
<b>Category 3</b>: other dangerous offenders - who have been cautioned for/or convicted of an offence which indicates that he or she is capable of causing serious harm AND which requires multi-agency management.</li>
</ul>

<p>7. The process for the management of <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> offenders being released from prison under the supervision of Community Offender Managers is set out in the <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> Guidance. A <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> offender will have an identified Offender Manager who will assess the level of <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> management the offender requires prior to the offender’s earliest possible release date from prison. This level of management will continue to apply when the TSFNO is transferred to the detention estate, with the Offender Manager remaining responsible for the case until the licence expires. The 3 levels of management for dealing with <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> offenders are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<b>Level 1</b>: ordinary agency management, where the offender can be managed by the lead agency in consultation with other agencies involved.</li>
  <li>
<b>Level 2</b>: for cases where active interagency management is required in order to manage the risk of serious harm posed.</li>
  <li>
<b>Level 3</b>: for the most complex cases which require active interagency management by Senior Managers from the agencies involved.</li>
</ul>

<p>8. All adult offenders, including FNOs, who are released before their sentence expiry date will be subject to licence on release and therefore will be managed by the National Probation Service (NPS) or a Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC). All <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> offenders will be managed by the NPS. This will include a number of <abbr title="time served foreign national offenders">TSFNOs</abbr> who, if released from detention, will be subject to licence and/or notification requirements. All young offenders will be subject to either a period of supervision or licence which will be held by a member of the Youth Offending Team. Most offenders sentenced for a sexual offence will be subject to notification requirements when released into the community.</p>

<p>9. All <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> offenders, including FNOs, who will be managed at <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> level 2 or 3 should be identified at least 6 months before their earliest release date from prison by the NPS Community Offender Manager in order for the referral, and review of the case, to be undertaken.</p>

<p>10. In cases where the offender is subject to <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> management at level 1, the Home Office should be involved in information sharing and risk management planning. For cases managed at <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> level 2 or level 3, the Home Office is required to contribute to the risk management plan by actively engaging in information and intelligence sharing within the meeting on an ongoing basis. This will apply in cases when the FNO would be subject to licence or police management should they be released into the community before their sentence end date. The Criminal Casework (CC) case owner is responsible for providing Home Office input.</p>

<p>11. Requests for information on a <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> offender should be tasked through the CC <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> co-ordinator to both the <abbr title="detention engagement team">DET</abbr> Manager and the Supplier Centre 
Manager. The CC case owner or the <abbr title="detention engagement team">DET</abbr> Manager should attend a <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> 
meeting in person, if requested and should be in a position to provide the panel 
with current, relevant information. They should also be of appropriate seniority to 
make decisions in relation to the risk management of the offender. If the 
behaviour of a <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> offender in an IRC is relevant to their ongoing risk 
management, the Supplier Security team should complete an IS91 Part C and 
submit to the Compliance team manager, <abbr title="detention engagement team">DET</abbr> managers and to the <abbr title="detention engagement team">DET</abbr> inbox. 
The <abbr title="detention engagement team">DET</abbr> manager, will send to the CC <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> co-ordinator (on Poise) and 
relevant case-owner.</p>

<p>12. The holding prison should provide the <abbr title="detainee monitoring and population management unit">DEPMU</abbr> risk assessment team with 
sufficient information around a detainee’s <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> status to assist them in 
assessing the risk posed by a detainee by ensuring the information is recorded 
accurately on NOMIS. The provision of a risk assessment will need to be 
requested by <abbr title="detainee monitoring and population management unit">DEPMU</abbr> in line with the guidance in PI 52/2014 (also issued as PSI 
34/2014). This information, along with a full risk assessment based on criminal 
conviction, sentence length and custodial behaviour, will inform the Population 
Management system as to where the TSFNO is best placed to be detained 
within the detention estate. <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> details will be routinely recorded by <abbr title="detainee monitoring and population management unit">DEPMU</abbr>
on the Casework Information Database (CID) on the special conditions screen 
as part of the risk assessment recording.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding and <abbr title="multi-agency public protection arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> <abbr title="time served foreign national offenders">TSFNOs</abbr> in <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>13. All visitors (including children) to <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr> should be protected by the safeguarding arrangements outlined in DSO 04/2012 ‘Visitors and visiting procedures’ and DSO 10/2012 ‘Detention and escorting safeguarding children policy’, to ensure they are safe and protected in any environment for which the Home Office has responsibility.</p>

<h3>Release of <abbr title="time served foreign national offenders">TSFNOs</abbr> from immigration detention</h3>

<p>14. If a TSFNO is released into the community from an IRC, the IRC supplier is 
responsible for ensuring the detainee has a copy of their licence prior to their 
release. In cases of sexual offenders, the TSFNO may also be subject to 
notification requirements and as such the TSFNO should be reissued with the 
notification requirement. Both documents are included in the 2050 Prison Core 
File or from the allocated Offender Manager.</p>

<p>15. Releases should be facilitated during daytime where possible, unless there are 
significant operational reasons that mean that release at other times would be 
unavoidable. The <abbr title="detention engagement team">DET</abbr> team are responsible for the release of a TSFNO and all 
the communications with the case owner.</p>
