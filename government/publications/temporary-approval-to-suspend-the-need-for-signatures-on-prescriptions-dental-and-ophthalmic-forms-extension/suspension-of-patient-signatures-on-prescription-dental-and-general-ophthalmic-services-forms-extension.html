<p>As part of the social distancing measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus, regulations came into force in September 2020 which enable the Secretary of State to temporarily suspend the need for patient signatures on prescription, dental and general ophthalmic services forms.</p>

<p>Full details are outlined in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/885/contents/made" class="govuk-link" rel="external">National Health Service (Coronavirus) (Charges and Further Amendments Relating to the Provision of Primary Care Services During a Pandemic etc.) Regulations 2020</a>.</p>

<p>A temporary suspension of these signatures is now in force and will last until 30 June 2021. This will, however, be kept under review and may be extended, if there continues to be a cross infection risk, or removed, as soon as it is deemed safe for patients to resume signing forms.</p>

<h2>Actions for pharmacy, NHS dental and general ophthalmic services contractors</h2>

<p>While the suspension is in place, we kindly ask contractors to comply with the following when accepting prescription forms or applications for NHS dental care or general ophthalmic services:</p>

<h3>Prescription forms</h3>

<p>Contractors are asked to confirm a patient’s eligibility for free prescriptions and mark this on the FP10 form or electronic prescription service (<abbr title="electronic prescription service">EPS</abbr>) token, on behalf of the patient. Patients should continue to be asked to produce evidence of entitlement or the FP10 or <abbr title="electronic prescription service">EPS</abbr> token can be marked with ‘evidence not seen’. Patients should continue to pay any relevant prescription fee if they do not have a current exemption. It is not necessary for contractors to submit <abbr title="electronic prescription service">EPS</abbr> tokens (other than those used for Serious Shortage Protocol (SSP) claims) to the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) while the suspension of signature requirements remains in place.</p>

<h3>NHS dental services</h3>

<p>Contractors are asked to complete any parts of the Practice Record (<abbr title="Practice Record">PR</abbr>) form or Treatment Plan (FP17DC and FP17DCO) that would usually be completed by the patient. Patients should be asked to confirm their eligibility for free NHS dental care and contractors should mark this on the appropriate section of the <abbr title="Practice Record">PR</abbr> form on behalf of the patient. Patients should continue to be asked to produce evidence of entitlement or practices are asked to mark the form with evidence not seen. Where patients would sign either form, contractors are asked to annotate the form with ‘COVID-19’.</p>

<h3>NHS general ophthalmic services</h3>

<p>Contractors are asked to complete the relevant general optical services forms, on behalf of the patient. Patients should be asked to confirm their eligibility and for that to be marked on the relevant form. Practices should continue to ask patients to produce evidence of entitlement and should mark the form ‘evidence not seen’ if a patient does not produce this. Where patients should sign forms, contractors are asked to annotate the form with ‘COVID-19’. Signatures from contractors/performers are still required on all forms.</p>

<p>Signed by:</p>

<p>Jeannette Howe, Head of Pharmacy</p>

<p>Alette Addison, Head of Dentistry and Eye Care</p>
