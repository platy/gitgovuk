<p>This includes fees for reconsiderations, status checks, duplicate certificates, confirmation of the non-acquisition of British citizenship and certificate corrections.</p>

<p>Fees must be paid in full in order to complete your online application(s) or if you send your paper form application(s) to the Home Office.</p>

<p>If the full fee or biometric data is not provided, then the application will be rejected as invalid. The application will not be considered and the fee will be refunded less an administration fee of £25.</p>

<p>The only exception to this applies to requests for a certificate correction. The fee for a certificate correction will be requested once the caseworker has decided what correction is appropriate. Please ensure that you have sufficient funds to cover the fee payment. Certificates of citizenship cannot be issued until fees have been received.</p>

<h2>Paying for your application</h2>

<h4>Online applications</h4>

<p>If you make your application using the online form, you will be asked to pay by credit or debit card during the online application.</p>

<h4>Paper applications</h4>

<p>If you make your application using the paper form, you must use the payment slip - citizenship or right of abode applications to send your payment by credit or debit card or cheque with your application. Please do not send cash, transcash or postal orders.</p>

<p>Fees are prescribed in law and only part may be refundable if applications are unsuccessful or withdrawn, except for declarations of renunciation.</p>

<p>You should read the guides that accompany application forms, to ensure that you meet the statutory requirements, before applying. If you are paying using a bank or credit account which belongs to someone else, you should give their details on the payment slip in case any refund becomes due.</p>

<p>The fees shown below are for applications submitted to the Secretary of State at the Home Office. Applications submitted to a different receiving authority must be sent, or handed in to that authority. The appropriate receiving authorities are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the Home Secretary if, on the date of receipt, the applicant is in Great Britain or  Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>the Lieutenant-Governor if, on the date of receipt, the applicant is in any of the Islands (for example, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man)</li>
  <li>the appropriate Governor if, on the date of receipt, the applicant is in a British overseas territory</li>
  <li>the Home Secretary if, on the date of receipt, the applicant is elsewhere (including in a Commonwealth country)</li>
</ol>

<p>Applications for registration or naturalisation as a British overseas territories citizen normally have to be referred to the Governor of the British overseas territory with which the applicant is connected, for his decision.  Where this is necessary, applicants will be notified about the fee payable after they have sent in their applications.</p>

<p>The overall fee for British citizenship comprises 3 elements. They are:</p>

<h4>Fee for handling and processing an application</h4>

<p>You will not get a refund if your application is refused or withdrawn.</p>

<p>If your application is rejected the overall fee will be refunded less an administration fee of £25 per applicant.

<h4>Biometric enrolment</h4>

<p>You’ll also need to have your biometric information (fingerprints and a photo) taken - there’s no fee for this.</p>

<h4>Citizenship ceremony fee</h4>

<p>You need to pay this if you are required to attend a citizenship ceremony. You would only get a refund if your application is refused or withdrawn.</p>
