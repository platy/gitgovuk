<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This part concentrates on goods liable to excise duty. It lists the rates of excise duty chargeable for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wine and made-wine</li>
  <li>beer</li>
  <li>cider and perry</li>
  <li>spirits</li>
  <li>low alcohol beverages</li>
  <li>imported composite goods containing alcohol</li>
  <li>tobacco products</li>
  <li>hydrocarbon oil â this section includes details about rebates for such products</li>
  <li>Climate Change Levy</li>
  <li>biofuels</li>
</ul>

<p>Use this guide with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">Trade Tariff: look up commodity codes, duty and VAT rates</a> to help with commodity code numbers (for example, 2204 10 11 for certain wines).</p>

<p>This part also contains some information and reference about excise drawback and excise duty reliefs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Important note on definitions</h3>

<p>The definitions used in this part are those prescribed for excise duty purposes only.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Background</h3>

<p>Excise duty is chargeable, in addition to any customs duty which may be due, on the goods described in this part. These goods may be either of UK origin, received in the UK following an intra EU movement or imported from outside the UK or EU.</p>

<p>The duty falls due at the time when the goods leave any duty suspension arrangements, that is when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are released for consumption or otherwise made available for consumption (generally through the warehouse system) registered trader (<abbr title="registered trader">REDS</abbr>) or occasional importer receives them in the UK</li>
  <li>a vendor makes a delivery under distance selling arrangements</li>
  <li>missing consignments and other dutiable shortages are discovered</li>
  <li>goods imported for personal use are then sold or put to commercial use</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Tax type code</h3>

<p>Different rates can apply to different sub categories of goods. In addition to the commodity description and code number each excisable item has allocated a tax type code number (for example, 451 for spirits). These identify the type and rate of excise duty payable. They are included in the tables listed in section <a class="govuk-link" href="#winemade">Wine and made-wine</a>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-box-47a-tax-type-codes">UK Trade Tariff: Box 47(a) tax type codes</a> also lists tax codes which are declared on the Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>) import document.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Wine and made-wine</h2>

<p>Wine produced in the UK by a licensed producer of wine or imported (in strengths measured by reference to the following percentages of alcohol at a temperature of 20Â°C).</p>

<p>The duty is charged on alcoholic strength to one decimal place, for example 4.19% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">abv</abbr> becomes 4.1% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">abv</abbr> (ignore figures after the first decimal place).</p>

<p>Low alcohol beverages made from malt exceeding 0.5% but not exceeding 1.2% are not liable to excise duty.</p>

<p>Examples of beer-based beverages are set out in the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#lab">Low alcohol beverages</a> which also shows the rate of excise duty for these products up to 5.5%. Beer and spirits mixtures exceeding 1.2% are liable to duty at the spirits rate. Beer mixtures containing dutiable liquors other than spirits and exceeding 5.5% are liable at the appropriate made-wine rate.</p>

<p>Small brewery beer relief will still be available on the general Beer Duty element of beer above 7.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">abv</abbr>. However, it will not apply to high strength Beer Duty and no further relief will be applied to the reduced rate of general Beer Duty for lower strength beers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Definitions and notes</h3>

<p>Beer-based beverage duty only applies to beverages of an alcoholic strength exceeding 1.2% but not exceeding 5.5% and cannot be dutiable as a âmade-wineâ.</p>

<p>This does not include cider, perry and beer as defined in sections for <a class="govuk-link" href="#candd">cider and perry</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#beer">beer</a>. The following are classified as beer-based beverages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shandy made with lemonade, or a mixture of beer and lemonade, lemon cordial, lemon flavouring, lemon juice, or lemon squash</li>
  <li>lager-and-lime, or a mixture of beer and lime cordial, lime flavouring, lime juice, lime squash, or limeade</li>
  <li>ginger beer shandy, shandygaff, or a mixture of beer and ginger, ginger cordial, ginger flavouring, ginger squash, or unfermented ginger beer</li>
  <li>a mixture of beer and:
    <ul>
      <li>fruit cordial, fruit flavourings, fruit flavoured carbonated water, fruit juice or fruit squash</li>
      <li>any alcoholic liquor or other alcoholic substance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A  reduced rate of general Beer Duty should be applied to beer-based beverages of an alcoholic strength exceeding 1.2% but not exceeding 2.8%. The tax type codes 444 or 446 should be used based on the origin of the product. Note these are identical to the tax type codes for low alcohol beer found in chapter 3. Where the beer-based beverage is of an alcoholic strength exceeding 2.8% but not exceeding 5.5% then the tax type code 473 should be used regardless of origin.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Imported composite goods containing alcohol</h2>

<p>Goods containing ingredients liable to excise duty are chargeable with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customs Duty where appropriate on the goods as a whole</li>
  <li>excise duty on the ingredient</li>
</ul>

<p>The tax type codes and excise duty rates are the same as for the type of alcohol used as the ingredient, for example, spirits (451) Â£28.74 per litre of alcohol.</p>

<span class="number">8.1 </span>Definitions and notes</h3>

<p>For the purposes of Tobacco Products Duty, tobacco products are defined in the Tobacco Products (Descriptions of Products) Order 2003 SI 2003/1471. The following is a summary of those definitions.</p>

<p>âTobacco productsâ means any of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#tobacco-products">products listed</a> which are manufactured wholly or partly from tobacco or any substance used as a substitute for tobacco but does not include herbal smoking products.</p>

<p>âCigarettesâ means any roll of tobacco capable of being smoked as they are and not falling within any of the descriptions of a cigar, or rolls of tobacco that, by simple non-industrial handling, are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inserted into cigarette-paper tubes</li>
  <li>wrapped in cigarette paper</li>
</ul>

<p>Any cigarette more than 9 centimetres (<abbr title="centimetres">cm</abbr>) long (excluding any filter or mouthpiece) will be treated as if each <abbr title="centimetres">9cm</abbr> or part thereof were a separate cigarette.</p>

<p>âCigarsâ include products of the following descriptions.</p>

<p>(1) rolls of tobacco made entirely of natural tobacco.</p>

<p>(2) rolls of tobacco, even if mixed with substances other than tobacco, with an outer wrapper of natural tobacco.</p>

<p>(3) rolls of tobacco with a threshed blend filler of tobacco or tobacco mixed with substances other than tobacco, with a binder and outer wrapper of reconstituted tobacco.</p>

<p>The outer wrapper must have the normal colour of a cigar and be fitted in spiral form with an acute angle of at least 30 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the cigar. The outer wrapper must cover the cigar in full including any filter but not (in the case of cigars with a mouthpiece) the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>Cigars falling within this description must have a unit weight (excluding filter or mouthpiece) of not less than 1.2 grams (<abbr title="grams">gm</abbr>).</p>

<p>(4) rolls of tobacco with a threshed blend filler of tobacco or tobacco mixed with substances other than tobacco and with an outer wrapper of reconstituted tobacco that has the normal colour of a cigar.</p>

<p>The outer wrapper must cover the cigar in full including any filter but not (in the case of cigars with a mouthpiece) the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>Any binder may be made of a material other than tobacco or reconstituted tobacco.</p>

<p>Cigars falling within this definition must have a unit weight (excluding any filter or mouthpiece) of not less than <abbr title="grams">2.3gm</abbr> and a circumference over at least one third of its length of at least 34 millimetres (<abbr title="millimetres">mm</abbr>).</p>

<p>A cigarillo that falls within one of these descriptions is a cigar.</p>

<p>âHand-rolling tobaccoâ means tobacco:</p>

<ul>
  <li>of which more than 25% by weight of the tobacco particles have a width of less than <abbr title="millimetre">1mm</abbr>
</li>
  <li>which is sold or intended to be sold for making into cigarettes by hand</li>
  <li>which is of a kind used for making into cigarettes by hand</li>
</ul>

<p>âChewing tobaccoâ includes any product prepared for chewing that consists in whole or in part of tobacco, or substitute for tobacco, and does not fall within the definition of one of the other tobacco products. It does not include products that are intended solely as an aid for persons to give up smoking.</p>

<p>âTobacco for heatingâ means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tobacco capable of being heated, without combustion, in order to produce or flavour vapour</li>
  <li>not cigarettes, cigars, hand-rolling tobacco, other smoking tobacco, or chewing tobacco</li>
</ul>

<p>âOther smoking tobaccoâ means tobacco that has been cut, split, twisted or pressed into blocks, and is capable of being smoked without further industrial processing, or tobacco refuse put up for retail sale that can be smoked, and which does not fall within the definition of one of the other tobacco products.</p>

<p>âHerbal smoking productsâ means products commonly known as herbal cigarettes or herbal smoking mixtures. They do not include plant material which is specially grown or processed for use as a tobacco substitute</p>

<p>Herbal material is usually readily identifiable as such by its texture and aromatic and pungent odour.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Hydrocarbon oil</h2>

<p>The Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 (<abbr title="Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act">HODA</abbr>) specifies full rates of excise duty on mineral oils and rebates of duty. The effect of applying a rebate of duty to a full rate is to create a lower rate of duty. These lower rates are known as rebated rates. This mechanism increases the number of effective rates of mineral oils excise duty.</p>

<p>âRebated oilâ means oil which has been delivered for home use on allowance of a rebate of excise duty under the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979, sections 11 and 14.</p>

<p>Supplementary information about the duty on hydrocarbon oil.</p>

<p>Eligibility for rebate, as set out, is restricted as follows.</p>

<p>Light oil furnace fuel â must be delivered marked and dyed (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat">Excise Notice 179</a>, paragraph 8.4), or unmarked under individual âsupplierâ or âuserâ marking waiver.</p>

<p>Unleaded petrol â qualifies for rebate without marking or other restriction provided it <a class="govuk-link" href="#unleaded-petrol">meets the definition</a>.</p>

<p>Aviation turbine kerosene â may be delivered unmarked, for example, as aircraft fuel under marking waiver (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat">Excise Notice 179</a>).</p>

<p>Other kerosene â must be marked (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat">Excise Notice 179</a>, paragraph 8.4) unless delivered under an individual âuser or dealerâ marking waiver (Excise Notice 179), or imported in containers not exceeding 2.5 litres capacity and not for use as road fuel.</p>

<p>Gas oil â must be marked (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat">Excise Notice 179</a>, paragraph 8.4), unless delivered under an individual âuserâ or âdealerâ marking waiver, or imported in containers not exceeding 2.5 litres capacity and not for use as road fuel.</p>

<p>Fuel oil or other heavy oil â qualifies for rebate without marking or other restriction, provided it is not intended for use as road fuel or road fuel extender.</p>

<p>Markers must not be present in any oil (whether light or heavy) imported for delivery as road fuel or road fuel extender. The prohibitions relating to markers and obscuration of markers which must be observed are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179-motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vat">Excise Notice 179</a>.</p>

<p>The excise duty on hydrocarbon oil removed to a refinery, instead of being charged at the time of importation, is charged on the delivery of any goods from the refinery for home use, and is the same as that which would be payable on the importation of like goods. It is therefore allowed the same rebate as would be allowed on importation. Any customs duty chargeable is payable when the oil is taken into use at the refinery, whether as feedstock or otherwise.</p>

<p>From 15 October 1993 the unit for calculation of duty on hydrocarbon oils is the standard litre, that is, litres at 15Â°C. If not already expressed in those terms quantities will need to be converted. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/motor-and-heating-fuels-general-information-and-accounting-for-excise-duty-and-vatexcise-notice-179#appendix-I">Excise Notice 179</a> Appendix l.â</p>

<p>Itâs illegal for any person to mix any oil on which no rebate of excise duty has been allowed with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fuel oil, gas oil, kerosene or light oil (including unleaded petrol) on which rebate of excise duty has been allowed</li>
  <li>oil delivered without payment of excise duty</li>
</ul>

<p>except under and in accordance with either an approval granted by the Commissioners under the Mixing Regulations or a licence granted by the Commissioners.</p>

<p>For excisedDuty purposes the methods of test whether any material is solid or semi-solid at a temperature of 15Â°C, and for the distillation characteristics of oil, are those laid down by the Institute of Petroleum and the Standardisation of Tar Products Test Committee.

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Imported composite goods containing mineral oils</h2>

<p>Goods containing mineral oils as a part or ingredient of them are not liable to excise duty unless they are intended for use as substitutes for road fuels or as additives to road fuels or road fuel substitutes. Any articles imported for these purposes are chargeable with UK excise duty on 100% of their volume (not only on the percentage of mineral oil, if any, contained within them). The tax type codes and excise duty rates to be applied are the same as for the type of mineral oil which the product is intended to substitute for or is to be added to.</p>

<p>Lubricating oils will not be charged with UK excise duty unless they are to be added to an additives package, in which case excise duty will be charged on the whole package.</p>
