<p>Did you know?</p>

<p>About 190 people a year die in accidental fires in the home.</p>

<p>You’re around 8 times more likely to die in a fire in the home if there are no working smoke alarms.</p>

<p>Faulty electrics (appliances, wiring and overloaded sockets) cause around 4,000 fires in the home across the country every year.</p>

<p>Two fires a day are started by candles.</p>
</div>

<p>This leaflet has been put together for people in shared or rented homes who are at greater risk from fire. The advice and tips provided here supplement our main Fire Safety in the Home leaflet.</p>

<h2>Landlords’ obligations to keep your home safe from fire</h2>

<p>If you live in privately rented accommodation, your landlord has to meet certain safety obligations under the law. This includes making sure all gas and electric appliances are safe and in good working order.</p>

<p>Your landlord must ensure that the property has at least one smoke alarm on every level of your home used as living accommodation.</p>

<p>Gas appliances must be checked by a Gas Safe registered gas fitter every year.</p>

<p>Electrical appliances must carry the British Safety Standard sign.</p>

<p>Your landlord must also ensure furnishings are fire resistant and meet safety regulations.</p>

<p>Your landlord must show you safety certificates so you can see when gas and electrical appliances were last checked.</p>

<p>Your landlord must ensure a carbon monoxide alarm is present in all rooms that contain a solid fuel burning appliance and are used as living accommodation. Landlords must test these and the required smoke alarms on the first day of the tenancy.</p>

<p>If you are worried your landlord isn’t doing enough to ensure your safety contact the environmental health officer at your local council for advice.</p>

<p>Make sure you look for symbols that show your appliances and furnishings are safe.</p>

<h2>Smoke alarms save lives</h2>

<p>Landlords must provide smoke alarms but you, the tenant, are personally responsible for making sure they continue to work after the initial test.</p>

<p>Test your smoke alarms every month. If any of your smoke alarms have a one year battery, make sure it is changed every year. Only take the battery out when you need to replace it.</p>

<p>Your local fire and rescue service may be able to visit your home and check it for risks. Contact them for further information (not 999).</p>

<h2>Be extra careful with electrics</h2>

<p>Avoid overloading sockets. Keep to one plug per socket.</p>

<p>Use a proper adaptor when using a non UK electrical appliance. Never put two prong plugs into three prong sockets.</p>

<p>Don’t use heaters for drying clothes and keep them a safe distance away to avoid them catching fire.</p>

<p>Inform your landlord immediately if you are concerned about the electrics in your property. If you notice burn marks around plugs or cables for example.</p>

<p>Don’t fix faulty electrics yourself. Inform your landlord or call a qualified electrician.</p>

<p>An extension lead or adaptor will have a limit to how many amps it can take, so be careful not to overload them to reduce the risk of fire.</p>

<p>Appliances use different amounts of power – a television may use a 3 amp plug and vacuum cleaner a 5 amp plug for example.</p>

<h2>Stay safe with candles and cigarettes</h2>

<p>Make sure cigarettes are put out properly after you have finished with them.</p>

<p>Smoke outdoors and put cigarettes right out – this is safer than smoking indoors.</p>

<p>Never smoke in bed.</p>

<p>The best way to reduce the risk is to make an attempt to quit, using NHS support if you need it. If you do not want to quit, consider vaping.</p>

<p>Be extra careful if you have been drinking alcohol or taking medication which may make you drowsy.</p>

<p>Be careful with candles and tea lights. Avoid placing them on or near materials that could burn or catch fire – like curtains.</p>

<h2>Plan an escape route</h2>

<p>Plan an escape route and make sure everyone knows how to escape. It could save your life.</p>

<p>Establish where the fire exits and alarms are if you live in a large or high level building.</p>

<p>Count how many doors you might need to go through to escape. It can be hard to see in smoke and you might become confused about where you are.</p>

<p>Keep all exits clear, even communal areas.</p>

<p>Keep fire doors closed. They help to slow down the spread of fire and will give you extra time to get out.</p>

<p>Keep door and window keys where everyone can find them.</p>
