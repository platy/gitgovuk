<p>Dear colleagues</p>

<p>We are writing to let you know that 3 NHS sites – the Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust, the Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, and Locala Health and Wellbeing in Greater Manchester – will begin small scale piloting of intradermal dosing of the vaccine used to combat monkeypox in the coming days.</p>

<p>This dosing approach was recently approved in the US by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for its monkeypox response, based on the scientific evidence that 0.1ml of the current vaccine administered intradermally provides the same immunological response to 0.5ml administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15008762?via%3Dihu" rel="external">the study report</a>. The European Medicines Agency Emergency Task Force has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/emas-emergency-task-force-advises-intradermal-use-imvanex-jynneos-against-monkeypox" rel="external">also approved the approach</a>.</p>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) have reviewed the same evidence and both agree that changing the method of administration will potentially enable an up to 5-fold increase in the number of people that can be offered vaccination with the same amount of vaccine and the same immunological protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The study also shows that local reactions such as erythema, induration and itchiness at the injection site are more commonly reported in intradermal administration, compared with subcutaneous administration. However, pain at the injection site was less commonly reported and systemic reactions were generally similar across both groups.</p>

<p>We are working with these 3 clinics to assess the operational feasibility of using intradermal injections, including staffing models, vaccination throughput, volume and patient experience.&nbsp;The clinics will also signpost recipients to complete online diary cards to monitor any adverse events. We will continue to update you on progress, learning and evaluation.</p>

<p>In addition to the proposal for intradermal dosing, the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> also supports <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s recommendation to reserve the post-exposure protective offer of vaccination for contacts at highest risk of severe illness at this time. We are therefore temporarily recommending that the offer of post-exposure vaccination should only be given to children under the age of 5 years, people with immunosuppression and pregnant women. These individuals will continue to be offered the standard 0.5ml dose of the vaccine (subcutaneously or intramuscularly) until we have completed the evaluations and while awaiting further data.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to thank you all – our Director of Public Health colleagues and all those working in sexual health services and across the NHS – for your hard work in responding to this monkeypox outbreak to date.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Professor Dame Jenny Harries</p>

<p>Chief Executive, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr></p>
