</ul>

<h2>Section 1: check test kit contents</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Wash your hands (with soap and warm water) for 20 seconds.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>Clean and dry a surface and place the home test kit contents on it.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Check test kit contents. If anything is broken or missing, call the customer contact centre to ask for a new kit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in England, Wales and Northern Ireland call 119</li>
  <li>in Scotland call 0300 303 2713</li>
</ul>

<h4>Test kit contents</h4>

<p>Your test kit contains the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>printed instruction booklet</li>
  <li>a sealed wrapper containing a 20cm stick with a cotton swab at the end. Do not unwrap it until instructed</li>
  <li>small plastic tube, containing a small amount of liquid</li>
  <li>in some kits there may also be a larger empty transportation tube without any liquid</li>
  <li>white absorbent pad</li>
  <li>2 plastic bags as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>one bag with a zip-lock. You can feel the zip lock at the top of the bag; you can press it when you need to close the bag. The bag is plain (with no printed information) and transparent</li>
      <li>one Biohazard bag with silver seal (this is the plastic bag without a zip lock). It has a blue and grey print on the bag</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>return box with pre-paid Royal Mail label. This box needs to be assembled at the end of the test so is initially flat</li>
  <li>security seal, for the return box (large blue and silver rectangular sticky label). This is a rectangular sticker which can be peeled off its backing after the box has been assembled</li>
  <li>barcode stickers. The barcode stickers are attached to the small tube, the Biohazard bag, the printed instructions and the return box</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 2: check collection times at a priority postbox</h2>

<h3>Important</h3>
<p>Do the test on the same day you post it.</p>

<p>Do not take the test or post your test kit on a bank holiday.</p>

<p>Post your completed test kit no later than 1 hour before last collection at a priority postbox.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you#/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Royal Mail: services near you</a> for instructions on where to post the kit visit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>click the ‘Show my nearest priority postboxes’ tick box</li>
  <li>enter the postcode of where you’re staying and select the address.</li>
  <li>view priority postboxes near you</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re unable to get to a priority post box</h3>

<p>Call the customer contact centre (England, Wales and Northern Ireland call 119, Scotland call 0300 303 2713) for guidance on when to take your test and how to book a courier collection if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unable to get to a priority postbox without using public transport</li>
  <li>unable to follow the government’s social distancing guidelines</li>
  <li>shielding, classed as vulnerable or too unwell to leave your home</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 3: register the test kit online</h2>

<h3>Important</h3>

<p>Register the kit before you take the test.</p>

<p>Anyone who does not register will not receive their test results.</p>

<p>If you’re testing more than one person in your household, you must register each person’s kit.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-home-test" class="govuk-link">Register your test kit online</a></p>
</div>

<p>You will need the following information, including the barcode numbers, so you might need sighted assistance or an app on your smartphone such as a barcode reader to access this information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10-digit order ID (see your home test order confirmation email)</li>
  <li>11-character test kit barcode (the stickers attached to the tube, booklet and biohazard bag). Check this barcode is the same on your booklet, plastic tube, biohazard bag, and return box</li>
  <li>13-character Royal Mail barcode on the prepaid return label (enter numbers and letters only and not the # hashtag symbol)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 4: prepare to do the test on yourself or someone else</h2>

<h3>Prepare to take the sample</h3>

<p>Taking the test may feel a little uncomfortable and unusual. If possible, do a practice without using any of the testing materials.</p>

<p>If you’re doing the test on a child or someone else, talk through the steps together. Remain calm and confident as you go through the process.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://youtu.be/Xaw8DsF2Igc" rel="external">Watch how to test a child</a></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Tips for testing a child</h3>

<p>Do not do this test if you do not feel confident or if the child has any pain or asks to stop. If you cannot do the test, continue to self-isolate as a household and follow the latest government guidance.</p>

<p>Try to explain the test to the child in words they can understand.</p>

<p>Some children may feel more comfortable sitting on a caregiver’s lap.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#help" class="govuk-link">help and contact details section</a> at the end for how to find further advice on coronavirus in children.</p>
</div>

<h2>Section 5: take a swab sample</h2>

<p>There are 7 steps. Read all steps first before starting. There is also information on what to do if you have been harmed when using this test kit.</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>If you can use a magnifying mirror and a torch, this may help you locate your tonsils. Look inside the mouth and find the tonsils (or the area where they would be if you do not have them) at the back of the throat. The tonsils are located at the back of the throat on the left- and right-hand side. This is where you’ll take the swab sample when instructed.</p>

<p>If testing someone else, ask them to say ‘ahhhh’ loudly for 5 seconds, so that you can see their tonsils.</p>
<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Tip for a child</h4>
<p>If you cannot swab a child’s tonsils, swab both of their nostrils for 10 to 15 seconds instead. The result may be less accurate.</p>
</div>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>Gently blow the nose and cough into a tissue so excess mucus does not spoil the test.</p>

<p>Throw the tissue away in a closed bin.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds using soap and warm water before handling the test kit to avoid contaminating it.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Find the package with the swab inside. Locate the fabric tip of the swab through the plastic (this is the fatter end), and then open the package from the other end so that you do not touch the fabric tip. Gently take out the swab. You’ll use this for both tonsils and nose.</p>

<p>Important: Try not to touch your tongue, teeth, cheeks, gums, or any other surfaces with the swab’s fabric tip, as this may spoil your sample. If this does happen, complete and return the test anyway.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>

<p>Holding the swab in your hand, open the mouth wide and gently rub the swab’s fabric tip over both tonsils at the back of the throat for 10 seconds. If you are able to see, use a torch and/or mirror to help you.</p>

<p>If testing someone else, get them to say ‘ahhhh’ loudly while you take the sample.</p>

<p>When the swab touches the tonsils, it may cause some gagging or brief discomfort, but it should not hurt.</p>

<h3>Step 6</h3>

<p>Put the same end of the same swab gently into the nostril about 2.5cm (1 inch) or until you feel some resistance.</p>

<p>Rotate the swab for 10 to 15 seconds and slowly remove it. If you/they have a piercing, use the other nostril.</p>

<p>Important: this may feel uncomfortable. Do not insert the swab any deeper if there’s a feeling of strong resistance or pain. Do not put the swab down or let it touch anything as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Step 7</h3>

<p>Unscrew the lid from the small plastic tube, while keeping it upright so the liquid stays inside.</p>

<p>Put the swab into the tube with the fabric tip facing down. Try not to touch the fabric swab. Snap off the stick end, so that it just fits inside the tube without bending. There is a snapping point halfway up the stick, and when you bend the top it will naturally break to fit inside the tube.</p>

<p>Important: the liquid must stay in the tube. Securely screw the lid on so the liquid cannot leak.</p>

<h2>Section 6: package the test kit</h2>

<p>There are 5 steps. Read all steps first before starting. You will need to assemble a cardboard box. This is likely to be difficult for some people and might require some patience.</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds, using soap and warm water.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>Place the absorbent pad into the zip-lock bag.</p>

<p>Put the small tube next to the absorbent pad in the same bag. If your kit also had the larger transportation tube, then put the small tube in the larger tube first and then put it next to the absorbent pad in the zip lock bag.</p>

<p>Take some air out of the bag and seal the zip-lock bag.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>If possible, make sure the barcodes on the plastic tube and the biohazard bag (bag without zip lock) match, otherwise assume this is correct.</p>

<p>Place the zip-lock bag into the biohazard bag. There is a flap on the front of the bag in the middle, don’t use this but find the opening at the top of the bag.</p>

<p>Seal the bag using its silver seal. To do this, remove the 2.5cm (1 inch) silver foil on the inside of the top of the bag. This reveals a sticky surface. Press the 2 sides at the top of the bag together to seal the bag.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>

<p>Assemble the return box. If you can, wipe down the bag and box with an antiseptic wipe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure the label is on the outside</li>
  <li>hold the box so that the larger side is towards you and the hinge is away from you</li>
  <li>fold the hinged part towards you so the lid is vertically, and fold the 2 small tabs, on the left- and right-hand side at the back, inwards</li>
  <li>fold the 2 tabs on the left- and right-hand side at the front upwards</li>
  <li>now fold the front of the box up, so the 4 tabs (at the back and the front) form the 4 corners of the box.</li>
  <li>when you do the next step, keep the lid vertical so it is out of the way</li>
  <li>fold the left- and right-hand sides of the box up so they form an edge of around 4cm high</li>
  <li>then fold these sides inwards in half, so the sides are now about 2cm high. Do one side at a time. They should cover/enclose the front and back corner tabs and keep them in place. The sides will click into place at the bottom of the inside of the box</li>
  <li>with the lid vertical, fold the 2 sides of the lid inwards</li>
  <li>put the biohazard bag into the box and close the box. To close the box, put the left and right sides/edges of the lid inside the box</li>
  <li>the front of the lid has 2 tabs to the left and right sides. Hold the lid in place and fold the tabs at either side of the front edge</li>
  <li>fold the front edge over and insert the 2 tabs into the slots at either side of the box. These slots were created when you made the box edges by folding over the sides. The box should now be securely closed.</li>
  <li>apply the security seal so the lid is firmly in place making sure it goes over the top, front and bottom of the box to seal the box and lid</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>If you have sufficient sight to see the label on the box, please make a note of the barcode on the Royal Mail return label so that you can track the delivery. Alternatively, you can use a smartphone app such as a barcode reader to make a note of the number or you can take a picture.</p>

<p>If you are unable to do this, then do not worry, it is only needed if you have to trace your kit.</p>

<p>You’re now ready to post your test kit.</p>

<h2>Section 7: post the completed test kit</h2>

<p>Post the completed test kit on the same day you take the test and no later than 1 hour before the last collection time of the priority post box (weekend times may differ from weekdays). Do not take the test or post the test kit on a bank holiday, take it on the following day instead.</p>

<p>Only use a Royal Mail priority postbox. These are identified on the website and shown visually with a priority label and one of the NHS logos.</p>

<p>Follow the government’s social distancing guidelines, wear a mask and do not take public transport. You must not enter any Post Office with your test kit.</p>

<p>Some priority postboxes have a Sunday collection. They’ll show this on the label and information on collection days and times is provided on the website.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.royalmail.com/track-and-trace">Track your delivery using your Royal Mail return label barcode</a></p>

<h2>When you will get your test results</h2>

<p>You should get your test results by email and text within 2 days after returning your test kit. However, due to the volume of tests, it may take longer.</p>

<p>If you have not received your results after 5 days call the customer contact centre:</p>
