<p>Guidance for the general public on the different types of coronavirus (COVID-19) testing available, including which types of test you should use and when, and what you should do when you receive a test result.</p>

<h2>Test to check if you have coronavirus now</h2>

<p>Taking a test usually involves taking a sample from the tonsils (or where they would’ve been) and from the nose, using a swab.</p>

<h3>Types of test</h3>

<p>There are 2 main types of test to check if you have coronavirus now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests check for the genetic material (RNA) of the virus in the sample. You send the sample for processing at a lab</li>
  <li>lateral flow device (LFD) tests detect proteins called ‘antigens’ produced by the virus. They give rapid results, in 30 minutes after taking the test</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tests for people with symptoms</h3>

<p>If you have symptoms of COVID-19 (a high temperature, a new and persistent cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste), however mild, you should self-isolate for at least 10 days from when your symptoms started.</p>

<p>You should also get a test straight away through <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/get-a-test-to-check-if-you-have-coronavirus/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have received your test result, you should follow the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/what-your-test-result-means/" class="govuk-link">guidance on test results</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you receive a negative virus test then you should continue to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing">guidance on social distancing</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-safe-outside-your-home" class="govuk-link">staying safe when outside of your home</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Tests for people without symptoms (asymptomatic testing)</h3>

<p>As many as 1 in 3 people who are infected with coronavirus  never have symptoms.</p>

<p>Test sites are being set up for people without symptoms in a number of community environments including schools, universities and some workplaces. Some local councils are prioritising people who cannot work from home.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-covid-19-lateral-flow-test-site" class="govuk-link">Check if you can get a test from your local council</a>, or contact your employer or place of study to find out more.</p>
</div>

<p>If you are not experiencing symptoms but have tested positive for COVID-19, you should self-isolate for at least 10 days starting from the day the test was taken.</p>

<p>If you have tested positive while not experiencing symptoms but develop symptoms during the isolation period, you should restart the 10-day isolation period from the day you develop symptoms.</p>

<p>If you take a test when you do not have symptoms and you receive a negative result, it does not guarantee that you do not have the virus. If you receive a negative test result then you should continue to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">guidance on social distancing</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-safe-outside-your-home" class="govuk-link">staying safe when outside of your home</a>.</p>

<h2>Test to find out if you’ve had coronavirus before</h2>

<p>An antibody test is used to tell if a person has previously been infected with coronavirus. 
Antibodies are produced by the immune system when someone has been infected.</p>

<h3>Which antibody tests to use</h3>

<p>Accurate antibody tests for coronavirus have now been developed. They are now being <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-antibody-tests" class="govuk-link">used in the NHS</a> by clinicians where appropriate for some patients.</p>

<p>Antibody tests can also be bought privately. Not all antibody tests that are available to buy are suitable for use. Before taking a test, it’s important to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work" class="govuk-link">understand how tests work, if a test is safe and the limits of tests and ways of testing</a>.</p>

<h3>What an antibody test result means</h3>

<p>A positive antibody test tells you that you have been infected with coronavirus in the past.</p>

<p>It is not clear if being infected in the past means a person is immune and they cannot get infected with coronavirus again in the future. It is also not clear if they can pass the virus onto others.</p>

<p>Scientists are working to understand how a person’s immune system responds to coronavirus, including if a person is immune after they’ve been infected with coronavirus and if so, how long this might last for.</p>

<p>Therefore, you should continue to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">guidance on social distancing</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-safe-outside-your-home" class="govuk-link">staying safe when outside of your home</a>, regardless of the result from an antibody test.</p>

<p>Discuss with the test provider if you are unsure what a test should be used for or what a test result means.</p>
