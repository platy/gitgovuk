<p>The 2022 framework agreement between the Department of Health and Social Care, and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (known as NHS Digital).</p>

<h2>Introduction and background</h2>

<h3>Purpose of document</h3>

<p>This framework document (the ‘framework document’) has been agreed between the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (known as NHS Digital) in accordance with HM Treasury’s handbook ‘Managing Public Money’. It has been approved by HM Treasury.</p>

<p>Following the government’s acceptance of the Laura Wade-Gery review in November 2021, NHS Digital’s functions will move into the transformation directorate of NHS England and Improvement (<abbr title="National Health Service England and Improvement">NHSE</abbr>), with the intention to merge legally when legislation allows.</p>

<p>This framework agreement is intended for the transitional period before the dissolution of NHS Digital as a separate entity. Any timetables and responsibilities are only applicable as long as it retains its functions.</p>

<p>The framework document sets out the broad governance framework within which NHS Digital and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> operate. It sets out NHS Digital’s core responsibilities, describes the governance and accountability framework that applies between the roles of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital, and sets out how the day-to-day relationship works in practice, including in relation to governance and financial matters.</p>

<p>The document does not convey any legal powers or responsibilities but both parties agree to operate within its terms. It is signed and dated on behalf of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital.</p>

<p>References to NHS Digital include all its subsidiaries and joint ventures that are classified to the public sector and central government for national accounts purposes. If NHS Digital establishes a subsidiary or joint venture, there shall be a document setting out the arrangements between it and NHS Digital agreed with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Copies of the document and any subsequent amendments have been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament and made available to members of the public on the NHS Digital website.</p>

<p>This framework document should be reviewed and updated at least every 3 years unless there are exceptional reasons that render this inappropriate that have been agreed with HM Treasury and the principal accounting officer of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>. The latest date for review of this document is 2025.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital share the common objective of delivering digital transformation, live services and data services to support health and social care. To achieve this NHS Digital and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will work together in recognition of each other’s roles and areas of expertise. This will provide an effective environment for NHS Digital to achieve its objectives through the promotion of partnership and trust, and ensuring that NHS Digital supports the strategic aims and objective of the sponsor department and wider government as a whole.</p>

<p>The purpose of this document is to define critical elements of the relationship between <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> as sponsor and NHS Digital. It is accompanied by an annual remit letter which sets out the deliverables of NHS Digital.</p>

<p>This is the third framework agreement between the department and NHS Digital and supersedes previous agreements. The agreement will be reviewed in Q2 and Q4 each year while NHS Digital continues in operation, to ensure it is fit for purpose. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> retains the right to propose amendments, additions or removals to this framework agreement, in consultation with NHS Digital. NHS Digital should also bring to the attention of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> any concerns about any element of the framework agreement.</p>

<h3>The responsible minister</h3>

<p>The minister for Innovation and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care will account for on all matters concerning NHS Digital in Parliament.</p>

<p>The ministerial statutory powers in respect of NHS Digital are set out in sections 250 to 277 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012.</p>

  <li>the Secretary of State or <abbr title="National Health Service England and Improvement">NHSE</abbr> may direct NHS Digital not to comply with a 255 request which is not a mandatory request - conversely, they may direct NHS Digital to comply with a request which was made by a person outside England</li>

The principles include regular collaboration and information sharing between the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr> communications teams to ensure communications are aligned and to amplify their impact.</p>

<p>All arm’s length bodies have committed to undertaking this collaboration and information in a timely manner of content being shared with the public, media or other stakeholders to ensure that as a system, we are communicating with the public, workforce and our stakeholders in a coordinated manner so as not to confuse or undermine another part of the system.</p>

<h3>Staff costs</h3>

<p>Subject to its delegated authorities, NHS Digital shall ensure that the creation of any additional posts does not incur forward commitments that will exceed its ability to pay for them.</p>

<h3>Pay and conditions of service</h3>

<p>NHS Digital’s staff are subject to levels of remuneration and terms and conditions of service (including pensions) within the general pay structure approved by the sponsor department and the Treasury.&nbsp;NHS Digital has no delegated power to amend these terms and conditions.</p>

<p>If Civil Service terms and conditions of service apply to the rates of pay and non-pay allowances paid to the staff and to any other party entitled to payment in respect of travel expenses or other allowances, payment shall be made in accordance with the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-servants-terms-and-conditions">Civil Service Management Code</a>&nbsp;and the annual Civil Service Pay Remit Guidance, except where prior approval has been given by the department to vary such rates.</p>

<p>NHS Digital will use the NHS Agenda for Change Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p>NHS Digital shall abide by public sector pay controls, including the relevant approvals process dependent on the organisations classification as detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/senior-civil-service-pay-and-reward">senior pay guidance</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/senior-civil-service-pay-and-reward">public sector pay and terms guidance</a>.</p>

<p>NHS Digital may operate a performance-related pay scheme that shall form part of the annual aggregate pay budget approved by the department or the general pay structure approved by the department and the Treasury whichever is applicable, where relevant with due regard to the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> <abbr title="executive and senior managers">ESM</abbr> pay guidance.</p>

<p>The travel expenses of board members shall be tied to the rates allowed to senior staff of NHS Digital.&nbsp;Reasonable actual costs shall be reimbursed.</p>

<h3>Pensions, redundancy and compensation</h3>

<p>Compensation scheme rules and pension scheme rules should reflect legislative and HMT guidance requirements regarding exit payments.</p>

<p>In relation to pensions, the organisational pension scheme is currently the NHS Pensions scheme, which is administered by the NHS Business Services Authority and has rules set down in legislation.</p>

<p>Any proposal by the HFEA to move from the existing pension arrangements, or to pay any redundancy or compensation for loss of office, requires the prior approval of the department. Proposals on severance must comply with the rules in Chapter 4 of Managing Public Money.</p>

<h3>Recruitment of senior staff</h3>

<p>NHS Digital will notify the Digital Oversight team of any <abbr title="executive and senior managers">ESM</abbr> recruitment prior to seeking approval from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> Remuneration Committee. Any applications to the Committee will be rejected if the sponsor has not agreed in advance.</p>

<h2>Business Plans Financial Reporting and Management information</h2>

<h3>Corporate and business plans&nbsp;</h3>

<p>NHS Digital shall submit to the sponsor department for review and comment, before publication and by the end of the financial year 2022/2023, a draft of its corporate plan covering the Spending Review period. NHS Digital shall agree with the department the issues to be addressed in the plan and the timetable for its preparation.&nbsp;The plan shall reflect NHS Digital’s statutory and/or other duties and, within those duties, the priorities set from time to time by the responsible minister (including decisions taken on policy and resources in the light of wider public expenditure decisions).&nbsp;The plan shall demonstrate how NHS Digital contributes to the achievement of the department’s medium-term plan and priorities and aligned performance metrics and milestones.</p>

<p>The first year of the corporate plan, amplified as necessary, shall form the business plan.&nbsp;The business plan shall be updated to include key targets and milestones for the year immediately ahead and shall be linked to budgeting information so that resources allocated to achieve specific objectives can readily be identified by the department.&nbsp;Subject to any commercial considerations, a digest of the corporate and business plans should be published by NHS Digital on its website and separately be made available to staff.</p>

<p>The following key matters should be included in the plans:</p>

<ul>
  <li>key objectives and associated key performance targets for the forward years, and the strategy for achieving those objectives</li>
  <li>key non-financial performance targets</li>
  <li>a review of performance in the preceding financial year, together with comparable outturns for the previous 2 to 5 years, and an estimate of performance in the current year</li>
  <li>alternative scenarios and an assessment of the risk factors that may significantly affect the execution of the plan but that cannot be accurately forecast</li>
  <li>other matters as agreed between the department and NHS Digital</li>
</ul>

<h2>Budgeting procedures&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Each year, in the light of decisions by the department on the updated draft corporate plan, the department will send to the <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a formal statement of the annual budgetary provision allocated by the department in the light of competing priorities across the department and of any forecast income approved by the department</li>
  <li>a statement of any planned change in policies affecting NHS Digital</li>
</ul>

<p>NHS Digital will work with the <abbr title="National Health Service England and Improvement">NHSE</abbr> Transformation Directorate and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> Finance Business Partners, in any in-year prioritisation process to refine and confirm the budget.</p>

<p>NHS Digital’s business planning will take account both of approved funding provision and any forecast receipts, and will include a budget of estimated payments and receipts together with a profile of expected expenditure and of draw-down of any departmental funding and/or other income over the year.</p>

<h3>Financial accountability for specific programmes</h3>

<p>The chief executive of NHS Digital as accounting officer is accountable to Parliament for the expenditure associated with NHS Digital as voted in the estimate, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running and maintaining live services and legacy systems which provide critical infrastructure for health and social care</li>
  <li>delivery of those programmes in the <abbr title="Technology Transformation Portfolio">TTP</abbr> which NHS Digital is contracted to deliver</li>
  <li>delivery of programmes outside of the <abbr title="Technology Transformation Portfolio">TTP</abbr> commissioned by organisations other than <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grant-in-aid and any ring-fenced grants&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Any grant-in-aid provided by the department for the year in question will be voted in the department’s Supply Estimate and be subject to Parliamentary control.</p>

<p>The grant-in-aid will normally be paid in monthly instalments. NHS Digital will comply with the general principle, that there is no payment in advance of need.&nbsp;Cash balances accumulated during the course of the year from grant-in-aid or other Exchequer funds shall be kept to a minimum level consistent with the efficient operation of NHS Digital.&nbsp;Grant-in-aid not drawn down by the end of the financial year shall lapse.&nbsp;Subject to approval by parliament of the relevant estimates provision, where grant-in-aid is delayed to avoid excess cash balances at the year-end, the department will make available in the next financial year any such grant-in-aid that is required to meet any liabilities at the year end, such as creditors.</p>

<p>If the department provides NHS Digital separate grants for specific (ring-fenced) purposes, it would issue the grant as and when NHS Digital needed it on the basis of a written request.&nbsp;NHS Digital would provide evidence that the grant was used for the purposes authorised by the department.&nbsp;NHS Digital shall not have uncommitted grant funds in hand, nor carry grant funds over to another financial year.</p>

<h3>Annual report and accounts&nbsp;</h3>
