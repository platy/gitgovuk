<p>This protocol sets the standards to which NHS Digital should aim in its relationship with Parliament and public, to secure the confidence of the public and Parliament and to maintain the service levels that MPs and the public have come to expect.

This protocol will be reviewed annually as part of the review of the framework agreement.</p>

<p>This protocol sets out how <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital work together to secure the confidence of the public and Parliament and to maintain the service levels that MPs and the public have come to expect. It is essential that ministers, MPs, peers and the public alike have confidence in the health and social care system.</p>

<p>The protocol covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>oral and written Parliamentary questions (<abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Parliamentary debates</li>
  <li>select committee inquiries</li>
  <li>correspondence from MPs direct to NHS Digital</li>
  <li>correspondence from MPs to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> about NHS Digital’s responsibilities</li>
  <li>meeting requests from MPs to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> ministers</li>
  <li>meeting requests from MPs to NHS Digital officials</li>

  <li>
<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> requests</li>
  <li>data protection requests</li>
  <li>complaints and whistleblowing</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Purpose</h2>

<p>This is an agreement between <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital. It is intended to help organisations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet their respective public and Parliamentary responsibilities</li>
  <li>work out their operational needs</li>
  <li>understand their own and respective organisations’ role and independence</li>
  <li>develop and strengthen collaborative partnership working</li>
  <li>secure the confidence of the public, MPs and peers</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Working together</h2>

<p>Both organisations agree to work together to ensure that, where reasonable, a consistent message is given, thereby securing the confidence of the public, ministers, MPs and peers alike. In doing so, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>share information about topics of interest to the public or the media</li>
  <li>share information about sensitive or contentious issues</li>
  <li>advise each other of changes in strategic direction or policy</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Quality, consistency and performance standards</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital have agreed to establish and maintain robust arrangements that support public and Parliamentary accountability across the health and social care structure.</p>

<p>NHS Digital and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> have put in place named contacts, adequate resources and robust processes to deal with the handling of public enquiries, correspondence, Parliamentary questions (<abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr>) and all other types of Parliamentary business, <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> requests and complaints in line with ministerial and Parliamentary expectations and timescales.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital will work collaboratively to ensure that both quality and performance standards are maintained.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send clear, unambiguous commissions for information to support answers to <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> and briefing, allowing as much time as possible within Parliamentary and other timescales for NHS Digital to provide the information required, and to allow ministers time to consider and meet their obligations to Parliament</li>
  <li>ensure an appropriate level of oversight is applied to NHS Digital responses on <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> and ministerial correspondence contributions sent to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and support NHS Digital in establishing quality assurance and appropriate senior level clearance arrangements</li>
  <li>provide advice (as required) on <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> matters; and discuss and agree public and Parliamentary accountability performance standards which are realistic and achievable for NHS Digital</li>
</ul>

<p>NHS Digital will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide contributions to answers to <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr>, briefing and correspondence so that ministers can meet their obligations to Parliament and under the Ministerial Code. The information will be timely, comprehensive, accurate, and truthful, and address meaningfully the question or issue raised</li>
  <li>build capacity and capability to ensure that correspondence contributions, briefing and <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> replies are fit for purpose and meet <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s quality and timeliness standards, and which answer the points raised</li>
  <li>ensure that <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> responses meet the requirements of <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> legislation on timeliness and provision of information</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, to embrace the government’s commitment to openness and transparency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that responses to requests made and issues raised under data protection legislation are handled in a timely and appropriate way in line with the requirements of the legislation and good information privacy standards</li>
  <li>ensure sufficient resources and arrangements for quality assurance and senior level clearance are available to provide accurate briefing, information for <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr>, and correspondence contributions within the deadlines agreed with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, for everything within NHS Digital’s area of responsibility</li>
  <li>allocate sufficient resource to ensure that <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> requests are responded to within the standard time set by NHS Digital and in line with legislation</li>
  <li>allocate sufficient resource to ensure that Data Protection Act (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>) requests are responded to within the set standard by NHS Digital and in line with legislation</li>
  <li>ensure arrangements are in place to respond to telephone enquiries from MPs and members of the public</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, the relevant policy team in <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will have responsibility for approaching NHS Digital with a request for data. The Digital Oversight Team may liaise directly with NHS Digital in supporting Parliament and public business, and on occasion have responsibility for a specific commission, where an area lacks a clear policy lead in <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> (unofficially known as ‘orphan’ areas). The team can help with relationships between NHS Digital and policy teams in <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and should be the first port of call where NHS Digital has concerns or there are other issues, for example, relating to a commission. The Digital Oversight Team will act to ensure that <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy colleagues conform to the principles in this protocol.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Multi-issue areas</h2>

<p>Responses to issues that span more than one <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>, where there is no obvious lead <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>, should be coordinated by the most appropriate policy team in <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> or the Digital Oversight team. If a <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> requires a contribution from several ALBs it is up to the policy area to co-ordinate contribution requests from the different organisations, and to ensure that there is no duplication. This will be determined on a case by case basis depending on the issue raised.</p>

<p>Some requests for information for <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr>, debates etc. may be received from colleagues in the joint unit between <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="National Health Service England and Improvement">NHSE</abbr> Transformation Directorate. These should be treated in the same way as a request from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>. In any case of uncertainty NHS Digital should discuss with the Digital Oversight team.</p>

<p>This public and Parliamentary accountability protocol and its arrangements will be monitored through the quarterly accountability meetings between <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Parliamentary accountability</h2>

<p>This will involve responsibilities around a number of Parliamentary accountability processes, including <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr>, correspondence, debates and committee hearings. Ministers are required to respond to debates and <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> etc. and NHS Digital has agreed to provide <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> with information to support speeches, information for answers and briefing as appropriate to enable ministers to account for NHS Digital. Briefing should include relevant background information in accordance with the commission and be signed off by a senior NHS Digital member of staff.</p>

<p>In order to emphasize organisational responsibilities and accountabilities, ministers will take every opportunity to explain relevant organisational responsibilities and encourage MPs and peers to liaise directly with NHS Digital on matters for which it has responsibility. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has agreed to give sufficient notice of requests and provide timely responses in order to meet Parliamentary deadlines. The process for this is set out below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Oral questions and debates</h2>

<p>The appropriate policy team in <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will alert NHS Digital to the oral question or debate as early as possible. The commission will be clear and provide a steer on what should be included.</p>

<p>NHS Digital will provide accurate information (and background where appropriate), in the format required by the deadline agreed with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> whenever possible. The expectation, depending on subject, is that wherever possible NHS Digital has at least 24 hours to provide a contribution to an Oral <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> answer, although it should be accepted that ministers set briefing deadlines which can mean briefing is sometimes required within 24 hours.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Written questions concerning matters within the responsibility of NHS Digital</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will alert NHS Digital to the question as early as possible on the day of receipt and seek information to support a full answer and relevant background material for the minister to consider. The general approach is that answers need to be substantive, even if couched in terms of ‘NHS Digital has advised that…’.</p>

<p>NHS Digital will provide information to the required standard within the deadlines agreed with the team commissioning the information. Wherever possible NHS Digital should be given at least 24 hours to provide information in respect of a named day <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr>, and at least 36 hours to provide information for an ordinary written or a Lords written question.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Parliamentary Questions</h2>

<p>Answering <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> is a critically important part of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s public accountability for the NHS, a role that only <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> can undertake. This activity therefore plays a major role in the communication and reputation management agendas for both <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and the NHS.</p>

<p>Parliament is responsible for initial <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> allocation and ministerial approval of <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr>. The daily <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> list from Parliamentary is sent directly to NHS Digital for planning and time management purposes only.</p>

<p>NHS Digital is responsible for providing timely and accurate contributions to <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> where approached by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, covering not only the provision of relevant information when that is held by the organisation but also rapid feedback on non-availability and, where possible, indications of alternative sources. NHS Digital may occasionally choose to obtain information from secondary sources such as NHS Prescribing Services of the NHS Business Services Authority.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy leads are responsible for commissioning contributions from NHS Digital and ensuring that NHS Digital’s contribution is incorporated into an accurate response that includes all the relevant caveats and notes.</p>

<p>The Digital Oversight team may commission contributions from NHS Digital, where there is no clear policy lead in <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Specific Responsibilities</h2>

<p>All contributions to <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> will be commissioned by the appropriate <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy lead as soon as possible, avoiding unnecessary delays. All <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> must be sent to NHS Digital’s <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> mailbox, <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pq@nhsdigital.nhs.uk">pq@nhsdigital.nhs.uk</a> which is managed by the NHS Digital contact centre. The minimum requirements are that all requests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are sent by the appropriate policy lead to the mailbox</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have one <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> per email with the phone number of the policy lead</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>specify the email address to which the contribution to be sent to</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide the full <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> content and reference number in the body of the email</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>put the unique <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> reference number in the subject line of the email</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include any additional information which will help inform NHS Digital’s contribution to
the <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr>, for example by setting out proposed structure of the reply, including where possible the generic type (if not the specific instance) of information that would fulfil the requirements of the reply; or by setting out which health geographies to apply, or any special data formatting requests. Commissioning emails could also usefully indicate if there is a contact in NHS Digital who would be best placed to provide a contribution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>state clearly the deadline (date and time) for the contribution to be returned to the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy lead</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> sent to NHS Digital by any other route will be returned requesting that they are sent directly to the contact centre (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pq@nhsdigital.nhs.uk">pq@nhsdigital.nhs.uk</a>) for initiation of the contribution preparation process. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> should not separately commission contributions directly from individuals within NHS Digital, to avoid duplication or confusion.</p>

<p>The Digital Oversight Team can advise if there is any issue relating to a request for a <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> contribution, and if necessary, liaise with the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy team.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy leads should aim to allocate <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> to NHS Digital by noon on the day of receipt. For:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commons Ordinary Written and Lords Written <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> the usual deadline will be for reply by 5pm the following day</li>
  <li>Commons Named Days the usual deadline will be for 5pm on the day of receipt</li>
</ul>

<p>Exceptions should be expected, but wherever possible these will be kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>There will be some occasions (typically approaching Parliamentary recess or prorogation) when deadlines for all <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> are shortened to 24 hours; NHS Digital should aim to respond appropriately on these occasions.</p>

<p>Ensuring a timely response to a <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> contribution request should take priority over other activities in NHS Digital, and be handled by appropriately skilled, trained and competent staff. All <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> sent to NHS Digital are managed through a quality assurance process that is initiated by NHS Digital’s Contact Centre, includes interim approvals and checking and concludes with Director approval (or Band 8D approval in certain circumstances).</p>

<p>Where NHS Digital does not hold the required data but another organisation may, NHS Digital will endeavour to return these <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> to the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy lead as quickly as possible for reallocation. Where appropriate, NHS Digital may decide to seek a contribution from a secondary source.</p>

<p>Where a contribution could take more than one approach NHS Digital will consult with the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy lead to agree the preferred option before proceeding with the preparation of the contribution. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will always welcome a dialogue about what can and cannot be provided by way of a contribution.</p>

<p>NHS Digital aims to provide all contributions within the deadline. NHS Digital has established internal measures and management processes to help achieve this. Only when necessary will NHS Digital contact the appropriate policy lead to discuss extending deadlines. For Named Day <abbr title="parliamentary questions">PQs</abbr> a brief note to the policy lead explaining the reason why a deadline was missed may be requested.</p>

<p>NHS Digital’s contribution to a <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> will be provided in a format that is editable and printable, and that follows the written questions guide. This will include the addition of clear and concise footnotes and explanatory notes. This contribution will be sent to the email address specified by the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy lead.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy lead requests NHS Digital to make a material change to a <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> contribution this change must be cleared through NHS Digital’s <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> contribution approval process before it is submitted to Parliament.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> policy lead and Parliamentary will provide constructive feedback to NHS Digital that will support a culture of continual improvement. The final version of the <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> will also be shared. There will be regular joint <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>/NHS Digital management reviews of the <abbr title="parliamentary question">PQ</abbr> process from end to end to provide feedback and identify ways to improve the overall process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Select Committees</h2>

<p>Parliamentary Select Committees will often require written or oral evidence from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> ministers or officials and from NHS Digital witnesses. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital will work closely together to keep each other informed when inquiries are notified to ensure that policy leads in both organisations can work together effectively on joint written evidence, briefing and responses to meet the clearance requirements of both organisations, including ministerial clearance, and to meet strict Parliamentary deadlines. Coordinators for both organisations will ensure that comprehensive information from across <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital is provided and aligned for consistency, while allowing for the different perspectives, roles and responsibilities of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital to be presented where appropriate. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital will ensure that any commitments made during committee hearings that relate to the other organisation will be passed on as soon as possible thereafter to ensure timely responses to the committee.</p>

<p>Where a commitment is made at an evidence session to provide further information, this should be done within 5 working days of the hearing. If the information cannot be provided within 5 working days, a letter should be sent from the witness to the Chair explaining the delay, giving an estimate of when the information can be provided, unless it is clearly not appropriate to do so (for example, when a witness promises to send figures which will become available at a later date which is known to the committee).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>
<abbr title="National Audit Office">NAO</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Accounts Committee">PAC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Public Accounts Committee (<abbr title="Public Accounts Committee">PAC</abbr>) inquiries supported by National Audit Office (<abbr title="National Audit Office">NAO</abbr>) reports follow a different process from other select committees. In the case of <abbr title="National Audit Office">NAO</abbr> reports, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital will share their individual clearance documents with each other and liaise with each other where relevant on negotiating changes to reports before publication. For government responses to <abbr title="Public Accounts Committee">PAC</abbr> recommendations, which take the form of a Treasury Minute and are subject to strictly prescribed formats and timescales, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital will work closely together to prepare agreed responses, with timely involvement at a sufficiently senior level on both sides to meet Treasury deadlines and to allow time for clearance by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital accounting officers and ministers. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital will take steps to implement those recommendations which are accepted and to report on their progress. The <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> accounting officer should see on all correspondence between NHS Digital and the <abbr title="Public Accounts Committee">PAC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>All Party Parliamentary Groups</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital will sometimes be approached to provide briefing, written and oral evidence by All Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) on specific issues. These groups do not have the formal status of Parliamentary Select Committees but <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital may wish to be helpful in providing them with information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Correspondence from MPs sent directly to NHS Digital</h2>

<p>This is correspondence addressed to the chair, chief executive or another official in NHS Digital about matters relating to the business of the organisation.</p>

<p>NHS Digital will normally respond directly to the MP. MPs will expect a reply from the person to whom the correspondence was addressed, or someone at the same level. NHS Digital will aim to respond within 18 working days for routine correspondence and 40 working days for complaint cases.</p>

<p>On occasion, MP correspondence may refer to both NHS Digital and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> business. When handling such correspondence, NHS Digital should reply answering the enquiries about NHS Digital business, explaining the independence of NHS Digital and recommending that the MP writes to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> about the issues relating to it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Correspondence from MPs to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> about NHS Digital responsibilities</h2>

<p>This is MP correspondence addressed to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> ministers or officials, but which relates to the business of NHS Digital. As NHS Digital is not a government department, the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> prevents <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> from routinely forwarding correspondence.</p>

<p>It is protocol for a <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> minister to respond to MP correspondence. When an MP has written to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> about an issue which relates solely to NHS Digital’s business, the minister will reply explaining the independence of NHS Digital and signposting the MP to that organisation. There may be occasions when the matter is sensitive, and ministers consider that it is more appropriate to respond fully to the correspondence. In such cases, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will discuss and agree with NHS Digital the most appropriate handling approach. At all times NHS Digital and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will comply with the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>, sharing personal information only when there is a need to do so.</p>

<p>When a contribution from NHS Digital is required for a ministerial reply, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will aim to request the contribution within 48 hours of receipt of the correspondence. NHS Digital will aim to provide the contribution within 4 working days of the request being received. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> may need to negotiate a shorter deadline with NHS Digital in urgent cases such as when a minister asks for a reply to be redrafted. NHS Digital will set in place appropriate senior clearance arrangements to ensure that the contribution is of a good quality and is returned within the stated deadline.</p>

<p>In instances where routine correspondence covers both <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS Digital’s responsibilities, the Ministerial Correspondence and Public Enquiries unit within <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will reply, addressing the issues it is responsible for and signposting the MP to NHS Digital. At all times <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will aim to reply to correspondence within the Whitehall Standard (currently 18 working days).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>MP meeting requests to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> ministers on NHS Digital matters</h2>

<p>MP requests for meetings are usually addressed to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> ministers. It is normal practice for meeting requests from MPs to be accepted. These requests will continue to be handled by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The minister’s private office will consider the request and seek advice from the Digital Oversight Team before responding. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will aim to contact NHS Digital on the day that the notification of the meeting request is received from the minister’s office. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will aim to comply with its Whitehall Standard deadline when responding to the MP (currently 18 working days).</p>

<p>NHS Digital will provide well considered and timely advice on whether or not the minister should accept the meeting request. It will also provide appropriate briefing in advance of the meeting to agreed deadlines and arrange for a relevant senior officer to attend meetings with the minister wherever possible.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>MP meeting requests to meet NHS Digital officials</h2>

<p>These will be requests from MPs to meet directly with officials from NHS Digital. NHS Digital will normally agree to requests from MPs and peers for meetings and will handle these without input from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Correspondence from members of the public to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> about NHS Digital business</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> prevents <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> from routinely forwarding correspondence. Instead, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will respond to the correspondence it receives, explaining the independence of NHS Digital and signposting the correspondent to it. In instances where the correspondence covers both departmental and NHS Digital responsibilities, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will reply with its policy lines and signpost the correspondent to NHS Digital for all matters pertaining to it. At all times, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will aim to comply with the Whitehall Standard target (currently 18 working days).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Correspondence from members of the public to NHS Digital</h2>

<p>This is correspondence from the public directly to NHS Digital. NHS Digital will respond directly to this correspondence. Where possible, NHS Digital will comply with accepted Whitehall Standard targets but will set its own targets for responding.</p>

<p>If the correspondence covers areas that should rightly be for <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to answer, NHS Digital will respond to the correspondence explaining the independence of NHS Digital and signpost them to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will pass on all public correspondence addressed to NHS Digital but delivered erroneously to its Ministerial Correspondence and Public Enquiries unit within 24 hours of receipt. NHS Digital will also put in place similar forwarding arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>
<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> requests to NHS Digital</h2>

<p>NHS Digital will respond to all <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> requests submitted to it. As a public authority, NHS Digital has a legal obligation to provide information in response to these requests and is required to have in place an approved publication scheme and restricted access to personal data. Under the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> and <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>, information is ‘held’ by a public authority if it is held by that authority, or by another person or organisation on behalf of that authority. NHS Digital will also have a duty under the act to provide advice and assistance to people who have made, or propose to make, information requests to the organisation. NHS Digital will also be mindful of the Ministry of Justice guidance on the handling of Papers of a Previous Administration and seek guidance from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> when papers relating to a previous administration are being considered for release.</p>

<p>Although NHS Digital must independently handle <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> and <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> requests as a separate organisation, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> team is willing to provide informal, impartial advice on relevant legislation and duties if requested. However, the decision as to whether a request falls under a relevant exemption or not will remain with NHS Digital.</p>

<p>NHS Digital will make its own forwarding arrangements with the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s postal service for any <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> or <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> correspondence delivered in error.</p>

<p>NHS Digital will have a nominated ‘qualified person’ in the event of it invoking an exemption under Section 36 of the <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>. A member of the Information Governance Team (IGT) will work closely with the Business Area concerned to ensure a Public Interest Test is completed, which would need approval from the Chief Executive.</p>

<p>In the event of NHS Digital responding to an <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> request with information that it considers relevant or of interest to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, NHS Digital will inform <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> about the release of that information in sufficient time to prepare appropriate media handling if necessary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span>
<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> and Data Protection (<abbr title="data protection">DP</abbr>) requests to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> on NHS Digital matters</h2>

<p><abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> requests to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> about NHS Digital will be assessed on the basis of whether <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> holds the information at the time of the request. The standard rules of <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> compliance will apply.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> holds the information and considers that it does not fall within the scope of an <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> exemption, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will liaise with NHS Digital before releasing any information.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> does not hold the information but judges that it may be in NHS Digital’s possession under the <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> Act’s duty to assist and advise, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will advise the applicant to contact NHS Digital giving full contact details.</p>

<p>In the event of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> responding to an <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> request with information that it considers relevant or of interest to NHS Digital, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will inform NHS Digital before the release of that information and in sufficient time to prepare appropriate media handling if necessary.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> receives a Data Protection request for access to personal data, or a request to stop processing personal data and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> holds the data, it will respond to the request. If <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> does not hold the data, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will advise the applicant to contact NHS Digital. There will be no onward referral of Data Protection or <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> cases to or from either organisation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21. </span>Telephone enquiries</h2>

<p>NHS Digital will be responsible for establishing its own arrangements to answer its telephone enquiries. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will signpost clearly any caller who wishes to discuss matters which relate solely to NHS Digital.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">22. </span>Complaints and Whistleblowing correspondence to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> about NHS Digital</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has in place established arrangements for processing the complaints and whistleblowing correspondence it receives about NHS and social care providers and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> ALBs. It aims to identify this type of correspondence within 24 hours of receipt and grades them according to their severity. When <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> receives serious complaints that need immediate action to protect a person’s welfare, it will contact the appropriate organisation to seek immediate intervention.</p>

<p>For all complaints, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will direct the correspondent to the appropriate complaint mechanism.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will refer anonymised information about whistleblowing cases and the most serious complaints to the appropriate regulatory authority. If serious concerns are raised about the way in which NHS Digital is running its operations (for example, allegations of fraud, governance etc.), this will be handled by the Digital Oversight Team. At all times <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will comply with Data Protection legislation, in doing so <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will do its utmost to protect an individual’s identity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">23. </span>Complaints to NHS Digital about NHS Digital</h2>

<p>NHS Digital and its staff must be aware of the commitments set out in the Statement of Common Purpose, as published in the government’s response to the Mid Staffs enquiry, November 2013, pages 5 to 7.</p>

<p>NHS Digital will have robust policies and processes in place for handling and responding to complaints. NHS Digital will follow best practice in responding to complaints, as set out in the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman’s Principles of Good Complaint handling.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> receives a complaint about NHS Digital, it will either ask the complainant for permission to forward the case to NHS Digital or write to the complainant giving details of how to complain to NHS Digital.</p>
