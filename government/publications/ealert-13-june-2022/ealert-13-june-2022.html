<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>New fund to accelerate Local Authorities’ tree planting ambitions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>A £7.8 million fund to support Local Authorities with the new staff and expertise needed to accelerate woodland and tree planting plans opens today (Monday 13 June).</h3>

<p>The Woodland Creation Accelerator Fund, delivered by the Forestry Commission in partnership with DEFRA, will provide Local Authorities with financial support to boost capacity and resource, helping Local Authorities to employ, train up and bring on board professional expertise to drive tree planting and woodland creation commitments.</p>

<p>Successful Local Authorities will be awarded up to £150,000 (per Local Authority) to establish the new people resource needed to develop planting plans and applications for capital funding in 23/24 and 24/25. This could include new members of staff, such as project managers, woodland creation officers, community engagement officers, funding consultants, or specialist advisors, such as landscape architects or archaeologists.</p>

<p>All upper tier authorities (county councils, unitary councils, London boroughs, metropolitan boroughs, combined authorities) are eligible to apply.</p>

<p>Local Authorities will be invited to outline the measures they propose to increase capacity and in return identify the area of new woodland or numbers of trees they will commit to plant by winter season 24/25. </p>

<p>For more information, visit GOV.UK page: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-creation-accelerator-fund-wcaf">Woodland Creation Accelerator Fund</a> or read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forestrycommission.blog.gov.uk/2022/06/13/new-staffing-support-for-local-authorities-creating-woodland-to-tackle-climate-change/" rel="external">latest blog</a> to find out more about the fund and application process.</p>

<p>Deadline for applications is 5:00pm Friday 8 July 2022.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Phytophthora Pluvialis – new plant heath requirements introduced</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Find out where the new demarcated areas are following further findings of the tree pathogen Phytophthora pluvialis.</h3>

<p>The Forestry Commission is urging woodland managers, landowners and the forestry industry to remain vigilant following further findings of Phytophthora pluvialis in areas across England.</p>

<p>A new demarcated area in relation to a finding in a woodland in Shropshire and revisions to the existing Notice for the demarcated area in Surrey which are minor grammatical changes for accuracy have been added to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/forestry-commission-takes-robust-action-to-combat-spread-of-tree-disease">press release: Forestry Commission takes robust action to combat spread of tree disease</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/phytophthora-pluvialis">GOV.UK page</a>.</p>

<p>Key symptoms to look out for are lesions on the stem, branch or roots. Any sightings should be reported to the Forestry Commission via its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/fthr/tree-alert/" rel="external">TreeAlert online portal</a>.</p>

<p>Phytophthora pluvialis is a fungus-like pathogen known to affect a variety of tree species, including western hemlock, Douglas fir, tanoak and several pine species (in particular radiata pine). It is reported to cause needle cast (where needles turn brown and fall off), shoot dieback, and lesions on the stem, branches, and roots.</p>
