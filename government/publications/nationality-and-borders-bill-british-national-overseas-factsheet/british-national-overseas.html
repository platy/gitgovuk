<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What is the British National (Overseas) or BN(O) route?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>On 31 January 2021, the UK launched a bespoke immigration route for British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) status holders and their immediate family members.</li>
  <li>This route reflects the UK’s historic and moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong who chose to retain their ties to the UK by taking up BN(O) status at the point of Hong Kong’s handover to China in 1997.</li>
  <li>This is an unprecedented offer following China’s passing of the National Security Law. This law significantly impacts the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.</li>
  <li>Those with BN(O) status and their eligible family members can apply to come to the UK to live, study and work in virtually any capacity, on a pathway to citizenship. After five years in the UK, BN(O) status holders and their family members will be able to apply for settlement, followed by citizenship after a further twelve months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How many people have applied for the route since it launched?</h2>

<p>According to the Quarterly Migration Statistics published on 24 February as of 31 December 2021 103,900 BN(O) status holders and their family members have chosen to take the UK up on this offer and applied for the BN(O) route since 31 January. A total of 97,057 visas have been granted. 75,961 visas were granted from overseas. 21,096 visas were granted within the UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What changes are you making to the BN(O) route?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>On 24 February, a change to the British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) immigration route was announced which will allow some adult children of BN(O) status holders to apply to the route independently from their BN(O) parent. This includes those who:
    <ul>
      <li>have at least one BN(O) parent;</li>
      <li>were born on or after 1 July 1997 and are aged 18 years or over; and</li>
      <li>are currently resident in Hong Kong, the UK or the Crown Dependencies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In order to be eligible, these individuals will need to meet all&nbsp; eligibility and suitability requirements for the route but this will no longer include a need for this cohort to apply with their BN(O) parent or be a member of the same household.</li>
  <li>The Government plans to make these changes to the Immigration Rules in September with the route open to applications from this additional cohort from October.&nbsp; Further information will be published in due course.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Are there other routes available?</h2>

<p>Those who are not eligible for the BN(O) route may wish to consider the other UK immigration routes available. Individuals from Hong Kong can apply to come to the UK under the terms of the UK’s new Points Based System. The skilled worker route enables individuals to come to the UK in a wider range of professions and at a lower general salary threshold than in the past. There is also the existing Youth Mobility Scheme which is open to those aged between 18 and 30 and offers a two-year grant of leave in the UK. There are 1,000 places currently available each year and places from Hong Kong were underused in 2021.</p>
