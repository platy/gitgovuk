<span class="number">3. </span>Information: Universal Infant Free School Meal (UIFSM) funding allocations</h2>

<p>We will publish the final UIFSM allocations for 2021 to 2022 and the provisional allocations for 2022 to 2023 this week.</p>

<p>For the final allocations for 2021 to 2022 we have returned to the usual methodology. This follows the temporary approach used last year due to the pandemic related school opening restrictions. The per meal rate of Â£2.34 has been applied.</p>

<p>Beginning from 1 April 2022, the per meal rate has been increased to Â£2.41. There is an additional payment in the 2021 to 2022 final allocations to backdate the uplift for the period April to August 2022.</p>

<p>The provisional allocations for 2022 to 2023 have been calculated using the total number of eligible meals in 2021 to 2022 with the new per meal rate of Â£2.41 applied.</p>

<h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Information: cost of school uniforms</h2>

<p>Schools will be aware that the Department published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cost-of-school-uniforms">new statutory guidance on the cost of school uniforms</a> in November 2021.</p>

<p>Schools should be compliant with much of the guidance by September 2022. The ârequirements for schoolsâ section sets out the actions that schools need to take before parents seek to purchase or acquire uniform items in summer 2022.</p>

<p>This includes a requirement for schools to make sure that second-hand uniforms are available for parents to acquire (either from the school directly or from an established scheme). While schools can decide the particular&nbsp;method&nbsp;they are going to use to make the provision of second-hand uniforms&nbsp;available, all schools should ensure that information on second-hand uniform is clear for parents of current and prospective pupils and published on the schoolâs website.</p>

<p>We expect schools to be engaging with parents and pupils to ensure that any required changes are in place ahead of September 2022.</p>
