<span class="number">1. </span>Action: update individualised learner record (ILR) for apprentices on frameworks by 4 August 2022</h2>

<p>The ILR currently shows a significant number of apprentices on apprenticeship frameworks. Many have a planned end date approaching, or having now past these dates, and are still recorded as in active learning.</p>

<p>Please ensure records for these apprentices are up to date including the completion status.</p>

<p>We require all providers to update the ILR for all apprentices on frameworks who are no longer actively working towards completion, in the R12 return by 4 August 2022.</p>

<p>You can read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/removal-of-apprenticeship-frameworks">withdrawal of apprenticeship frameworks</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: local authority high needs funding: 2022 to 2023 operational guide survey</h2>

<p>We’d like to gather user feedback on the content and format of the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs funding: 2022 to 2023 operational guide</a>. We’ll use feedback received from the survey to inform and shape future publications of the guide.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dferesearch.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6gLlOLbU8R90ZGm?jfefe=new" rel="external">access the survey</a> and submit your responses by 27 June 2022. Please note, this survey is optional.</p>

<p>The survey should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact us via email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CRM.QUERIES@education.gov.uk">CRM.QUERIES@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your participation and contributions – the views of our audience are important to us and will help improve the accessibility of future publications.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Reminder: user survey for the post-16 funding monitoring reports dashboard</h2>

<p>All post-16 providers and MCAs/GLA can give feedback on the post-16 monitoring reports <a class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/welcome" rel="external">dashboard</a> in the second annual survey. You can access the survey via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yXfS-grGoU2187O4s0qC-U8YXhnL365HlSORDajdWvVUQjVEUEtUTjhUTVlOQjM4U1lIUkdQS0NRNy4u" rel="external">the survey link</a> or from the dashboard landing page until the 22 July 2022. Please take a moment to tell us what’s working and suggest changes that may make your dashboard experience even better.</p>

<p>Following last year’s feedback, we added the category ‘Employer provider’ to the VYED sign in page, simplified graphical and tabular displays, and incorporated the Known Issues log.</p>

<p>This is your opportunity to tell us how you find your way around the funding monitoring reports and guidance, manage to download and filter data, and how useful the graphs and tables are.</p>

<p>So far, we’ve received wide ranging feedback and would like to encourage providers to perhaps consult their colleagues, view the dashboard together, consider their answers carefully and submit a team reply.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span>Reminder: updating course directory with apprenticeship training offer</h2>

<p>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1051720/ESFA_Apprenticeship_Agreement_for_Training_Providers__January_2022_.pdf" rel="external">apprenticeship agreement</a>, main apprenticeship training providers are required to provide up to date information, through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-apprenticeship-training-how-to-submit-data">Publish to the course directory</a>, about the apprenticeships they offer which are funded by ESFA.</p>

<p>Course Directory data and information is shared with employers when they use ESFA’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-find-apprenticeship-training">Find apprenticeship training</a> online search facility, to find apprenticeship standards and identify approved providers that can deliver training.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-find-apprenticeship-training">Find apprenticeship training</a> provides information to employers about a training provider’s organisation and their apprenticeship offer, including the geographical areas they cover, helping to inform employer choice. It is important that this information is up to date so that employers and ESFA have an accurate view of coverage of apprenticeship provision across all apprenticeships.</p>

<p>To ensure compliance with your apprenticeship agreement, we are asking all providers to ensure their information is up to date and complete. You can add new apprenticeships, edit and update existing apprenticeships and remove those you no longer offer through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-apprenticeship-training-how-to-submit-data">Publish to the course directory</a>.</p>

<p>You may also find reading the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-apprenticeship-training-how-to-submit-data/information-for-training-providers-on-submitting-your-apprenticeship-training-provision-through-publish-to-the-course-directory">guidance</a> about submitting your apprenticeship training provision through Publish to the course directory helpful.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: reconciliation thresholds for under and over-delivery for ESFA adult education budget (AEB) academic year 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>We have increased the AEB over-delivery <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-funding-claims">threshold for the academic year 2021 to 2022</a> from 103% to 110%.</p>

<p>This applies to ESFA grant and contract funded AEB adult skills and brings the over-delivery threshold in line with that for Free Courses for Jobs and 19 to 24 traineeships.</p>

<p>The under-delivery threshold for ESFA AEB adult skills for grant-funded providers has not changed and remains at 97% as previously published.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact your territorial team or use our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">online enquiry form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: update on the post-16 capacity fund for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>Eight additional post-16 providers that bid to the post-16 capacity fund in 2021 and were the next highest scoring applications are to receive funding in 2022 to 2023 as a result of the Department securing a small amount of additional funding for 2022 to 2023. One further project is under consideration. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/post-16-capacity-fund-2021-to-2022-successful-applications">Further information is available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Additional post- 16 capacity funding was secured in the 2021 Spending Review for the three years from 2022 to 2025. This is to support post-16 providers to provide additional capacity to accommodate the demographic increases in 16 to 19 learners from 2022 onwards. Details of the next bidding process and how much funding is available will be announced in due course. The post-16 capacity fund has so far provided capital support for a total of 47 post-16 providers.</p>

<p>Any questions please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:post16.capacityfund@education.gov.uk">post16.capacityfund@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: updated traineeship framework for delivery</h2>

<p>Next month we will be publishing a revised traineeship framework for delivery. The framework aims to be more concise and provide those reading a clearer idea of what a traineeship involves.</p>

<p>One area that has been highlighted where the framework was a little unclear, is around where a work experience should take place. The revised framework will confirm that the work experience placement should be with an external employer at their premises and face to face. A virtual work experience placement is not considered a valid work experience placement for the traineeship programme. A face-to face experience ensures that the trainees get the best support and development they need whilst also experiencing a true work-based environment. This will be fully enforced from the 1 August 2022.</p>
