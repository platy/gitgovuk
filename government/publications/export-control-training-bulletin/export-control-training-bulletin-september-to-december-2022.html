<h2>Strategic export control learning path</h2>

<p>You should review the learning path and think carefully about what you need to achieve from these courses, before deciding which level suits you best.</p>

<h2>Targeted courses</h2>

<h3>Licences workshop - regional</h3>

<p>Duration: half day</p>

<p>Cost: £120</p>

<p>Pre-course knowledge: You may have some experience of making licence applications and undertaken prior training from the learning path.</p>

<h4>Course content</h4>

<p>This workshop aims to improve the permissions exporters get to export strategically controlled military and dual-use items. This reduces the number of licences required and improves compliance.</p>

<p>With the wealth of export control licences available to UK exporters, finding the right one to enable your company to export efficiently can be daunting. Based on course feedback, input from the SPIRE replacement program (LITE), and our Compliance Unit, this course is a development of our ‘Making Better Licence Applications’ workshop and aimed at guiding exporters through the licence types available; deciding which one is right for your export.</p>

<p>Attendees will first be taken through the core <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/standard-individual-export-licences">standard individual export licence (<abbr title="standard and individual export licences">SIEL</abbr>)</a> application screens to demonstrate how prior planning can reduce the number of ‘Requests For Information’ (<abbr title="Requests For Information">RFIs</abbr>), work and number of licences required.</p>

<p>The course will then turn to open general licences (OGLs and <abbr title="general export authorisations">GEAs</abbr>); covering what is available, online resources and how to read OGLs to improve compliance with the terms and conditions.</p>

<h3>Making better licence applications: London only - on demand</h3>

<p>Duration: half day</p>
