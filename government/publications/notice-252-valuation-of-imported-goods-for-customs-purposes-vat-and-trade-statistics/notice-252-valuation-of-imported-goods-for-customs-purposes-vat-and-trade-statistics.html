<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> What this notice is about</h3>

<p>There are a number of methods for establishing the value on which Customs Duty and import VAT is calculated. The same value is also used for trade statistics. This notice explains what the methods are and when they may be used.</p>

<p>This notice explains our view of the law, and nothing in it overrides the law.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Trading and moving goods in and out of Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>Under the Northern Ireland Protocol Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) valuation rules will continue to apply to goods imported into Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> valuation rules operate in a similar way to the UKs rules for goods imported into the UK or GB from third world countries. Apart from a variation to the list of products covered by the <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trading-and-moving-goods-in-and-out-of-northern-ireland">goods moving in and out of Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Who should read this notice</h3>

<p>It is mainly for importers and their clearing agents. The notice is written as though you are the importer unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Why you need a value for Customs Duty</h3>

<p>We often charge Customs Duty as a percentage of the value of your goods â€” we call this â€˜ad valorem dutyâ€™. The amount of duty you must pay depends on the customs value of your goods. The rules for arriving at the customs value are based on the World Trade Organisation (<abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr>) Valuation Agreement (previously known as the â€˜General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (<abbr title="General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade">GATT</abbr>) Agreementâ€™).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> What law covers customs valuation?</h3>

<p>In the UK valuation is covered by the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 &amp; The Customs (Import Duty) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018.</p>

<p>In the Northern Ireland the Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) applies. Regulations 952/2013 &amp; 2015/2477 can be found on the EU legislation website Eur-lex.</p>

<p>For imports to the UK before 01/01/2021 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> legislation should be applied.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> Import VAT</h3>

<p>VAT due at import is treated like a Customs Duty. The amount of VAT you must pay depends on the value of the goods. The rules for arriving at this value are set out in the Value Added Tax Act 1994, section 19.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span> What are trade statistics?</h3>

<p>We have to collect and compile trade statistics for the UK. You must always declare a value for trade statistics on the import entry or removal document from customs warehousing. This value must be declared in the value for duty whether or not ad valorem duty is to be paid or the goods are to be entered to a customs warehouse.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Customs Duty</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Where can I find out if I have to pay â€˜ad valorem Customs Dutyâ€™?</h3>

<p>In the UK Trade Tariff. This lists all the Customs Duty rates, commodity codes and procedures relating to imported goods. You can ask for details from our Helpline.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> How do I arrive at the value for Customs Duty?</h3>

<p>You do this by using one of 6 â€˜methodsâ€™. You must try Method 1 before going on to Method 2 and so on. We may ask you to explain why an earlier Method cannot be used. The only exception to the order of trying the methods is that you may try Method 5 before Method 4 if you wish. Under Method 4 you can use the Simplified Procedure Values (<abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr>) system (for goods imported on consignment) (see section 9) if you import fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>However, the normal Method of valuation is Method 1 (the transaction value Method). You must use this Method wherever possible and in fact it is used for over 90% of importations liable to ad valorem Customs Duty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Must I produce evidence to support the value for Customs Duty?</h3>

<p>Yes. The evidence for each method is described in the relevant sections. You must produce any documents and information about an importation which one of our officers requires. You may also be required to allow officers to inspect or take extracts from any relevant document.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> How long must I keep customs records?</h3>

<p>You must keep them for a period of at least 4 years.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> What if I cannot arrive at the value for Customs Duty?</h3>

<p>You can ask for release of your goods by paying the undisputed charges outright and securing the balance by cash or cheque â€” we call this a deposit. When the value is agreed you may be asked to pay more duty or you may get a refund â€” we call this adjusting the deposit. If the deposit equals the amount of duty due youâ€™ll be told â€” we call this bringing the deposit to account. As an alternative to a cash deposit, you may be able to use a guarantee, underwritten by a bank. The Helpline will be able to advise you further.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> What do I do if I disagree with a customs decision?</h3>

<p>If you do not agree with the decision issued to you, there are 2 options available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you want a review you should write back to the decision maker within 30 days of the date of letter, giving your reasons why you do not agree with their decision</li>
  <li>appeal direct to the tribunal who are independent of HMRC</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose to have your case reviewed youâ€™ll still be able to appeal to the tribunal if you disagree with the outcome.</p>

<p>More information about reviews and appeals is in leaflet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-revenue-and-customs-decisions-what-to-do-if-you-disagree">HMRC1: HM Revenue and Customs decisions â€” what to do if you disagree</a>.

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Method 1</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> What is Method 1?</h3>

<p>It is the first method you must try. It is called the â€˜transaction valueâ€™.</p>

<p>It is the normal method of valuation which applies to over 90% of importations liable to ad valorem Customs Duty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> What is meant by â€˜transaction valueâ€™?</h3>

<p>This is the price paid or payable by the buyer to the seller for the goods when sold for export to the UK adjusted in accordance with specific rules explained in detail in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p>This may also cover situations where goods are imported from a processor. The â€˜transaction valueâ€™ may be â€˜built upâ€™ or â€˜constructedâ€™ by reference to the cost of processing plus any items to be added in accordance with paragraph 3.14, particularly sub-paragraph (d). Such items are commonly referred to as â€˜assistsâ€™.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> How can a sale for export be demonstrated?</h3>
<p>Where it can be demonstrated that there are specific and relevant circumstances which led to export of the goods to the customs territory of the UK. Ways in which you can do this include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods are manufactured according to UK specifications, or are identified (according to, for example, the marks they bear) as having no other use or destination</li>
  <li>the goods in question were manufactured or produced specifically for a buyer in the UK</li>
  <li>specific goods are ordered from an intermediary who sources the goods from a manufacturer and the goods are shipped directly to the UK from that manufacturer</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of sales for export to the UK are given in Section 26.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> What if there is no sale?</h3>

<p>This rules out Method 1. You must try Method 2. Ignore the rest of this section and go direct to section 4.</p>

<p>Examples of situations where there is no sale are given in section 25.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> How do I arrive at the customs value?</h3>

<p>You base it on the price actually paid or payable by the buyer to the seller for the goods. This means the total payment made or to be made by the buyer to or for the benefit of the seller for the imported goods. It includes all payments made or to be made as a condition of sale of the imported goods by the buyer to the seller or by the buyer to a third party to satisfy an obligation of the seller. Thus periodic payments (such as monthly, quarterly, annually) or â€˜one offâ€™ payments by the buyer to the seller for the imported goods must be taken into account (for example, tooling charges, engineering fees, development costs).</p>

<p>The buyer of the imported goods need not necessarily be established in the country of importation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> What evidence of the price paid or payable must I produce?</h3>

<p>A copy of the sellerâ€™s invoice or other document against which payment will be made. This will include any document used instead of an invoice irrespective of its form of presentation, insofar as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authenticity of the document is not in doubt</li>
  <li>the information contained in the document is suitable for supporting the particulars declared or the information required (see also paragraph 2.3).</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> What if customs have doubts about the transaction value?</h3>

<p>Where we have doubts that the declared transaction value represents the total amount paid or payable, we will ask you for more information. If those doubts continue we shall notify you (in writing if you request) of the grounds for those doubts before making a final decision about the acceptability of the declared value. Youâ€™ll be given a reasonable opportunity to respond. Then we will make a final decision and notify you of it in writing (see paragraph 2.6 if you disagree with a customs decision).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> What if the sale is subject to any restrictions?</h3>

<p>If the sale is subject to conditions which restrict your freedom to dispose of or sell the goods as you wish you may not be able to use Method 1 (see section 27).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span> What if I am related to the seller of the goods?</h3>

<p>The fact that you are related to the seller of the goods does not mean that Method 1 cannot be used. The price paid or payable is still acceptable unless as a result of the relationship you get a reduced price. You must demonstrate this is at armâ€™s length (see section 28).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> What does â€˜relatedâ€™ to the seller mean?</h3>

<p>(1) Persons A and B are related persons for the purposes of this Part in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(a)where B is a body corporate, A is an officer of B</li>
  <li>(b)A and B are partners in the same business</li>
  <li>(c)A is an employee of B</li>
  <li>(d)the same person controls a business carried on by A and a business carried on by B</li>
  <li>(e)A controls a business carried on by B</li>
  <li>(f)A and B jointly control the business of another person; or</li>
  <li>(g)A is a member of the same family as B</li>
</ul>

<p>(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1):</p>

<ul>
  <li>(a)a person controls a business carried on by another person where the latter is accustomed to conduct the business in accordance with the directions of the former</li>
  <li>(b)a person also controls a business carried on by another person where the control is exercised through a third person who acts on that personâ€™s direction</li>
  <li>(c)where a business is carried on by a company, a person controls that business where that person holds 5% or more of the voting rights in the company; and</li>
  <li>(d)a business referred to is not limited to a business involved in the importation of the chargeable goods presented to Customs</li>
</ul>

<p>(3) In paragraph (1)(g), â€˜A is a member of the same family as Bâ€™ where a relationship exists directly or indirectly between A and B which arises through blood, adoption, marriage, civil partnership or co-habitation.</p>

<p>But if you act as the sellerâ€™s agent, distributor or concessionaire you are related only if one of the above categories also applies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span> If Iâ€™m an intermediary (such as a selling agent) or branch office can I use Method 1?</h3>

<p>You may be able to use Method 1. Section 29 for selling agents or 30 for branch offices give further information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.12 </span> Does it matter if I pay the seller direct?</h3>

<p>No. You can pay a third party if the seller says so.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.13 </span> Does it matter if I pay in cash?</h3>

<p>No. You can also pay by letters of credit or negotiable instrument.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.14 </span> What items must I add to the price paid or payable?</h3>

<p>You must add the following to the price you pay (unless they are already included):</p>

<p>Delivery costs. The costs of transport, insurance, loading or handling connected with delivering the goods to the UK border must be included. Section 15 gives further details.</p>

<p>(b) Commissions. Certain payments of commission and brokerage, including selling commission, must be included. Section 29 gives more details about selling agents.</p>

<p>But you can exclude buying commission if it is shown separately from the price paid or payable for the goods (see paragraph 3.15(f) and section 31).</p>

<p>(c) Royalties and licence fees. You must include these payments when they relate to the imported goods and are paid by you as a condition of the sale to you of those goods.</p>

<p>You can find further information in section 32.</p>

<p>(d) Goods and services provided free of charge or at reduced cost by the buyer. If you provide, directly or indirectly, any of the following, you must include in the customs value any part of the cost or value not included in the price charged to you by the seller:</p>

<p>(i) materials, components, parts and similar items incorporated in the imported goods including price tags, kimball tags, labels</p>

<p>(ii) tools, dies, moulds and similar items used in producing the imported goods, for example, tooling charges â€” there are various ways of apportioning these charges</p>

<p>(iii) materials consumed in producing the imported goods, for example, abrasives, lubricants, catalysts, reagents etc which are used up in the manufacture of the goods but are not incorporated in them</p>

<p>(iv) engineering, development, artwork, design work and plans and sketches carried out outside the UK and necessary for producing the imported goods â€” the cost of research and preliminary design sketches is not to be included</p>

<p>If you make any payments (periodically or â€˜one offâ€™) to the seller for any of the above goods and services, you must include the amounts in the customs value (see paragraph 3.5).</p>

<p>(e) Containers and packing, include the cost of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>containers which are treated for customs purposes as being one with the goods being valued (that is not freight containers the hire-cost of which forms part of the transport costs)</li>
  <li>packing whether for labour or materials</li>
</ul>

<p>Where containers are for repeated use, for example, reusable bottles, you can spread their cost over the expected number of imports. If a number of the containers may not be re-exported, this must be allowed for.</p>

<p>(f) Proceeds of resale. If you are to share with the seller (if directly or indirectly) the profit on resale, use or disposal of the imported goods you must add the sellerâ€™s share to the price paid (but see paragraph 3.15(d) as regards dividends). For example, if the seller is to have 30% of the profit which you receive, this is to be added to the price paid or payable. If at the time of importation the amount of profit is not known, you must request release of the goods against a deposit or guarantee (see paragraph 2.5).</p>

<p>(g) Export Duty and taxes paid in the country of origin or export. When these taxes are incurred by the buyer they are dutiable. However, if you benefit from tax relief or repayment of these taxes they may be left out of the customs value.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.15 </span> Can I leave out any items from the customs value?</h3>

<p>Yes. The following items may be left out of the customs value:</p>

<p>(a) Delivery costs in the UK. If the sellerâ€™s or carrierâ€™s charge covers delivery beyond the UK border you may deduct the additional charges for such delivery, providing they are shown separately from the price paid or payable for the goods. Section 15 gives more details.</p>

<p>(b) UK duties or taxes. You can deduct from the price you pay any included Customs Duty or other taxes which are payable in the UK because of the importation or sale of the goods.</p>

<p>To find the amount of duty included in the invoice price, use the formula:</p>

<p>Duty inclusive invoice price Ã— duty rate Ã· (100 + duty rate)</p>

<p>For example, if the duty inclusive invoice price is Â£1,100 and the rate of duty is 10% the duty included in that invoice price is:</p>

<p>Â£1,100 Ã— 10 Ã· (100 + 10)   =   Â£11,000 Ã· 110 = Â£100</p>

<p>Therefore the included duty is Â£100.</p>

<p>Note: the included duty is the last item to be deducted.</p>

<p>(c) Discounts. These can only be left out where they relate to the imported goods being valued and there is a valid contractual entitlement to the discount at the material time for valuation. Discounts (such as contingency or retroactive discounts) related to previous importations cannot be claimed in full on the current importation.</p>

<p>(i) Quantity or trade discounts. You can leave out these discounts where earned. In other words the price paid or payable net of these discounts is acceptable. If you are related to the seller the discounts will also be allowed if that relationship has not affected the price of the goods (see paragraph 28.1).</p>

<p>(ii) Cash and early settlement discounts. You can also leave out these discounts on the following basis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when the payment reflecting the discount has been made at the time of entry to free circulation</li>
  <li>if the payment has not been made at the time of entry to free circulation, it will be allowed at the level declared provided it is a discount generally accepted within the trade sector concerned</li>
  <li>if the discount is higher than is generally accepted within the trade sector concerned it will only be accepted if you can demonstrate, where required, that the goods are actually sold at the price declared as the price actually paid or payable and the discount is still available at the time of entry to free circulation</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: if you never take advantage of a cash discount and always pay the gross contract price for the goods, the discount may become liable for inclusion in the customs value at the time of entry to free circulation. For further information you should contact our Helpline.</p>

<p>(d) Dividends. You can leave out dividend payments you make to the seller.</p>

<p>(e) Marketing activities related to the imported goods. You are not required to include in the customs value the cost of the following activities which you carry out at your own expense:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advertising</li>
  <li>promotion</li>
  <li>guarantee or warranty services</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition any payments that you make towards general marketing support which are not related to imported goods, should not be included.</p>

<p>Note: the cost of marketing activities borne by the seller are to be included in the customs value even if they are charged separately from the invoice price for the goods.</p>

<p>(f) Buying commission. You may leave out fees or brokerage paid to your agent for representing you outside the UK in buying imported goods, providing the commission is shown separately from the price paid or payable for the goods.</p>

<p>See section 31 for further details.</p>

<p>Note: buying commission is only to be included in the value for VAT where the buyer in the sale on which the customs value is based is not registered for UK VAT (see paragraph 22.2 for further details).</p>

<p>(g) Interest charges. These may be left out if they are payable under a financing arrangement for buying the imported goods, providing the charges are shown separately from the price paid or payable for the goods.</p>

<p>See section 33 for further details.</p>

<p>(h) Rights of reproduction. Payments for these rights may be left out if they are shown separately from the price paid or payable for the goods.</p>

<p>(i) Post-importation work. You may leave out charges for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>construction work</li>
  <li>erecting</li>
  <li>assembling</li>
  <li>maintaining</li>
  <li>giving technical help</li>
</ul>

<p>for goods such as industrial plant, machinery or heavy equipment. The work may be carried out before or after importation so long as it relates to the imported goods and the charge is shown separately from the price paid or payable for the goods.</p>

<p>(j) Management fees. You can leave out management fees that you pay to the seller. This would include general service fees for administration, marketing, accounting, and so on, that are not related to the imported goods.</p>

<p>Note: you may need to produce evidence to support any claim to leave any of the items mentioned in this paragraph out of the customs value.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.16 </span> What can I do if, at the time of entry, I cannot arrive at a value for an item that:</h3>

<p>(a) I must add to the price paid or payable?</p>

<p>(b) I may leave out of the customs value?</p>

<p>You can ask us to agree to a simplified procedure for arriving at an appropriate amount to add or exclude at the time of entry. This could involve the use of average values or a percentage addition or deduction and be subject to periodic reviews. However, a retrospective price adjustment would not meet the criteria for a simplification (see section 28.3).</p>

<p>Send your request, saying why you need to use a simplified procedure together with details of how the amounts will be determined, to:</p>

<span class="number">4. </span> Method 2</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> What is Method 2?</h3>

<p>It is the second Method you must try. It is based on the customs value of identical goods exported to the UK at or about the same time as the goods to be valued.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> What is meant by â€˜identical goodsâ€™?</h3>

<p>These are goods produced in the same country as those being valued.</p>

<p>They must also be the same in all respects, such as physical characteristics, quality and reputation. Minor differences in appearance do not matter. If the producer of the Method 2 goods does not produce Method 1 goods, another producerâ€™s goods may be used for comparison.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> What if there are no identical goods?</h3>

<p>This rules out Method 2. You must try Method 3. Ignore the rest of this section and go direct to section 5.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> How do I arrive at the customs value?</h3>

<p>You base it on a customs value of identical goods already accepted by UK customs under Method 1. Where there is a sale at the same commercial level and in the same quantity this must be used.</p>

<p>If more than one value is available use the lowest.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> What if there are no sales at the same level or in the same quantity?</h3>

<p>You may use sales at a different commercial level or in different quantities. But when arriving at the customs value you must take into account any effect these differences have on the price. There are examples in section 34.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Are there any other differences I must take into account?</h3>

<p>Yes. You must take account of differences between the costs of delivering the identical goods and delivering the goods to be valued.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span> What evidence must I produce?</h3>

<p>A copy of, or the necessary data to enable us to trace, an import entry (with supporting documents) for identical goods where Method 1 has been accepted by UK customs. This entry must relate to identical goods exported at or about the same time as the goods to be valued. This is to ensure that the goods to be valued and the identical imported goods will have been exported within a timescale in which the price of the goods would not have changed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> What if identical goods are to be valued under both Method 1 and Method 2?</h3>

<p>If some of the goods are sent free of charge, (see section 10) and they are entered on the same import entry, the evidence provided with that entry can be used to establish both the customs values.</p>

<p>We may need a copy of the producerâ€™s price list where differences for level or quantity have to be taken into account (see paragraph 4.5 and section 34).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Method 3</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> What is Method 3?</h3>

<p>It is the third Method you must try. It is based on the customs value of similar goods exported to the UK at or about the same time as the goods to be valued.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> What is meant by â€˜similar goodsâ€™?</h3>

<p>These are goods which differ in some respects from the goods being valued but they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are produced in the same country</li>
  <li>can carry out the same tasks</li>
  <li>are commercially interchangeable</li>
</ul>

<p>Where similar goods are not made by the producer of the goods to be valued, you can use similar goods produced by a different person.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> What if there are no similar goods?</h3>

<p>This rules out Method 3. You now have a choice to either try Method 4 (explained in section 6) or Method 5 (explained in section 7).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> What are the conditions for using Method 3?</h3>

<p>The conditions are the same as for Method 2, see section 4.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Method 4</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> What is Method 4?</h3>

<p>It is the fourth Method you can try. It is based on the selling price of the goods in the UK.</p>

<p>Remember that Method 5 can be tried before Method 4 if you wish.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> How do I arrive at the customs value?</h3>

<p>The customs value is based on the price of each item (unit price) at which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the imported goods</li>
  <li>identical imported goods (see paragraph 4.2)</li>
  <li>similar imported goods (see paragraph 5.2)</li>
</ul>

<p>are sold in the UK in the condition as imported to customers unrelated to the seller. The unit price must relate to sales in the greatest aggregate quantity (see paragraph 6.6) at or about the time of the importation of the goods to be valued.</p>

<p>You must be able to produce details of the sales in the greatest aggregate quantity at the time of entry into free circulation.</p>

<p>In the UK this is known as â€˜Method 4(a)â€™.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> What if there is no sale at or about the time of importation?</h3>

<p>You can base the customs value on the unit price of the actual sales of the imported goods that take place up to 90 days after importation.</p>

<p>As you cannot establish the customs value until the goods have been sold you must request release against a deposit (see paragraph 2.5).</p>

<p>In the UK this is known as â€˜Method 4(b)â€™.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> What if the goods are not sold in the UK in the condition as imported?</h3>

<p>If you want to, you can base the customs value on the price at which the goods are sold after processing.</p>

<p>But you cannot do this if the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lose their identity (unless you can accurately and easily establish the value added by the processing)</li>
  <li>keep their identity but form a minor part of the goods sold</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> What if there are no sales to unrelated persons in the UK?</h3>

<p>This rules out Method 4. You must try Method 5 (explained in section 7) if youâ€™ve not already considered it. Otherwise go to section 8.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span> How do I arrive at the â€˜sale in the greatest aggregate quantityâ€™?</h3>

<p>You add together the number of items sold at each price. The largest number of items sold at one price is the greatest aggregate quantity. See section 35 for examples.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span> What deductions must I make from the unit price?</h3>

<p>You must deduct the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>either the commissions usually paid or agreed to be paid or the addition usually made for profit and general expenses in connection with sales in the UK of imported goods of the same class or kind</li>
  <li>the usual costs of transport, insurance and associated costs incurred in the UK</li>
  <li>UK customs duties and internal taxes payable in the country of importation</li>
</ul>

<p>Also if the goods are sold after processing (see paragraph 6.4) deduct the value added by the processing carried out in the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span> Can I deduct my actual profit and general expenses?</h3>

<p>Yes unless your figures are out of line with those usual for sales in the UK of imported goods of the same class or kind.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.9 </span> What if customs challenge the deduction I have made?</h3>

<p>We will produce other relevant information relating to additions for profit and general expenses made by importers of goods identical or similar to those to be valued. Therefore you should have available information to show that the deduction youâ€™ve made is â€˜usualâ€™ by comparison with importers within your trade sector. Because this is a complex subject we recommend that you contact the Helpline to agree a deduction before you begin importing the goods concerned.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.10 </span> What is meant by â€˜goods of the same class or kindâ€™?</h3>

<p>This term means goods which fall within a group or range of goods produced by a particular industry or sector of industry. It includes identical (see paragraph 4.2) and similar (see paragraph 5.2) goods. The goods need not have been imported from the same country as the goods being valued.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.11 </span> What evidence must I produce?</h3>

<p>Method 4(a) â€” you must produce with the import entry one of the following showing the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a sales invoice</li>
  <li>a price list current at the time of importation</li>
  <li>other evidence as agreed with us</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless an overall percentage deduction has been agreed with us, we also need details of the actual deductions claimed.</p>

<p>Method 4(b) â€” at the time of importation. You must give a reasonable estimate of the final sales value for deposit purposes (see paragraph 2.5). This estimate must be supported by a pro-forma invoice, statement of value or other evidence. For importations of fresh fruit and vegetables and cut flowers, you do not have to wait until all the goods are sold to establish the Customs value. Once youâ€™ve sold enough to arrive at the unit price you must send copies of the sales invoices and a copy of your calculations to the National Import Duty Adjustment Centre (<abbr title="National Import Duty Adjustment Centre">NIDAC</abbr>). Unless an overall percentage deduction has been agreed with us, we will also need details of the actual deductions claimed. Duty will either be taken to account, refunded or called for (see paragraph 2.5).</p>

<p>In the fresh fruit and vegetable and cut flowers trade the account sales procedure may be used as a basis for arriving at the duty payable (see section 36 for more information).</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cds-uk-trade-tariff-volume-3-import-declaration-completion-guide">Customs Declaration Service instructions for completing imports</a> if you are submitting your declarations through this service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Method 5</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> What is Method 5?</h3>

<p>It is the fifth Method you can try. It is based on the costs of production of the goods. Usually it can only be used where the importer and supplier are related (see paragraph 3.10).</p>

<p>Remember you can try this Method before Method 4 if you wish.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> How do I arrive at the customs value?</h3>

<p>The customs value is a built-up value. It is based on the sum of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the cost or value of materials and fabrication or other processing used in producing the imported goods including:<br>
</li>
  <li>the items detailed in paragraph 3.14(d) if supplied by the buyer, directly or indirectly, even if the work listed in paragraph 3.14(d)(iv) is carried out in the UK you must include the value of the work in the customs value if you charge the producer of the goods to be valued for that work<br>
</li>
  <li>containers and packing (see paragraph 3.14(e))</li>
  <li>an amount for the producerâ€™s profit and general expense</li>
  <li>the cost of transport, insurance and loading or handling connected with delivering the goods to the UK border</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> What evidence must I produce?</h3>

<p>You must be able to get information about the cost or value of the items in paragraph 7.2. This information must be based on the producerâ€™s commercial accounts. These accounts must follow the general principles of accounting, which apply in the country where the goods are produced.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> What other evidence is required?</h3>

<p>You must also be able to get information about the producerâ€™s profit and general expenses. The amount to be added must be in line with the usual figures for profit and general expenses for producers in the country of exportation of the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>of the same class or kind (see paragraph 6.10)</li>
  <li>for export to the UK</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span> What if customs challenge the producerâ€™s figures for profit and general expenses?</h3>

<p>We will produce other relevant information relating to figures for profit and general expenses reflected in sales by other producers who export to the UK. Such figures will relate to producers of identical or similar goods in the same country of export as the goods to be valued.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span> What if I cannot get this information?</h3>

<p>This rules out Method 5. If youâ€™ve already unsuccessfully tried Method 4 (explained in section 6) you must now use Method 6 (explained in section 8).</p>

<h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.8 </span> Can I get help to work out this Method?</h3>

<p>Yes, but we know from experience that this Method is difficult and therefore is rarely used. For further advice you should contact the Helpline.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Method 6</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> What is Method 6?</h3>

<p>It is the final Method and is called the â€˜fall-backâ€™ Method.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> How do I arrive at the customs value?</h3>

<p>You must arrive at the customs value by using reasonable means consistent with the <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr> Valuation principles.</p>

<p>You do this where possible by adapting Methods 1 to 5 flexibly to fit unusual circumstances:</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>Methods 2 or 3. The customs value could be based on the transaction value of identical or similar imported goods produced in a country other than the country of exportation of the goods being valued.</p>

<p>Method 4(b). The 90 days limit for sales could be extended.</p>

<p>The customs value could be based on the price that would have been paid for the goods if they had been purchased (perhaps by reference to the export price list for sales to the UK issued by the supplier). This approach would be consistent with <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr> valuation principles.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span> What evidence must I produce?</h3>

<p>This depends on which Method is being flexibly used. For further advice you should contact the Helpline.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> <abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> What are <abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr>?</h3>

<p>They are customs values derived from prices realised on sales in specified marketing centres in the UK. A variety of deductions are made from these prices to arrive at an average sterling value per 100 kilogram net for each product covered by the scheme.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span> <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> in Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>If you are using <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> values in NI they are operated under <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> rules. The list of commodities, periods of validity, and values you must use are different from the UK.</p>

<p>Annex 23-02 of COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/2447 lists the commodities and periods of validity, and the <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> values can be found on the EUs TARIC Consultation database.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span> What fruit and vegetables does the scheme cover?</h3>

<p>A list is given in section 37. Importers connected to Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) can obtain these details from the relevant data files.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span> When can I use <abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr>?</h3>

<p>You can only use the <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> scheme for whole fruit and vegetable produce, of a single kind, imported on a consignment basis.</p>

<p>Excluded from the scheme are fruit or vegetable products that have undergone a cut and dicing process prior to importation.</p>

<p>You cannot use the <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> system if there is a transaction value. The goods must be valued using Method 1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.5 </span> Can I change my mind about using the <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> scheme during a calendar year?</h3>

<p>Yes, there are no restrictions on changing between <abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr> and other valuation Methods during that year. Remember that if there is a transaction value, Method 1 must always be used.</p>

<p>Note: once the goods have been entered to <abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr> you can never have the entry amended to, for example, Method 4(b) nor may goods be entered against security pending a choice between <abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr> and any other Method.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.6 </span> How often do the <abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr> change?</h3>

<p>Fortnightly, starting midnight Thursday/Friday.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.7 </span> How can I find out the current <abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr>?</h3>

<p>A list of the values is available The Fresh Produce Consortium (UK) is also told the values for the benefit of their members.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> to be used is the value applying when the import entry is accepted by us.</p>

<p>Note: when a <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> rate is not available to use as the basis of value you must use Method 4(b) to value goods imported on consignment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.8 </span> Can I get a refund of duty on goods which are received in a state unfit for human consumption or have to be destroyed?</h3>

<p>Yes, if you can show that 5% or more of the consignment was unfit for human consumption (before entry into free circulation). Duty will be refunded on that part of the consignment which is unfit for human consumption. Check guidance on refunds and waivers on customs debt for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/refunds-and-waivers-on-customs-debt">advice on repayments</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.9 </span> What if the goods are received in a damaged state?</h3>

<p>If you can show that the damage occurred before entry into free circulation and the value of the consignment has decreased by at least 20% the <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> rate will be apportioned accordingly.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<p>If the value of the consignment has decreased by 40%, the customs value will be based on 60% of the <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.10 </span> What evidence must I produce?</h3>

<p>You must show by what percentage the goods were damaged or unfit for human consumption before they were released from our control. This must be done by producing a statement from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our officer who examined the goods</li>
  <li>the Port Health Official</li>
  <li>an independent expert such as an insurance assessor or a surveyor who is acceptable to us</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Valuing free of charge goods</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span> Can I use Method 1?</h3>

<p>Not normally, because there is no price paid or payable by you to the supplier.</p>

<p>But you may be able to use Method 1 where you are importing the goods pre-sold and you can produce evidence of that sale.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span> If I cannot use Method 1, how else can I arrive at the customs value?</h3>

<p>You can try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Methods 2 or 3 (see sections 4 or 5) if you import or have knowledge of imports of identical or similar goods under Method 1</li>
  <li>Method 4 (see section 6) if you sell the goods or identical or similar goods to unrelated customers in the UK</li>
  <li>Method 5 (see section 7) if you can get the detailed costings</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span> What if I cannot use any of these Methods?</h3>

<p>You must use Method 6 (see section 8). The customs value can be based, for example, on the price you would have paid the supplier if you had bought the goods. You must add or leave out the items detailed in paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15 as appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span> What evidence must I produce under Method 6?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the supplierâ€™s current export price list for goods sold to the UK</li>
  <li>a statement from the supplier of the value of the goods</li>
  <li>other evidence as agreed with us</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Valuing free of charge replacement goods</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Replacement goods in the same shipment</h3>

<p>If the supplier includes in the shipment a quantity of items â€˜free of chargeâ€™ as replacements for goods likely to be defective or damaged in transit, the contracted sale price is regarded as covering the total quantity of items shipped.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Replacement goods in a subsequent shipment</h3>

<p>The customs value is determined in accordance with paragraphs 10.1 and 10.2. However, you can ask customs to amend the customs value of the original shipment in accordance with the contractual arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Valuing used goods</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span> Second-hand goods which were not used by you before entry into free circulation</h3>

<p>You have to follow the rules set out in sections 3 to 8. No special treatment is necessary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span> Goods acquired new or used and used or further used in a third country before entry into free circulation</h3>

<p>Where the period and extent of use between being acquired and entry into free circulation results in the goods being worth less at time of entry into free circulation than when acquired, you need not use Method 1.</p>

<p>You can try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Methods 2 or 3 (see sections 4 or 5) if you import identical or similar goods of the same age and in the same condition under Method 1</li>
  <li>Method 4 (see section 6) if you sell the goods or identical or similar goods to unrelated customers in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot use any of these Methods you must use Method 6. The customs value can be based on the value of the goods when acquired less an amount for loss of value due to the usage.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Valuing rented or leased goods</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span> How do I arrive at the customs value?</h3>

<p>When you import goods that youâ€™ve rented or leased, there will be no sale between the supplier and yourself. However, prior to being rented or leased, the goods may have been subject to a sale. Thus it may be possible to use Method 1 (see paragraph 3.5). Otherwise Methods 2 to 5 (see sections 4 to 7) should be tried. Nevertheless, in most cases, Method 6 will be appropriate (see paragraph 13.3).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span> Can I use a cash price?</h3>

<p>Sometimes a cash price is quoted in the rental or leasing agreement in case you wish to purchase the goods at a later date. However, this cash price may be artificially high to encourage the renting or leasing of the goods. Alternatively it may be an option to buy when the goods are effectively second hand. Thus such a cash price does not constitute a sale and cannot be used under Method 1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.3 </span> How do I arrive at a value using Method 6?</h3>

<p>You multiply the annual rental or leasing cost by the expected economic life of the imported goods.</p>

<p>Where the rental or leasing cost includes interest it is necessary to calculate the â€˜cashâ€™ price of the goods. This is done by using a formula. There are 2 formulae which can be used, depending on if the payment is made in advance or arrears. Further information about the formulae is given in section 38.</p>

<p>For further advice you should contact the helpline where it is difficult to determine the expected economic life of the imported goods.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span> Goods lost, damaged or defective</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span> What this section covers</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/refunds-and-waivers-on-customs-debt">Rejected imports â€” repayment or remission of duty and VAT</a> gives details of the duty relief provisions. This section is intended to cover the cases when those provisions cannot be used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span> What if I do not receive all of my goods?</h3>

<p>No duty is due on any goods shown to have been short-shipped or lost in transit before release from customs charge into free circulation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.3 </span> What if the goods are damaged?</h3>

<p>If you can prove to us that damage occurred before the goods were released from customs charge into free circulation, you can ask for the customs value to be amended. See paragraph 9.8 for goods entered under the <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> scheme.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.4 </span> What evidence must I produce?</h3>

<p>We cannot list all acceptable forms of evidence but some examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a credit note from the seller</li>
  <li>a statement from the customs officer who examined the goods</li>
  <li>a certificate of condemnation</li>
  <li>a statement from the Port Health Official</li>
  <li>a statement from an independent expert such as a surveyor</li>
  <li>details of settlement of claim against insurer or carrier</li>
</ul>

<p>But see paragraph 9.8 for goods entered under the <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> scheme.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.5 </span> How do I arrive at the customs value?</h3>

<p>Depending on the evidence you can produce you can do this by for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apportioning the original price paid or payable to take account of partial loss or damage</li>
  <li>using the revised price paid or payable where the seller reduces the price as a result of the loss or damage</li>
  <li>comparing the price at which you sell the damaged goods with the published average market values for the same type of goods at the time of sale, and using the ratio to apportion the invoice price</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.6 </span> What if the goods are found to be defective after importation?</h3>

<p>If the defects are repaired, and the seller reimburses you under warranty for the cost of the warranty work carried out by you or on your behalf, you can submit a claim for repayment of duty to Customs National Duty Repayments Centre.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.7 </span> What evidence must I produce?</h3>

<p>You must:</p>

<p>(a) Provide full details of the contractual arrangements covering the warranty work that have been agreed between you and the seller of the imported goods.</p>

<p>(b) Show that the seller has accepted responsibility under the warranty for the defects in respect of the particular goods in question and agreed to make the reimbursement for the warranty work.</p>

<p>(c) Provide a clear audit trail to show that youâ€™ve been reimbursed for the post-importation warranty work required on the imported goods which evidences and links:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the discovery and nature of the defect (including sufficient details to identify the goods concerned)</li>
  <li>the repair work undertaken and the cost</li>
  <li>the reimbursement of the repair cost by the seller in accordance with the terms of the warranty, (if details are not available, demonstrate how the precise amount for the repair cost has been calculated and that the seller or warrantor has accepted liability for that amount)</li>
</ul>

<p>(d) Provide details of the customs entry for the goods in question.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.8 </span> How do I calculate the amount I claim?</h3>

<p>You must calculate the amount of Customs Duty that would have been paid if the customs value of the imported goods had been reduced by the amount of the reimbursement you receive from the seller of the goods and deduct this amount from the duty that was actually paid. You can claim the difference.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.9 </span> Are there any time limits?</h3>

<p>Yes, you must ensure that the claim is submitted within 3 years of the date of the acceptance of the customs entry that resulted in the duty being paid on the goods being repaired.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.10 </span> Are there any other conditions?</h3>

<p>Yes, the amount claimed under these arrangements for any specific imported item may not exceed the original declared value of that item resulting in a â€˜negativeâ€™ value.</p>

<p>Note: customs reserves the right to carry out any appropriate verification enquiries and to request access to any relevant documentation before claims are processed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Delivery costs</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span> What are â€˜delivery costsâ€™?</h3>

<p>These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the cost of transport</li>
  <li>the cost of insurance (including global or blanket policies)</li>
  <li>loading and handling charges</li>
  <li>container charges (for example when hired for transportation of the imported goods)</li>
  <li>terminal charges (charges for a variety of services in connection with the handling/storage of freight containers at container depots)</li>
  <li>any other charges involved in carrying the goods from one place to another</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span> Are all of the costs to be included in the customs value?</h3>

<p>No. Only costs up to the place of introduction of the imported goods into the UK border are to be included.</p>

<p>Remember you must include in the customs value all inland transport and associated costs in the country of export.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span> Where is the â€˜place of introductionâ€™?</h3>

<h4>Sea</h4>

<p>If the goods are delivered direct to the UK the place of introduction is the port of importation into the UK.</p>

<h4>Air</h4>

<p>The place of introduction is the point where the UK border is first crossed during the air journey.</p>

<h4>Road, rail or inland waterway</h4>

<p>The place of introduction is the point where the goods first pass a customs office, this is usually the point when the goods cross the UK border.</p>

<h4>Post</h4>

<p>The place of introduction is the address for delivery, for example, your office or home.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.4 </span> Can I deduct UK transport costs where they are included in the total freight charge?</h3>

<p>Yes. If the freight is charged separately and distinguished, the freight charge can be apportioned to arrive at the value for the journey after the UK border.</p>

<p>For goods transported by sea the freight charge that would have been paid to the place of introduction is to be included in the customs value. Rates shown in rate books or otherwise advertised by the shipping line or other carrier are usually acceptable.</p>

<p>For goods transported by rail or road the freight charge is to be apportioned using reasonable means for example by distance covered outside and inside the UK. Section 39 gives other examples.</p>

<p>The percentage of the air transport costs shown on the air waybill to be included in the customs value are published on GOV.UK. The percentages are listed in section 40. Importers connected to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> can obtain details from the relevant data files.</p>

<p>Remember locally agreed rates for UK transport costs for VAT purposes must not be used for ad valorem Customs Duty calculations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.5 </span> Can I deduct UK transport costs where they are included in the price I pay for the goods?</h3>

<p>Yes, a deduction for these charges may be made from the price you pay, provided they can be distinguished and evidence can be produced to support them. Section 39 gives examples.</p>

<p>The following would be acceptable as evidence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount shown separately on the sellerâ€™s invoice</li>
  <li>a certified statement or telex from the supplier</li>
  <li>an invoice or certified statement of the actual freight amount charged by the carrier to the buyer, seller or agent</li>
  <li>an invoice or certified statement establishing the total cost of transport, split to show the proportion of actual distance inside and outside the UK</li>
  <li>a statement from the buyer referring to a schedule of freight rates normally applied for the same mode of transport</li>
  <li>in the case of goods imported by air, a statement on the invoice confirming that the cost of freight included in the price is the same as that stated on the air waybill</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.6 </span> What if the transport is free or I provide my own transport?</h3>

<p>You must include in the customs value an amount for transport costs to the UK border. You can calculate this amount by using the freight rates tariff for the type of transport used, for example IATA rates for air transport costs, or conference rates for sea.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.7 </span> Is the cost of insuring the goods against loss or damage in transit to be included in the customs value?</h3>

<p>Yes. You must include the cost of insurance for the goods up to the place of introduction into the customs territory of the UK. However, if you pay a premium which covers the whole journey, the cost of insurance after the UK border does not have to be included in the customs value provided you separately distinguish this element. Also, where there is separate cover for the journey after the UK border, the cost of this separate insurance cover does not have to be included in the customs value.</p>

<p>Remember if your insurance covers more than one importation, or relates to other items as well as the imported goods, the cost of that insurance must be apportioned and the appropriate amount included in the customs value. An example of how to apportion a periodic insurance premium to individual consignments is provided in section 39.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.8 </span> Can I leave out container terminal costs?</h3>

<p>Yes, if they are separately charged and are for a container terminal in the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.9 </span> Can I leave out demurrage charges?</h3>

<p>Yes, if the charge is made as a result of delay after arrival of the goods at the place of introduction.</p>

<p>But charges for delay before arrival of the goods at the place of introduction are to be included in the customs value.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.10 </span> Can I use surface freight costs when goods are sent by air?</h3>

<p>In normal circumstances, no. However, where the contractual arrangements between buyer and seller:</p>

<p>(a) are in force at the time of entry of the goods concerned to free circulation</p>

<p>(b) require the seller to have the goods transported by air to ensure agreed delivery deadlines are met, and</p>

<p>(c) the seller has to bear the additional costs, the following treatment will apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the terms of the original order were <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> (Cost, Insurance and Freight) or post <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr>, then the terms change to <abbr title="Carriage and insurance paid to">CIP</abbr> (Carriage and Insurance Paid To) and the air transport cost is considered to be included in the <abbr title="Carriage and insurance paid to">CIP</abbr> price. No further addition for transport and associated costs is required</li>
  <li>if the terms of the original order were <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr>, those terms change to <abbr title="Carriage and insurance paid to">CIP</abbr> or <abbr title="Carriage paid to">CPT</abbr> (Carriage Paid To). The <abbr title="Carriage and insurance paid to">CIP</abbr> or <abbr title="Carriage paid to">CPT</abbr> price is considered to include the air transport cost. No further addition for transport and associated costs is required unless any further costs are incurred by the buyer, for example, for insurance or if the buyer makes a contribution towards the additional air transport costs (for example by paying an amount equal to what it would have cost to transport the goods by sea). In which case those costs have to be included in the customs value.</li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, the cost of transport in the UK can be excluded from the customs value, provided the costs are shown separately on the invoice, or can be evidenced by alternative satisfactory means.</p>

<p>Note: you should contact our helpline for further information if consignments are shipped late on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.11 </span> Can I leave out a currency adjustment factor?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.12 </span> Can I leave out a bunker adjustment factor?</h3>

<p>No. This surcharge is raised by shipping lines to take account of fluctuations in the price of marine fuel. A similar â€˜fuel surchargeâ€™ is applied where goods are transported by air to compensate for fluctuations in the price of aviation fuel.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.13 </span> Should any other transport surcharges be included in the customs value?</h3>

<p>Yes, the following surcharges are considered to be part of the cost of transporting the goods to the place of introduction in the UK and must be included in the customs value:</p>

<ul>
  <li>peak season surcharge</li>
  <li>security surcharge</li>
  <li>war risk surcharge</li>
  <li>UK port congestion charge</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition any other payment or surcharge charged by the shipping line, airline or carrier of the goods, which does not relate to a cost incurred, or an activity or operation taking place after the arrival of the goods at the place of introduction must be included in the customs value of the goods.</p>

<p>Note: where the surcharge is made in connection with transport by air, it may be included in the total air transport costs declared for apportionment purposes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span> Rates of exchange â€” conversion of foreign currency</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span> What must I do if all or part of any amount to be taken into account in arriving at the customs value is shown in a foreign currency?</h3>

<p>You must convert to sterling any foreign currency amount which needs to be taken into account in arriving at the customs value. Also you must convert to sterling any other part of the customs value shown in foreign currency, for example, freight or insurance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span> Can I use the rate of exchange at which I make settlement?</h3>

<p>No. Unless paragraphs 16.3 or 16.5 apply.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.3 </span> Can I use a fixed rate of exchange?</h3>

<p>You should use the fixed rate when the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contract of sale specifies that a fixed rate of exchange is to be used to convert a foreign currency amount to sterling</li>
  <li>seller is to receive payment in sterling</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.4 </span> What if the supplier requires payment in a foreign currency?</h3>

<p>If the invoices are in sterling at a fixed rate of exchange quoted in the contract of sale, that rate of exchange must be used to convert the sterling amount into the foreign currency. The resulting foreign currency amount must be reconverted to sterling at the customs rate of exchange applicable at the time of importation (see paragraph 16.5).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.5 </span> Which rate of exchange must I use?</h3>

<p>If paragraph 16.3 does not apply you must use the rate of exchange published by us for use at the time the entry to free circulation is accepted.</p>

<p>However, for periodic declarations, you may ask us to accept a single exchange rate based on the rate applicable on the first day of the period covered by the declaration in question.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.6 </span> How are the customs rates designated?</h3>

<p>The monthly rates are fixed under provisions set out in UK legislation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.7 </span> When are the rates published?</h3>

<p>At the end of every month we publish the rates on the internet and on the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> noticeboard. These give the rates of exchange to be used during the next month for converting foreign currencies for duty and import VAT purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.8 </span> What period do the rates cover?</h3>

<p>From the first to the last day of the next calendar month.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.9 </span> What happens when there are sudden currency fluctuations?</h3>

<p>Once a week we check the monthly rates issued against the commercial selling rates. If the commercial rate for a currency differs by more than 5% from the last published customs rate, the customs rate is amended from midnight on Tuesday/Wednesday of the following week. However, you may continue to use the exchange rate based on the rate applicable on the first day of the period through that month (see paragraph 16.5).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span> Valuation declaration</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.1 </span> What is a valuation declaration?</h3>

<p>It is a form that gives information to us about the value declared on the import entry when Method 1 is used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.2 </span> Must I complete a valuation declaration?</h3>

<p>No, not unless we ask you to.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.3 </span> When will I be asked to complete a valuation declaration?</h3>

<p>We may ask you to complete a form for import declarations we examine on a post importation audit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.4 </span> Who can sign the valuation declaration?</h3>

<p>A valuation declaration can be signed by any person (natural or legal):</p>

<ul>
  <li>residing or having a place of business in the UK</li>
  <li>who has the information needed to answer the questions on the forms</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the forms are completed for a company, the person signing must be a responsible representative of the company, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>director</li>
  <li>company secretary</li>
  <li>manager</li>
</ul>

<p>One of these persons may authorise an employee to sign for the company. Clearing agents may also sign these forms on behalf of the importer when authorised to do so.</p>

<p>Note: the person signing a declaration is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the particulars given on the form and must be in possession of all the facts relating to the sale upon which the declared customs value is based.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span> Customs warehousing</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.1 </span> What value must I declare at the time of importation?</h3>

<p>You must declare a value for statistical purposes (see section 23). This value will also be used for warehouse stock control purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.2 </span> How do I arrive at the customs value when the goods are removed to free circulation?</h3>

<p>You do this by using one of the 6 Methods set out in sections 3 to 8 or <abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr> for fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.3 </span> When using Method 1 must I base the customs value on the last sale before removal?</h3>

<p>If a sale for export exists when the goods arrive in the UK that is the basis for the customs value. In situations where the goods are the subject of a sale after being placed under a special (suspension) procedure, such a sale can be used for the determination of the customs value under the transaction method.</p>

<p>In general terms, the customs value is to be based on a transaction value which represents a sale for export to the UK.</p>

<p>For further advice you should contact our helpline.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.4 </span> When must I establish the customs value of goods removed from warehouse to free circulation?</h3>

<p>At the time the goods are removed from the customs warehouse. This means that any elements making up the value for duty (for example, price, freight and insurance charges) which are invoiced in a foreign currency will have to be converted to sterling at the customs period rate of exchange (see paragraph 16.4) in force at the time the goods are entered for removal from the warehouse.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.5 </span> What value do I declare for goods that devalue whilst in a customs warehouse?</h3>

<p>If goods depreciate in value whilst in warehouse (for example, they are goods that have
missed the seasonal market) the price paid or payable in the sale for export to the
UK, declared as the basis of value on entry to the customs warehousing procedure,
should be used when valuing the goods on removal from warehouse.</p>

<p>However if, before entry of the goods to free circulation, the price paid or payable has been reduced by the supplier  /  seller to the buyer, a revised value is acceptable providing it is supported by satisfactory evidence, and the reduction stems from contractual arrangements in place at the time the goods entered the warehouse.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.6 </span> Can I leave out of the customs value the cost of warehousing and/or preserving the goods?</h3>

<p>Yes, providing it is shown separately from the price of the goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.7 </span> Where can I find out more about customs warehousing?</h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span> Outward Processing</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.1 </span> How do I arrive at the customs value of goods reimported after process outside the UK?</h3>

<p>(a) The processor charges you for the cost of the process.</p>

<p>You must try Method 1 (see section 3 particularly paragraph 3.14(d)). The customs value will be based on the cost of the process.</p>

<p>All of the following items must be included in the customs value if not already in the processorâ€™s charge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the value of the exported goods (where the goods are purchased from an unrelated person, the cost of acquisition is to be used â€” where the goods are produced by yourself or a related person, the cost of production is to be used)</li>
  <li>the value of any material rejected, lost or wasted before, during or after the process</li>
  <li>any third country Customs Duty or similar levy</li>
</ul>

<p>Outward freight and insurance are not to be included in the built-up value. The exception to this is when the temporarily exported goods are invoiced â€˜<abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr>â€™ and the outward freight and insurance is not separately distinguishable. Then the outward freight and insurance is includible in the built-up value.</p>

<p>(b) The processor does not charge you for the cost of the process.</p>

<p>As no payment is made Method 1 cannot be used. You must try either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Methods 2 or 3 (see sections 4 or 5) if you import identical or similar processed goods under Method 1</li>
  <li>Method 4 (see section 6) if you sell the processed goods or identical or similar processed goods to unrelated customers</li>
  <li>Method 5 (see section 7) if you can get the detailed costings of the processed goods</li>
  <li>Method 6 (see section 8) if you cannot use any of these Methods â€” the customs value can be based on the charge that would have been made for the process, additions have to be made as detailed in (a) above</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">22. </span> Valuation for VAT</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.1 </span> What is the basis of the value for VAT?</h3>

<p>You must base it on the value for duty even if no duty is payable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.2 </span> What items must I add to the value for duty to arrive at the value for VAT?</h3>

<p>You must add all of the following unless they are already included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all incidental expenses such as commission, packing, transport and insurance costs incurred up to the goodsâ€™ first destination in the UK</li>
  <li>all such incidental expenses where they result from transport to a further place of destination in the UK if that place is known at the time of importation</li>
  <li>any Customs Duty or levy payable on importation into the UK</li>
  <li>any Excise Duty or other charges payable on importation into the UK (except the VAT itself)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: commission does not include â€˜buying commissionâ€™. This is considered to be a payment for services subject to the business to business rule on the place of supply of services and VAT should be accounted for on it under the reverse charge procedure. Details are given in Notice 741A: place of supply of services (see section 22.8).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.3 </span> Must I include royalty or licence fees?</h3>

<p>No. These are regarded as charges for services received from outside the UK. VAT is due on such payments at a later stage. Notice 741A: place of supply of services, gives you information on how to account for such supplies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.4 </span> Must I include a discount for prompt payment?</h3>

<p>No. Provided at the time of import a discount for early payment is still available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.5 </span> What must I do if the price of the goods is in foreign currency?</h3>

<p>You have to convert the foreign currency into sterling. Also you must convert to sterling any other part of the value shown in foreign currency for example transport, insurance, and so on. You must use the rules set out in section 16.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.6 </span> Are there any special arrangements for certain goods?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>hydrocarbon oils and certain racehorses â€” standard values have been agreed for certain goods, such as racehorses imported for auction and hydrocarbon oils you can get details from your Trade Associations</li>
  <li>certain imported works of art, antiques and collectorsâ€™ items â€” these are entitled to a reduced valuation at importation, giving an effective VAT rate of 5%</li>
  <li>computer software</li>
  <li>goods reimported after process or repair abroad</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.7 </span> How do I arrive at the value for VAT when imported goods are removed from a customs warehouse?</h3>

<p>You follow the procedures for customs value set out in section 18 and the value rules set out in this section.</p>

<p>Note: the treatment of services performed in a customs warehouse or an excise or customs and excise warehouse (see paragraph 22.9) may affect the declared VAT value.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.8 </span> Incidental Expenses</h3>

<h4>22.8.1 Simplified Arrangements</h4>

<p>The following three methods may be used to calculate the â€˜incidental expensesâ€™ element of the import VAT value. The first method requires actual costs to be declared, whilst methods 2 and 3 provide two ways of estimating the incidental expenses. Use of the three methods is non-hierarchical and individual importers or agents may use whichever method best suits their particular circumstances.</p>

<h4>22.8.2 Method 1</h4>

<p>This method requires actual costs to be declared at the time the goods are imported. The time of importation is the time at which a customs debt becomes due, or would have become due if the goods were subject to duty. Post-clearance amendments should be submitted in instances where costs are later found to be incorrect (for example, if additional storage costs are incurred).</p>

<h4>22.8.3 Method 2</h4>

<p>The following nationally agreed rates may be used to estimate the incidental expenses to be included in the import VAT value. The rates are intended only for international movements of goods, which terminate in the UK, and represent average costs of handling, storage, customs declarations and transport to destination. Values for other consignments, including those destined for delivery in other member States, should be based on methods 1 or 3. If importers/agents use these rates, post-entry amendments are not required. Additionally, where it is found that the import VAT due based on actual costs exceeds the amount declared on the basis of method 2 rates, Customs will not seek to collect import VAT arrears unless the importer concerned is not registered for VAT, or, if registered, is restricted in the amount of import VAT that can be claimed as input tax.</p>

<h4>22.8.4 Method 3</h4>

<p>In those cases where Methods 1 and 2 are considered inappropriate or impractical to use, individual agreements may be negotiated with our Entry Processing Unit, or with the importerâ€™s local Excise and Inland Customs office. Importers or agents interested in this method, who are uncertain about which office to approach should contact the National Advice Service or use the contact number at the end of this paper. Once an individual method 3 rate is in use, post-entry amendments are not required.</p>

<h4>22.8.5 Courier and Express Parcels Consignments</h4>

<p>A separate â€˜method 2â€™ rate has been agreed with AICES for these consignments.
Further information on the import VAT valuation rules is given in the appendix to this paper.</p>

<h4>22.8.6 Appendix</h4>

<p>The following provides a brief summary of the existing rules on import VAT valuation, explains the meaning of some of the terms used and the application of the rules in respect of removals from warehouse, and advises you where you can obtain further information if required.</p>

<h4>22.8.7 Value For Import VAT</h4>

<p>The value for VAT of imported goods is their value for customs duty purposes (whether or not duty is actually due) plus, if not already included in the price:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any customs duty or levy payable on importation into the UK</li>
  <li>Any excise duty or other charges payable on importation into the UK (except the VAT itself)</li>
  <li>All incidental expenses such as commission, packing, transport and insurance costs incurred up to the goods first destination in the UK</li>
  <li>All such incidental expenses where they result from transport to a further place of destination in the UK if that place is known at the time of importation</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant legislation is Section 21 of the VAT Act 1994.</p>

<h4>22.8.8 Incidental Expenses</h4>

<p>In addition to the examples given above, the term â€˜incidental expensesâ€™ also covers such items as customs clearance charges, quay rent, entry fees, demurrage, handling, loading and storage costs. Generally, where supplies of services qualify for zero-rating because they are supplied in connection with an importation of goods, the cost of those services should be included in the value for import VAT.</p>

<p>In most cases, the services to be included in the VAT value are charged to the importer by a third party, eg an agent, freight forwarder or hauler. However, when a particular service is provided by the importer, eg own transport, the cost may be left out of the value.</p>

<p>Charges for certain services received from outside the UK â€” most commonly royalties and licence fees â€” should not be included in the value for import VAT as they are taxable under the reverse charge/international service arrangements. For details see VAT Notice 741A (Place of supply of services).</p>

<h4>22.8.9 First Destination</h4>

<p>â€˜First destinationâ€™ is the place mentioned on the consignment note or any other document by means of which the goods are imported. So, for example, where goods are consigned to Birmingham via Dover (and the import documentation shows that) Birmingham will be the first destination for import VAT purposes. In the absence of such documentation, first destination means the place of the first transfer of cargo in the UK.</p>

<h4>22.8.10 Further Destination</h4>

<p>If a further destination in the UK is known at the time the goods are imported, costs resulting from the transport of the goods to that place must be included in the import VAT value.</p>

<h4>22.8.11 Goods Removed From Warehouse</h4>

<p>The rules set above apply equally to imported goods, which are removed from customs or excise warehouses. This is because the goods are not deemed to be imported until they are entered to free circulation â€” at which point a place of destination beyond the warehouse will normally be shown on the relevant import documentation. That place is therefore the place of first destination for import VAT purposes, and any incidental expenses incurred up to that place should be included in the import VAT value. Any cost resulting from the transport of the goods to a further destination, if known at the time of importation, should also be included in the value.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.9 </span> What if I cannot arrive at the value for VAT?</h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">25. </span> Examples of situations where there is no sale</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.1 </span> Examples</h3>

<p>(a) Free consignments (for example, gifts, samples, promotion items). Where transactions do not involve the payment of a price, they cannot be regarded as sales.</p>

<p>(b) Goods imported on consignment. Under this trading practice, the goods would be dispatched to you not as a result of a sale, but with the intention that you would sell them for the account of the supplier, at the best price obtainable. At the time of entry to free circulation, no sale would have taken place.</p>

<p>(c) Goods imported by intermediaries, who do not purchase the goods and who sell them after entry to free circulation. This covers a whole range of situations encountered in commercial practice, whereby goods are delivered to intermediaries without having been the subject of a sale.</p>

<p>(d) Goods imported by branches which are not separate legal entities. There can be no sale, because a sale necessarily involves a transaction between 2 separate legal entities.</p>

<p>(e) Goods imported under a hire or leasing contract. Hire or leasing transactions by their very nature do not constitute sales, even if the contract includes an option to purchase the goods.</p>

<p>(f) Goods supplied on loan, which remain the property of the sender. Goods (often machinery) are sometimes loaned by the owner to a customer. These transactions do not involve sales.</p>

<p>(g) Goods (waste or scrap) imported for destruction in the UK, with the sender paying you for your services. As costs are incurred in connection with this destruction, the exporter would pay you an amount for your services. As you would not pay for the imported goods but, on the contrary, be paid for accepting and destroying them, no sale would have taken place.</p>

<p>Note: see also section 27 regarding the constraints on the use of Method 1.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">26. </span> Examples of sales for export to the UK</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">26.1 </span> Example 1</h3>

<h4>Facts</h4>

<p>Company B buys the goods for Â£1,000 from company A and they are both based in a third country.</p>

<p>Company B then subsequently sells the goods for Â£1,200 to company C who are based in the UK leading to the goods being imported there.</p>

<p>The Â£1,000 lower price cannot be used as it is not the last sale before the goods were imported into the UK , and it also cannot be demonstrated it was a sale for export to the UK.</p>

<p>The Â£1,200 sale between company B and company C is a sale for export as it led to the goods being introduced into the UK, and is also the last sale before the goods were brought into that territory, so should be used under the transaction value method (method 1).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">26.2 </span> Example 2</h3>

<h4>Facts</h4>

<p>Company B in the UK buys the goods from company A in a third country.</p>

<p>While the goods are being shipped, company B then sells the goods to company C prior to their introduction into the UK.</p>

<p>While the sale between company A to company B is a sale for export , it is not the last sale for export which is the subsequent sale between company B and company C, and this therefore should be used under the transaction value method (method 1).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">26.3 </span> Example 3</h3>

<p>Company A sells the goods to company B, who then sells to company C before the goods are introduced into the UK.</p>

<p>After the goods have been brought into the customs territory of the UK, company C sells the goods to company D which is the importer.</p>

<p>The sale occurring immediately before the goods were brought into the customs territory of the UK is the sale between B and C. This is the sale for export to the customs territory of the UK and shall be used in order to determine the customs value under the transaction value method.</p>

<p>However, to be able to use the transaction value method it depends on the importer (company D) being able to obtain the invoice, which refers to the sale transaction concluded between B and C.</p>

<p>When the importer does not have access to this invoice, the transaction value method (method 1) is not applicable and the other valuation methods (methods 2 to 6) would need to be considered.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">27. </span> Method 1 â€” conditions for use</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">27.1 </span> Conditions for using Method 1</h3>

<p>Before you can use Method 1 you must be able to satisfy all of the following conditions:</p>

<p>(a) There must be no restrictions as to the disposal or use of the goods by you except those which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in the UK</li>
  <li>limit the geographical area in which the goods may be resold</li>
  <li>do not substantially affect the value of the goods</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of restrictions which can be ignored:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an official licence is needed to trade in the imported goods</li>
  <li>the goods can be sold only in the UK</li>
  <li>the goods cannot be sold before a certain date, for example, cars which cannot be sold before the start of a model year</li>
</ul>

<p>(b) The sale or price must not be subject to some condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued.</p>

<p>Examples of conditions or considerations for which a value cannot be arrived at the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seller fixes the price of the imported goods on condition that you buy other goods in specified quantities</li>
  <li>price you pay for the imported goods depends upon the price you charge the seller for other goods</li>
  <li>price you pay for the imported goods depends upon an agreement you make with the seller, for example, you import semi-finished goods on the understanding that youâ€™ll send a specified quantity of the finished goods to the seller</li>
</ul>

<p>But you can ignore conditions or considerations relating to the production or marketing of the imported goods. For example, the fact that you provide the seller with engineering and plans undertaken in the UK does not prevent you using Method 1.</p>

<p>Note: where you can determine the value of a condition or consideration you can use Method 1, however, you must add that value to the price paid or payable as an indirect payment by you to the seller.</p>

<p>(c) Where the seller receives (directly or indirectly) part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the imported goods, you must be able to make an appropriate addition to take account of this (paragraph 3.14(f) and 3.16 refer). Where you cannot make an appropriate addition, Method 1 cannot be used.</p>

<p>(d) If you are related to the seller (see paragraph 3.10) you must be able to show that you do not get a reduced price because of this relationship. Section 28 explains how to do this.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">28. </span> Method 1 â€” buyer and seller related</h2>

<p>This section assumes you are the buyer of the goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.1 </span> General information if you are related to the seller</h3>

<p>If you are related to the seller (see paragraph 3.10), the price paid or payable can be accepted under Method 1 as long as you can show that the relationship has not affected the price.</p>

<p>One way you can do this is by applying the following â€˜testsâ€™ for comparison purposes.</p>

<p>(a) You need to show that the price you paid to the seller is close to one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the transaction value of identical (see paragraph 4.2) or similar (see paragraph 5.2) goods exported to the UK, in sales between buyers and sellers who are unrelated</li>
  <li>the customs value of identical or similar goods arrived at under Method 4 (see section 6)</li>
  <li>the customs value of identical or similar goods arrived at under Method 5 (see section 7)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: the â€˜testâ€™ values must have been accepted by us at or about the same time as the importation of the goods to be valued.</p>

<p>(b) Alternatively you could provide information which demonstrates that either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you and the seller trade with each other as though you are unrelated</li>
  <li>you pay the same price as unrelated buyers in the UK operating at the same commercial level and purchasing similar quantities of the goods</li>
  <li>the price you pay is fully costed (armâ€™s length)</li>
</ul>

<p>We also accept recent feasibilities or transfer pricing studies conducted by independent third-parties, as evidence to verify that the Transfer price is at armâ€™s length for customs valuation purposes only. Here we do not question nor verify your Transfer Pricing, as this falls under Corporation Tax.</p>

<p>What do we mean by armâ€™s length transaction? 
An armâ€™s length transaction refers to a commercial sale in which the buyers and sellers act independently without one party influencing the other.</p>

<p>We may also decide to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale to determine if the transaction value is acceptable.</p>

<p>In practice we are seeking assurance that you do not receive preferential treatment under the inter-company pricing arrangements because of your relationship with the seller. If, following enquiries, we have grounds to consider that the price is affected by the relationship, we will tell you what these grounds are. If you request, this will be in writing.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll have a reasonable opportunity to respond. If it is finally concluded that the relationship has influenced the price, Method 1 cannot be used. Then you must try Method 2 (see section 4).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.2 </span> Transfer pricing</h3>

<p>Transfer pricing is a term used to describe how multi-national enterprise (<abbr title="multi-national enterprise">MNE</abbr>) set prices for the transfer of physical goods and intangible property or provides services between related (associated or connected) companies. They are the price set by MSEâ€™s that control each other or that are controlled by a common entity.</p>

<p>UK tax law and customs law require prices within a <abbr title="multi-national enterprise">MNE</abbr> to be set, for Corporation Tax and customs valuation purposes respectively, as if group members are not related. A transfer price may be used as the basis of a Method 1 value only where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it fulfils the criteria in â€” (see section 27 and paragraph 28.1) and</li>
  <li>all relevant costs (see section 3.14) are included in the dutiable value if paid separately from the transfer price of the imported goods</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.3 </span> Retrospective price adjustments (related or unrelated buyer and seller)</h3>

<p>Situations may arise, whereby, for a variety of reasons, the price that you pay to the seller for the imported goods is revised or re-negotiated after the entry of the goods to free circulation. When this happens you must consider the customs valuation and Customs Duty implications.</p>

<p>Where, at the time of entry, there are contractual arrangements in place between you and the seller indicating the possibility of retrospective price adjustments, the invoice price for the goods concerned would, in effect, be provisional.</p>

<p>This means that you cannot arrive at a final value for Customs Duty at the time of entry. Therefore you should make security arrangements (see paragraph 2.5).</p>

<p>Alternatively you can pay Customs Duty outright at the time of entry but must undertake to notify HMRC where there has been an adjustment.</p>

<p>We would both adjust the Customs Duty payable upward or downwards as appropriate, according to any agreed price adjustments subsequently notified.</p>

<p>Any retrospective price adjustment would not come under the criteria for a simplification (see section 3.16).</p>

<p>Where there has been a retrospective price increase, we will treat this as part of the total payment made by you to the seller for the imported goods. The fact that you agree to pay such a price increase is regarded as confirmation that the contractual arrangements implied or there was an implicit understanding between you and the seller that such an adjustment may occur, when the goods were ordered or purchased. Thus we will issue a demand (form C18) to you for the arrears of Customs Duty.</p>

<p>If you are a large business trader, you should send details to your Customer Compliance Manager (CCM). In all other cases details should be sent to the National Post Clearance Centre (NPCC).</p>

<p>Where there has been a retrospective price decrease you may submit a claim for a refund of duty to the National Duty Repayment Centre. Your claim must be accompanied by appropriate evidence including full details of the contractual arrangements as well as rebates received from and credits notes issued by the seller.</p>

<p>The key item of evidence is the contract between you and the seller. We accept that contracts may be verbal as well as written. However, in the case of a verbal contract we would seek alternative evidence, for example, reports of meetings, correspondence, between you and the seller. In cases of doubt we may request an affidavit from the parties to the verbal contract.</p>

<p>Where we are satisfied that the price decrease stemmed from contractual arrangements in force at the time of entry of the goods concerned to free circulation, an appropriate refund of duty will be made (subject to the normal rules). In particular the refund claim must be lodged with us within 3 years from the date of each relevant entry.</p>

<p>In circumstances where no customs duty is payable on the imported goods, and the retrospective price adjustment will therefore concern VAT only, you should make any adjustment via your VAT returns, but retain the evidence of any retrospective price adjustments, to potentially be checked at any post clearance audit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.4 </span> Can we help you?</h3>

<p>We know from experience that trading arrangements involving related parties are complex. Therefore it is not possible to cover every situation in this section. If you need further advice from a valuation liaison officer our Helpline will provide you with contact details.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">29. </span> Selling agents</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">29.1 </span> Goods imported to prior order</h3>

<p>If a selling agent takes orders from customers in the UK on behalf of a third country seller and then imports to fulfil those orders, Method 1 can usually be used. The customs value will be based on the selling price (inclusive of that selling agentâ€™s commission) to the UK customer.</p>

<p>This also applies where the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contract provides for a supply of pre-ordered goods to be delivered to the customer at certain intervals to meet production requirements</li>
  <li>selling agent holds the customerâ€™s pre-ordered stock for delivery on demand</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: where you can use Method 1 in these circumstances it must be used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">29.2 </span> Goods imported for sale from stock</h3>

<p>Where a selling agent imports goods to sell later from stock held in the UK on behalf of the third country seller, Method 1 cannot usually be used and Methods 2 to 6 (see Sections 4 to 8) must be tried.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">30. </span> Branch offices</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">30.1 </span> If Method 1 is used</h3>

<p>(a) â€˜Salesâ€™ to branches â€” where goods are imported either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>through a branch office which does not have a separate legal status of its own</li>
  <li>directly by the supplierâ€™s own employees</li>
  <li>by a person or firm acting in the supplierâ€™s name (for example, under Power of Attorney)</li>
</ul>

<p>the transaction cannot be regarded as a sale.</p>

<p>The parties are regarded as being part of the same legal entity. A company cannot sell to itself and therefore the prices shown on inter-company transfer or accounting documents cannot be used to establish the customs value under Method 1. It may be possible to use an earlier sale, for example, if the supplier has purchased rather than manufactured the goods to be valued (see paragraph 3.5).</p>

<p>(b) Sales to prior order â€” where the goods are imported to the prior order of UK customers, the value can be established under Method 1 based on the price actually paid or payable by the buyer to the seller.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">30.2 </span> Where Method 1 cannot be used</h3>

<p>Where Method 1 cannot be used you must try Methods 2 to 6 as explained in sections 4 to 8.</p>

<p>Where you can show that the intra-company invoice value between the head office and its branch or vice-versa represents a fully costed (armâ€™s length) price (see section 28), this would be acceptable under Method 6. It is consistent with the principles and general provisions of the <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr> Valuation Agreement.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">31. </span> Buying commission</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">31.1 </span> Buying commission and customs value</h3>

<p>Buying commission is the term used for the fees paid by an importer to his agent for the services in representing him in the purchase of the imported goods.</p>

<p>Among the tasks undertaken by a buying agent are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to find suppliers</li>
  <li>tell the seller what you want</li>
  <li>collect samples</li>
  <li>inspect the goods</li>
  <li>buy the goods on your behalf</li>
  <li>arrange insurance, transport, storage and delivery of the goods</li>
</ul>

<p>The payment (commission) made to a buying agent can be left out of the customs value so long as the payment is shown separately from the price actually paid or payable for the goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">31.2 </span> Do I need evidence of buying commission?</h3>

<p>Yes. In order to exclude the payment for buying commission from the customs value, the payment must be shown separately from the price for the goods on the documentation (for example invoice, valuation declaration) accompanying the entry to free circulation.</p>

<p>We may ask for further evidence of the contractual and trading arrangements between you and the other parties involved in support of any claim to leave out the amount for buying commission from the customs value. This may include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the contract between you and your buying agent</li>
  <li>a copy of the original sellerâ€™s invoice showing the price of the goods or, alternatively if this cannot be produced</li>
  <li>a copy of the original sellerâ€™s contract of sale showing the price of the goods</li>
  <li>copies of purchase orders, correspondence or other documentation which clearly evidence a bona fide buying agency arrangement</li>
</ul>

<p>If no evidence is available or the evidence produced is considered unsatisfactory, customs may decide that no buying agency arrangement exists and the payments you make to the agent should be included in the customs value.</p>

<p>Note: requests to amend a customs declaration to exclude non-dutiable elements after the entry has been accepted and the goods released into free circulation will be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">32. </span> Royalties and licence fees</h2>

<p>This section assumes you are the buyer of the goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">32.1 </span> What is a royalty or licence fee?</h3>

<p>These terms describe payments to a person for use of that personâ€™s patent or design rights, processes, trademarks, copyrights or for â€˜know howâ€™. Traders often have to pay for the right to manufacture, use or sell the licensorâ€™s goods or for technical knowledge and assistance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">32.2 </span> When do I have to include such payments in the customs value?</h3>

<p>Royalty or licence fees payable to the seller are to be included in the customs value as long as they both:</p>

<p>(a) related to the imported goods and (b) are paid as a condition of the sale where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the seller or a person related to the seller requires the buyer to make this payment;</li>
  <li>the payment by the buyer is made to satisfy an obligation of the seller, in accordance with contractual obligations;</li>
  <li>the goods cannot be sold to, or purchased by, the buyer without payment of the royalties or license fees to a licensor.</li>
</ul>

<p>This rule does not apply where such payments are made for the right to reproduce the imported goods (see paragraph 3.15(h)).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">32.3 </span> What if they relate partly to the imported goods and partly to other ingredients or component parts added, or services related to the goods after their importation?</h3>

<p>You can apportion the royalty payment between dutiable and non-dutiable elements. The basis for the apportionment of the total payment can sometimes be found in the licence agreement or be obtainable from the licensor. Where this is not the case we recommend that you contact customs (see paragraph 3.16).</p>

<p>Where apportionment is not possible because of a lack of relevant information, you cannot use Method 1. You must try Method 2 (see section 4).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">32.4 </span> What if I pay a third party?</h3>

<p>The conditions in paragraph 32.2(b) equally apply. Except that payments made to a person who is not related (see paragraph 3.10) to the seller are only to be included in the customs value when the seller requires those payments to be made.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">32.5 </span> Can we help you?</h3>

<p>We know from experience that trading arrangements involving payment of royalty or licence fees are complex and vary with each royalty or licence agreement. Therefore it is not possible to cover every situation in this section. For further advice you should contact our Helpline.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">33. </span> Interest charges</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">33.1 </span> How interest charges affect the customs value</h3>

<p>Charges for interest under a financing arrangement entered into by you for the purchase of imported goods can be left out of the customs value as long as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the charges are shown separately from the price actually paid or payable for the goods</li>
  <li>the financing arrangement has been made in writing</li>
  <li>where required by us, you can demonstrate that:<br>
</li>
  <li>such goods are actually sold at the price declared as the price actually paid or payable (net of the interest charge)<br>
</li>
  <li>the claimed rate of interest does not exceed the level for such transactions prevailing in the country where, and at the time when, the finance was provided</li>
</ul>

<p>These provisions apply to Methods 1 to 6 (see sections 3 to 8).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">33.2 </span> What evidence is needed?</h3>

<p>The charge for interest must be shown separately from the price for the goods on the documentation (for example, invoice, valuation declaration) accompanying the entry to free circulation. We may call for further evidence in support of any claim to leave out the amount for interest charges from the customs value. Such evidence would include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the finance agreement</li>
  <li>a copy of the contract of sale of the goods if it contains the financing clause</li>
  <li>information to show that the claimed rate of interest is not excessive</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: requests to amend a customs declaration to exclude non-dutiable elements after the entry has been accepted and the goods released into free circulation will be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">34. </span> Methods 2 and 3 â€” Examples of adjustments for level and quantity</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.1 </span> Same commercial level and quantity â€” no adjustment required</h3>

<h4>Facts</h4>

<p>You are a wholesaler who imports 1,700 articles for which Method 1 cannot be used.</p>

<p>You can produce a customs entry for 1,700 articles of identical/similar goods imported by a wholesaler. This entry has been accepted by UK customs under Method 1. The customs value is 6 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>As the quantity and commercial level are the same no adjustment is needed. The value of 6 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> is acceptable as the customs value under Method 2/3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.2 </span> Same commercial level but different quantity â€” no adjustment required</h3>

<h4>Facts</h4>

<p>You are a wholesaler who imports 2,000 articles for which Method 1 cannot be used.</p>

<p>You can produce a customs entry for 1,700 articles of identical/similar goods imported by a wholesaler. This entry has been accepted by UK customs under Method 1. The customs value is 6 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>It has been established that the supplier of the identical/similar goods sells at 6 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> to wholesalers regardless of quantity ordered.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>As the commercial level is the same and the quantity ordered does not affect the price no adjustment is needed. The value of 6 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> is acceptable as the customs value under Method 2/3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.3 </span> Different commercial level and quantity â€” no adjustment required</h3>

<h4>Facts</h4>

<p>You are a wholesaler who imports 1,500 articles for which Method 1 cannot be used.</p>

<p>You can produce a customs entry for 1,200 articles of identical/ similar goods imported by a retailer. This entry has been accepted by UK customs under Method 1. The customs value is 6 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>It has been established that the supplier of the identical/similar goods sells at 6 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> regardless of the quantity ordered and the commercial level of the customer.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>As the commercial level and the quantity ordered does not affect the price no adjustment is needed. The value of 6 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> is acceptable as the customs value under Method 2/3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.4 </span> Same commercial level but different quantity â€” adjustment required</h3>

<h4>Facts</h4>

<p>You are a wholesaler who imports 1,700 articles for which Method 1 cannot be used.</p>

<p>You can produce a customs entry for 2,300 articles of identical/similar goods imported by a wholesaler. This entry has been accepted by UK customs under Method 1. The customs value is 4.75 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>It has been established that the supplier of the identical/similar goods sells at different prices depending on the quantity ordered. The price list shows that for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>less than 2,000 articles the price is 5 units</li>
  <li>2,000 articles or more the price is 4.75 units</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>As the commercial level is the same no adjustment is required for level. An adjustment is required for quantity. The price list shows that the price of 1,700 articles is 5 units per article. Therefore the value of the identical/similar goods must be increased by 0.25 units per article. The value of 5 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> is acceptable as the customs value under Method 2/3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.5 </span> Different commercial level but the same quantity â€” adjustment required</h3>

<h4>Facts</h4>

<p>You are a wholesaler who imports 2,800 articles for which Method 1 cannot be used.</p>

<p>You can produce a customs entry for 2,800 articles of identical/similar goods imported by a retailer. This entry has been accepted by UK customs under Method 1. The customs value is 2.5 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>It has been established that the supplier of the identical/similar goods sells at different prices depending on the commercial level of the customer. The price list shows that for wholesalers a 20% discount is given. Retailers pay the list price.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>As the quantity is the same no adjustment is required for quantity.</p>

<p>An adjustment is required for commercial level. The price list shows that a wholesaler receives 20% discount. Therefore the value of the identical/similar goods must be decreased by (2.5 Ã— 20% = 0.5) 0.5 units. The value of 2 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> is acceptable as the customs value under Method 2/3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.6 </span> Different commercial level and quantity â€” adjustment required</h3>

<h4>Facts</h4>

<p>You are a wholesaler who imports 2,500 articles for which Method 1 cannot be used.</p>

<p>You can produce a customs entry for 1,500 articles of identical/similar goods imported by a retailer. This entry has been accepted by UK customs under Method 1. The customs value is 2.5 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>It has been established that the supplier of the identical/similar goods sells at different prices depending on the quantity ordered. A 20% discount is also given to wholesalers. The price list shows that for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>less than 2,000 articles the price is 2.5 units</li>
  <li>2,000 articles or more the price is 2 units</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>An adjustment is required for quantity. The price list shows that the price of 2,500 articles is 2 units per article therefore the value of the identical/similar goods must be decreased by 0.5 units per article. Also an adjustment is required for commercial level. The wholesaler receives a 20% discount therefore the value of the identical/similar goods which has already been adjusted for quantity (2 units per article) must be decreased by (2.5 Ã— 20% = 0.4) 0.4 units.</p>

<p>The value of 1.6 units per article <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> is acceptable as the Customs value under Method 2/3.</p>

<p>Greatest number of units sold at one price is 80. The unit price of these is Â£90. Therefore the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is Â£90.</p>

<p>You import 2,000 units. The value of the consignment is therefore 2,000 Ã— Â£90 or Â£180,000. From this value the allowable deductions as indicated in paragraph 6.7 are to be made.</p>

<p>900 units are imported.<br>
500 units are sold at Â£95 each.<br>

<p>The greatest number of units sold at one price is 500 units. The unit price is Â£95 each. Therefore the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is Â£95.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">36. </span> Method 4(b) â€” fresh fruit, vegetables and cut flowers â€” account sales procedure</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>If you import fresh fruit, vegetables or cut flowers on consignment you can use the account sales procedure to arrive at the customs value under Method 4(b) (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.11). A valuation declaration (see paragraph 17.1) is not required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.2 </span> Calculation of deposits at importation</h3>

<p>As the goods have not been sold at the time of importation, the amount of duty you must pay cannot be established. Therefore youâ€™ll need to request release of the goods against a deposit (see paragraph 2.5). To calculate the deposit you must declare on the import entry one of:</p>

<p>(a) the price you expect to get for the goods</p>

<p>(b) the current market value (<abbr title="current market value">CMV</abbr>) published by the trade associations</p>

<p>(c) the <abbr title="Simplified procedure value">SPV</abbr> customs publish (see section 9 for more details).</p>

<p>If you use either (a) or (b) you can deduct before calculating the deposit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for profit and general expenses or commission, and transport costs in the UK</li>
  <li>the included duty</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.3 </span> Arriving at the duty payable</h3>

<p>Within 90 days of the importation, you must produce to <abbr title="National Import Duty Adjustment Centre">NIDAC</abbr> evidence of the sale of the goods. No other values, such as <abbr title="Simplified procedure values">SPVs</abbr> or values used to calculate the deposit may be used.</p>

<p>If any goods are not sold in the same state as imported or are unsold, the unit price established for identical or similar produce in the same consignment, which has been sold in the condition in which it was imported, must be used.</p>

<p>The amount of duty you must pay will then be calculated.</p>

<p>If the deposit you paid was too high youâ€™ll receive a refund â€” if it was too low we will ask you to pay more.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.4 </span> Evidence of sale</h3>

<p>Copy invoices. You must produce copy invoices issued to wholesalers or supermarkets. These invoices must show the prices paid by these customers.</p>

<p>Statement of sales. If you find it difficult to produce copy invoices (perhaps because you sell to many customers) you can produce a statement showing the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>names and addresses of the wholesalers or supermarkets</li>
  <li>quantity sold to each wholesaler or supermarket</li>
  <li>prices paid by each wholesaler or supermarket</li>
  <li>details of items repacked, destroyed or lost and so on</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember you must have the copy invoices available to produce on request.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.5 </span> Certification of evidence of sale</h3>

<p>You must certify on the invoices or statement that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the goods on the import entry are accounted for</li>
  <li>the prices shown are those paid by the wholesaler or supermarket</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.6 </span> Deductions</h3>

<p>You may deduct the following from the amount paid to the importer by the wholesaler (net of wholesalersâ€™ commission and handling expenses) or the price paid by the supermarket:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10% to cover your commission and general expenses (the percentage has been agreed with the trade associations)</li>
  <li>the usual costs of transport, insurance and associated costs incurred in the UK</li>
  <li>UK customs duties</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.7 </span> Evidence of deductions</h3>

<p>You need only produce either of a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>copy of the freight account, which can be split by the distance inside and outside the UK</li>
  <li>statement of the cost of transporting the goods from the person supplying the freight</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: only importers who provide their own transport can make a simple statement of the cost of UK freight.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.8 </span> Losses in repacking</h3>

<p>The number of items (such as cartons or boxes) lost in repacking must be shown on the duty reconciliation statement. Minor losses of this nature may be disregarded but where the losses are substantial the procedure set out in section 14 is to be followed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.9 </span> Arriving at the customs value</h3>

<p>You need to use the following formula:</p>

<ul>
  <li>price paid by the wholesaler or supermarket</li>
  <li>less 10%</li>
  <li>less transport costs etc in the UK</li>
  <li>less included duty</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.10 </span> Example of calculating the customs value</h3>

<p>The goods are sold for Â£10,000. The transport costs in the UK are Â£200. The duty rate is 10%. The deposit was Â£900.</p>

<p>Using the formula:</p>

<p>Price paid Â£10,000 less 10% (Â£1,000) = Â£9,000 less transport costs Â£200 = Â£8,800 less included duty (10/110 Ã— 8,800) = Â£800 gives Customs value Â£8,000</p>

<p>The duty due is therefore Â£800.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll get a refund of Â£100 (Â£900 â€“ Â£800).</p>

<p>The document used for this calculation is called the duty reconciliation statement. You are to provide such a statement so that the duty due can be calculated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.11 </span> Guaranteed advances</h3>

<p>You may agree to make a payment to the supplier on condition that if the net proceeds from the sale of the goods are:</p>

<p>(a) more than the agreed payment, youâ€™ll also send your supplier the balance</p>

<p>(b) less than the agreed payment, youâ€™ll stand the loss</p>

<p>This agreement is called a guaranteed advance.</p>

<p>If (a) applies, Method 4(b) can be used.</p>

<p>If (b) applies, the guaranteed advance is to be used as the basis to arrive at the customs value under Method 1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.12 </span> Example where guaranteed advances are involved</h3>

<p>The goods are sold for Â£5,000. Your commission and expenses are Â£600. The duty rate is 10%. You agree to pay the supplier:</p>

<p>(1) Â£3,000
(2) Â£5,000</p>

<p>(1) Goods sold for Â£5,000 less commission/expenses Â£600 = Â£4,400 less included duty (10 Ã· 110 Ã— Â£4,400 = Â£400. Net proceeds Â£4,000 less amount already paid to supplier Â£3,000 leaves balance payable to supplier Â£1,000.</p>

<p>Method 4(b) can be used.</p>

<p>(2) Goods sold for Â£5,000 less commission/expenses Â£600 = Â£4,400 less included duty (10 Ã· 110 Ã— Â£4,400 = Â£400. Net proceeds Â£4,000. Amount already paid to supplier Â£5,000 exceeds net proceeds therefore Method 4(b) cannot be used.</p>

<p>The Customs value under Method 1 is to be based on the guaranteed advance of Â£5,000.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">38.1 </span> Case study one â€” yearly hire charge (not including maintenance)</h3>

<h4>Facts</h4>

<p>An electronic sorting machine is imported by a user under a hire contract, the main terms of which are:</p>

<p>(a) the importer is to pay the supplier a yearly hire charge of Â£1,000 in advance</p>

<p>(b) the machine is to be erected and maintained by the supplier at the expense of the importer</p>

<p>(c) import duties and taxes are borne by the importer</p>

<p>(d) post importation transport costs are borne by the importer</p>

<p>The machine is invoiced pro forma at an amount corresponding to 2Â½ years of rental. No payment is made in respect of this invoice. It has been established that these machines are never sold and are available only to users who are prepared to subscribe to the above contract for 5 years.</p>

<p>The importer and supplier are not related. The estimated life of the machine is 5 years. The interest rate is 15% per annum.</p>

<p>Therefore Q = 1,000, R = 15%, N = 5</p>

<p>Calculation</p>

<p>Image showing example of a calculation to find the amount of duty included in the invoice price</p>

<p>Â£3,855 rounded down in the importerâ€™s favour.</p>

<p>As this represents a value at the UK border, no further adjustments are required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">38.2 </span> Case study 2 â€” yearly hire charge (including maintenance and other expenses)</h3>

<h4>Facts</h4>

<p>A machine which produces artificial hair is imported by a doll manufacturer under a hire contract, the main terms of which are:</p>

<p>(a) the importer is to pay the supplier a hire charge of Â£1,000 per annum</p>

<p>(b) the hire charge is to be paid annually in arrears</p>

<p>(c) the supplier will maintain the machine free of charge</p>

<p>(d) import duties and taxes will be paid by the importer</p>

<p>(e) the costs of delivery to the importerâ€™s premises will be paid by the supplier</p>

<p>The machine is invoiced at a nominal price in respect of which no payment is made. The importer and supplier are not related.</p>

<p>The estimated life of the machine is 13 years. The interest rate is 15% pa. The average maintenance cost will be Â£140 pa.</p>

<p>Therefore Q = (1000 â€“ 140) = 860, R = 15%, N = 13</p>

<p>Calculation</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">39. </span> Examples of apportionment of transport costs and insurance charges</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">39.1 </span> Goods invoiced on pre-<abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> UK border terms</h3>

<p>(a) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> terms.</p>

<p>Freight from Japan to Tilbury separately charged â€” Â£1,000.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Tilbury.</p>

<p>Place of introduction Tilbury.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The charge for transport is to the place of introduction.</p>

<p>No deduction for transport in the UK is needed. Therefore, the amount to be included in the Customs value for transport costs is Â£1,000.</p>

<p>(b) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> terms.</p>

<p>Freight from Norway to buyerâ€™s warehouse in Glasgow separately charged â€” Â£200.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Leith.</p>

<p>Place of introduction Leith.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The place of introduction is Leith but the charge for freight is to the buyerâ€™s warehouse in Glasgow.</p>

<p>The journey from Leith to Glasgow is in the UK.</p>

<p>The cost of the journey from Norway to Leith is shown in the shipping lineâ€™s rate book as Â£180.</p>

<p>Therefore only Â£180 is to be included in the customs value.</p>

<p>(c) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on ex-works terms.</p>

<p>Freight from sellerâ€™s factory to New York is separately charged â€” Â£50.</p>

<p>Freight from New York to Canterbury is separately charged â€” Â£600.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Canterbury .</p>

<p>Place of introduction Dover where the goods were transhipped.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The place of introduction is Dover.</p>

<p>But the charge for freight is to Canterbury.</p>

<p>The journey from Dover to Canterbury is in the UK.</p>

<p>The cost of the journey from New York to Dover is shown in the shipping lineâ€™s rate book as Â£550.</p>

<p>The whole of the freight charge from the sellerâ€™s factory to New York is to be included in the customs value.</p>

<p>Total freight addition = Â£550 + Â£50 = Â£600.</p>

<p>(d) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on delivered airport of departure terms.</p>

<p>Air transport costs from New York to Heathrow Airport separately itemised â€” Â£300.</p>

<p>Total air waybill charges (inclusive of charges for loading and handling at airport of departure) â€” Â£350.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Heathrow Airport.</p>

<p>Place of introduction is the notional point where the aircraft crosses the UK border.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The place of introduction is the UK border BUT the charge for freight is to Heathrow Airport.</p>

<p>The journey from the UK border to Heathrow Airport is in the UK. Therefore, the cost of that part of the journey is to be deducted from the total charge for the air transport costs.</p>

<p>Total air transport costs â€” Â£300.</p>

<p>Percentage of journey outside UK 70% (see section 40). Therefore 70% of the air transport costs are to be included in the Customs value:</p>

<p>70% Ã— Â£300 = Â£210</p>

<p>Plus</p>

<p>The difference between the air way bill charges and the air transport costs. These are made up of costs incurred in the country of export, such as loading, handling and clearing charges. The total cost must be included in the customs value.</p>

<p>Â£350 â€“ Â£300 = Â£50</p>

<p>Total charge to be included in the Customs value = Â£210 + Â£50 = Â£260</p>

<p>(e) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> aircraft terms.</p>

<p>Air transport costs from New York to Glasgow Airport separately charged â€” Â£400.</p>

<p>Air transport costs from Glasgow Airport to Heathrow Airport separately charged â€” Â£100.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Heathrow Airport.</p>

<p>Place of introduction is the notional point where the aircraft from New York to Glasgow crosses the UK border.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The place of introduction is the UK border. The air transport costs from Glasgow Airport to Heathrow Airport are not to be included in the customs value because that journey is in the UK.</p>

<p>Also the journey from the UK border to Glasgow Airport is in the UK. Therefore the cost of that part of the journey is to be deducted from the total charge for the air transport costs (from the Â£400).</p>

<p>Total air transport costs from New York to Glasgow â€” Â£400</p>

<p>Percentage of journey outside the UK â€” 70%</p>

<p>(Section 40 gives details of the percentage of the air transport costs to the UK which must be included in the Customs value).</p>

<p>Therefore 70% of the air transport costs from New York to Glasgow are to be included in the Customs value:</p>

<p>70% Ã— Â£400 = Â£280.</p>

<p>(f) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> Hong Kong terms.</p>

<p>Goods shipped by sea to Singapore and then by air to Heathrow Airport.</p>

<p>The charge for sea freight from Hong Kong to Singapore is Â£500.</p>

<p>The charge for air freight from Singapore to Heathrow Airport is Â£1,000.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Heathrow Airport.</p>

<p>Place of introduction is the notional point where the aircraft crosses the UK border.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The sea journey is outside the UK. Thus the sea freight charge of Â£500 is includible in the customs value.</p>

<p>The journey from the UK border to Heathrow Airport is in the UK. Therefore, the cost of that part of the journey is to be deducted from the total charge for air freight.</p>

<p>Total air freight charge â€” Â£1,000</p>

<p>Percentage of journey outside UK 70% (see section 40, all airports to London).</p>

<p>Therefore 70% of the air freight is to be included in the customs value:</p>

<p>70% Ã— Â£1,000 = Â£700.</p>

<p>Total charge to be included in the customs value = Â£500 + Â£700 = Â£1,200</p>

<p>(g) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on <abbr title="Free on Board">FOB</abbr> Tokyo terms.</p>

<p>Goods shipped by sea from Tokyo to Seattle and then by air from Seattle to Heathrow Airport.</p>

<p>The total freight charge from Tokyo to Heathrow Airport is Â£2,000. No breakdown of the charges for the sea and air journeys is available.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Heathrow Airport.</p>

<p>Place of importation is the notional point where the aircraft crosses the UK border.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The place of introduction is the UK border but the charge for freight is to Heathrow Airport.</p>

<p>The journey from the UK border to Heathrow Airport is in the UK. Therefore the cost of that part of the journey is to be deducted from the total freight charge.</p>

<p>As no breakdown of this charge is available, for practical convenience the air transport cost apportionment may be used.</p>

<p>Percentage of journey outside UK 83% (section 40).</p>

<p>Therefore 83% of the total freight charge is to be included in the customs value. 83% Ã— Â£2,000 = Â£1,660.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">39.2 </span> Goods invoiced on post-<abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> UK border terms</h3>

<p>(a) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> Birmingham terms.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Avonmouth.</p>

<p>Place of introduction Avonmouth.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The invoiced amount includes transport to Birmingham, which is beyond the place of introduction but is not separately charged.</p>

<p>The seller states that the amount included in the invoice price for the transport from Avonmouth to Birmingham is Â£50.</p>

<p>Therefore the amount to be deducted from the invoice price for post-introduction transport cost is Â£50.</p>

<p>(b) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on uniform free delivered domicile terms.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Dover.</p>

<p>Place of introduction Dover.</p>

<p>Evidence is provided to show that the free-frontier price would be lower than the uniform free domicile price.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>The invoiced amount includes transport to the buyerâ€™s premises in Manchester, Glasgow and Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>The seller states that the average amount included in the invoice price for transport in the UK to the buyerâ€™s premises is Â£9 per metric tonne.</p>

<p>Therefore the amount to be deducted from the invoice price for post-introduction transport costs is Â£9 per metric tonne.</p>

<p>(c) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on delivered Horsham terms.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Brighton.</p>

<p>Place of introduction Newhaven (that is, the UK border).</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The invoiced amount includes transport to Horsham which is beyond the place of introduction but is not separately charged.</p>

<p>There is no statement from the seller of the amount included in the invoice price of the transport from Newhaven to Horsham.</p>

<p>But there is a statement from the haulier of the price charged for the transport to the seller.</p>

<p>This evidence can be accepted without confirmation from the seller that this charge has been costed into the price to the buyer.</p>

<p>(d) Facts</p>

<p>Goods purchased on <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> Heathrow Airport terms.</p>

<p>Goods imported at Heathrow.</p>

<p>Place of introduction is the notional point where the aircraft crosses the UK border.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>The invoiced amount includes air transport costs to Heathrow, which is beyond the place of introduction but is not separately charged.</p>

<p>There is no statement from the seller of the amount included in the invoice price for the air transport costs to Heathrow.</p>

<p>A copy of the air waybill is produced as evidence of the amount charged for the air transport.</p>

<p>This evidence will be accepted by us providing it can be confirmed that the charge shown on the air waybill is the amount costed into the <abbr title="Cost, Insurance and Freight">CIF</abbr> price by the seller of the goods. The percentages shown in section 40 can then be applied in the normal way.</p>

<p>Where no confirmation can be obtained from the seller, no deduction can be allowed and the air transport percentages do not apply.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">39.3 </span> Example of apportionment of insurance costs</h3>

<p>Annual set premium â€” Â£350</p>

<p>Total value of imports in the previous 12 months â€” Â£1,750,000</p>

<p>The premium can be expressed as a percentage of the total value of imports.</p>

<p>350 Ã· 1.750,000 Ã— 100 = 0.02%</p>

<p>This percentage can be used to calculate the insurance costs for individual imports made during the following 12 months.</p>

<p>Where the total value of imports includes, for example, insured or non-insured goods or both dutiable and non-dutiable imports, the percentage can be adjusted if the relevant information is available.</p>
