<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Summary</h2>
<p>The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund provides financial support to help students overcome the specific financial barriers to participation they face so they can remain in education.</p>

<p>There are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursaries:</p>

<ol>
  <li>bursaries for defined vulnerable groups</li>
  <li>discretionary bursaries which institutions award using policies they set, in line with these funding rules</li>
</ol>

<p>Any references to âweâ or âusâ below are to ESFA.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Key points for the 2022 to 2023 academic year</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Revised calculation methodology</h3>

<p>The Department for Education (DfE) revised the methodology used to calculate discretionary bursary allocations in the 2020 to 2021 academic year to better match financial disadvantage and student needs across the country. To reflect that change, transitional arrangements have been applied.</p>

<p>In the 2020 to 2021 academic year, institutions received no less than 75% and no more than 125% of the total amount of discretionary bursary funding they were allocated in the 2019 to 2020 academic year.</p>

<p>In the 2021 to 2022 academic year, the lower and upper limits increased to +/- 50% so institutions received no less than 50% and no more than 150% of the value of their 2019 to 2020 discretionary bursary allocation.</p>

<p>In the 2022 to 2023 academic year, the lower and upper limits will further change so institutions receive no less than 25% and no more than 175% of the value of their 2019 to 2020 discretionary bursary allocation.</p>

<p>Transitional arrangements will cease in the 2023 to 2024 academic year when the intention is to base allocations on their actual calculated values.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2022-to-2023-academic-year/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2022-to-2023-academic-year#Funding">funding and allocations: discretionary bursaries</a> section of these funding rules contains a summary of the methodology, but institutions should also refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2022-to-2023">explanatory notes</a> that accompany funding allocations (issued in February/March 2022).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Assess actual financial needs</h3>

<p>Institutions must ensure they assess the actual financial needs of individual students in addition to eligibility when awarding bursary funding. Our audit and assurance work and ongoing monitoring/feedback activity by DfE continues to find institutions making flat rate/fixed rate payments to students without considering students actual financial needs. Both types of bursary funding are designed to help students overcome the individual financial barriers to participation they face, and institutions must ensure the funds go to those who genuinely need them. No student should automatically be awarded a set amount of funding without an assessment of the level of actual financial need they have.</p>

<p>Institutions must ensure they have a clear and accessible policy or statement setting out how they will use their bursary fund, the eligibility criteria they use and any terms and conditions they set.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Tool to assess applications</h3>

<p>This guide includes a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063803/16-19_Bursary_Checklist_1_.pdf">checklist</a> institutions can use when assessing bursary applications from students, and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063806/16_to_19_Bursary_summary_1_.pdf">summary</a> that lists the most important things that institutions should consider when administering the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund. These reflect common errors and issues identified during audits.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Essential costs</h3>
<p>We remind institutions that the bursary fund is intended to help students with the essential costs of participating in their study programme, so to help with the cost of essential books or equipment or with the cost of travelling to school or college, for example. The bursary fund is not intended to support costs not related to education (living costs), extra-curricular activities or provide learning support â services that institutions give to students â such as counselling, mentoring or extra tutoring.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Eligibility criteria: all bursaries</h2>
<p>Students must meet the age and residency criteria which follow to be eligible for help from the bursary fund.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Age</h3>

<p>A student must be aged 16 or over but under 19 on 31 August 2022 to be eligible for help from the bursary fund in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>Students aged 19 or over are only eligible to receive a discretionary bursary if they are continuing on a study programme they began aged 16 to 18 (19+ continuers) or have an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP).</p>

<p>These 2 groups of aged 19+ students can receive a discretionary bursary while they continue to attend education (in the case of a 19+ continuer, this must be the same programme they started before they turned 19), as long as their eligibility continues and their institution considers they need the support to continue their participation.</p>

<p>Students aged 19 or over are not eligible for bursaries for vulnerable groups.</p>

<p>Institutions should generally only pay bursaries to students aged 16 or over. However, in exceptional circumstances where under 16 students are on funded 16 to 19 study programmes at the institution, they may use their discretion to pay bursaries to younger students. For example, where a student is following an accelerated study programme. Bursary funds should not be awarded to students enrolled at another institution, where that institution also receives public funding for the student, for example, students aged 14 to 16 who are attending college as part of their key stage 4 programme at a local school/academy. Paragraphs 44 to 48 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision">ESFA funding regulations</a> for post-16 provision provide more detail about funded 14 to 16 year olds.</p>

<p>Students aged under 19 enrolled on higher education qualifications are not eligible for support from the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Eligible education provision</h3>
<p>Students must be participating in provision that is subject to inspection by a public body that assures quality (for example Ofsted). The provision must also fall into one of these groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>funded directly by us, or by us via a local authority</li>
  <li>funded or co-financed by the European Social Fund</li>
  <li>otherwise publicly funded and lead to a qualification (up to and including level 3) accredited by Ofqual or on our list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/section-96-qualifications">qualifications approved for funding 14 to 19</a>
</li>
  <li>a 16 to 19 traineeship programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Students on apprenticeship programmes, or any waged training, are employed, rather than in education. They are not eligible for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund.</p>

<p>Non-employed students aged 16 to 19 who are participating in a Princeâs Trust Team Programme are eligible to receive the bursary in the same way as any other student participating in an eligible, publicly funded course.</p>

<p>We do not expect students on distance learning provision to need help from the bursary fund because they do not have the kinds of costs the bursary is intended to cover (travel, equipment, and uniforms, for example). In the rare instances where an institution identifies such a student does require financial help, they should provide support in-kind. An example could be providing a temporary travel pass for the student to attend exams.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Residency</h3>
<p>Students must meet the residency criteria in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision">ESFA funding regulations</a> for post-16 provision. This document also specifies the evidence institutions must see and retain for audit to confirm eligibility for post-16 funding (and therefore meet the residency criteria for bursary fund eligibility).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Accompanied asylum seeking children (under 18 with an adult relative or partner)</h3>
<p>Generally, asylum seekers are not entitled to public funds. Accompanied asylum seeking children (those under 18 with an adult relative or partner) and those aged 18 and above are entitled to education, but not to public funds. If they are destitute, they can apply to the Home Office (HO) for suitable housing and cash for essentials, but they are not eligible for other income.</p>

<p>As long as an asylum seeker has not had their application for asylum refused, institutions can provide in-kind student support such as books, equipment, or a travel pass. Under no circumstances should an institution give cash to any asylum seeker unless they are an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child (UASC).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Unaccompanied asylum seeking children</h3>
<p>Unaccompanied asylum seeking children do not receive cash support from the HO and are the responsibility of the local authority. They are treated as looked after children and are eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups (âin careâ group), where they have a financial need.</p>

<p>When these young people reach legal adulthood at age 18, institutions must consider their immigration status. If the asylum claim is decided in their favour, the local authority must provide them with the same support and services as they do care leavers. As such, they continue to be eligible for a bursary as a student from a vulnerable group until they reach the upper <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2022-to-2023-academic-year/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2022-to-2023-academic-year#age">age</a> limit.</p>

<p>Where an asylum claim is not supported, the individual may not be able to stay legally in the UK. When asylum claims have been fully heard/the appeals process exhausted, an individual has no entitlement to public funds (with a few exceptions where the withdrawal of support would be seen as a breach of human rights).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Eligibility criteria: bursaries for young people in defined vulnerable groups</h2>
<p>Students who meet the criteria, and who have a financial need, can apply for a bursary for vulnerable groups. The defined groups reflect that these students are unlikely to be receiving financial assistance from parents or carers, so may need a greater level of support to enable them to continue to participate. Students should be awarded the amount of support they need to participate based on an assessment of the types of costs they have and must not be automatically awarded Â£1,200. Institutions must ensure students are eligible for the bursary for defined vulnerable groups in each year they require support.</p>

<p>The defined vulnerable groups are students who are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in care</li>
  <li>care leavers</li>
  <li>receiving Income Support (IS), or Universal Credit (UC) because they are financially supporting themselves or financially supporting themselves and someone who is dependent on them and living with them, such as a child or partner</li>
  <li>receiving Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Personal Independence Payments (PIP) in their own right as well as Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) or UC in their own right</li>
</ul>

<p>UC has now fully rolled out and so young people aged 16 to 18 will no longer be in receipt of the other benefits listed above. However, students aged 19 to 25 and funded from the 16 to 19 budget (19+ continuers and those with an EHCP) may still be in receipt of those other legacy benefits.</p>

<p>The bursary for vulnerable groups can pay up to Â£1,200 per year to a student participating on a study programme that lasts for 30 weeks or more if they need that amount of support. Students on study programmes of less than 30 weeks should be paid a pro-rata amount, as appropriate based on an assessment of their actual needs.</p>

<p>Institutions must also consider the number of hours involved in studentâs study programme when deciding if a pro-rata payment is more appropriate. A student studying for around 16 hours a week is likely to have greater costs than a student studying for 4 hours a week, for example.</p>

<p>Students should only receive the amount they actually need to participate, and institutions must not automatically award students Â£1,200 if they do not need the full amount.</p>

<p>Institutions may decide that although a young person may be eligible for a bursary because they are in one or more of the defined vulnerable groups, they do not have any actual financial need. This might be because their financial needs are already met and/or because they have no relevant costs. Institutions can refuse a studentâs application on this basis.</p>

<p>Equally, institutions can pay a bursary to a vulnerable group student of more than Â£1,200 if they assess they need extra help to remain in education. Any payments over Â£1,200 must be paid from their discretionary bursary allocation or from their own funds. If paid from discretionary bursary, all the eligibility criteria and usual assessment processes must be met and followed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Defining in care and care leavers</h3>
<p>The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund defines âin careâ as children looked after by a local authority on a voluntary basis (section 20 of the Children Act 1989) or under a care order (section 31 of the Children Act 1989). Section 22 of the Children Act 1989 defines the term âlooked after childâ.</p>

<p>A âcare leaverâ is defined as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>a young person aged 16 and 17 who was previously looked after for a period of 13 weeks consecutively (or periods amounting to 13 weeks), which began after the age of 14 and ended after the age of 16; or</li>
  <li>a young person aged 18 or above who was looked after prior to becoming 18 for a period of 13 weeks consecutively (or periods amounting to 13 weeks), which began after the age of 14 and ended after the age of 16</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Foster care, including privately arranged foster care</h3>
<p>A young person placed with a foster carer by the local authority, including where the foster carer is on the books of an independent fostering agency, is classed as looked after. They meet the criteria for the âin careâ vulnerable group where they need financial support to participate.</p>

<p>A child who is privately fostered (in other words, a private arrangement is made between the parent and the person who will care for the child) is not classed as a looked after child and is not eligible for the bursary for vulnerable groups.</p>

<p>In some instances, a young person may have been in the care of the local authority and the care transferred to another party via a permanent form of fostering such as a Special Guardianship Order. In these circumstances, the young person is defined as having left care so is now a care leaver. They must meet the definition of a âcare leaverâ in full (so, the period of weeks and age range set out above). If they do, they are eligible for help from the bursary for vulnerable groups, where they need financial support to participate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Universal Credit</h3>

<p>UC has replaced IS and ESA as well as other benefits. Institutions will increasingly see students claiming bursaries for defined vulnerable groups based on receiving UC.</p>

<p>UC award notifications do not include any information on the benefits they replace. For this reason, the description of the bursaries for vulnerable group category that relates to receipt of UC or IS is that a student must be receiving UC in their own right because they are financially supporting themselves and anyone who is dependent on them and living with them, such as a child or partner.</p>

<p>The DfE is keeping the situation surrounding the legacy benefits (above) under review, to ensure the descriptions of the defined vulnerable groups reflect the benefits situation.</p>

<p>Bursary funds awarded to a student should not form part of the UC assessment undertaken by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). How DWP treat any funding for education depends on whether the student is undertaking advanced full-time education. It is unlikely that 16 to 18 year olds will be in advanced full-time education as they are generally on study programmes at level 3 or below. Since full role out of UC, any current and future 16 to 18 year old can only claim UC, they can no longer claim IS or income related ESA.</p>

<p>Under UC, any educational award which is paid under a scheme to enable persons under age 21 to complete a course of non-advanced education (which will clearly include the 16 to 19 Bursary) does not fall to be treated as grant income for UC purposes â as provided under reg 68(7) of the UC Regulations 2013.</p>

<p>We do encourage institutions to provide support from the bursary fund by making payments in kind where possible. Institutions must not make bursary fund payments as regular payments for living costs. This is out of scope of the bursary fund and any such payments would be subject to the Social Security Amendment (Students and Income-related Benefits) Regulations 2000.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Evidence of eligibility</h3>
<p>Institutions must obtain proof that students meet the criteria for the bursary for vulnerable groups in full. In other words, that they are in receipt of the specified benefits in their own name or that they fully meet the definitions for in care/care leavers. Institutions should ask for evidence from each student and retain copies for audit purposes.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for students who are in care or a care leaver, written confirmation of their current or previous looked-after status from the relevant local authority â this is the local authority that looks after them or provides their leaving care services. The evidence could be a letter or an email but must be clearly from the local authority</li>
  <li>for students in receipt of UC or IS, a copy of their UC or IS award notice. This must clearly state that the claim is in the studentâs name/confirm they are entitled to the benefits in their own right. The evidence must not state any conditions that prevent them from participating in further education or training. For students in receipt of UC, institutions must also see a document such as a tenancy agreement in the studentâs name, a child benefit receipt, childrenâs birth certificates, utility bills and so on</li>
  <li>for students receiving UC/ESA and DLA and PIP, a copy of their UC claim from DWP. Evidence of receipt of DLA or PIP must also be provided</li>
</ul>

<p>UC claimants should be able to print off details of their award from their online account or provide a screenshot to the institution.</p>

<p>Students can also contact their UC Work Coach (or relevant Benefit Office if they are receiving getting IS or ESA) and ask them for help in providing evidence of receiving benefits.</p>

<p>Institutions must only submit a funding claim to the Student Bursary Support Service (SBSS) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://studentbursary.education.gov.uk/w/webpage/1619bursary" rel="external">online portal</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when they have seen and verified appropriate evidence to confirm that the student is eligible for the bursary for vulnerable groups, and</li>
  <li>when they have assessed the actual amount of financial help the student needs to participate. It is this amount that institutions should request from the SBSS</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Pro-rata bursaries for vulnerable groups</h3>

<p>Students who have a financial need who meet the criteria for a bursary for vulnerable groups may be eligible for a bursary of up to Â£1,200 (with the actual amount dependant on the specific financial needs they have) if they are on a study programme which lasts for 30 weeks or more in the academic year. Students who meet the criteria and who are on study programmes lasting for less than 30 weeks should be given a bursary on a pro-rata basis, as appropriate, with the actual amount dependent on the assessment of their specific financial needs.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a student is on a 30-week programme. If the institution assesses they have financial needs that require a full Â£1,200, the bursary may be Â£1,200 Ã· 30 = Â£40 per week</li>
  <li>if the same student was on a 10-week programme, the pro-rata bursary may be Â£40 x 10 weeks = Â£400</li>
</ul>

<p>Institutions should also consider the number of hours involved in a studentâs study programme when deciding if a pro-rata payment is more appropriate. A student studying for around 16 hours a week is likely to have greater costs than a student studying for 4 hours a week, for example.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Young people eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups who donât require bursary funding</h3>

<p>In some cases, a young person might meet the eligibility criteria for a bursary for vulnerable groups, but their financial needs are already met, they have no relevant costs or they do not need the maximum award.</p>

<p>For example a student:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attending specialist residential provision that covers their educational costs in full</li>
  <li>taking a distance learning programme who has no financial barriers to participation (for example, they donât have any travel costs or meal costs)</li>
  <li>in the care of the local authority whose educational costs are covered in full by the local authority</li>
  <li>who is financially supported by their partner</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances, institutions can refuse the studentâs application. The institution should explain to the student and/or the studentâs parents or support worker the aim of bursary funding and why they are not awarding any bursary.</p>

<p>If a student, or the studentâs parents or support worker, still wants to claim a bursary for vulnerable groups, institutions should consider the particular circumstances in each case. They should assess whether no bursary should be awarded (because the student has no financial needs) or to award a reduced amount (because the financial help needed is limited).</p>

<p>We recommend that institutions should be clear in their bursary fund application form that there is a possibility of no award or a limited award. This ensures all parties understand that meeting the criteria for a bursary for vulnerable groups does not automatically mean funding will be given. Institutions should ensure their forms avoid any terminology such as âguaranteed bursaryâ or wording such as âyou will automatically get a bursary of Â£1,200 if you are in one of the defined groupsâ.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Eligibility criteria: discretionary bursaries</h2>
<p>Institutions make discretionary bursary awards to help students with the cost of travel, to buy essential books, equipment, or specialist clothing (such as protective overalls, for example). These are items the student would otherwise need to pay for to participate.</p>

<p>The bursary fund is not intended to provide learning support â services that institutions give to students, for example, counselling or mentoring â to support extra-curricular activities where these are not essential to the studentsâ study programme or provide living costs support.</p>

<p>Institutions set their own eligibility criteria for the discretionary bursary but must comply with the eligibility conditions and funding rules set out in this guide. Institutions must ensure that students are eligible for the discretionary bursary in each year they require support.</p>

<p>Institutions must base all decisions about which students receive a discretionary bursary and how much bursary they receive on each studentâs individual circumstances and their actual financial need. These will vary from student to student, depending on, for example, eligibility based on household income, and their actual financial needs such as the distance they need to travel to the institution and the requirements of their study programme. Institutions must not make blanket or flat rate/fixed rate payments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to all students</li>
  <li>to students in particular income bands</li>
  <li>to students whose families are in receipt of particular benefits</li>
</ul>

<p>without considering the actual needs of each student. For example, although many students who had previously benefitted from a free school meal may have financial needs, these will vary depending on personal circumstances so an individual assessment of actual need should be made.</p>

<p>Institutions must manage the number and size of discretionary bursary awards to keep within their budget.</p>

<p>Institutions may decide to retain a small emergency fund from their allocation to support students who face exceptional circumstances during the year due to a change in their situation â if it impacts on their ability to participate in education. Evidence of the studentâs eligibility, the individual assessment and the studentâs actual participation costs must be held for audit purposes as for any other bursary fund application/award and all bursary expenditure must be in line with the funding rules in this guide. Institutions may also choose to top up the bursary with their own funds.</p>

<p>There is no set limit for the amount of discretionary bursary that can be awarded to students. Institutions can award discretionary bursaries equal to or higher than the bursary for vulnerable groups maximum as long as they have clearly identified an individual student has actual costs that require this level of funding to participate. The rationale must be included as part of their auditable records.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Using household income and establishing individual student need</h3>
<p>Institutions must ensure their bursary policy ensures funding reaches those students who are most in need of financial support. This means institutions must use household income in some way to help establish which students are eligible before confirming the amount of support a student may need. Institutions can decide to use household income in conjunction with other factors, such as distance to travel from the institution and the number of dependent children in the household, as well as the actual participation needs the student has.</p>

<p>It is for institutions to decide the process they use to assess household income, and the specific evidence they request from students/their families. However, DfE is aware that some institutions are unsure about how to use UC award notices when these are provided as evidence of household income. DfE suggests institutions may wish to ask for the 3 most recent monthly award statements. The take-home pay figure in addition to the amount of UC after all deductions will give a total monthly income. Using 3 months statements will act as a guide to the household income for a quarter of a year. Institutions could then estimate assumed income for a full year.</p>

<p>This guide includes an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063808/Example_of_a_UC_monthly_award_notice.pdf">example of a UC award notice</a>. The notice shows the 2 highlighted figures â one for take-home pay; one for the amount of UC after deductions â that should be added together to give a monthly total.</p>

<p>Institutions are encouraged to keep their bursary policies under review to ensure they continue to provide support to students who need it. For example, students from households being supported via lower income jobs could be in more financial need than a student in receipt of free school meals or where the family receives other benefits. An assessment of individual need should help to identify whether they are struggling to afford the books and equipment they need or to cover their essential travel costs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Supporting industry placements</h3>
<p>Institutions engaged in industry placement delivery are also encouraged to ensure their bursary policies can respond to the needs of students undertaking industry placements. A few students may find themselves facing financial difficulties due to incurring extra participation costs, for example, because they need to pay for additional travel to their placement. These students may only need support for a short period of time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Publishing bursary fund policies</h3>
<p>Institutions must publish a policy or statement setting out how they will use their bursary fund. The document should be available early enough for students to be able to use the information when deciding which post-16 institution to attend. The institutionâs eligibility criteria must be clear and available to us and students. The policy document must state that the support available to students is from the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund and institutions must be mindful of this if they develop their own financial support branding, and/or use their own funding to enhance their offer to students.</p>

<p>Institutions must comply with the requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/pdfs/ukpga_20100015_en.pdf" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a> when setting their criteria and must not discriminate against their students, either directly or indirectly, because of their protected characteristics.</p>

<p>Bursary fund policies must clearly set out what type of help the institution offers, for example, help with transport, books and equipment, field trips and other course-related costs and whether bursary support is available to contribute to the costs of attending industry placements, university interviews and open days.</p>

<p>Institutions should remember that whilst the bursary can be used for transport costs, it does not replace the statutory transport duty local authorities have. Each local authority must publish an annual transport statement that sets out the arrangements they will make to facilitate participation in education or training for students aged 16 to 19. Institutions should consider the relevant local authorityâs transport statement and local offers when setting their bursary fund policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Managing bursary fund applications</h3>
<p>Institutions develop and use their own application forms for students to apply for support from the bursary fund. Application forms must capture all the relevant information for the institution to assess the application in line with the bursary rules, including household income and the actual financial needs the student has to support their participation (such as help with travel or to buy essential books or equipment for example). The application form should be signed by the student.</p>

<p>Institutions delivering standard academic year provision may wish to specify that all applications for the bursary are submitted by a set date so they can assess the overall level of demand holistically and make discretionary awards on a fair basis. Any specific deadline date should be clearly stated in the application form and included in the bursary policy.</p>

<p>However, it is important to bear in mind that a studentâs circumstances and needs may change later in the year. A small emergency fund may be retained for this purpose but consequently, we recommend that there should be no absolute cut-off point for applications.</p>

<p>Institutions delivering short programmes, roll-on roll-off provision or industry placements, should enable students to apply for help from the bursary fund at any point during the year.</p>

<p>The institutionâs application process must maintain confidentiality and their application form, promotional materials and so on, should emphasise this message, so students donât feel embarrassed about applying.</p>

<p>Application forms, bursary policies and any supporting information must all be clear that students who meet the criteria for bursaries for vulnerable groups are not automatically entitled to a bursary if they do not have financial needs and/or their financial needs are covered from other sources. They may receive a lower amount of bursary or no bursary, if they do not have any actual participation costs.</p>

<p>It is best practice for students and/or their families to sign a declaration when they apply for help from the bursary to confirm that the evidence they have provided is correct and complete to the best of their knowledge and belief. Students and their families should be made aware that giving false or incomplete information that leads to incorrect/overpayment may result in future payments being stopped and any incorrectly paid funds being recovered. They should also be informed that this might result in a referral to the police with the possibility of the student and/or their family facing prosecution.</p>

<p>The institution should communicate the outcome of the application to the student (the amount of bursary they have been awarded and for what types of costs, for example, travel). The institution should also inform them how the costs will be paid, so in kind or by payments to their bank account. The institution must also set out clearly what terms and conditions they are attaching to the funding, so, attendance, when they require any receipts to be provided or the return of equipment at the end of the study programme, for example. The institution must hold a record of the planned amount of funding required based on the actual need of the student and this should be recorded against each participation need.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>What the bursary fund cannot be used for</h3>
<p>The bursary fund is not intended to</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide learning support â services that institutions give to students â for example, counselling, mentoring or extra tutoring</li>
  <li>support extra-curricular activities where these are not essential to the studentsâ study programme</li>
  <li>support general household incomes</li>
</ul>

<p>Institutions are not permitted to use the bursary fund in any way that would give them a competitive advantage over other institutions. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fees for access to facilities in the institution</li>
  <li>block subsidy of the canteen</li>
  <li>block subsidy of transport, or support for travel for all students regardless of family incomes</li>
  <li>block provision of equipment, material or books</li>
  <li>making bonus payments to reward attendance or achievement</li>
  <li>payments to support studentsâ general living costs</li>
</ul>

<p>Institutions must not use the bursary as a way of incentivising attendance or as a marketing tool to encourage students to choose their institution over another.</p>

<p>Where institutions use non-bursary funds to provide free travel for all their students, they must make clear that this is an offer from the institution, rather than being supported via the bursary fund.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Paying bursary funding to eligible students</h3>
<p>We encourage institutions to pay bursaries in-kind rather than cash as far as possible. This helps ensure that the bursary is spent for the reasons it was awarded. In-kind payments can include travel passes, vouchers or credits for meals, required books and required equipment.</p>

<p>Where institutions make in-kind payments, they should explain to the student the value of the payments and, if appropriate, how these have been deducted from their total bursary award.</p>

<p>Where institutions make bursary fund payments to students rather than providing support in-kind, it is good practice to pay the funding by BACS transfer to the studentâs own bank account. A basic bank account (which students can open at age 16) allows BACS transfers and allows the student to withdraw money.</p>

<p>Institutions must insist that students only spend the bursary payments they have made to them on the support that has been identified as necessary to help them participate in education. This means they must specify students can only use the funds to pay for travel costs and/or a meal during the day, to buy equipment or any other support that has been agreed.</p>

<p>Institutions should make the value of the award and any terms/conditions clear to the student in their award letter/confirmation document.</p>

<p>We have received several enquiries from institutions about receipts for expenditure. Receipts for expenditure and purchases made with bursary funding form part of the audit and assurance of the scheme. They confirm that funding is being used for the reasons it was awarded. For standard weekly costs like travel and food, it may not be practical to collect receipts for every transaction, so costs may be evidenced initially by receipts then paid linked to attendance. Students could then be asked to provide receipts to the institution at various points in the year (for example) which could form part of the terms/conditions set out in the award letter/confirmation document to students. Institutions should remember that the purpose of the bursary is to provide help to those who need it to participate and remain in education. Asking students to incur expenditure and provide a receipt first before providing any funding does not reflect the policy intent which is why payment in kind rather than in cash is recommended.</p>

<p>We do not expect bursary payments to be paid into another personâs account, except in exceptional circumstances where a student is unable to administer their own account. If the student cannot manage their own funds, the institution will need to consider who will manage the bursary on the studentâs behalf.</p>

<p>Where payments are made, it is good practice to make these on a regular basis (weekly, for example) as this helps students manage their finances. It also means that if a student has a payment withheld due to failing to meet the conditions the institution has set, they will not be left without financial support for a long period. However, institutions should take these decisions based on the reasons the bursary was awarded, the studentâs circumstances and local arrangements.</p>

<p>We do not recommend that institutions make large or lump sum bursary payments to students.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Conditions for receiving bursary funding</h3>
<p>Institutions should make payments for both the bursary for vulnerable groups and the discretionary bursary conditional on the student meeting agreed standards of attendance and behaviour.</p>

<p>Institutions must ensure that any standards they set are clear, and accessible, and that students understand them.</p>

<p>Institutions should ensure they obtain and retain evidence that a student has seen and agreed to the conditions. This might be an agreement signed by the student or a signed declaration that forms part of the institutionâs bursary fund application form.</p>

<p>Institutions can withhold payments if a student does not meet agreed standards, but they should always consider the individual circumstances of the student first. Sanctioning a student to the extent that their bursary funding had been stopped for a whole term, for example, is not recommended as it can stop students attending and undermine the purpose of the bursary fund.</p>

<p>Institutions should consider the impact on attendance that might be caused by illness, caring responsibilities or other exceptional circumstances. This should be built into the payment conditions agreed between the student and their institution, so that both parties are aware of the potential effect on payments.</p>

<p>Institutions should stop payments where students have been absent for a period of 4 continuous weeks or more (excluding holidays) and where students have decided to withdraw from a study programme. Institutions can also take money back from students if they have not spent it for the reasons it was awarded to them. However, institutions should consider the impact of such an action on the individual student before taking a final decision to do so.</p>

<p>If an institution purchases books or equipment for a student, they must specify the student must return these at the end of their study programme so they can be used again by another student where appropriate. So, if an institution purchases equipment (a laptop would be one example) that is necessary for the student to complete their study programme, they can purchase this with bursary funds and specify the student must return it once they have completed their study programme. If keeping equipment on campus is the best way of ensuring this happens, institutions have the right to set this as a condition.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>Institutionsâ responsibilities in managing complaints or appeals</h3>
<p>Any student or parent who is unhappy with how an institution has managed their application for bursary funding should follow the institutionâs own complaints procedure.</p>

<p>Institutions should manage the escalation of complaints about the bursary fund in the same way as any other complaint they may receive.</p>

<p>We do not have a role in the administration of bursary funding to students because this is the responsibility of individual institutions. As such, we do not usually get involved with complaints. However, we may get involved if there is an allegation that the bursary fund eligibility criteria or any content within this guide is being disregarded.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span>16 to 19 Bursary Fund and receipt of DWP benefits</h3>
<p>Institutions may wish to highlight to students and parents the impact of receipt of the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund on other benefits.</p>

<p>Receipt of bursary funding does not affect receipt of other means-tested benefits paid to families, such as IS, Jobseekerâs Allowance, Child Benefit, Working Tax Credit, Housing Benefit or, generally, UC (the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2022-to-2023-academic-year/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2022-to-2023-academic-year#universal-credit">UC section</a> of this document contains more detail about this benefit).</p>

<p>If a student is in receipt of DLA (or PIP) and ESA, parents can no longer receive certain household/family benefits for that child, such as child benefit.</p>

<p>Institutions must not make bursary fund payments as payments for living costs. This is out of scope of the bursary fund and any such payments would be subject to the Social Security Amendment (Students and Income-related Benefits) Regulations 2000.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Funding and allocations: bursary for vulnerable groups</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Drawing down funding for vulnerable groups</h3>
<p>Institutions should draw down funding for bursaries for vulnerable groups from the SBSS whenever they identify and verify new students who meet the criteria. Institutions can submit as many funding claims as they need to throughout the academic year. Institutions must ensure they have fully verified the studentâs eligibility and assessed their participation needs before submitting any funding claim. Institutions should only draw down the amount of funding they need from SBSS â they should not draw down the full Â£1,200 if the student does not need that amount of funding.</p>

<p>Institutions should not hold onto claims until the end of the academic year and submit them retrospectively for payment. Submitting funding claims regularly helps us to monitor the number of eligible students and the funding that is required to support them. It also ensures institutions do not need to use their discretionary bursary fund allocations to make payments for bursaries for vulnerable groups.</p>

<p>Institutions draw the funding down by completing and submitting a bursary for vulnerable groups funding claim via the SBSS <a class="govuk-link" href="https://studentbursary.education.gov.uk/w/webpage/1619bursary" rel="external">online portal</a>. The deadline for the submission of 2022 to 2023 academic year funding claims is 31 July 2023. The SBSS will not pay any claims submitted after this date.</p>

<p>The portal contains guidance about the submission of funding claims, but if institutions need further help, they can contact the SBSS provider helpline on 0300 303 8610 or use the web chat facility which is available throughout the process.</p>

<p>Institutions must retain a copy of the funding claims they submit to SBSS, and records of funding paid to them through the claims process. The portal is not intended to be a filing system for claims and institutions should ensure they keep their own records outside the portal for future audit. This includes local authorities who will receive payment for claims made by, or on behalf of, maintained schools.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Accessing the SBSS online portal for the first time</h3>
<p>To receive funding from the DfE and its associated bodies or agencies, institutions must provide information about banking and payments. The information required includes an email address.</p>

<p>The SBSS use this email address to create access details for the institutionâs administrator account in the online portal. When the main administrator account is created, an email containing a link to the portal is sent to the registered email address. This is followed immediately by a second email containing a temporary password â this must be used when accessing the portal for the first time. The system will then automatically request that the user sets up a new password for future use.</p>

<p>Once the main administrator has access, they can then set up other users for their institution. It is important that institutions make it clear to any staff who may be required to submit funding claims who their SBSS portal administrator is. Any individual who does not have access to the portal should contact their institutionâs main administrator to request it. They should not contact us or SBSS.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>How the SBSS processes and pays funding claims</h3>
<p>The SBSS carries out checks on the funding claim forms to verify that institutions are eligible to claim and that the form has been correctly completed. The usual processing time for a claim is within 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Once processed, a funding statement and remittance advice will be issued in the online portal to confirm payments. Payments will only be made to the institutionâs bank account we hold. No other bank account or method of payment is permitted.</p>

<p>It is important institutions keep their bank account and contact details up to date with us as any discrepancies will impact on payments. Institutions should request a change to their bank account details by completing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/provide-information-about-your-banking-and-payments-to-dfe">online form</a>. They should send any queries about amending bank account to to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dfe.standingdata@education.gov.uk">dfe.standingdata@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Institutions should contact SBSS if they have any queries about funding claims or payments made to them by SBSS they cannot resolve by using the information in the online portal. They should not contact us.</p>

<p>All our funded institutions in receipt of a discretionary bursary allocation in the 2022 to 2023 academic year and institutions delivering 16 to 19 traineeships in the academic year can submit a funding claim for bursaries for vulnerable groups if they have eligible students, they assess need financial help. Payment will be dependent on whether an institution has signed and returned their ESFA funding contract.</p>

<p>Institutions who are not in receipt of a discretionary bursary allocation in the 2022 to 2023 academic year may submit a funding claim for bursaries for vulnerable groups if they have eligible students. However, SBSS will need to make further checks with us before an institution can submit a claim.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Funding claims for students placed in independent provision</h3>
<p>Local authorities are responsible for submitting funding claims for students who they have placed in independent provision if they are eligible for bursaries for vulnerable groups and have a financial need.</p>

<p>The independent education institution is responsible for verifying that students meet the criteria for a bursary for vulnerable groups, including obtaining evidence and assessing their actual need for help. Once they are satisfied the student is eligible for support, they should contact the relevant local authority. The local authority cannot submit a funding claim without formal confirmation of eligibility from the institution. The institution can provide confirmation by sending the local authority a copy of the evidence they have seen or by setting out in writing/by email to the local authority that they have seen evidence to confirm eligibility.</p>

<p>The SBSS will pay the funding to the local authority if the funding claim is successful. Education institutions making funding claims through local authorities must ensure they liaise with the local authority finance contact to ensure the bursary funds are redirected to them as appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Recycling bursaries for vulnerable groups funding</h3>
<p>Institutions may accrue some unused funding for bursaries for vulnerable groups during the academic year. For example, if a student leaves their study programme early after only receiving part of their bursary, or the institution does not pay the full amount to a student because they did not meet the agreed conditions.</p>

<p>Institutions are expected to recycle this funding and use it to offset funding claims for other eligible students until 30 April 2023. For example, if the institution has a newly identified student who meets the criteria for a bursary for vulnerable groups and who they have assessed as needing Â£1,000 of financial support, the institution may already have Â£700 that they claimed for a student who has now left. The institution should recycle the Â£700 for the new student, claiming only Â£300 from the SBSS to give them the total amount of funding they need.</p>

<p>Institutions can add any funding for bursaries for vulnerable groups they have claimed, but no longer need, for eligible students to their discretionary bursary allocation from 1 May 2023.</p>

<p>Institutions that have incorrectly claimed funding for bursaries for vulnerable groups (for example, they submitted a funding claim without verifying a student met the criteria), should try to recycle the funding on subsequent funding claims. However, if the institution has no other students who are eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups, the incorrectly claimed funds cannot be added to their discretionary bursary allocation because they were claimed in error. Instead, institutions must contact SBSS to return the funds by emailing: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:1619bursary@studentbursary.education.gov.uk">1619bursary@studentbursary.education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Submitting âzeroâ funding claims</h3>
<p>Where an institution holds enough funds to cover the costs of a bursary for a vulnerable group eligible student in full, we ask that they submit a funding claim form to the SBSS showing a zero amount.</p>

<p>Similarly, if an institution has decided that a young person is in one or more of the defined vulnerable groups but does not have any actual financial need, it is also helpful if the institution submits a funding claim form showing a zero amount.</p>

<p>This helps give us information on the number of 16 to 19 students in education who are in each of the defined vulnerable groups.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Funding and allocations: discretionary bursaries</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Allocations</h3>
<p>We make discretionary bursary allocations to institutions that have a 16 to 19 contract or funding agreement each year.</p>

<p>If an institution operates from more than one location across England, or operates through subcontracts, we will make the allocation to the lead office for distribution to each site. Institutions should ensure that students attending provision delivered by subcontractors or at different sites can apply for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund. The lead institution is responsible for ensuring the bursary fund is administered appropriately at each site and at any subcontractor to ensure students can access support.</p>

<p>The methodology for calculating discretionary bursary allocations has 2 elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>element 1: financial disadvantage</li>
  <li>element 2: a) student costs to support travel and b) industry placements</li>
</ul>

<p>Both elements are based on analysis of end of 2020 to 2021 academic year full year data, to gauge which students help inform an institutionâs 2022 to 2023 academic year discretionary bursary allocation</p>

<p>The underlying requirement that institutions make awards based upon studentsâ financial needs to participate has not changed. However, to be clear, institutionsâ local bursary policies do not need to be split into these two elements, nor do they need to be referred to. These elements form part of the allocations methodology only. There is no ring fence between the elements and institutions can use the different elements flexibly to support studentsâ needs up to their full allocation.</p>

<p>Element 1, disadvantage, is calculated based on studentsâ home postcodes, matched against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019">Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2019</a>. The IMD is a government index that uses statistics on education, crime, health, employment and income to determine how disadvantaged an area is. Financial disadvantage instance values are assigned to students living in the 27% most deprived areas of the country.</p>

<p>Element 2, student costs, is intended to provide a general indicator of the main costs faced by students. There are 2 parts to this element:</p>

<ul>
  <li>element 2a calculates an amount of funding for travel for non-residential students whose home postcode is in the top 60% most deprived areas (based on IMD 2019). The calculation factors in rurality and distance travelled between the studentâs home postcode and the delivery location of their learning</li>
  <li>element 2b considers whether the studentâs study programme makes them eligible for industry placement funding via Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF) and their home postcode is in the top 60% most deprived areas. Only institutions approved to deliver industry placements via CDF in the 2022 to 2023 academic year are in scope for this funding</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2022-to-2023">explanatory notes</a> that are issued with funding allocations set out the calculation in full.</p>

<p>In a small number of instances, a âby exceptionâ process will be used. For example, the application of averages may be used where there is no end of year data available. This will be made clear to any institutions affected.</p>

<p>This methodology has only been in place since the 2020 to 2021 academic year and to reflect that transitional arrangements have been applied. In the 2020 to 2021 academic year, institutions received no less than 75% and no more than 125% of the total amount of discretionary bursary funding they were allocated in the 2019 to 2020 academic year. For the 2021 to 2022 academic year, the lower and upper limits increased to +/- 50%, meaning that institutions received no less than 50% and no more than 150% of the value of their 2019 to 2020 discretionary bursary allocation.</p>

<p>In the 2022 to 2023 academic year, the lower and upper limits will further change to +/- 75%, which is no less than 25% and no more than 175% of an institutionâs 2019 to 2020 discretionary bursary allocation. Transitional arrangements will cease in the 2023 to 2024 academic year when the intention is to base allocations on their actual calculated values.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Payments</h3>
<p>Discretionary bursary allocations are paid in 2 parts: two-thirds in August, one-third in April. The first payment for academies is September, in line with general academy payment schedules.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Convertor academies</h3>
<p>Any school sixth-forms that convert to academies in September will have already received their first bursary payment in August (via the local authority as school sixth-forms). We will make subsequent bursary payments directly to the academy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Maintained schools</h3>
<p>We makes discretionary bursary allocations to maintained schools with an ESFA-funded sixth form through local authorities. Local authorities should pass this bursary funding to the school.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>Maintained special schools</h3>
<p>Local authorities will also receive discretionary bursary funding to support students at maintained special schools (MSS). This bursary funding is aggregated and paid as a lump sum to each local authority. The discretionary bursary allocation methodology will be applied to the number of students recorded in the 2020 to 2021 summer census and will require the use of calculations based on averages. This is a single allocation, and local authorities are asked to distribute the bursary funding across all their MSS, according to need, using their own local knowledge and judgment</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span>New institutions</h3>
<p>We will make discretionary bursary funding available to institutions that start delivering eligible education and training for us for the first time in the 2022 to 2023 academic year. This could be during or after the 2022 to 2023 allocations round. These allocations will require the use of calculations based on averages.</p>

<p>To be eligible for an allocation, the institution must meet the eligible provision criteria set out in this guide. We may also undertake a financial health assessment of the institution before deciding to allocate funding.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.7 </span>Administration contribution</h3>
<p>Institutions are permitted to use up to 5% of their allocation for administrative costs relating to the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund. Institutions that receive both a 16 to 19 Bursary Fund and free meals in further education allocation are permitted to use up to 5% of the combined allocation for administration. Institutions must ensure they do not take a sum that is greater than 5% of the single allocation total.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Rules on unspent bursary funds</h2>
<p>We permit institutions to carry unspent bursary funds over to the next academic year. Institutions must continue to use any funds carried forward to support students in line with the funding rules in this guide. Institutions cannot add the funds to general funds.</p>

<p>Where institutions are given a single overall allocation that includes funding for both free meals and the discretionary bursary, they can carry forward funds from both schemes. Institutions may use this funding for either free meals or discretionary bursary payments in the new academic year.</p>

<p>Institutions must fully use any unspent funds for either discretionary bursary or free meals before using their new academic year allocation.</p>

<p>Institutions cannot carry forward funding for discretionary bursary and/or free meals funding for more than one year and must inform us of the total amount of any unspent funds (not previously reported) from any year up to and including the 2020 to 2021 academic year.</p>

<p>Institutions must report unspent funding using our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Education_and_Skills_Funding_Agency__ESFA__enquiry_form" rel="external">online enquiry form</a>. We encourage institutions to do this as soon as they are aware however they must report it no later than 31 March each year. We will recover the unspent funds.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Data returns, including the individualised learner record (ILR) and school census</h3>
<p>We remind institutions of the importance of completing the ILR or school census, as appropriate, to indicate the numbers of students receiving support from the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund.</p>

<p>Institutions must also ensure they complete the ILR or census fields to provide data on the number of students participating in industry placements.</p>

<p>We operate an in-year growth process for discretionary bursaries based on ILR or census data. This is part of the in-year growth process for 16 to 19 programme funding which will release additional funding to institutions where data indicates it is needed. Any growth or additional funding is subject to affordability.</p>

<p>In addition to the completion of the ILR or school census, DfE aims to undertake survey activity to monitor how effective the new allocations methodology is, providing information on how institutions are using the funding. The co-operation of institutions in completing the survey will be appreciated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Audit, assurance, and fraud</h3>
<p>16 to 19 Bursary Funds are subject to normal assurance arrangements for 16 to 19 education and training. Institutions must ensure they have appropriate processes in place to record bursary applications and expenditure at student level (including a breakdown of the value, purpose, whether awarded or not, and a brief justification for the decision). They must also be able to confirm, during any audit, the amount of any unspent funds that have been carried forward to the current academic year.</p>

<p>Institutions must ensure they can evidence their application process, how the student was assessed as eligible, how they made the decision to award the specific amount of bursary based on actual financial need and the funds that they have issued to the student. Auditors will be looking for evidence that institutions have a clear bursary policy, have applied their bursary fund eligibility criteria correctly and used a consistent application and assessment process for all students.</p>

<p>Institutions should retain copies of any documents the student has signed to give formal agreement to their conditions for payment. This might include attendance, returning equipment at the end of their study programme or certain points in the year when they need to provide receipts for expenditure, for example.</p>

<p>Institutions should retain hard or scanned copies of documentation for 6 years (records can be kept electronically). This includes the application form, the household income evidence and evidence of actual financial need.</p>

<p>Examples of documentation auditors expect to see include:</p>

<p>For the bursary for vulnerable groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the funding claim sent to SBSS</li>
  <li>evidence showing that the student is eligible, for example, a letter from DWP or the local authority or a copy of the studentâs online UC statement</li>
  <li>evidence of payments received from the SBSS, for example bank statements and remittance advices</li>
  <li>a copy of the studentâs individual assessment of actual financial need</li>
  <li>receipts for purchases or in-kind support provided to the student, for example, bus pass, lunch receipts or book receipts</li>
</ul>

<p>For the discretionary bursary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence used to assess eligibility and determine household income, such as P60âs, self-employment accounts, wage slips, a letter from DWP, copies of online statements for UC</li>
  <li>a copy of the studentâs individual assessment of actual financial need, including the calculation that has determined the amount awarded</li>
  <li>receipts for purchases or in-kind support provided to the student, for example, bus pass, lunch receipts or book receipts</li>
  <li>evidence to support the value of any cash payments made to the student such as travel pass, bus tickets or meal deals</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Common audit errors</h3>
<p>Common errors identified at audit, which can lead to the recovery of funds, include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no clear bursary fund policy in place which explains, for example, the criteria the institution will use to assess students and how they will make decisions about the amount of support they award</li>
  <li>bursary fund application forms which are not fit for purpose because they do not capture all the necessary evidence to confirm the studentâs household income and the actual participation costs they have</li>
  <li>application forms not completed and signed by students each year to allow an assessment of their current financial needs to be made</li>
  <li>financial assessments not always being undertaken or undertaken based on partial/incomplete evidence.</li>
  <li>making blanket or flat rate/fixed rate payments to students without considering their actual need for financial support or the types of costs they have. For example, awarding a student Â£10 a week when their travel costs are Â£3.50, and they have no other defined costs</li>
  <li>evidence to support household income not being retained</li>
</ul>

<p>It is good practice to use an eligibility checklist to ensure a clear and complete bursary fund process is followed, in line with the funding rules set out in this guide. This guide includes an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063803/16-19_Bursary_Checklist_1_.pdf">example checklist</a> which institutions may wish to use when assessing applications from students can be accessed below:</p>

<p>This guide also includes a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063806/16_to_19_Bursary_summary_1_.pdf">summary document</a> which lists the most important things that institutions should consider when administering the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund, based on common errors and issues ESFA auditors have identified.</p>

<p>We will recover funds where auditors identify funding errors in any circumstances where the institution is not able to demonstrate at audit how their students meet the eligibility criteria of the bursary fund or where the institution does not have sufficient evidence to support payments made to students, and in any circumstances where the institution has claimed vulnerable group bursary payments for duplicate students.</p>

<p>We take any concerns relating to financial irregularity or impropriety seriously. We will investigate where we assess those concerns have been raised in good faith and there is sufficient evidence to warrant it. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/complaints-procedure">Further guidance and contact details</a> are available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Institutions are responsible for investigating instances of fraud relating to bursary fund applications. If institutions find evidence that misleading or fraudulent information has been knowingly submitted by a student or parent, resulting in the student receiving a bursary they were not entitled to, they should attempt to recover the overpayment from the student.</p>

<p>Institutions that identify significant fraud should report it to us. Significant fraud involves one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of money is over Â£1,200</li>
  <li>the particulars of the fraud are novel, unusual, systemic or complex</li>
  <li>there is likely to be great public interest because of the nature of the fraud or the people involved</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Free meals in further education</h2>
<p>Institutions that receive allocations for both free meals in further education and the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund discretionary bursary continue to have flexibility to use the funding as a single allocation. Institutions must manage the single allocation appropriately to ensure all students eligible for a free meal receive one (including when they are attending a work placement) in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-meals-in-further-education-funded-institutions-guide-2022-to-2023-academic-year">free meals guide</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to the introduction of additional funding for free meals, institutions had supported the cost of meals for students who needed them from discretionary bursaries. For the 2022 to 2023 academic year, we will continue to adjust discretionary allocations calculated by the new methodology to take account of this double funding for those institutions also in receipt of an allocation for free meals.</p>

<p>Where students are eligible for a free meal, institutions should ensure they consider the provision of a free meal, or the funding provided to the student for the free meal, when they assess their overall need for support, whether from the discretionary bursary or bursaries for vulnerable groups to prevent double funding.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Other useful information</h2>
<p>This section provides information on specific groups of students to help inform institutionâs eligibility decisions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span>Young offenders</h3>
<p>Young offenders can apply for a bursary if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are serving a non-custodial sentence</li>
  <li>have been released early from a custodial sentence (except on temporary license)</li>
  <li>have been remanded to a non-secure institution</li>
</ul>

<p>Young offenders cannot apply for a bursary if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are serving a custodial sentence</li>
  <li>have been released from a custodial sentence on temporary license</li>
  <li>have been remanded to a secure institution</li>
</ul>

<p>Institutions should provide in-kind support to young offenders rather than cash wherever possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span>Residents of Scotland</h3>
<p>If a student lives in Scotland and travels to study at an English institution, they should approach their home local authority in Scotland to make an application for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mygov.scot/ema/?via=http://www.emascotland.com/" rel="external">Scottish Education Maintenance Allowances</a> (EMA). These students are not eligible to apply for support from the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund.</p>

<p>If a student lives in England and travels to study at a Scottish institution, they should approach their home local authority in England to make an application for a discretionary or vulnerable group bursary. These students are not eligible for Scottish EMA.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span>Residents of Wales</h3>
<p>If a student lives in Wales and travels to study at an English institution, they should approach their home local authority to make an application for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mygov.scot/ema/?via=http://www.emascotland.com/" rel="external">Welsh EMA</a>.</p>

<p>Students may also apply to their English institution for help from the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund discretionary bursary but are not eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups. Institutions should consider any support the student is receiving from Wales before making any bursary award.</p>

<p>All students living in England and travelling to Wales to study who meet the criteria for a bursary for vulnerable groups are eligible to apply for one if they have a financial need. They should approach their home local authority in England to make an application.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Good practice</h2>
<p>The following section highlights some areas of good practice in administering both types of bursary fund.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span>Raising awareness of the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund</h3>
<p>Examples of policies and procedures designed to raise early awareness of the bursary include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a college has information about the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund on their website and in their prospectus, as well as on posters that are on display around the college throughout the year. The college distributes information at open evenings for year 11 pupils from local schools. Further information, including an application form, is available following enrolment and all new entrants receive a text message and email about the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund soon after the start of the academic year</li>
  <li>in another college, as well as information about the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund being in prospectuses and posters, the college also works with local support services to target potential students who are homeless and provide them with information</li>
  <li>one college raises awareness about the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund by providing information to prospective students prior to enrolment at open evenings, talks at schools and so on. Any young person who attends a pre-enrolment interview gets a card with brief information on the bursary and pointers directing them to the full information on the collegeâs website. In addition, social workers who work with the most disadvantaged young people help the college to identify those who may be eligible for the bursary for vulnerable groups</li>
  <li>another college uses text messages throughout the year to inform students of the financial support available to them. In the summer term, text messages are sent to inform students that application forms are available to download and complete</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span>Identifying students eligible for bursaries for vulnerable groups</h3>
<p>Institutions can take the initiative to identify students eligible for a bursary for vulnerable groups by working with the local authority, looked after childrenâs education services and care leaver services, to encourage students to apply. Institutions and local authorities can also set up local data sharing agreements to share information about which students might be in need. For example, institutions might want to ask their local authority if a young person received free school meals in year 11.</p>

<p>Examples of working with local stakeholders to identify eligible young people:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in one area, institutions include information on the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund in a bulletin to social worker contacts. This is published 3 times a year, and ensures contacts are updated about the bursary</li>
  <li>another collegeâs Inclusion Manager, who has developed links with local agencies working with vulnerable young people (YMCA, Social Services, and Youth Offending Teams), identifies young people who might need support. This helps the college identify young people likely to be in need before enrolment. They then assist in completing the application process if appropriate</li>
  <li>one college promotes the bursary through partner organisations, social services, foster parent networks, schools, asylum support teams and youth offending and health services. The college works with these organisations to identify and engage with young people considering further education and to provide opportunities to discuss the support they may need</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span>Identifying students who may need support from the discretionary bursary</h3>
<p>The DfE recognises that it can be difficult for institutions to identify which students may need help from the discretionary bursary if they do not proactively ask for support. General further education colleges, sixth form colleges, school sixth forms, 16 to 19 academies and specialist post-16 institutions can now check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.keytosuccess.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">key to success</a> site to find out if new students were in receipt of pupil premium funding in year 11 or received SEND support. Schools and colleges can use this information to identify students they could proactively approach to see if they require support.</p>

<p>Institutions should not use this information to guarantee support or to offer blanket support to students. However, it could be a helpful source of information for institutions to use to identify students they could proactively approach to see if financial support is required (subject to the usual assessment of individual need).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span>Young people with caring responsibilities</h3>
<p>Young people with caring responsibilities, for example, caring for a parent or other relative, may be reluctant to say so because of fear of being stigmatised. Institutions should ensure confidentiality to reduce these concerns, publicise the availability of help from the bursary fund and encourage young carers to apply where they have a financial need.</p>

<p>When assessing young carersâ eligibility for support from the bursary, institutions could consider whether they have had a young carers assessment (which includes questions about the support they need for education), whether they access a young carers service, whether their GP could confirm their caring role or whether they receive Carers Allowance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span>Working with other organisations</h3>
<p>Institutions are encouraged to work with other local institutions and the local authority to agree a common approach to the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund. This could include institutions working together to identify and support eligible students, pool funds and centrally manage and administer the bursary. For example, one group of colleges has created a Learning Executive with representatives from each local college. This meets regularly and sets a consistent approach to financial support across all colleges in the area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.6 </span>Paying bursary funding to students</h3>
<p>Institutions should always ensure students and their families know who they should contact if they have any queries about payments.</p>

<p>Some examples of different payment approaches used by institutions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one institution involves carers and social workers in establishing the most appropriate way of getting the funding to the young person. At the beginning of term, if the student needs specialist equipment and/or a travel pass, the college purchases this and deducts the cost from the studentâs overall award. In cases where a carer has responsibility for the young personâs finances, the institution sets up meetings with them to decide how payments should be made</li>
  <li>in another institution, a financial support advisor interviews students to decide together on the best way to deliver his or her support. They address priority areas first: travel to college, equipment costs and support with studies. They also discuss additional expenditure, such as university visits</li>
  <li>one institution pays students a greater amount of funding at the start of their course so they can pay for equipment and course-related items. Students use travel vouchers to pay for bus fares. The student services team meet with the students regularly to help them with budgeting</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>How to ask a question about the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund</h2>
<p>These funding rules should provide the information that institutions need to administer the bursary and should be consulted before contacting us. However, if institutions have a question that is not answered by this guide, they can contact us via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=/en&amp;cancelRedirectLink=/en" rel="external">online enquiry form</a>.</p>
