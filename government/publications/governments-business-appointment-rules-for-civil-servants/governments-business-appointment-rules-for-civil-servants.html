<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>THE BUSINESS APPOINTMENT RULES FOR CIVIL SERVANTS</h2>

<p>The following Rules cover the Civil Service. Equivalent versions of the Rules are
in place for the Diplomatic Service/Intelligence Agencies/Armed Forces.
The Rules apply to civil servants who intend to take up an appointment or
employment after leaving the Civil Service.</p>

<p>The approval process for applications under the Rules differs depending on the
applicantâs seniority.</p>

<p>For members of the Senior Civil Service and equivalents, including special
advisers of equivalent standing, the Rules continue to apply for two years after
the last day of paid Civil Service employment.</p>

<p>For those below the Senior Civil Service and equivalents, including special
advisers of equivalent standing, the Rules continue to apply for one year after
leaving the Civil Service, unless, exceptionally, the role has been designated as
one where a longer period of up to two years will apply.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Key Principles</h2>

<p>These Rules are designed to uphold the core values in the Civil Service Code:
Integrity</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must not misuse your official position, for example by using information
acquired in the course of your official duties, to further your private interests or
those of others.
Honesty</li>
  <li>You must not be influenced by improper pressures from others or the prospect of
personal gain.
Objectivity</li>
  <li>You must take decisions on the merits of the case. 
Impartiality</li>
  <li>You must not act in a way that unjustifiably favours or discriminates against
particular individuals or interests.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is in the public interest that people with experience of public administration
should be able to move into other sectors, and that such movement should not be
frustrated by unjustified public concern over a particular appointment. It is equally
important that when a former civil servant takes up an outside appointment or
employment there should be no cause for justified public concern, criticism or
misinterpretation.</p>

<p>The aim of the Rules is to avoid any reasonable concerns that:</p>

<p>a.  a civil servant might be influenced in carrying out his or her official duties by
the hope or expectation of future employment with a particular firm or
organisation, or in a specific sector; or</p>

<p>b.  on leaving the Civil Service, a former civil servant might improperly exploit
privileged access to contacts in Government or sensitive information; or</p>

<p>c.  a particular firm or organisation might gain an improper advantage by
employing someone who, in the course of their official duties, has had access to:</p>

<p>i.  information relating to unannounced or proposed developments in
Government policy, knowledge of which may affect the prospective
employer or any competitors; or</p>

<p>ii.  commercially valuable or sensitive information about any
competitors.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Who must apply, when and how</h2>

<p>The Rules apply to all civil servants. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Permanent civil servants;</li>
  <li>Civil servants employed on fixed term contracts;</li>
  <li>Civil servants on secondment to other organisations; and</li>
  <li>Special advisers</li>
</ul>

<p>For those at SCS1 level and above (and equivalents), the Rules apply for two
years after leaving the Civil Service. For those below SCS1 level (and equivalents), 
they normally apply for one year after leaving the Civil Service<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. In circumstances
where an individual is undertaking a role on temporary promotion immediately prior to
leaving the Civil Service, it will be the temporary grade that will determine how the Rules
are to be applied.</p>

<p>Before accepting any new appointment or employment, whether in the UK
or overseas, which they intend to take up after they have left the Civil Service,
individuals must consider whether an application under the Rules is required. If it
is required, they should not accept or announce a new appointment or offer of
employment before it has been approved. The application form for this purpose is
available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="link"></a> and on departmental intranets. This form should be used for all applications under the Rules.</p>

<p>Retrospective applications will not normally be accepted.</p>

<p>The process for giving approval differs depending on the applicantâs seniority.
Permanent Secretaries and SCS3 (and equivalents, including special advisers of
equivalent standing)</p>

<p>An application is required for any new appointment or employment that
individuals wish to take up during the two year period after leaving office. All
applications at this level must be referred by the Department to the Advisory Committee
on Business Appointments (the Advisory Committee). The Advisory Committee provides
advice to the Prime Minister, who makes the final decision <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because of their role at the highest level of Government, and their access to a
wide range of sensitive information, all Permanent Secretaries, including Second
Permanent Secretaries, will be subject to a minimum waiting period of three months
between leaving paid Civil Service employment and taking up an outside appointment
or employment. The Advisory Committee may advise that this minimum waiting period
should be waived if, in its judgement, no questions of propriety or public concern arise
from the appointment or employment being taken up earlier. Equally, the Advisory
Committee may consider that public concern about a particular appointment or
employment could be of such a degree or character that a longer waiting period is
appropriate. Taking account of the maximum waiting period of two years that may be
applied, the Advisory Committee may, exceptionally, add a rider to their advice to the
Prime Minister stating that they view the appointment or employment to be unsuitable.</p>

<p>As a general principle, there will be a two year ban on all Permanent Secretaries
and SCS3 (and equivalents, including special advisers of equivalent standing) lobbying
Government on behalf of their new employer after they leave the Civil Service. The two
year lobbying ban may be reduced and/or modified by the Advisory Committee if they
consider this to be justified by the particular circumstances of an individual application.</p>

<p>Lobbying in the context of these Rules means that the former civil servant should not
engage in communication with Government (including Ministers, special advisers and
officials/public office holders) â wherever it takes place - with a view to influencing a
Government decision, policy or contract award/grant in relation to their own interests, or
the interests of the organisation by which they are employed, or to whom they are
contracted or with whom they hold office. This does not prohibit contacts, including at a
social or party political level which is unrelated to such lobbying. In certain cases, due
to the nature of the proposed appointment or employment, the Advisory Committee
may, at its discretion, recommend that the lobbying ban need not prevent
communications with Government on matters that are an integral part of the normal
course of business for the organisation concerned. The application form prompts applicants to 
provide the relevant details about the proposed employment or appointment that will assist with 
the formulation of an appropriate lobbying condition.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>SCS2 and SCS1 (and equivalents, including special advisers of equivalent standing).</h2>

<p>For those at this level, the Rules apply for two years after the last day of paid
service. An application for a new appointment or employment during this two year
period is only required if the individualâs circumstances match one or more of the
triggers set out below. Decisions on applications from those at this
level are made by the relevant Department <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Below SCS1 (and equivalents, including special advisers of equivalent standing)</h2>

<p>For these grades, the Rules normally <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> apply for one year after the individualâs
last day of paid service. An application for a new outside appointment or employment
during this one year period is only required if an individualâs circumstances match one
or more of the triggers set out in the paragraph below.  Decisions on applications from staff in this 
category are made within the Department. Further details are set out in
departmental staff handbooks/on departmental intranets.</p>

<p>As set out in the paragraphs above, an application under the Rules is only
required from those at SCS2 and below (and equivalents) if the individualâs
circumstances match one or more of the following:</p>

<p>i. They have been involved in developing policy affecting their prospective
employer, or have had access to unannounced Government policy or
other privileged information affecting their prospective employer, at any
time in their last two years in the Civil Service.</p>

<p>ii. They have been responsible for regulatory or any other decisions affecting
their prospective employer, at any time in their last two years in the Civil
Service.</p>

<p>iii. They have had any official dealings with their prospective employer at any
time in their last two years in the Civil Service.</p>

<p>iv. They have had official dealings of a continued or repeated nature with
their prospective employer at any time during their Civil Service career.</p>

<p>v. They have had access to commercially sensitive information of
competitors of their prospective employer in the course of their official
duties.</p>

<p>vi. The proposed appointment or employment would involve making
representations to, or lobbying the Government on behalf of a new
employer.</p>

<p>vii. The proposed appointment or employment is consultancy work, either
self-employed or as a member of a firm, and they have had official
dealings with outside bodies or organisations in their last two years in the
Civil Service that are involved in their proposed area of consultancy work.</p>

<p>In cases of doubt, departmental Human Resources functions are able to advise
individuals on whether or not an application is required.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Special Advisers</h2>

<p>Under the terms of their contract, special advisers are required to submit an
application to the head of their former Department for a new appointment or
employment they wish to take up after leaving the Civil Service. This requirement 
applies to special advisers of equivalent standing to the Senior Civil Service for two
years after leaving the Civil Service, and to other special advisers for one year <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Applications from special advisers of equivalent standing to Director General and
above are referred to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (the Advisory
Committee). The Advisory Committee provides its advice to the relevant departmental
Permanent Secretary, who makes the final decision based on that advice. Applications
from other special advisers are handled within the relevant Department, and the
Permanent Secretary makes the decision on the application. A special adviser who is
unhappy with the decision may appeal to the Lead Non- Executive Director of their
former Department.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>How to apply</h2>

<p>Applicants must approach their departmental Human Resources function as early
as possible, and before any announcements or commitments are made. Human
Resources will have a process in place for handling business appointment applications.
This involves completion of the application form which will need to be countersigned by
an appropriate person, normally someone within the line management chain.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Notification of decisions on applications will be made through the Department.</h2>

<p>Applications may be approved unconditionally, or approved subject to conditions
applying for a maximum of two years from the individualâs last day of paid service. Such
conditions may include a waiting period and/or a prohibition on the individual being
involved in lobbying Government on behalf of their new employer. When a lobbying
prohibition or other restriction is applied to an individual at any level, this information will
be made available to key staff within a department. Other restrictions could include a
condition that for a specified period, the former civil servant should stand aside from
involvement in certain activities, for example, commercial dealings with his or her former
Department, or involvement in particular areas of the new employerâs business.</p>

<p>Where it is proposed that an application be approved with conditions or a waiting
period, the applicant will be offered an opportunity to discuss any concerns he or she
may have with an appropriate departmental officer, or for applicants at SCS3 level and
above (and equivalents, including special advisers of equivalent standing) with the 
Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (the Advisory Committee), before a final
decision is made.</p>

<p>For those cases considered by the Advisory Committee, in addition to the
maximum two-year waiting period, the Advisory Committee may, if they judge the
propriety concerns to be substantial, add a rider to their advice saying that they also
view the appointment to be unsuitable. It is for the Prime Minister (or relevant
Permanent Secretary in the case of special advisers) to take the final decision on the
application based on the advice received from the Advisory Committee.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Payment for Waiting Periods</h2>

<p>It may be appropriate to continue to pay former civil servants, including special
advisers, who are required to observe a waiting period before taking up an external role.
Such a payment would be subject to the particular circumstances of the individual case,
and it would be important to ensure that decisions take account of all relevant factors
including, for example, whether there was a reasonable expectation of a waiting period
under the Rules. Where a waiting period is required, departments should seek to
redeploy individuals for the duration of the period. Where there is no alternative suitable
employment available, the department can consider whether there is a case for the
individual to be compensated for serving a waiting period. The Cabinet Office must be
consulted when payment is proposed either by the Department or the individual.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Transparency</h2>

<p>In addition to notifying the applicant of the outcome of their application, the
Department must also inform prospective employers of any conditions which have been
attached to the approval of the appointment or employment. For those applications
considered by the Advisory Committee, their advice, alongside summary details of the
applicantâs last Civil Service post, will usually be made public once the appointment or
employment has been taken up by the applicant or announced, and Departments will
make public on their departmental websites summary information in respect of
individuals at SCS2 and SCS1 level (and equivalents, including special advisers of
equivalent standing), setting out the advice given to their former civil servants, and the
restrictions (if any) imposed upon them. In all other respects, the business appointment
process is a confidential one <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Where to find out more</h2>

<p>Departmental guidance and advice on the Rules is available from local Human
Resources functions, and, where applicable, on local intranets. More about the
operation of the Rules, including details of appointments taken up by the
most senior members of the Civil Service, can be found on the website of the Advisory
Committee on Business Appointments (the Advisory Committee): 
https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-business-appointments</p>

<p>The Advisory Committeeâs Secretariat is available to provide advice and support
to Departments on the application of the Business Appointment Rules and the handling
of individual cases at any level.</p>
