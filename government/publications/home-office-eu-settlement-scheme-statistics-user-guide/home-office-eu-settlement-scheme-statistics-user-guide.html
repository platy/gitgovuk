<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This user guide to the Home Office’s ‘EU Settlement Scheme statistics’ is designed to be a useful reference guide with explanatory notes on the issues and classifications which are key to the production, development and presentation of these releases.</p>

<p>In line with the Citizens’ Rights Agreements, the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) enables EU, other EEA and Swiss citizens resident in the UK by the end of the transition period at 11pm on 31 December 2020, and their family members, to obtain a UK immigration status. Further information about the EU Settlement Scheme can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">on the GOV.UK EU Settlement Scheme webpage</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Statistics covered</h3>

<p>The findings presented in these releases are based on administrative data of applications to the EU Settlement Scheme. Applications (and their conclusions) are broken down in the monthly data by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK country (August 2020 to July 2021 releases)</li>
  <li>Applications and conclusions after 30 June 2021 (July 2021 to December 2021 releases)</li>
  <li>Outcome type (All releases)</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications (and their conclusions) are further broken down in the quarterly data by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nationality</li>
  <li>Age group</li>
  <li>UK country, region and local authority</li>
  <li>Outcome type</li>
  <li>Derivative right to reside route</li>
  <li>Repeat applicants</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Late applications to the EU Settlement Scheme</h3>

<p>For EU, other EEA and Swiss citizens and their family members resident in the UK by the end of the transition period, the deadline for applications to be made to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) was 30 June 2021. However, in line with the Citizens’ Rights Agreements, they can make a late application to the EUSS where there are reasonable grounds why they missed that deadline. Figures on late applicants include all first time applications received from 1 July 2021 (other than from joining family members). This includes some applications where the “required date” of application was other than 30 June 2021. For example, where an applicant was previously exempt from immigration control or held leave granted under another part of the Immigration Rules (not Appendix EU) or outside the Immigration Rules. Such applications may have been made ‘in time’. More information on late applications can be found at:<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-settlement-scheme-information-for-late-applicants/eu-settlement-scheme-information-for-late-applicants">EU Settlement Scheme: information for late applicants</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Repeat applicants</h3>

<p>Applicants who have previously applied to the EUSS, and were granted pre-settled status, need to apply again for settled status before their pre-settled status expires.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Joining family members</h3>

<p>A person can apply to the EUSS as a joining family member of an EU, other EEA or Swiss citizen resident in the UK by the end of the transition period and who, with some exceptions, has pre-settled or settled status under the EUSS, where the family relationship existed by the end of the transition period (except in the case of a child born or adopted after that date) and continues to exist when the person applies to the EUSS. A late application can also be made by a joining family member where there are reasonable grounds why they missed the deadline for their application of three months from the date they arrived in the UK (or 30 June 2021 where they arrived by 31 March 2021 ).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Purpose</h3>

<p>EU Settlement Scheme statistics provide valuable insight into applications to the scheme. This helps to inform government policy and to ensure that the scheme has been effectively communicated to eligible EU, other EEA and Swiss citizens and their family members.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>What statistics have been published previously?</h3>

<p>The monthly and quarterly EU Settlement Scheme statistics releases have been designed to be complementary. The monthly EUSS updates provide more timely, high level figures up to the end of the preceding month. The quarterly publications provide a more detailed breakdown of the applications received and concluded, including local authority level data and repeat applicants.</p>

<p>The entire series of EU Settlement Scheme statistical publications (including quarterly and monthly releases) can be found at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/eu-settlement-scheme-statistics">EU Settlement Scheme statistics collection page</a>.</p>

<p>Following the simplification of the high level monthly EUSS figures in July 2020, table EUSS_MON has been included in subsequent quarterly releases, providing monthly breakdowns of applications by nationality, UK country and outcome, using the same format as the previously published monthly statistics reports.</p>

<p>Within an explanation of a term, words in bold are explained elsewhere in the glossary.</p>

<p>The <strong>Atlas</strong> case-working system is being developed to replace the <strong>Case Information Database (CID)</strong> as the Home Offices main immigration case-working system, including the processing of paper and <strong>Derivative rights of residence EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)</strong> cases.</p>

<p>The <strong>Case Information Database (CID)</strong> has been the Home Offices main immigration case-working system since 2002. It was used to process <strong>EUSS</strong> applications in the early private beta phases and is used to process paper and <strong>Derivative rights of residence</strong> cases. Most <strong>EUSS</strong> applications have been processed in the <strong>Pega</strong> case-working tool since the public beta test phase. <strong>CID</strong> is being replaced with the <strong>Atlas</strong> case-working system.</p>

<p>The <strong>Citizens’ Rights Agreements</strong> are the Withdrawal Agreement with the <strong>European Union</strong>, the separation agreement with the other <strong>European Economic Area</strong> states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and the agreement with Switzerland on citizens’ rights.</p>

<p>The <strong>EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)</strong> enables EU, other EEA and Swiss citizens resident in the UK by the end of the transition period at 11pm on 31 December 2020, and their family members, to apply for UK immigration status. The scheme is a digital system which allows them to obtain <strong>settled status</strong> or <strong>pre-settled status</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>European Union (EU)</strong> consists of 27 countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.</p>

<p>The <strong>European Economic Area (EEA)</strong> consists of the 27 countries of the <strong>European Union</strong>, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>

<p><strong>EU Settlement Scheme Family Permits</strong> enable family members of EU, other EEA and Swiss citizens resident in the UK by the end of the transition period (and of qualifying British citizens returning to the UK after living in the EEA or Switzerland) to join them in the UK. Once here the family member can then apply to the EUSS for the immigration status they need to continue living in the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Invalid applications</strong> are those which fail to meet the validity criteria specified in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-eu">Immigration Rules</a> relating to the EUSS. An application is valid where it has been made using the required application process, the required proof of identity and nationality (or of entitlement to apply from outside the UK) has been provided, and the required biometrics have been provided.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-settled status</strong> and <strong>settled status</strong> are types of immigration status which can be granted under the EUSS. Under Appendix EU to the Immigration Rules, grants are either indefinite leave to enter (ILE) (where the application is made outside the UK) or indefinite leave to remain (ILR) (where the application is made within the UK) – also referred to for the purposes of the scheme as ‘<strong>settled status</strong>’ – or 5 years’ limited leave to enter (LTE) (where the application is made outside the UK) or 5 years’ limited leave to remain (LTR) (where the application is made within the UK) – also referred to as ‘<strong>pre-settled status</strong>’.</p>

<p>A valid application can be <strong>refused</strong> on eligibility or suitability grounds where it does not meet the eligibility or suitability criteria for the scheme, set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-eu">Appendix EU</a> to the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>The <strong>eligibility</strong> criteria are considered on a case by case basis and are generally met where the applicant has satisfactorily proved that they are eligible for leave under the scheme because, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have a continuous qualifying period of UK residence that began before the end of the transition period, or</li>
  <li>they have (or had) a family relationship with a relevant EU, other EEA or Swiss citizen.</li>
</ul>

<p>In February 2020, the Home Office began refusing EU Settlement Scheme applications on <strong>eligibility</strong> grounds. Many of these eligibility refusals relate to cases that had been under consideration for several months and, in most cases, subject to repeated unsuccessful attempts to obtain missing evidence or information from the applicant.</p>

<p>The <strong>suitability</strong> criteria are considered on a case by case basis, and are generally met where the applicant has satisfactorily proved that they are suitable for leave under the scheme because, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are not subject to a deportation order/decision or an exclusion order/decision,</li>
  <li>they have not submitted false or misleading information or documentation in their application.</li>
</ul>

<p>The eligibility and suitability criteria can be found in full within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-settlement-scheme-caseworker-guidance">EU Settlement Scheme caseworker guidance</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>transition period</strong> was the period from the UK’s exit from the European Union at 11pm on 31 January 2020 until 11pm on 31 December 2020, during which EU law on free movement continued to apply in the UK.</p>

<p>An application is <strong>void</strong> if it is submitted by someone whose status means that they cannot be granted leave under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-eu">Immigration Rules</a>, and there is therefore no legal basis for the Home Office to process it. Examples include applications from British citizens (including dual nationals) or others with a right of abode in the UK.</p>

<p>An application is <strong>withdrawn</strong> if the applicant asks the Home Office, in writing, to withdraw it before it is concluded. Examples include where the applicant applies but subsequently decides to leave the UK or apply for a different status (for example British citizenship) or has made multiple applications.</p>

<p><strong>Derivative rights of residence</strong> are relevant to applicants who do not qualify for a right of residence under the Free Movement Directive (Directive 2004/38/EC), but may qualify for a right to reside in the UK derived from other EU law. Derivative rights applicants can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme under one of the following routes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chen</li>
  <li>Ibrahim &amp; Teixeira</li>
  <li>Lounes</li>
  <li>Surinder Singh</li>
  <li>Zambrano</li>
</ul>

<p>Lounes and Surinder Singh applications are grouped under <strong>family member of a British citizen</strong> in the statistics.</p>

<p>Applications under the <strong>Chen</strong> route can be made by the primary carer of an EEA national self-sufficient child. A derivative right to reside in the UK was available to the primary carer to ensure the EEA national child was not compelled to leave the UK.</p>

<p>Applications under the <strong>Ibrahim &amp; Teixeira</strong> route can be made by the child (and the primary carer of that child) of an EEA national, where the child is in education in the UK and the EEA national has ceased to be a worker in the UK. A derivative right to reside in the UK was available to the child and their primary carer so that the child can continue to be educated in the UK.</p>

<p>Applications under the <strong>Lounes</strong> route can be made by the family members of an EEA national who had rights under the Free Movement Directive and then subsequently naturalised as a British citizen. This route is available to ensure the dual EEA and British citizen can continue to rely in practice on their EU law rights for family reunion purposes.</p>

<p>Applications under the <strong>Surinder Singh</strong> route can be made by the family members of a British citizen who resided with that British citizen while they exercised their rights under the Free Movement Directive in an EEA Member State or Switzerland. This route is available to enable the British citizen can continue for now to rely in practice on their EU law rights for family reunion purposes when they return to the UK.</p>

<p>Applications under the <strong>Zambrano</strong> route can be made by the primary carer of a British citizen who, without the care provided by the primary carer, would be compelled to leave the UK and the EEA.</p>

<p>Information on the eligibility criteria for derivative rights applicants can be found in full within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-settlement-scheme-caseworker-guidance">EU Settlement Scheme caseworker guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Conventions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Experimental Statistics</h3>

<p>These statistics are released as Experimental Statistics, meaning they are going through development and evaluation. The Home Office is continuing to work to improve these statistics to ensure they meet the needs of users. Further details can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" rel="external">ONS Guide to Experimental Statistics</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Rounding</h3>

<p>As these are Experimental Statistics, data have been rounded to the nearest 10 as the figures are subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large recording system. There are a range of different types of errors possible, such as those resulting from recording errors or misclassifications.</p>

<p>In most instances, percentages are rounded to the nearest per cent using the round-half-away-from-zero method. The round-half-away-from-zero method has been used so that in the borderline case where the fraction of the percentage is exactly 0.5, the rounded figure is equal to y + 0.5 if y is positive, and y - 0.5 if y is negative. For example, 23.5% is rounded to 24%, and -23.5% is rounded to -24%.</p>

<p>Where percentages are rounded, they may not total 100% because they have been rounded independently.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Disclosure control</h3>

<p>Rounding and cell suppression are forms of ‘statistical disclosure control’ and have been considered in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/code-of-practice-for-statistics/" rel="external">‘Code of Practice for Official Statistics’</a>.</p>

<p>In the high-level monthly statistics, figures are rounded to the nearest 100, with cell counts between 1 and 49 replaced by an asterisk (‘*’).</p>

<p>In the more detailed quarterly statistics, figures are rounded to the nearest 10, with cell counts between 1 and 9 replaced by an asterisk (‘*’).</p>

<p>“The Code of Practice for Official Statistics states ‘Ensure that arrangements for confidentiality are sufficient to protect the privacy of individual information, but not so restrictive as to limit unduly the practical utility of official statistics.’ This emphasises the dual purposes of statistical disclosure control. Detail relating to individual statistical units is to be protected but the released data must still be of high practical utility for users<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.”</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Use of symbols</h3>

<p>The following symbols have been used in the tables:</p>

<p><strong>*</strong> 	  	   -   Figures (between 1 and 9) not disclosed<br>
<strong>0</strong> 	  	   -   Nil<br>
<strong>z</strong> 	  	   -   Not applicable</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Revisions to data</h3>

<p>The data contained in the release may be subject to revision. It is not possible to evaluate whether any future revisions will be upward or downward, however the reasons for revisions are likely to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>late reporting of cases – a small proportion of cases are not included when the statistics are produced</li>
  <li>the results of data-cleansing exercises, such as data identified that cannot be included when the statistics are calculated because of missing or invalid values, or the identification of duplicates in the data</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>Data Quality</h3>

<p>Listed below are key data quality measures relating to the ‘EU Settlement Scheme statistics’.</p>

<ul>
  <li>detailed information based on administrative data</li>
  <li>data are classified as ‘Experimental Statistics’ (see definition above)</li>
  <li>timely release of high-level monthly data</li>
  <li>more detailed quarterly breakdowns of the high-level monthly data</li>
  <li>provision of detailed local level data on a quarterly basis. Figures are sourced from a live operational database, to which revisions may be made</li>
  <li>there are a small number of cases where location (2.6%), nationality (less than 0.01%), or age (less than 0.01%) information is not available or in an analysable format<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>non-disclosure of small figures and rounding are used for data quality purposes (see above) and confidentiality reasons</li>
  <li>‘Withdrawn’ and ‘void’ applications are not reported separately as they are grouped together in the EUSS case working systems</li>
</ul>

<p>The majority of EUSS applications are associated with a UK address, although there is no requirement to give a UK address and applications can be made in-country, or in some cases, from overseas. We report that “total applications include small numbers of records (2.6%) where locational data is not currently in an analysable form from live systems.” This proportion includes applications associated with a non-UK address.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Methodology</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Data source</h3>

<p>The Home Office introduced a new standalone caseworking system specifically for processing EU Settlement Scheme applications. The system went ‘live’ on 1 November 2018 and has been used to process applications from this date. The data available for analysis in this publication does not include some detailed information reported on in the earlier test phases relating to performance of the EU Settlement Scheme app.</p>

<p>Before the introduction of the new caseworking system, Private Beta 1 (PB1) applications were processed in an existing caseworking system, ‘CID’. Paper and derivative rights applications continue to be processed in CID. CID was introduced in 2000 as the Asylum Case Information Database (ACID). It was then expanded in 2002 to cover non-asylum extensions of stay, settlement and British citizenship casework. CID is now being replaced by the Atlas case administration system.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Integration of case working systems</h3>

<p>Applications to the EU Settlement Scheme are made through an online system, although there are certain exceptions where applications may be submitted using a paper application form.</p>

<p>Paper application forms may be submitted by applicants who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are applying on the basis of a derivative right to reside</li>
  <li>do not hold a valid identity document and are unable to obtain one</li>
  <li>are unable to apply using the online application form and cannot be supported to do so</li>
</ul>

<p>Electronic and Paper applications have been integrated into a single reporting set of data from August 2020.</p>

<p>Applications made online are captured and processed on a digital case working system, from which the majority of the data underpinning the statistical reports are extracted. Applications made using a paper form are captured and processed using a separate case working system once they have been received. Paper-based applications were included for the first time in the EU Settlement Scheme quarterly statistics published in August 2020 after the integration of the two case working systems. Revisions were made to the entire back series of monthly and quarterly figures to account for the 10,000 paper applications made to the EU Settlement Scheme through to 30 June 2020, providing a more comprehensive picture of EUSS applications received.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Development</h2>

<p>Statistics are vital to support public debate and evaluation of government policies and programmes. The Home Office is continuing to work to improve these statistics to ensure they meet the needs of users.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>User feedback</h3>

<p>In line with the Code of Practice for Statistics, the Home Office openly invites feedback from users to continue developing the quality, usefulness and presentation of statistics on the EU Settlement Scheme.</p>

<p>Feedback is continuously sought across our suite of Home Office immigration statistics, alongside regular internal consultation, and external engagement through multiple stakeholder channels.</p>

<p>If you have any comments or suggestions for the development of these statistics, please provide feedback by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MigrationStatsEnquiries@homeoffice.gov.uk">MigrationStatsEnquiries@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>. Please include the words ‘EUSS PUBLICATION FEEDBACK’ in the subject of your email.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Repeat applications to the EUSS</h3>

<p>Figures reported in the statistical publications account for applications to the system, including individuals making applications on more than one occasion. For example, an individual who has been granted pre-settled status can make a new application at a later stage for settled status. Equally, they can receive an outcome on one application and choose to withdraw another application. As these are separate applications with separate outcomes, they are counted as separate applications and outcomes in the statistics.</p>

<p>To continue to meet user needs and to better understand the number of applicants to the scheme, the Home Office has been exploring ways to identify repeat applications by individuals and their outcomes (e.g. those moving from pre-settled to settled status).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Data matching methodology</h3>

<p>Data matching techniques have been developed and externally peer reviewed <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> to help identify the number of people who have made repeat applications to the EU Settlement Scheme. Applications are uploaded onto a Home Office database and to find applications that are from the same individual, a de-duplication process is required.</p>

<p>Unique identifiers were chosen to identify records that belong to the same person, which includes variables such as name, date of birth and ID document numbers.</p>

<p>The unique identifier fields were cleaned and made as uniform as possible - for example by capitalising names, to ensure matching was optimal. Both a deterministic (where there is an exact match) and a probabilistic approach (where a weight is given to how close or similar a match is) were used in the algorithm. This gave the methodology a more balanced approach of optimising the records that are matched but also minimising errors that can occur from the data matching process – such as creating ‘false matches’ or missing records that should be ‘true matches’.</p>

<p>Weights were created for each variable where a higher score was assigned on a unique field such ID document number and a lower score for variables such as date of birth, which can be shared by many people. A formal method for assigning scores was described by Fellegi and Sunter <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>  (1969) which this scoring is based on.</p>

<p>A match score rate of 25 and above was agreed after extensive iteration and clerical review of the matched data. A clerical review was conducted by a team of reviewers, where a randomised sample of matched records (10%, which was around 9,000 records) were manually assessed to evaluate how well the matching algorithm performed. The results of the clerical review allowed for calculation of the overall accuracy rate.</p>

<p>Based on calculations measuring linkage accuracy <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> from the clerical review, an overall accuracy rate of 99.25% was calculated taking into consideration true positive and true negative match rates.</p>

<p>Following the matching process, a dataset was created where individuals were assigned a unique person ID allowing us to estimate the number of applicants to the scheme and their most recent outcomes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Comparisons with ONS population estimates</h3>

<p>Figures in this publication refer specifically to applications made to the EU Settlement Scheme including repeat applications as people transition from pre-settled to settled status. These estimates cannot be directly compared with estimates of the resident population of EU/EEA nationals in the UK. Figures in this report include non-EEA national family members and eligible EEA nationals not resident in the UK. None of these are usually included in estimates of the resident EU/EEA population. Furthermore, the population estimates do not take account of people’s migration intentions and will include people who have come to the UK for a range of purposes, including some who have no intention to settle in the UK.</p>

<p>On the 2 July 2021, the Office for National Statistics published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2021/07/02/are-there-really-6m-eu-citizens-living-in-the-uk/" rel="external">blog</a> discussing the non-comparability of population estimates and EUSS applications, and signposted users to their previous <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/noteonthedifferencebetweenonspopulationestimatesbynationalityandhomeofficeeuropeanunionsettlementschemeeussstatistics/2020-02-24" rel="external">‘Note on the difference between ONS population estimates by nationality and Home Office EU Settlement Scheme statistics’</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Home Office Impact assessment</h3>

<p>The estimate of EEA citizens and their family members eligible for the EUSS made for the Impact Assessment was primarily based on ONS Annual Population Survey (APS) data, which estimates the resident population, and therefore cannot be directly compared to applications made to settlement scheme.  The Impact Assessment discusses in detail the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and exclusions surrounding its estimate of eligible citizens and made clear it should be considered as indicative and not as minimum and maximum estimates.</p>
