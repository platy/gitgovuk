<h2>New rules for transporting goods in vans in Europe</h2>

<p>From 21 May 2022, you’ll need a goods vehicle operator licence and a transport manager to transport goods in vans in Europe.</p>

<p>This applies to businesses of every size, including sole traders.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-goods-in-and-out-of-the-uk-using-vans-or-car-and-trailers-from-21-may-2022">Find out how to prepare</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>There are more than 3.6 million vans used for business across the UK.</p>

<p>The police and the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) have the power to carry out spot checks on your vehicles and issue prohibitions if necessary. A prohibition prevents your drivers from driving until you get a problem with your vehicle fixed.</p>

<p>As part of targeted roadside checks, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> stops around 15,600 vans each year. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> estimates that being stopped can cost owners and operators up to £4,000 per day, per vehicle.</p>

<p>This chart shows the percentage of light goods vehicles that were given a prohibition for different reasons during targeted checks in 2013 to 2014.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Operating a fleet of vans: the basics</h2>

<p>Vans are sometimes called:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘light goods vehicles’ (<abbr title="light goods vehicles">LGVs</abbr>) in the UK - not to be confused with ‘large goods vehicles’ which are over 3,500kg</li>
  <li>‘light commercial vehicles’ (<abbr title="light commercial vehicles">LCVs</abbr>) across the rest of the EU</li>
</ul>

<h3>Being a goods vehicle operator</h3>
<p>You need a goods vehicle operator’s licence if your business uses vans above a certain weight.</p>

<p>You need a licence to carry goods in a van with either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a design gross weight (the maximum weight your vehicle can weigh when it’s loaded) of over 3,500 kilograms (<abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr>)</li>
  <li>an unladen weight of more than 1,525 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (where there’s no plated weight)</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/being-a-goods-vehicle-operator">being a goods vehicle operator</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Vehicle tax and condition</h3>

<p>All vehicles that you use should be correctly taxed and kept safe and in good condition at all times.</p>

<h4>Vans that need an MOT</h4>
<p>Vans with a design gross weight of up to 3,500kg need an MOT every year when they reach 3 years old.</p>

<p>For the MOT, your van will be classed as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>class 4 - goods vehicles up to 3,000kg design gross weight (this include car-type vans)</li>
  <li>class 7 - goods vehicles over 3,000kg up to 3,500kg design gross weight</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h4>Vans that need a goods vehicle annual test</h4>
<p>Vans with a design gross weight of over 3,500kg need a goods vehicle annual test each year.</p>

<p>The first test should be 12 months after the van was first registered with DVLA.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

</div>

<h3>Drivers you use or employ</h3>
<p>You must make sure that any drivers you use or employ have the correct licence and training.</p>

<p>As an employer, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monitor your mobile workers’ working time</li>
  <li>make sure they don’t go over the limit</li>
  <li>record working time and keep the records for at least 2 years</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> encourages all van drivers to take a 45 minute rest for every 4.5 hours of driving. This is in line with EU drivers’ hours rules.</p>

<p>Tachographs record information about driving time, speed and distance. They’re used to make sure drivers and employers follow the rules on drivers’ hours.</p>

<p>Your drivers can read a guide about the basics of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-a-van">driving a van</a> for more information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who can drive what types of van</li>
  <li>the rules on speed limits</li>
  <li>weight limits and loading</li>
  <li>drivers’ hours</li>
  <li>maintenance</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>Loading your vans</h3>
<p>You must not overload your vans. They have a ‘design gross weight’. This is the maximum weight your van can weigh when it’s loaded. It’s sometimes called the ‘gross vehicle weight’ or ‘laden weight’.</p>

<p>This weight limit is on the vehicle identification number (VIN) plate in your van.</p>

<p>The design gross weight is the total combined weight of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicle</li>
  <li>driver (and any passengers)</li>
  <li>fuel</li>
  <li>the load and anything the van is carrying</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Operator checklist</h2>

<p>Use this checklist to help make your van fleet roadworthy and compliant.</p>

<h3>Check and repair your vans</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/van-drivers-daily-walkaround-check">daily walkaround checks</a> before using your vans and record any defects</li>
  <li>fix any major defects before your vans are sent out</li>
  <li>keep a record of your van repairs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Maintain your vans</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>service your vehicles to at least the minimum standard in line with the manufacturer’s guidelines</li>
  <li>get qualified people to frequently check safety critical components like brakes if your vans are subject to demanding work</li>
  <li>make sure your vans are always insured, taxed and MOT’d and document this process</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keep records</h3>

<p>You should keep records of the following for at least 15 months as part of an effective maintenance system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>defects</li>
  <li>maintenance</li>
  <li>repairs</li>
  <li>servicing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use suitable vans</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the right vans with the right size, load capability and equipment for the job</li>
  <li>not load vans beyond their design gross weight</li>
  <li>maintain fitted specialist equipment like tail lifts and tow bars</li>
</ul>

<h3>Manage risks and costs</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fit a 70 miles per hour (<abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr>) limiter on vans used on the motorway - most vans use 25% more fuel at 80 <abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr> than at 70 <abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr>
</li>
  <li>fit parking sensors to protect pedestrians, employees and your vans in crowded urban areas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Check your drivers’ licences and ID</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>know who is driving your vans for work by requesting references from their previous employers</li>
  <li>take more than one form of ID from drivers and cross-check them with their driving licence details</li>
  <li>make sure you follow the same ID process for agency drivers - you’re responsible for them when they’re driving your vans</li>
  <li>check all your drivers have a valid driving licence for driving your vans - keep copies on file</li>
  <li>check driving licence details regularly - especially for drivers with 6 points or more</li>
</ul>

<h3>Check and improve your drivers’ ability</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess all newly qualified and newly employed drivers to make sure they’re capable of driving your vans</li>
  <li>provide extra driver training so they can safely handle larger non-car based vans</li>
  <li>record assessments and training to show you’ve addressed any driver-related risks</li>
  <li>regularly check your drivers are fit to drive and make sure they’re free from the adverse effects of alcohol and drugs</li>
  <li>ask your drivers to make a written statement declaring they’re entitled to drive and have no driving-related health issues</li>
  <li>carry out regular eyesight checks for your drivers to make sure they have no visual impairments which could affect their driving over time</li>
  <li>log and analyse all driver incidents including any disciplinary action or training</li>
</ul>

<h3>Check your drivers know the rules</h3>

<p>You should make sure your drivers fully understand the rules they have to follow, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/drivers-hours">drivers’ hours rules</a></li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/drivers-hours/rules-for-employers">Working Time Directive</a>
