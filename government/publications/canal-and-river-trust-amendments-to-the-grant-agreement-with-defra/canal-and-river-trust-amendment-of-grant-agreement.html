<h4>Paragraph 5: Schedule of payment</h4>

<ul>

The first quarterly payment will be made on Defra's earliest possible pay run in April, in order that invoices are raised, dated, and processed within the relevant financial year.</li>
</ul>

<p>The remaining payments set out in Clause 2.2.3 shall be paid in Defra's earliest possible pay run in July, October, and January of the relevant financial year provided that, if applicable and subject to satisfaction of the relevant standards.</p>

<p>4. Subject to paragraph 6 of this Schedule, for each of the financial years from 2021 to 2022 until 2023 to 2024 inclusive (years 10 to 12 of this grant agreement), the part A core grant will be further adjusted, relative to the preceding financial year, at the rate for the financial year in question set out in the most recently published Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator projections available on 31 March 2021 or 0% where this projection is a negative figure.</p>

<p>Paragraph 5 shall be deleted and replaced with the following:</p>

<p>5. Subject to paragraph 6 of this Schedule, for each of the financial years from 2024 to 2025 until 2026 to 2027 inclusive (years 13 to 15 of this grant agreement), the part A core grant will be further adjusted relative to the preceding financial year, at the rate for the financial year in question set out in the most recently published GDP deflator projections as at 31 March 2024 or 0% where this projection is a negative figure.</p>
