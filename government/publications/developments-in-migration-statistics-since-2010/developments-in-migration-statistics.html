<h2>Developments in Migration Statistics</h2>

<p>The Home Office publishes a range of data on different aspects of the immigration system in its quarterly statistics and other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/migration-statistics">publications</a>. Our statisticians ensure that the migration statistics are kept under review, and that we continually improve and enhance both the statistics themselves and users’ understanding of them.</p>

<p>We aim to provide robust evidence and advice to inform government policy development and operational decision-making. We also help to inform public debate by making a wide range of data available for public use and to aid the accountability of the Home Office to parliament and the public.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Improving Home Office Migration Statistics</h2>

<p>Improvements to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immigration-statistics-quarterly-release">Home Office quarterly immigration statistics</a> have seen a streamlining of individual topics to provide a more coherent, succinct narrative of the statistics. Each topic includes an ‘about the statistics’ section which provides more information on how to interpret the statistics we publish.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Data Tables</h3>

<p>We changed the format of the published tables to include a range of summary tables, accompanied by more detailed datasets. Following positive feedback from users, changes have now been made to all immigration areas, with the final area around settlement, completed in Q4 2021.</p>

<p>These summary tables include a high-level overview of the main datasets published in each area. The detailed datasets allow users to explore the data in more detail. The ‘contents’ page within the summary tables contains an overview of the available datasets (including hyperlinks), while the ‘notes’ page shows how the information in the old tables maps to the information in the new tables.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Accessibility</h3>

<p>We have further reviewed and updated our statistical tables, in line with accessibility legislation, helping to ensure that they meet all user needs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Managed Migration</h3>

<p>In February 2020, Government announced its intention to introduce a new Points-Based Immigration System, which has been phased in, starting from October 2020. The Home Office has incorporated data from the new system in the regular quarterly Immigration Statistics publications and have included relevant statistics that relate to work and study routes, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sponsored Study - Student and Child Student routes;</li>
  <li>Work - Skilled worker, Skilled worker Health &amp; Care and Inter Company Transfer routes; and</li>
  <li>Other work – Frontier worker route</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, in February 2021 we reported on the number of visa applications and outcomes under the routes that had opened for all nationalities (including EU, EEA and Swiss nationals) also showing decisions made on applications to extend stay in the new routes. The Graduate route was introduced on 01 July 2021, replacing the Doctorate Extension Scheme, and statistics on the Graduate route were also published for the first time in this report.</p>

<p>The International Sportsperson visa was launched in October 2021 and now combines the Tier 2 (Sportsperson) visa and sporting element of the Tier 5 (Creative &amp; Sporting) visa. The Creative worker visa replaces the creative element of the Tier 5 (Creative &amp; Sporting) visa and statistics on this were published for the first time in the November 2021 report.</p>

<p>In October 2021, the Government launched a temporary visa scheme under the Seasonal Worker route to recruit additional poultry workers, pork butchers and HGV food drivers for the remainder of the year. Data relating to the scheme have been shown in statistical tables and the Work topic for Q4-2021.</p>

<p>We have continued to include data on extensions granted to NHS, frontline health and care workers whose visas are due to expire before the deadline, currently 1 October 2021.</p>

<p>All of these statistics are kept under review and we will continue to update statistics accordingly and report on new routes as they come online.</p>

<p>The Home Office also published more detailed data tables on citizenship, EEA residence and family member documents to meet increased interest post EU referendum, alongside the new data from the EU Settlement Scheme (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#eu-settlement-scheme-euss">section 1.8</a>).</p>

<p>Migrant journey analysis provides a longitudinal analysis of migration by people arriving on non-visit visas. In May 2020, we further developed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/migrant-journey-2019-report">Migrant Journey release</a> by restructuring the report around different migration pathways (Work, Study and Family); publishing additional age and sex breakdowns for the first time; and adding pivot tables that users can manipulate to obtain specific breakdowns for their needs.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/reports-on-statistics-relating-to-exit-checks">Reports on statistics relating to exit checks</a> have historically provided updated results on the proportion of non-EEA nationals recorded as having departed before the expiry of their visa, or their temporary leave to enter or remain, as well as updated data quality metrics for Exit Check data collected by the Initial Status Analysis (ISA) system.</p>

<p>In August 2020, we updated the annual <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fifth-report-on-statistics-relating-to-exit-checks">experimental statistics on Exit checks data</a> (covering visa-compliance by visa route (e.g. study)), streamlining the presentation, reducing superfluous text and clarifying definitions.</p>

<p>We are currently re-developing the Migrant Journey and Exit Checks reports to provide a more comprehensive picture of migrant travel patterns and use of the Immigration system, particularly reflecting the impact of changes due to the Covid-19 pandemic. For further information, please see the Home Office note on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/reports-on-statistics-relating-to-exit-checks">Developments in Exit Checks</a>.</p>

<p>On 31 January 2021, the UK Government introduced a new immigration route for British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) status holders, providing the opportunity for them and their family members to live, work and study in the UK. Data relating to this route has been added to both summary and detailed tables relating to entry clearance and in-country extensions and is covered in the “How many people come to the UK each year (including visitors)?” topic of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immigration-statistics-quarterly-release">Immigration Statistics</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Responding to the Covid-19 pandemic</h3>

<p>Home Office migration statistics have responded dynamically to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, we published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-relating-to-covid-19-and-the-immigration-system-may-2020">‘Statistics relating to Covid-19 and the immigration system, May 2020’</a>, which provides an overview of COVID-19 impacts on the immigration system following the outbreak in the UK and the introduction of lockdown measures in March and April 2020. Since then, we have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immigration-and-border-statistics-relating-to-covid-19">Statistics relating to passenger arrivals since the COVID-19 outbreak</a> on a quarterly basis, which show the impact of the pandemic and associated restrictions on passenger arrivals to the UK. We continue to work on developing these figures and increasing their accuracy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> No recourse to public funds (NRPF)</h3>

<p>In response to growing public interest in no recourse to public funds (NRPF), from July 2020 the Home Office has published new statistics on Change of Conditions applications, relating to those people who apply to request the NRPF restriction be removed from their visa permission, included as part of the Home Office Transparency Statistics.</p>

<p>The Home Office is committed to improving the range of information that is available on those who are subject to no recourse to public funds and have engaged regularly with key stakeholders in the national NRPF network and other users of these statistics. There are a range of technical developments underway which will impact our ability to provide additional analyses of this case data and given the complexity of the issue, the range of individuals who are subject to an NRPF condition, and the ongoing work to migrate legacy immigration case working system to a new integrated system. We are still working through what options are available to us to further enhance the picture we can provide.</p>

<p>New analyses should enable us to provide further information on those visa extensions where NRPF is not applied. Future developments will include looking to see how we might identify repeat applications. We will continue to expand the information we provide as our systems allow to help improve public understanding about these NRPF cases.</p>

<p>There have been public exchanges of correspondence between the Home Office and the UK Statistics Authority on the issue of No Recourse To Public Funds statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Response from Home Office to Office for Statistical Regulation: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/jon-simmons-to-ed-humpherson-enhancing-data-on-statistics-about-those-subject-to-no-recourse-to-public-funds-nrpf-update/" rel="external">Enhancing data on statistics about those subject to no recourse to public funds (NRPF) Update</a> (13th January 2022)</li>
  <li>Response from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/response-from-daniel-shaw-to-ed-humpherson-parliamentary-question-response/" rel="external">Home Office to Office for Statistical Regulation: Parliamentary question response</a> (3rd July 2020)</li>
</ul>

<p>Home Office data on applications for a Change of Condition are only available to those on Family and Human Rights routes and those on the Hong Kong BN(O) route and so may not provide a full picture of the people who might be in need of assistance from public funds. We have discussed the lack of available data on migrant poverty more generally, both within government and with the sector. We propose to work with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to look at the 2021 Census data, once that is released next year, to see whether this can provide additional insight into the question of migrant poverty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> Asylum and Resettlement</h3>

<p>In May 2021, we published data on the inadmissibility rules which came into force on 1 January 2021. The data relates to the number of asylum seekers considered for removal on the basis that they have an earlier presence in, or connection to, a safe third country. Prior to leaving the EU, such cases were dealt with in accordance with the Dublin Regulation, which applies to all EU member states. Following user feedback, we have subsequently incorporated these statistics into underlying data tables.</p>

<p>To aid user understanding, we have introduced a list of detailed definitions for initial decisions and resettlement, including information on the conditions of the type of leave. This is published alongside our initial decisions and resettlement dataset (Detailed data table Asy_D02 - outcomes of asylum applications at initial decision, and refugees resettled in the UK).</p>

<p>Following the launch of the UK Resettlement Scheme (UKRS) in February 2021, we have amended our resettlement statistics to report on the number of refugees resettled under the new scheme. To reflect the scheme’s global reach, we have also added a ‘host country’ breakdown to the published statistics. We have also amended our data to report on the numbers resettled via Community Sponsorship schemes separately, to allow greater transparency for these schemes.</p>

<p>We have expanded our asylum support data to include some additional breakdowns for individuals in receipt of Section 4 support, bringing it more in line with the information published on Section 95 support. We have also undertaken a cleansing exercise which has improved the quality of our data on support by local authorities, resulting in fewer individuals categorised as having an ‘unknown’ local authority.</p>

<p>In November 2017, experimental data on Asylum Claims on the Basis of Sexual Orientation were published for the first time. To the best of our knowledge the UK is the first country to publish such information – and these statistics are now updated each year, with the most recent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-statistics-year-ending-june-2021/asylum-claims-on-the-basis-of-sexual-orientation-2020">update of Asylum Claims on the Basis of Sexual Orientation</a> in August 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span> Enforcement and Irregular migration</h3>

<p>We have expanded our data on returns of Foreign National Offenders to include a nationality breakdown.</p>

<p>In February 2022, we published a statistics report on irregular migration to the UK for the first time, including information on the number of small boat arrivals across the channel. This was in response to the growing public interest in the number of migrants reaching the UK irregularly by boat across the English Channel. These statistics will be updated quarterly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span> EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)</h3>

<p>Following the opening of the EU Settlement Scheme on 29 March 2019, the Home Office has published both monthly and quarterly statistics on the scheme.</p>

<p>The monthly EUSS statistics (first published in May 2019) provide a limited set of more timely figures up to the end of the preceding month. In July 2020, the monthly publication moved to a new format, with more timely headline figures updated monthly on the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/eu-settlement-scheme-statistics">EUSS statistics landing page</a>. We have actively sought user feedback on the EUSS publications and made changes to ensure that they meet user needs.</p>

<p>The quarterly publication (first published in August 2019) provides a more detailed breakdown of the applications received and concluded, including breakdowns by applicant nationality and local authority level data. Subsequent developments in 2020 included the integration of paper-based applications into the statistics, including those who are making an application through a Derivative Rights route. In 2021, we developed a data matching methodology to identify applications that have been submitted by the same individual, for example when somebody who has been granted pre-settled status then goes on to apply for settled status. This has helped us to determine the proportion of follow-on and repeat applications and also enabled us to estimate the number of ‘people’ who have applied to the scheme.</p>

<p>The EUSS quarterly reports for June and September 2021, provided more detailed information on repeat applicants by nationality; including a breakdown of those upgrading from pre-settled to settled status and current outcomes.</p>

<p>Following the 30 June 2021 scheme deadline, we have continued to provide monthly and quarterly statistics in line with user needs. This includes the addition of top line figures on applications received after the 30 June 2021. More detailed reporting on post 30 June 2021 applications and outcomes, will be published following updates to the Migration Statistics data pipeline.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> IT Systems Development Work</h2>

<p>The UK’s Immigration system is undergoing a period of unprecedented change with the introduction of a new points-based system and new immigration routes (especially for EU nationals). In bringing EU nationals into the global visa system, as currently applies to non-EU nationals, there are a variety of additional policy changes that will require adaptations in the production and presentation of statistics made available by the Home Office. Any changes, including new routes or schemes will be clearly signposted in relevant statistical publications.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Home Office IT systems are undergoing a considerable process of transformation, including the introduction of new integrated case working systems to replace legacy immigration casework systems from which administrative data used in the quarterly Immigration Statistics are derived. This case working system transformation, along with the supporting data infrastructure changes that must follow, will continue during 2022. We expect to maintain the core functions of the systems over this period, including the development and publication of new immigration statistics.</p>

<p>These changes should begin to deliver a variety of new capabilities once they are fully in place, from which we will investigate the potential of the new systems and explore the feasibility of adding information to the published statistics. These new systems will also provide additional opportunities to link Home Office data with other administrative data and provide additional new insights.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Working jointly with the Office for National Statistics</h2>

<p>The Home Office is committed to supporting ONS’s (Office for National Statistics) cross-government programme of work on developing migration estimates and to continue to work together, along with our partners from the Government Statistical Service in other departments, to ensure that the statistical information on migration in the public domain is as coherent as possible and helps to inform policy development and public debate.</p>

<p>ONS’ analysis of Home Office border crossing and Exit Checks data continues to be a key aspect of their migration statistics development programme. The Home Office has established innovative new methods to facilitate and support ONS analysts in their use of Home Office administrative data and provides a wide range of advice to ONS to aid their understanding of the immigration system data and help shape the development of new migration statistics. We will continue to work closely with ONS on future changes to the Home Office ISA system, including to understand the ingestions of new data, such as that relating to EEA nationals.</p>

<p>We are working to support <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/internationalmigrationstatisticaldesignprogressreport/2021-11-26" rel="external">ONS’ creation of admin-based migration estimates (ABMEs)</a>, which use statistical models to bring data together and estimate the likely outcome of long-term international migrants who have recently immigrated or emigrated. The aim is that ONS’ future system will link different sources of admin data to ensure wider population coverage and provide granular detail and insight into migration and the wider population. Home Office ISA data is a key source of this information.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/visajourneysandstudentoutcomes/2021-11-29" rel="external">In November 2021, ONS published the first results of their work</a> using ISA data to improve our understanding of international students and transitions within the UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Future plans</h2>

<p>The Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) launched in April 2021 and the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) launched in January 2022. Work is underway to ensure information relating to all the individuals relocated are recorded on case working systems. Once this work concludes, further statistics will be included in subsequent editions of the Immigration Statistics.</p>

<p>We are currently redeveloping the Migrant Journey and Exit Checks reports. For further information, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/reports-on-statistics-relating-to-exit-checks">Developments in Exit Checks</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> National Statistics</h2>

<p>Our National Statistics status means that Home Office statistics meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value; signifying compliance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/" rel="external">‘Code of Practice for Statistics’</a>; and it is the responsibility of the department to maintain compliance with these standards.</p>

<p>The UK Statistics Authority’s Office for Statistical Regulation undertook a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fuksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk%2Fpublication%2Fstatistics-on-immigration-letter-of-confirmation-as-national-statistics%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7CFrancesca.Allerton%40homeoffice.gov.uk%7Cc890dd4543ec4241b52308d8d1bb9afc%7Cf24d93ecb2914192a08af182245945c2%7C0%7C0%7C637489950987306465%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=XXDMCdDVFRKl8Y5wLkJ0LkrruF12Ag9lnS3P7J7O%2BsE%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">full assessment of the Home Office immigration statistics in February 2012</a>.The continued designation of these statistics as National Statistics was again confirmed in September 2018, following a further compliance check by the Office for Statistics Regulation. In their report, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/compliance-check-on-home-offices-statistics-on-immigration/" rel="external">Compliance check on Home Office’s statistics on immigration</a>, the OSR made a number of suggestions for improvements which the Home Office has addressed, including by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clearer sign-posting to other ONS and cross-government migration outputs in the quarterly Immigration statistics</li>
  <li>including an ‘about the statistics’ section in each topic of the Immigration Statistics to inform users on what each set of statistics covers, and any limitations</li>
