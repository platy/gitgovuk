<span class="number">1. </span>Political and economic</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Political overview</h3>

<p>The political system in Portugal is a semi-presidential parliamentary democracy, where the President is the Head of State with limited powers and the government holds the key executive role. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and the government is accountable to the President and to Parliament.</p>

<p>The President serves a five-year term, while a parliamentary term and a government mandate last for four years. The next general election is due in September/October 2026 and the next presidential election in January 2026.
The President, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, was re-elected in January 2021 for a second term and he comes from the right-of-centre Social Democratic Party (PSD). Prior to his election, he was a respected law professor and highly popular TV commentator.</p>

<p>Since October 2015, Portugal has been governed by the Socialist Party (PS), led by Prime Minister António Costa. He has been leader of the PS since 2014 and was previously in government as Minister for Internal Affairs and Minister for Justice. In January 2022, Costa and the PS won a snap election with an overall majority.</p>

<p>Eight parties are represented in Parliament: the Socialist Party (PS), the Social Democrats (PSD), Chega (Enough - CH), the Liberal Initiative (IL), the Communists (PCP), the Left Block (BE), the Animal and Nature Party (PAN), and Livre (Free - L). The current distribution of seats is as follows: PS 119; PSD 78; CH 12; IL 8; PCP 6; BE 5; PAN 1; and L 1.</p>

<p>Since democratic elections were introduced in Portugal in 1976, the leader of the party winning most votes at the election had always become Prime Minister. However, this practice ended in October 2015 when the PSD were unable to form a majority government and the centre-right minority government was voted down by the left-wing majority in Parliament. António Costa, leader of the second-placed PS, formed a minority government supported in Parliament by Socialist, Communist and Left Block MPs.</p>

<p>This was an unprecedented alliance in which the parties chose to put aside major differences, notably on the Euro and NATO, in order to achieve a shared objective of putting an end to the austerity imposed during the bail-out. Despite the marked differences between the parties, this left-wing alliance proved successful in leading the country through a period of political and social stability, as well as slow but steady economic recovery.
After the 2019 election, the minority PS government continued to rely on the left to pass its economic policies and on the right to comply with Portugal’s international and multilateral commitments. There was no formal arrangement or alliance in place however and support was negotiated issue by issue.</p>

<p>In October 2021, the minority Socialist government failed to secure parliamentary approval for the state budget and the President dissolved parliament and announced new elections. In January 2022, Prime Minister Antonio Costa’s Socialist Party defied the polls to win a parliamentary majority at the expense of its former allies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Economic overview</h3>

<p>With a population of 10.3 million and a GDP of around €212.3bn (2019), Portugal saw its economy expand rapidly since its accession to the EU in 1986 and until the late 90s. Two decades of economic near-stagnation then followed.</p>

<p>Portugal weathered the 2008 global financial crisis relatively well but was dragged into the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis in 2010/11. With the sovereign and banks effectively shut out of international capital markets, the then Socialist Government was forced to negotiate a €78bn financial assistance package (‘bail-out’) with the European Commission, ECB and IMF in May 2011.</p>

<p>Following the successful completion of the bailout programme, the Portuguese economy was recovering steadily prior to COVID-19, with GDP growing for 22 consecutive quarters and GDP reaching €212bn in 2019; GDP per head however remains at just 79.2% of the EU average. In 2020, GDP contracted by an unprecedented 8.4%, due to the pandemic, which curbed domestic demand and tourism (the latter represents some 14% of the economy).</p>

<p>In 2021, GDP grew 4.9%, slightly above government expectations. Growth was mostly driven by increased internal demand thanks in part to a successful vaccination campaign and a gradual withdrawal of confinement and restrictions throughout the year. For 2022, the outlook remains positive, GDP is expected to grow 5.5% and recover its pre-pandemic level by Q2. There are, however, several risks to that outlook, mainly tilted to the downside: the evolution of (foreign) tourism; continued inflationary pressures; possible changes in ECB´s monetary policy; structural bottlenecks e.g. high (public and private) debt, low stock of capital and low productivity.</p>

<p>Portugal’s ambitious post-COVID-19 recovery plan, to be funded mainly by EU money (structural and cohesion funds under the 2021-27 MFF and grants under the Next Generation EU package), will trigger sizeable investments on climate action, digital transition, infrastructure (mainly rail and ports) and human capital. Portugal’s economic prospects are intrinsically linked to the ability to properly execute this large financial envelope.</p>

<p>On the fiscal side, the budget balance reached +0.2% of GDP in 2019 (the first surplus in almost 50 years), down from a 10% record deficit pre-bailout. As for 2021, the government expects the deficit to have been around 4.3% of GDP and forecasts a -3.2% balance in 2022. Public debt closed 2021 at 127.5% of GDP, down from 133.7% in 2020 but still well-above the 117.2% in 2019. The figure is expected to drop below 123% in 2022. Portugal continues to enjoy full market access market but recent increases in inflation have put pressure on the ECB to reduce its volume of asset purchases, which is starting to push borrowing costs upwards.</p>

<p>Despite the unprecedented covid-driven recession, the labour market proved resilient, mainly due to a comprehensive job retention package. The unemployment rate reached 5.9% at end-2021, down from a pre-pandemic level of 6% at end-2019 and a record high of 17.5% in early 2013.</p>

<p>Financial stability is safeguarded, and banks’ asset quality has improved: (between mid-2016 and mid-2020 Portugal reduced its non-performing loans ratio three-fold to 5.5%, which fell further to 4% in Q3 2021, but it is still twice the European average. And real estate prices and high stocks of (public and private) debt will remain important risks.</p>

<p>The government remains committed to an active commercial diplomacy agenda that enables Portugal to “export its way out of the crisis”. While continuing to strengthen commercial links with its current trade partners in Europe, including the UK, Portugal’s 5th largest export market, the government is also proactively seeking new export market opportunities in non-EU emerging economies, mainly within the Portuguese-speaking world, eg Angola, Brazil, but also in China, Latin America, North Africa.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Business and Human Rights</h2>

<p>Portugal reiterates its firm commitment to the respect for human rights, which are embodied in the Portuguese Constitution. The country has ratified most of the universal human rights treaties, as well as the main ILO and UNESCO conventions and protocols relating to fundamental rights and it is part of all the core UN HR instruments.</p>

<p>Rules from international conventions which have been duly ratified or approved, automatically apply in domestic law following their official publication.</p>

<p>The right of assembly, membership of trade union organisations and the right to strike are legally guaranteed to employees. There are two union federations (CGTP-IN - General Confederation of Portuguese Workers and UGT - General Union of Workers), and a number of other union organisations in different sectors.</p>

<p>There is also a legal framework to safeguard the rights of children and adults who may be especially vulnerable because of race, sexual preference, gender, age or illness, although there are still challenges faced by the Portuguese society in these areas.</p>

<p>In particular, since the onset of the global financial crisis there have been concerns relating to the living conditions and discrimination towards minority groups as well as citizens living in poverty. The Portuguese Government has stated its commitment to find and implement measures to solve this problem, namely by reinforcing social security instruments and tackling rising unemployment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>In addition, a commercial organisation carrying on a business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Reports of suspicious transactions are investigated by the financial intelligence unit, a department of the Portuguese Judicial Police (PJ).</p>

<p>Portugal is a member of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/greco/home" rel="external">Group of States Against Corruption</a> (GRECO), part of the Council of Europe.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021" rel="external">Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index</a> ranked Portugal in 32nd place in 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Crime and fraud prevention</h2>

<p>International organised criminal activity does take place in Portugal. Illegal activities identified by the authorities are linked to narcotics and people trafficking, money-laundering, identity fraud and counterfeit currency. The government has been committed to action to tackle these issues, working together with international organisations.</p>

<p>There was a 79% rise in reported incidents of cyber-crime in 2020, a significant acceleration in the general trend seen in previous years. Cyber attacks have targeted private and public entities in sectors including education, healthcare, public administration, media and science/technology. Portugal opened its National Cybersecurity Centre (CNCS) in 2014; this is the competent authority leading Portugal’s response to cyber threats and working with international partners. The CNCS has published guidance (in Portuguese) which sets out its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cncs.gov.pt/pt/empresas/?persona=organizations" rel="external">cybersecurity recommendations for businesses operating in Portugal</a>. Cyber crime investigations are handled by a specialist national unit (UNC3T), which is part of the Judicial Police (PJ).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Terrorism threat</h2>

<p>Terrorist attacks in Portugal can’t be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.</p>

<p>There’s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria. You should be vigilant at this time..</p>
