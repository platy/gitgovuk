</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Immigration advisers</h2>

<p>Immigration advisers provide advice and services mainly on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>claims for asylum</li>
  <li>applications for entry clearance or leave to enter or remain in the UK</li>
  <li>immigration employment documents</li>
  <li>nationality</li>
  <li>citizenship</li>
  <li>residence</li>
  <li>deportation or removal</li>
  <li>bail applications and appeals against deportation</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a criminal offence for a person to provide immigration advice or services in the UK unless their organisation is regulated by the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner (<abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>) or is otherwise covered by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Members of certain professional bodies may give immigration advice without registering with <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>General Council of the Bar</li>
  <li>Law Society of England and Wales</li>
  <li>Chartered Institute of Legal Executives</li>
  <li>Faculty of Advocates</li>
  <li>Law Society of Scotland</li>
  <li>General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Law Society of Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Fitness and competence</h3>

<h4>Fitness</h4>

<p>An individual or organisation will be considered ‘fit’ to provide immigration advice and/or services if they can sufficiently demonstrate to the Immigration Services Commissioner that there is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the likelihood of compliance with <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>’s regulatory scheme</li>
  <li>a history of honesty and legal compliance</li>
  <li>a history of financial probity</li>
</ul>

<p>The commissioner’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fitness-of-immigration-services-assessing-advisers">guidance on fitness for advisers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fitness-of-immigration-services-assessing-owners">guidance on fitness for owners</a> explains how a person can demonstrate that they meet the requirement of fitness and how he will assess this.</p>

<p>The commissioner provides <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-process-for-ex-offenders-applications">guidance</a> on the approach taken to advisers and applicant advisers that have a criminal conviction(s).</p>

<h4>Competence</h4>

<p>An individual or organisation will be considered competent to provide immigration advice or services if they can sufficiently demonstrate to the commissioner the necessary knowledge and skills required to meet the needs of clients seeking immigration advice or services at a specified advice level and category. This includes an organisation’s capability to act competently in the manner in which it operates its business.</p>

<p>The commissioner recognises 3 distinct advice levels of competence. Details of these levels, the work permitted at each level and the relevant knowledge and skills required are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competence-oisc-guidance-2012">commissioner’s guidance on competence</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Immigration advice</h2>

<p>The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, as amended, defines ‘immigration advice’ (section 82) as advice relating to a particular individual given in connection with one or more ‘relevant matters’ by a person who knows that he is giving such advice.</p>

<p>This does not include advice given in connection with representing an individual before a court in criminal proceedings or matters ancillary to criminal proceedings.</p>

<p>‘Relevant matters’ are defined in the act as including:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>a. a claim for asylum</li>
  <li>b. an application for:
    <ol>
      <li>i. or for the variation of, entry clearance or leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom</li>
      <li>ii. an immigration employment document</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>c. unlawful entry into the United Kingdom</li>
  <li>d. nationality and citizenship under the law of the United Kingdom</li>
  <li>e.</li>
  <li>f.</li>
  <li>g.</li>
  <li>h. removal or deportation from the United Kingdom</li>
  <li>i. an application for bail under the Immigration Act or under the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997</li>
  <li>j. an appeal against, or an application for judicial review in relation to any decision taken in connection with a matter referred to in paragraphs (a) to (i)</li>
</ol>

<p>The 1999 act defines ‘immigration services’ as the making of representations, in connection with one or more relevant matters, on behalf of a particular individual either in:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>a. civil proceedings before a court, tribunal or adjudicator in the United Kingdom</li>
  <li>b. in correspondence with a Minister of the Crown or government department</li>
</ol>

<p>Such services are regulated when provided in the course of business, whether or not done for profit. This includes occasional help offered to members of a community. Organisations that undertake these activities as an ancillary service to their main business (for example, colleges assisting students to apply for visas) still need to be regulated by <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Second tier advice is advice given by one advice service to another. If you only provide second-tier advice or signpost clients to other advisers, you do not need to apply for regulation by <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The commissioner’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clarification-of-the-oiscs-jurisdiction/clarification-of-oiscs-jurisdiction">clarification on the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>’s jurisdiction</a> provides further guidance on ‘relevant matters’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Check if you need to apply for registration</h2>

<p>If you wish to provide immigration advice or services, you must apply for registration with <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Section 84 (1) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (‘the act’) prohibits the provision of immigration advice or services other than by a ‘qualified person’.</p>

<p>The act states that a person is a qualified person if he or she is:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>a. a registered person with OISC within the UK</li>
  <li>b. authorised by a designated professional body to practise as a member of the profession whose members that body regulates</li>
  <li>c.</li>
  <li>d.</li>
  <li>e. acting on behalf of, and under the supervision of, a person within any of paragraphs a to d (whether or not under a contract of employment)</li>
</ol>

<p>Most voluntary and community organisations and most businesses that offer immigration advice or services in the UK need to apply to <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> for registration.</p>

<p>Operating an immigration advice service where work is checked by a solicitor or barrister is not sufficient to satisfy paragraph e. If you are working with a solicitor or barrister the relevant professional body itself must regulate the work. Further, solicitors or barristers assisting unregulated advisers to practise in this way may be acting in breach of Solicitors Regulation Authority or Bar Standards Board Rules.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> provides further information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-regulation-and-solicitors"><abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>’s regulatory jurisdiction and solicitors</a>.</p>

<p>If you need any further help or clarification, please contact <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> on 0345 000 0046 or email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:info@oisc.gov.uk">info@oisc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Ministerial exemptions</h3>

<p>The Secretary of State currently provides three exemptions (through Statutory Instruments) from the requirement to be regulated by the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>. This means that organisations operating in line with the exemptions can provide immigration advice and services without needing to be regulated by the Commissioner.</p>

<p>Statutory Instrument No. 235 Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (Part 5 Exemption: Licensed Sponsors) Order 2022. (This Order replaces the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (Part V Exemption: Licensed Sponsors Tiers 2 and 4) Order 2009 (as amended), which it revokes.)</p>

<p>The Order exempts employers and educational establishments who hold sponsor licences, issued by the Home Office, from the general prohibition, contained in Part V of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, on providing immigration advice and services, unless registered, authorised or otherwise exempt under section 84 of that Act.</p>

<p>You are exempt from registering with the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> if you are a licensed sponsor. The exemption is restricted to immigration advice and services provided free of charge by sponsors to people they are directly sponsoring (and, if applicable, their immediate family members) in connection with their application for entry clearance or leave to enter or remain in the UK on a sponsored work or study route.</p>

<p>Article 2 of the Order specifies “licensed sponsors” for this purpose, when providing immigration advice or immigration services in specific situations described in article 2(2) and (3). Licensed sponsors are persons licensed by the Secretary of State who, in accordance with the United Kingdom immigration rules, sponsor individuals from abroad to do particular work or attend particular courses of study in the United Kingdom. Two registers of licensed sponsors are maintained by the Home Office, and article 2(5) of this Order defines “licensed sponsor” as a person listed in either of those registers.</p>

<p>Statutory Instrument 2003 No 3214 – The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (Part V Exemption: Relevant Employers Order 2003 (Amended by The Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 (Consequential, Saving, Transitional and Transitory Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI No. 1309).</p>

<p>This is also known as the ‘Exemption of relevant employers’. You are exempt from registering with the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> if you:
• Provide immigration advice and/or services free of charge (and)
• The immigration advice and/or services is provided to an employee or prospective employee</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>The employee or prospective employee must:
• Be subject to an application for a work permit submitted by the prospective employer, or
• Has been granted a work permit entitling them to work with the employer</p>

<p>Statutory Instrument 2001 No. 1403 (Educational Institutions and Health Sector Bodies) (As Amended)</p>

<p>This is also known as the ‘exemption of educational institutions’ and the ‘exemption of health sector bodies’.</p>

<p>You are exempt from registering with the <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> if you are: 
• A specific educational institution, or a person employed by or acting on behalf of such a body together with their respective student unions described in Schedule 2 of the Statutory Instrument.
• A specific health sector body, or a person employed by or acting on behalf of such a body as described in Schedule 3 of the Statutory Instrument The exempted persons or entities listed above are however still required to comply with the Commissioner’s Code of Standards.</p>

<p>The exempted persons or entities listed above are however still required to comply with the Commissioner’s Code of Standards.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Applying for the correct level</h2>

<p>When completing the application form you should consider both the levels (complexity of work to be undertaken) and categories of advice (areas of knowledge) that you wish to work at.</p>

<p>Details of the work covered at each level and category can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competence-oisc-guidance-2012">guidance on competence</a> issued by the commissioner.</p>

<p>The levels include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>level 1: basic immigration advice within the Immigration Rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>level 2: more complex casework, including applications outside the Immigration Rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>level 3: appeals</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should apply for regulation at the level that reflects your competence and service. If you are uncertain as to what is appropriate for you, please read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competence-oisc-guidance-2012">guidance on competence</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Providing immigration advice at more than one level</h3>

<p>If you wish to operate at different levels for categories of advice, you should complete a competence statement at the highest level for any specific category.</p>

<p>If you are applying for level 2 in the categories of entry clearance, leave to remain and nationality, but level 1 in asylum, then you need only complete a level 2 competence statement.</p>

<p>You can apply to move up levels in the future, but will have to submit a new application and pay a further fee.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Transferring regulation to another organisation</h3>

<p>Your regulation with the commissioner is not transferable to another organisation.</p>

<p>You can apply for regulation with another organisation, but you must submit a competence statement through the new organisation and wait for the commissioner to approve the application.</p>

<p>However, should you be transferring from one <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> organisation to another within 6 months at the same levels and categories, then we do not require a competence statement, we require written confirmation from the new organisation you are joining.  This must be approved by the commissioner before you are able to start working at the new organisation.</p>

<p>The commissioner must provide you with the authorisation individually for each organisation you work for.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Application process</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>) check</h3>

<p>As part of your application for regulation you may need to undergo a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/overview"><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> service check</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> will only accept a copy of an original <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate if it’s dated within 6 months of the application for regulation being received by <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> (please only provide a copy of the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate, not the original)</li>
  <li>existing advisers who are moving to a new organisation (with less than a 6 month break), and those increasing their level or categories, are not required to provide a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> reserves the right to request a new <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check any at time</li>
</ul>

<p>An application from a person who has been convicted under sections 25 or 26 of the 1971 Immigration Act cannot be approved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Application fee</h3>

<p>All organisations must pay a fee for an application for registration unless the applicant is a person who is:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>a. Providing immigration advice or immigration services in the course of a business that is not for profit; and</li>
  <li>b. Does not charge a fee, directly or indirectly, for the provision of that advice or those services</li>

<p>There will be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulations-that-immigration-advisers-must-follow--2/regulations-that-immigration-advisers-must-follow#continued-registration">subsequent application fees for continuing years’ registration</a>. The commissioner considers membership fees and obligatory donations to be fees.</p>

<p>The fee is dependent on the level of advice intended to be given and, for a level 2 or 3 application, the number of prospective advisers.</p>

<p>The scale of fees is set by The Immigration and Nationality and Immigration Services Commissioner (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 No. 296.</p>

<p>Once you have submitted all the required information and documentation, we will consider your application. The material you have submitted will be assessed for compliance with the code of standards.</p>

<p>Each new adviser will be invited to sit a level 1 competence assessment as part of an overall assessment of his or her competence. You may also be asked to sit an assessment at levels 2 and 3 (please note this only applies to applicants wishing to work at level 2 or 3). See page 10 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-application-for-regulation"><abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> application for regulation guidance notes</a> for information on assessments.</p>

<p>If you then fail to provide all the required information and documentation with your application, it will be refused. The fee will not be refunded in these circumstances.</p>

<p>Make sure you read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oisc-code-of-standards-commissioners-rules-2012">code of standards</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competence-oisc-guidance-2012">commissioner’s guidance on competence</a>.

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Competence assessment</h3>

<p>Applicant advisers will be invited to sit <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> competence assessment when it is confirmed they have completed a Disclosure and Barring Service application and submitted a new adviser competence statement that meets the necessary experience and training requirements.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> must consider your competence to provide immigration advice and services.</p>

<p>If you are applying to become regulated or increase your current level of authorisation you will be tested according to the level and category that you are applying for. You will be expected to demonstrate a sound knowledge of the area that you have applied to be regulated in by passing a formal test of your knowledge, ability to analyse an immigration situation and effectively communicate your understanding in written English.</p>

<p>If you are applying for regulation as part of the local authority national checking service or for level 1 asylum and protection only, your competence will be assessed through a different process. Please contact <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> for further details.</p>

<p>The assessment provides <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> with one indication of your competence and it will be reviewed by the caseworker, along with other information submitted, before a final decision is made.</p>

<h4>The syllabuses</h4>

<p>Each level and category has a specific syllabus that provides information on the areas and standard that you will be expected to know.</p>

<p>You will need to ensure that you have the knowledge and skills to meet the standards that you are applying for.</p>

<h4>Sample questions</h4>

<p>The level 1 assessment is a 2 part assessment. The first part is a multiple choice answer test and the second part is an immigration scenario followed by a number of questions about the scenario. Both parts of the assessment must be passed at the same assessment session.</p>

<p>An example of the type of questions you can expect can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-assessment-level-1-oisc">the level 1 sample question</a></p>

<h4>Exam resource books</h4>

<p>The following exam resource books have been developed for candidates taking the assessments. The level 1 exam resource book contains all the relevant statutory material, rules and regulations you may need to refer to during the assessment for candidates taking the level 1 assessment only. Candidates taking a level 1 assessment as a prelude to taking a higher level exam, should only print the level 2 and 3 exam resource book as this contains all the statutory material, rules and regulations you may need for both the level 1 and level 2 or 3 assessments.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Qualifications and Law Society accreditation</h3>

<h4>Qualifications</h4>

<p>You do not need any specific qualifications to apply for regulation. However, your competence and fitness will be thoroughly assessed before you will be approved.</p>

<p>You will need to satisfy  <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> that you have the knowledge and skills to practice competently at the level at which you have applied.</p>

<p>Your organisation will need to satisfy <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> that you have the resources, management structures and procedures needed in accordance with the commissioner’s code of standards.</p>

<h4>Law Society Immigration and Asylum accreditation</h4>

<p>Prospective advisers who are seeking authorisation only in the category of Asylum and Protection and have successfully completed the Law Society Immigration and Asylum Accreditation Scheme (IAAS) examinations and gained IAAS accreditation, are not required to sit the corresponding level <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> competence assessment.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IAAS level 1 accredited caseworker &gt; <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> level 2 assessment (Asylum and Protection)</li>
  <li>IAAS level 2 senior caseworker &gt; <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> level 3 assessment (Asylum and Protection)</li>
  <li>IAAS level 2 supervisor &gt; <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> level 3 assessment (Asylum and Protection)</li>
</ul>

<p>For <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> exemption at level 2, the minimum requirement is IAAS accredited
caseworker. For level 3, it is IAAS senior caseworker or supervisor.</p>

<p>The relevant certificate must be enclosed with your application for regulation.
Please ensure that one certificate for each accredited adviser is submitted. For
example, if only one applicant has IAAS accreditation, the others need to sit <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr>
assessment.</p>

<p>Further exemptions from assessments may be given to organisations who have IAAS accreditation at accredited or senior caseworkers level, or supervisor level, who provide immigration advice and services which are entirely limited to work that falls within scope for Legal Aid (for example Domestic Violence and Immigration Bail applications). Such exemptions will be decided on a case by case basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Experience and training</h3>

<h4>Previous immigration work experience</h4>

<p>It may be difficult for you to demonstrate that you have the required knowledge and skills if you have no previous training or experience in immigration law and practice, especially at levels 2 and 3.</p>

<p>Even if you demonstrate high levels of knowledge in the competence assessment, we may undertake oral competence assessments during pre-regulation visits and, ask that you attend additional training to improve your skills and abilities before authorisation is granted.</p>

<h4>Continuing Professional Development (CPD)</h4>

<p>All authorised immigration advisers are expected to demonstrate that they comply with the commissioner’s CPD <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/458689/Code_of_Standards_2016.pdf" rel="external">requirements</a>. This includes advisers registered at all levels and categories.
CPD is an ongoing process undertaken to ensure an adviser’s skills and knowledge are up to date and is essential in maintaining fitness and competence and improving the service provided to clients.
Find out more about the CPD scheme <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/oiscs-reviewed-cpd-scheme">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Providing immigration advice and services while an application is being assessed</h4>

<p>You cannot provide immigration advice and services until the commissioner has approved your application.</p>

<p>While your application is being considered, you are not regulated and are not permitted to provide immigration advice or services.</p>

<p>If we become aware that you are practising illegally, for example without authorisation, this could affect our decision on whether or not we approve your application.</p>

<p>It is a criminal offence, punishable by fine and/or imprisonment, for anyone to provide, or offer to provide, immigration advice and services without being approved to do so by the commissioner (or other body, as defined in Section 82 (2) of the act).</p>

<p>To offer to provide immigration advice and services, such as advertising, before the commissioner has approved your application, is also a criminal offence.</p>

<h4>Becoming competent if you cannot practise until you are regulated</h4>

<p>The act allows people to gain experience of immigration advice without being regulated if they are employed by, or supervised by, another adviser who is authorised by <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> to provide immigration advice and services. The organisation must inform <abbr title="Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner">OISC</abbr> of the supervisory arrangements.</p>

<p>A person can also give immigration advice while employed (and supervised) by a member of a chosen professional body such as a practising solicitor.</p>
