<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Background and introduction</h2>

<p><strong>1.1</strong>: The Secretary of State may act through the Department for Education and /or its executive agency, the Education and Skills Funding Agency (“the department”).

<p><strong>1.2</strong>: The department remit includes financing apprenticeship training and education services provided in respect of people in employment.</p>

<p><strong>1.3</strong>: The department must exercise appropriate control over Funding for which it is responsible. This means it must ensure that:</p>

  <li>that Funding is used to deliver the policies and priorities set by the Secretary of State and for the purposes intended by Parliament.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1.4</strong>: In addition to being responsible for Funding the delivery of education and training the department must also be satisfied as to the provision of accurate data, in accordance with the agreements and or contracts through which Funding is provided, in order to be confident that the requirements at 1.3 are being met.</p>

<p><strong>1.5</strong>: The provision of public funding is contingent upon the department being satisfied that an Employer is not demonstrating High-Risk Behaviour, as set out in this policy and its proper use as set out in the agreements and/or contracts that an Employer holds with the department.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Purpose of this policy</h2>
