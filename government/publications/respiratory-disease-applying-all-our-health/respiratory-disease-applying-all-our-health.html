<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/all-our-health-personalised-care-and-population-health">‘All Our Health’,</a> a resource which helps health professionals prevent ill health and promote health and wellbeing as part of their everyday practice.</p>

<p>We also highlight actions that managers and staff holding strategic roles can take.</p>

<p>This guide does not cover the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on respiratory conditions. Respiratory hospital admissions and deaths included in this guide do not include a primary diagnosis or underlying cause of death for COVID-19. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">Coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance and support</a> for further information.</p>

<p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, respiratory diseases (those affecting the airways and lungs) were diagnosed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/online-version/chapter-3-further-progress-on-care-quality-and-outcomes/better-care-for-major-health-conditions/respiratory-disease/" rel="external">in 1 in 5 people in England and were the third biggest cause of death.</a> They are also a major driver of health inequalities, and much of this disease is largely preventable. Respiratory disease covers a wide variety of conditions, including common conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr>), lung cancer, infections such as pneumonia and flu, and less common diseases such as interstitial lung disease and mesothelioma.</p>

<h2>Why you should focus on respiratory disease prevention in your professional practice</h2>

<h3>Impact on health outcomes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/" rel="external">68,000 people a year</a> died from respiratory disease on average between 2013 and 2019 in the England, equivalent to 1 person every 8 minutes</li>
  <li>England has among the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.healthdata.org/united-kingdom-england" rel="external">highest mortality rates from respiratory disease</a> in Europe</li>
  <li>health outcomes for respiratory disease have not improved over the last 10 years to the same extent as other disease areas such as cardiovascular disease and cancer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact on health inequalities</h3>

<p>Mortality considered preventable from respiratory disease in the under 75s (2017 to 2019) was <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/inhale#page/7/gid/1938133300/pat/15/par/E92000001/ati/6/are/E12000004/iid/93724/age/163/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/3/cid/4/tbm/1/page-options/car-do-0_ine-yo-3:2017:-1:-1_ine-pt-0_ine-ct-149" rel="external">2.9 times higher</a> in the most socioeconomically deprived areas in England compared to the least deprived.</p>

<p>Respiratory disease is, therefore, a major contributor to the overall life expectancy gap between the rich and the poor, a gap that is widening. This inequality is related to a multitude of factors, such as greater exposure to risk factors (such as smoking, air pollution, poor housing, and occupational hazards) as well as variation in healthcare quality and access.</p>

<p>Specific groups are at significantly higher risk of respiratory illness, such as people with severe mental illness, people with learning disabilities, and the homeless.</p>

<h3>Impact on the health system and wider economy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>prior to COVID-19 pandemic, respiratory disease accounted for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity" rel="external">1.1 million hospital admissions</a> in 2019 to 2020, a rise of 49% on respiratory admissions in 2009 to 2010</li>
  <li>hospital admissions due to respiratory conditions are a major factor in the winter pressures faced by the NHS</li>
  <li>lung disease alone costs the UK more than <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.blf.org.uk/policy/economic-burden#:~:text=Lung%20disease%20in%20the%20UK,%C2%A311%20billion%20a%20year.&amp;text=%C2%A31.2%20billion%20falls%20on,musculoskeletal%20diseases%20and%20heart%20disease." rel="external">£11 billion per year</a> including the impact on the NHS (£9.9bn), and wider economy through working days lost (£1.2bn)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Core principles for health and care professionals</h2>

<h3>Health and care professionals and managers should:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>understand specific activities which can prevent, protect, and promote public health</li>
  <li>understand their role, and the roles of system partners, in prevention and population-level approaches</li>
  <li>understand the needs of their patients, communities and populations and the services available to address those needs</li>
  <li>consider the resources available in health and wellbeing systems and the potential impact of earlier diagnosis and better management</li>
  <li>recognise and investigate unwarranted variation in activity and outcomes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taking action</h2>

<h3>Front-line health and care professionals</h3>

<p>Health and care professionals can have an impact on an individual level by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understanding the risk factors and exposures that increase risk of respiratory illness, and providing advice to patients to reduce or avoid these exposures</li>
  <li>understanding the populations at risk, and the symptoms and signs of respiratory illness, in order to detect and diagnose these conditions early</li>
  <li>implementing best practice guidelines around the diagnosis and management of people with respiratory conditions</li>
  <li>referring patients for specialist services where appropriate, such as smoking cessation services and pulmonary rehabilitation</li>
  <li>providing personalised care to support individuals manage and live with their condition while maintaining high quality of life</li>
  <li>promoting uptake of the flu and pneumonia vaccinations among eligible groups</li>
</ul>

<h3>Team leaders and managers</h3>

<p>Community health and care professionals and providers of specialist services can have an impact by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>promoting staff awareness, education and training on respiratory disease and prevention</li>
  <li>adopting best practise guidelines around case detection and management of people with respiratory conditions</li>
  <li>ensuring appropriate referral pathways and promote uptake of specialist services such as smoking cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation</li>
  <li>promoting uptake of vaccines amongst eligible patient and staff groups, such as the flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine</li>
  <li>investigating and acting on unwarranted variation in care quality or health outcomes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Senior and strategic leaders</h3>

<p>Senior and strategic leaders, including health professionals, should be aware of the interventions at population level, which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>raising awareness of respiratory health issues in their organisations, and influencing wider policies that affect respiratory health, such as air pollution, housing, and transport</li>
  <li>understanding the burden of respiratory disease in their local population and ensuring that resources and services are best utilised to meet those needs</li>
  <li>seeking opportunities to work collaboratively with local partners through sustainability and transformations partnerships (<abbr title="sustainability and transformations partnerships">STPs</abbr>), integrated care systems (ICSs), and primary care networks (<abbr title="primary care networks">PCNs</abbr>), and ensuring there is clarity on shared priorities with local partners</li>
  <li>investigating and acting on unwarranted variation in care quality or health outcomes</li>
  <li>establish plans to mitigate and minimise the impact of extreme seasonal temperatures (heatwaves and cold winters) on respiratory health</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding local needs</h2>

<p>Public Health England provides data for health professionals, managers and commissioners to understand local population needs and whether these are being addressed by services. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/tobacco-control" rel="external">Local Tobacco Control Profiles:</a> an online tool which provides local areas with data on tobacco use, tobacco-related harm and outcomes</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/inhale" rel="external">INHALE:</a> an online tool which provides indicators on Asthma and <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr> around prevention, diagnosis, management, outcomes and cost</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/inhale" rel="external">Atlas of Variation:</a> a data series that explores variation in access and quality of care between different local areas in England. The 2nd Atlas of variation for respiratory disease has recently been released, covering 64 indicators</li>
</ul>

<h2>Measuring impact</h2>

<p>As a health and care professional there are a range of reasons why it makes sense to measure your impact and demonstrate the value of your contribution. This could be about sharing what has worked well in order to benefit your colleagues and local people, or help you with your professional development.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework" rel="external">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a> examines indicators that help us understand long term trends in public health at a local level. Many of the PHOF indicators relate specifically to respiratory health, including premature and preventable mortality due to respiratory disease (4.07), smoking prevalence (2.09, 2.14), mortality attributable to air pollution (3.01), and flu vaccination coverage (3.03).</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://qof.digital.nhs.uk/" rel="external">Quality and Outcomes Framework (<abbr title="Quality and Outcomes Framework">QOF</abbr>)</a> is a voluntary annual reward and incentive programme for all GP surgeries in England, detailing practice achievement results. It is not about performance management but resourcing and then rewarding good practice. It includes clinical domains for asthma and <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr>, and a public health domain for smoking.</p>
