<h2>Testing for primary, school-based nursery and maintained nursery school staff</h2>

<p>Following the launch of rapid asymptomatic coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in secondary schools and colleges on 4 January, staff in primary, school-based nurseries and maintained nursery schools are also being offered the opportunity to take part in regular asymptomatic testing.</p>

<p>It remains imperative that the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#infection-prevention-and-response-system-of-controls" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a> continues to be rigorously applied to enable the safest possible environment. The testing programme is an important addition to supporting leaders to maintain the continuity of education through the pandemic.</p>

<p>All primary schools, school-based nurseries and maintained nursery schools will start to receive deliveries of home testing kits to offer to all their staff from 18 January.</p>

<p>Primary, school-based nursery and maintained nursery staff will be supplied with lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test kits to self-swab. Staff will be asked to take their test kits home and carry out the test twice a week. The <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test will give a result in around 30 minutes. Staff must report their result to NHS Test and Trace as soon as the test is completed either online or by telephone as per the instructions in the home test kit. Staff should also share their result with their school or nursery to help with contact tracing.</p>

<p>Testing is not mandatory for staff and staff do not need to provide proof of a negative test result to attend school or nursery in person, although participation in testing is strongly encouraged.</p>

<p>Staff with a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result will need to self-isolate in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay-at-home guidance</a>. They will also need to arrange a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test to confirm the result. Staff with a negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result can continue to attend school or nursery and use protective measures.</p>

<p>The asymptomatic testing programme does not replace the current testing policy for those with symptoms. Anyone with symptoms (even if they recently had a negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result), should still self-isolate immediately according to government guidelines.</p>

<p>Those with symptoms are also expected to order a test online or visit a test site to take a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test to check if they have the virus.</p>

<h2>Report test kit and delivery issues</h2>

<p>Primary schools, school-based nurseries, and maintained nursery schools, can report problems relating to test kits and delivery issues using the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/rapid-testing-contact">rapid testing contact form</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll need to enter your school’s unique reference number (<abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>) to use this form.</p>
