<p>When all licences and approvals have been received by the applicant, production can begin.</p>

<p>Where an existing business (including all of its assets, liabilities and obligations) is sold to a new owner, any licences or approvals will not transfer to the new owner. The new owner must be able to demonstrate that they meet “The fit and proper test”(check <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-10">paragraph 2.10</a>).</p>

<p>Upon the sale of the business, as set out in the paragraph above, the new owner should apply at least 45 days before they intend to start production. The new owner will not be able to trade until they have received confirmation from HMRC that their applications have been successful. If they do so, they will be treated as trading without approval.</p>

<p>This only applies where there has been a complete change in ownership. Significant changes must still be notified to HMRC. Check <a class="govuk-link" href="#para3-1">paragraph 3.1</a> for examples of when a new application is required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Guide to the process</h3>

<p>The following is a detailed guide to the process of starting as a distiller. Any potential producers of Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, Irish cream, Irish poteen or Somerset cider brandy should read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-8">paragraph 2.8</a> which explains how to become a verified producer of a UK spirit drink with a protected geographical indication.</p>

<h3>Before applying to HMRC</h3>

<p>Prepare a business plan. This can help assure us of your suitability for approval, particularly if you are a new distiller without previous or existing licences. In some instances, a business plan is a requirement of the application. For more information on when a business plan is necessary, and what it should include, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-3">paragraph 2.3</a>.</p>

<p>Identify production and warehouse premises. If you do not own these, you’ll need to provide evidence to show you are planning to purchase them with any application you make.</p>

<p>Any variations between initial proposals and final plans could lead to a delay or rejection of your application.</p>

<h3>At least 45 days before you start to produce spirits</h3>

<p>Use form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-application-for-a-distillers-licence-and-approval-of-distillery-plant-and-process-dla1">DLA1, Alcohol duties: application for a distiller’s licence and approval of distillery plant and process</a> to apply, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-5">paragraph 2.5</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Alongside your DLA1 form, provide us with the required information to seek approval of plant and process, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-6">paragraph 2.6</a>.</p>

<p>We can issue a letter of indication to help you in securing finance to complete your plans where we’re satisfied from the details in your application that you are likely to succeed. For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-4">paragraph 2.4</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll only issue the final distiller’s licence when we’re satisfied that all necessary requirements are in place, including premises security.</p>

</ul>

<p>Be aware that 45 working days is the standard time taken to process applications. The actual time taken to process applications depends on the circumstances of each individual applicant. For example, if you’ve not provided all the required information or the application refers to premises that require building work, the time taken to process and approve the application may be longer than 45 days.</p>

<p>Once you’ve received your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>distiller’s licence</li>
  <li>approval of plant and process</li>
  <li>proper warehouse and warehousekeeper approvals</li>
</ul>

<p>you’re ready to begin to produce spirits.</p>

<h3>After production begins</h3>

<p>Excise Duty becomes chargeable when spirits have been produced and will not normally be payable until the spirits are taken out of the warehouse. For information on payment procedures, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197</a>. We may ask you to pay duty on any losses which are not due to natural wastage or for which there is not an acceptable explanation.</p>

<p>You must complete form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-quarterly-distillery-return-declaration-of-materials-used-and-spirits-produced-w21">W21 Alcohol duties: Quarterly Distillery Return — declaration of materials used and spirits produced</a> return quarterly for each class of spirit you produce, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para6-3">paragraph 6.3</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> The business plan</h3>

<p>For the manufacture of spirits using a still with a capacity of less than 18 hectolitres (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-7">paragraph 2.7</a>) we’ll always require a business plan to assure us that the production is commercial in nature.</p>

<p>In other cases, a business plan can also help assure us of your suitability for approval, particularly if you are a new distiller without previous or existing licences.</p>

<p>There’s no checklist of what we would expect to see within a business plan as each case will be different. However, we’re expecting to see satisfactory evidence which shows that it’s likely to be a viable business. Information on costings, suppliers, customer base, market research and profit forecasts will all build the picture we’re looking for of a well-considered and potentially successful business. We’ll ask for more information where plans lack enough detail for us to make a decision.</p>

<p>For help and advice read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/write-business-plan">write a business plan</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Distiller’s licence — letter of indication</h3>

<p>Where a business is looking to secure necessary finance (for example, to purchase premises), financial institutions have in some cases, asked the applicant for an indication that a distiller’s licence will be granted by HMRC.</p>

<p>Providing we’re content with your plans, we can, on request, issue a letter confirming we’re likely to approve your application based on the information you’ve provided. Before issuing a letter, we expect to see comprehensive business plans and detailed information of the proposed plant and process, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-6">paragraph 2.6</a> for more information.</p>

<p>We’ll not issue a letter of indication if we’re not satisfied that you’ve demonstrated a genuine business purpose or if we’ve concerns about other aspects of your plan, for example, the security of alcohol once produced. We’ll not issue the final licence if there are changes, or deviations from the original plans.</p>

<p>Once you’ve completed the building or other preparation work that was not ready at the time of application, you should contact us to arrange for final approval.</p>

<p>We’ll close your application if we’ve not heard from you in a reasonable time from issuing the letter of indication, and you’ll need to start the process again if you wish to proceed. It’s your responsibility to contact us.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Applying for a distiller’s licence</h3>

<p>Send your completed form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-application-for-a-distillers-licence-and-approval-of-distillery-plant-and-process-dla1">DLA1</a> to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

HM Revenue and Customs
<br>Excise Processing Teams
<br>BX9 1GL
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You must make the application in the name of the person manufacturing the spirits. If you, as a manufacturer, are not also the owner of the premises you can obtain a licence in joint names.</p>

<p>If you intend to produce spirits at more than one set of premises, you must complete a separate application and get a licence for each.</p>

<p>We’ll not issue a distiller’s licence to produce spirits for your own use.</p>

<p>The production of spirits by a person who is not licensed is an offence for which there are financial penalties. You can avoid a penalty by applying for a licence at the correct time. If you’ve not applied for a licence, you must notify us as soon as possible. We may be able to reduce the penalty. You can find information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/877263/CC-FS11.pdf" rel="external">penalties</a>.</p>

<p>You’ve the right to appeal if we impose such a penalty. For more information read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-appeals">disagree with a tax decision</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para17">paragraph 17</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Approval of plant and process</h3>

<p>At the same time as you apply for a distiller’s licence, you must apply for approval of the plant and process you intend to use.</p>

<p>Attach the following information, on a separate sheet, with your application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>address of proposed distillery</li>
  <li>plan of premises</li>
  <li>full description of the manufacturing process, including size of still</li>
  <li>the number and description of the vessels used in the manufacturing process, their capacity and use of all plant</li>
  <li>your intended source of raw materials and the range of products you intend to produce</li>
  <li>where the product will be stored, including security arrangements (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para5">paragraph 5</a> for more information on security)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve asked for a letter of indication (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-4">paragraph 2.4</a>) we still require you to apply for approval of plant and process in as much detail as possible. We’ll refuse your application if you’re not able to provide enough detail.</p>

<p>Our approval of the plant and processes at each distillery may include conditions which we consider are necessary to protect the revenue. These conditions will be set out in our letter of approval and we’ll review them from time to time. We may add to them or vary them if we need to.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span> Stills smaller than 18 hectolitres</h3>

<p>We may refuse to issue a licence where the largest still to be used has a capacity below 18 hectolitres. However, we’ll consider applications for a distiller’s licence providing you use the still for the commercial production of spirits. You must submit a business plan to support your application for commercial production, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-3">paragraph 2.3</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span> Producing spirits with protected geographical indication</h3>

<p>If you intend to produce a UK spirit drink with a protected geographical indication, you must apply for verification under HMRC’s Spirit Drinks Verification Scheme in addition to the process described above for obtaining a distiller’s licence and approval of plant and process. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/spirit-drinks-with-a-protected-geographical-indication">Spirit drinks with a protected Geographical Indication</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The current spirit drinks with protected geographical indication status in the UK are Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, cream and poteen, and Somerset cider brandy.</p>

<p>You can find the technical files for each within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spirit-drinks-verification-scheme-technical-guidance">technical guidance for each product</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span> How HMRC will process your application</h3>

<p>We’ll check your application to see if it has been completed correctly and in full. If it’s incomplete, or is in any way unclear, we’ll ask you to supply the missing detail or clarify certain information. Until we’re satisfied with the changes, we will not be able to process your application.</p>

<p>We will then perform checks to satisfy ourselves that the information you’ve given is full and accurate and that you are suitable for approval. These will involve checks of our records to find out whether you’ve been compliant with your tax obligations and, in the case of a corporate body, are likely to include checks with Companies House. We may include checks with other government departments and agencies, and with credit reference agencies. We’ll also check the criminal records of applicants for any relevant convictions.</p>

<p>We may also decide that we want to visit your premises to look at your trading activities. We’ll ask you for details about (but not limited to) your suppliers, customers, business plans, accounting and stock control systems, premises and financial viability. For information on what to expect, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compliance-checks-excise-visits-ccfs16">Compliance checks: Excise visits — CC/FS16</a>.</p>

<p>We may refuse your approval if we discover that the information you’ve given to us is untrue or incomplete in any important aspect, and you could be prosecuted or liable to penalties.</p>

<p>If HMRC’s checks do not provide sufficient assurance that you are suitable, we may ask you for more information. Your application will not be processed further until we’ve received and verified this information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.10 </span> The fit and proper test</h3>

<p>We’ll only grant approval to applicants who can demonstrate that they are fit and proper to carry on a controlled activity. This means HMRC must be satisfied the business is genuine and that all persons with an important role or interest in it are law abiding, responsible, and do not pose any significant threat in terms of potential revenue non-compliance or fraud.</p>

<p>HMRC will assess all applicants (not just the legal entity of the business but all partners, directors and other key persons) against a number of ‘fit and proper’ criteria to establish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there’s no evidence of illicit trading indicating the business is a serious threat to the revenue, or that key persons involved in the business have been previously involved in significant revenue non-compliance, or fraud, either within excise or other regimes — some examples of evidence we would consider are:
    <ul>
      <li>assessments for duty-unpaid stock or for other under-declarations of tax that suggest there’s a significant risk associated with the business trading in duty-unpaid alcohol</li>
      <li>seizures of duty-unpaid products</li>
      <li>penalties for wrongdoing or other civil penalties which suggest a business does not have a responsible outlook on its tax obligations</li>
      <li>trading with unapproved persons</li>
      <li>previous occasions where approvals have been revoked or refused for spirits production or other regimes (including liquor licensing)</li>
      <li>previous confiscation orders and recovery proceedings under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/contents" rel="external">Proceeds of Crime Act 2002</a>
</li>
      <li>key persons have been disqualified as a director under company law</li>
      <li>there are no connections between the businesses, or key persons involved in the business, with other known non-compliant or fraudulent businesses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>key persons involved in the business have no criminal convictions which are relevant for example, offences involving any dishonesty or links to organised criminal activity — we will normally disregard convictions that are spent provided there are no wider indications that the person in question continues to pose a serious threat to the revenue (an ‘unspent’ conviction is one that has not expired under the terms of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/53" rel="external">Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974</a>)</li>
  <li>the application is accurate and complete and there has been no attempt to deceive HMRC</li>
  <li>there have not been persistent or negligent failures to comply with any HMRC record-keeping requirements, for example poor record keeping in spite of warnings or absence of key business records</li>
  <li>the applicant, or key persons in the business, have not previously attempted to avoid being approved and traded unapproved</li>
  <li>the business has provided sufficient evidence of its commercial viability and credibility — HMRC will not approve applicants where they find that they cannot substantiate that there’s a genuine plan to legitimately trade from the proposed date of approval</li>
  <li>there are no outstanding, unmanaged debts to HMRC or a history of duty or VAT not being paid on time</li>
  <li>the business has in place satisfactory due diligence procedures covering its dealings with customers and suppliers to protect it from trading in illicit supply-chains, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para16">paragraph 16</a> for more information about due diligence</li>
</ul>

<p>The list above is not exhaustive. HMRC may refuse to approve you for reasons other than those listed, if they have justifiable concerns about your suitability to be approved.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Changes to your address, records and accounts</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Amending or changing details of a distiller’s licence or plant and process</h3>

<p>You must tell the Excise Processing Teams (see address in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-5">paragraph 2.5</a>) if you change your business address. We’ll then issue you with an updated licence. You must also tell us if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there are any significant changes to the information on the licence (for example, changes to the legal entity or key personnel)</li>
  <li>you wish to make significant changes to your approved plant and process (for example, you want to produce a new category of spirits or install a new still)</li>
  <li>you cease trading</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to tell us about minor changes such as repairs to pipes — note these in your business records instead.</p>

<h4>Change in business ownership</h4>

<p>Where an existing business (including all of its assets, liabilities and obligations) is sold to a new owner, any licences or approvals will not transfer to the new owner.</p>

<p>Upon the sale of the business the new owner should apply at least 45 days before they intend to start production. The new owner will not be able to trade until they have received confirmation from HMRC that their applications have been successful. If they do so, they will be treated as trading without approval.</p>

<p>Examples of when a change of ownership takes place and a new application is required include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>share sales involving a complete transfer of shares from the original owner to the new owner, including all assets, liabilities and obligations</li>
  <li>business sales involving a complete transfer of all assets, liabilities and obligations as part of the terms of the sale of the business</li>
</ul>

<p>A partial sale of shares or a business’s assets or liabilities, where an original owner remains in place may not require a new application, but any changes must still be notified to HMRC as set out in this section.</p>

<p>The above examples are not exhaustive. If you are unsure if a new application is required, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">contact HMRC for clarification</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Revoking a licence, withdrawal of plant and process approval</h3>

<p>We may revoke your distiller’s licence if you cease to manufacture spirits.</p>

<p>We may withdraw, vary or add conditions to approval of plant and process with reasonable cause.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> Making alterations, repairs or carrying out maintenance</h3>

<p>You do not need to inform us if you carry out maintenance or repairs or make minor alterations.</p>

<p>You’ll only need to inform us directly if you wish to make significant changes to your approved processes or schedule of plant (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para3-1">paragraph 3.1</a>).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Manufacturing operations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Distillation periods</h3>

<p>These are accounting periods for the manufacture of spirits. You must carry out all manufacturing in these periods. A period is usually between a week and a month. If you need a longer period you should contact our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Helpline</a>. You must specify the start and finish dates of each period in your records. If you manufacture more than one class of spirits (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para6-2">paragraph 6.2</a>) you must specify separate periods for each class of spirit. These periods may run simultaneously.</p>

<p>Every distillation period should be clearly identifiable in your business records.</p>

<p>Until you’ve taken separate accounts, you must not mix spirits produced in different periods.</p>

<p>You must complete a quarterly return, form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-quarterly-distillery-return-declaration-of-materials-used-and-spirits-produced-w21">W21 Quarterly Distillery Return — declaration of materials used and spirits produced</a> at the end of March, June, September and December. You’ll need to complete a separate return for each class of spirits you produce. The form W21 details how to complete the return itself.</p>

<p>We give each distillery a unique 5-digit identifying number. We’ll notify you of your number and you should use this on your quarterly return.</p>

<p>If you manufacture more than one class of spirits we’ll view this as more than one distillery. We’ll allocate a unique number for each class of spirits which you produce, for example you’ll receive one number for malt spirits and another for grain spirits if you produce both. You must complete your quarterly return (with the correct identifying number) and submit it to the address on the form within 14 days of the end of the calendar quarter.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> Submitting a production return when no spirits have been produced</h3>

<p>Even if you’ve not produced spirits in the quarter concerned you must still make a return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> Signing the return</h3>

<p>Returns must be signed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you (as the proprietor)</li>
  <li>a partner or director</li>
  <li>the company secretary</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span> Restrictions on the manufacturing processes</h3>

<p>When you manufacture spirits you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use only those processes for which you’ve received approval</li>
  <li>comply with any conditions we specify including, if applicable, those relating to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inward-processing">inward processing</a> on imported cereals</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to change an existing process, or use a new process you must contact the Excise Processing Teams, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-5">paragraph 2.5</a> for more information. You must have our written approval before introducing any changes to your processes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span> Taking production samples</h3>

<p>You may take duty-unpaid samples of wort, wash, feints and spirits for the purposes of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>quality control</li>
  <li>strength testing</li>
  <li>scientific research</li>
  <li>reference</li>
  <li>other production-related analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>note the samples taken in your business records</li>
  <li>keep the quantity to the minimum necessary for the purpose</li>
  <li>label the samples as ‘sample’</li>
  <li>label samples of spirits, ‘duty-unpaid sample — not for sale’</li>
  <li>destroy samples no longer required</li>
  <li>keep records of their use and disposal</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.9 </span> Duty-suspended receipt of wash and feedstock for use in spirits manufacture</h3>

<p>You may receive and store in duty suspense, wash and feedstock from the premises of a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered cider maker</li>
  <li>licensed wine producer</li>
  <li>registered brewer</li>
</ul>

<p>providing your premises are covered by an excise warehouse approval (granted under section 92 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1992).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.10 </span>	Producing spirits for experimental purposes</h3>

<p>There’s no exemption from the requirements covering spirits production for anyone seeking to manufacture spirits for experimental purposes (for example, to use in the making of a flavoured gin before deciding whether to sell the product).</p>

<p>All spirits producers must have a distiller’s licence, approval of plant and process, warehousekeeper authorisation and warehouse approval as per the information earlier in this notice.</p>

<p>As a choice, producers may wish to consider using duty-paid plain spirit and adding flavourings separately. In order to do this, a rectifier’s or compounder’s licence will be necessary, depending on the method of manufacture used (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para15">paragraph 15</a> for more information about rectifying and compounding).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Measuring wort, wash, gravity and alcoholic strength</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Requirements in respect of wort, wash and gravity</h3>

<p>The following requirement has force of law and is made under regulation 6 of the Revenue Traders (Accounts and Records) Regulations 1992.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You must keep an accurate record of the quantity and gravity of wort and wash collected.</p>

<p>The quantity and gravity of wort and wash should be measured using recognised industry methods.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Measuring the quantity of wort, wash and gravity</h3>

<p>You should use any industry-recognised equipment, in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Instruments for measuring alcoholic strength: criteria and use</h3>

<p>Instruments must comply with regulation 18 of the Spirits Regulations 1991 (as amended).</p>

<p>Automatic densimeters must measure density according to regulation 18 of the Spirits Regulations 1991.</p>

<p>The 2 main criteria are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the density must be directly measured as ‘density in air’ not ‘density in vacuum’ and then converted to ‘density in air’</li>
  <li>at the time the measurement is taken, the temperature of the liquid must be 20°C — the measurement cannot be taken at a different temperature and converted to the equivalent density at 20°C</li>
</ul>

<p>The automatic densimeter must carry out density measurements with accuracy and precision. All of the approved densimeters have been 5-decimal place machines, and when used according to the operator’s instructions, have proved to be accurate and precise enough for our purposes.</p>

<p>Some machines can convert the density of a liquid to the alcoholic strength from an internal look-up table. If you select this option, the machine must use the Official Laboratory Alcohol Tables to convert the density in air value to an alcoholic strength. For a copy of the table write to the Alcohol Policy Team at the address in the ‘Comments or suggestions’ section at the end of this notice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Methods to use to measure the strength of spirits</h3>

<p>You may use any method set in the Spirits Regulations 1991 (as amended).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Low wines, feints and fusel oil</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Disposal and destruction of feints</h3>

<p>Normally you’ll carry feints forward from one manufacturing period to another. If you’ve feints which you no longer wish to use in the manufacture of spirits, these should be isolated and an account taken of them, and then they should be warehoused or destroyed. Your records must show what you’ve done with the feints.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Re-distillation of low wines, feints and spirits</h3>

<p>You may re-distil low wines, feints and spirits at any time.</p>

<p>Record the details of operations to re-distil low wines, feints and spirits in your business records.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> Removal of fusel oil</h3>

<p>You may remove any fusel oil which has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>separated from the feints in the feints receiver</li>
  <li>collected in oil traps</li>
</ul>

<p>You must measure the quantity and strength of the fusel oil before you dispose of it and record the details in your records. We do not charge duty on fusel oil which is below 8.7% alcohol by volume, but you must be sure that no spirits or feints are mixed with the oil. If you find it contains more than 8.7% alcohol by volume, it must be ‘washed’ so that the alcohol content is reduced to 8.7% or below before it’s removed from the distillery.</p>

<p>If the strength of any fusel oil is greater than 8.7% alcohol by volume, the whole product is liable to Excise Duty at the spirits rate.</p>

<p>If you keep fusel oil recovered from the distillation of materials entered to inward processing in the community, it may be chargeable with Customs Duty.</p>

<p>Fusel oil used as a heating fuel is not subject to Excise Duty.

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Accounting for spirits and warehouse vat</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> Accounting for the spirits produced</h3>

<p>The following requirement has the force of law and is made under regulation 6 of the Revenue Traders (Accounts and Records) Regulations 1992.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You must keep a record of the spirits you’ve produced. The record must include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date and time</li>
  <li>spirits receiver or other vessel</li>
  <li>dip or gauge reading</li>
  <li>temperature and hydrometer readings</li>
  <li>quantity of spirits, adjusted to a temperature of 20°C, with details of bulk volume, strength, and litres of alcohol produced</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span> Warehouse vat</h3>

<p>You must immediately warehouse spirits you’ve produced once you’ve taken account of them (<a class="govuk-link" href="#para10">paragraph 10</a>). If your spirit receiver is additionally approved as a warehouse vat, we’ll consider the spirits to have been warehoused as soon as the account has been taken and declared in your records.</p>

<p>Where your spirits receiver is not approved as a warehouse vat, the spirits collected must be removed immediately after the taking of the account. In both instances, the receiver must be empty before you put in any newly produced spirits.</p>

<p>You may request approval for your spirits receiver to be a warehouse vat as part of the application for approval of plant and process (<a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-6">paragraph 2.6</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span> Accounting for remnants in the spirits receiver</h3>

<p>Where a remnant remains you should take account of it in the normal way and enter the details in your records.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Warehousing</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>The type of warehouse a distiller may provide for storing spirits produced at their own distillery is known as a ‘distiller’s warehouse’. Approval of a distiller’s warehouse is under section 15 of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 — for details on how to apply to operate a distiller’s warehouse read paragraph 10.2 in this notice.</p>

<p>The operations that may be carried out in a distiller’s warehouse are very limited and do not extend to the same range that may be carried out in a general storage and distribution warehouse (read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Excise Notice 196</a> for more information). However, they include the bottling of spirits produced at the distillery of manufacture.</p>

<p>Spirits produced by a third-party may not be stored or processed in a distiller’s warehouse. They must be stored or processed in an excise warehouse approved under section 92 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 — read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Excise Notice 196</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Spirits produced by a third-party distillery may not be stored or processed in a distiller’s warehouse which is not directly connected to the production distillery.</p>

<p>You may not receive, hold or move duty-suspended excise goods outside the terms of your warehouse approval.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span>	Applying for authorisation as an excise warehousekeeper and for a distiller’s warehouse</h3>

<p>To store spirits you’ve produced in duty suspense you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be authorised as an excise warehousekeeper — using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-warehousing-application-to-be-an-excise-warehousekeeper-ex61">form EX61</a>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit your application for both together with the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>distiller’s licence application <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-application-for-a-distillers-licence-and-approval-of-distillery-plant-and-process-dla1">form DLA1</a>

</ul>

<p>to the Excise Processing Teams (address in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para2-5">paragraph 2.5</a>) at least 45 working days before you wish to begin production.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span> 	Distiller’s warehouse: providing a financial guarantee</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, we no longer routinely require a premises guarantee but we may call for one where there’s a risk to the revenue.</p>

<p>Where we do require one, the level of guarantee required for a distiller’s warehouse is calculated by reference to the potential average month-end duty liability on the spirits produced by the distillery that are stored in the distiller’s warehouse (meaning the throughput).</p>

<p>Refer to the table in paragraph 4.5 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Excise Notice 196</a> to establish the level of guarantee required. For example, a distiller’s warehouse with a proposed or current month-end stockholding of £3 million would require a guarantee of £250,000. One with a month-end stockholding of £100,000 does not have to provide a guarantee.</p>

<p>Reductions apply to the level of guarantee for good compliance. The guarantee required is reduced by 50% after 2 years of good compliance. After a further 2 years of good compliance, it’s reduced to zero (paragraph 4.5 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Excise Notice 196</a> refers).</p>

<p>If we require a premises guarantee for a new business, its initial guarantee will be based on anticipated levels of production and stockholding. HMRC will review the guarantee level on a regular basis to make sure it reflects actual production and stockholding.</p>

<p>To apply for a financial guarantee, you must contact HMRC’s Financial Securities Centre (FSC). Read paragraph 4.5 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Excise Notice 196</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span>	Specific requirements to follow when storing spirits in a third-party warehouse</h3>

<p>It’s possible to remove spirits from a distiller’s warehouse to a third-party warehouse (for example, to an independent maturation warehouse).</p>

<p>If you wish to store spirits in a third-party warehouse, you’ll need to register as an owner of warehoused goods under regulation 5(1) of the Warehousekeepers and Owners of Warehoused Goods Regulations 1992. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197</a> for more information on moving excise goods.</p>

<p>To apply for authorisation to store spirits in a third-party warehouse you must complete <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-warehousing-application-to-be-an-owner-of-duty-suspended-goods-held-in-excise-warehouses-ex60">form EX60</a>.

<h3>
<span class="number">10.5 </span>	Moving alcohol in duty suspension</h3>

<p>If you intend to move alcohol in duty suspension, you must register for the Excise Movement Control System.

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Duty</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Point at which Excise Duty is chargeable on spirits, and how to pay it</h3>

<p>Excise Duty becomes chargeable following distillation or manufacture of spirits in any other way. It’s not normally payable until the spirits are taken out of warehouse storage (for information on duty payment procedures and worked examples of the Excise Duty calculation for spirits, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197</a>).</p>

<p>We may ask you to pay duty on any losses, which occur at your distillery or while transferring spirits to a warehouse, which are not due to natural wastage or for which you do not have an acceptable explanation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span>	The duty charge</h3>

<p>It’s normally based on the litres of alcohol contained in the spirits and any feints produced less the litres of alcohol in any feints brought forward from the previous period. This is known as the actual charge.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span>	Less spirits produced than expected</h3>

<p>You should investigate the reasons why this has happened. Your business records should show the steps you’ve taken to look into the matter and your findings. If, having completed your investigations, you’ve found no satisfactory explanation for the loss, then you should provide a written explanation of what has happened to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">excise written enquiries team</a>. We may assess for duty on the loss.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> UK spirit drinks with a geographical indication</h2>

<p>Certain UK spirit drinks, for example, Scotch whisky, have geographical indication protection.</p>

<p>This means that relevant authorities must verify that any spirit drink with a protected geographical indication complies with specific conditions set out in the product’s technical file. The costs of providing this verification must be paid by the manufacturers of the spirit drink.</p>

<p>HMRC is the designated verifying authority for UK spirit drinks with a protected geographical indication. If you produce a UK geographical indication spirit drink, you must apply to us for verification of your processes. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spirit-drinks-verification-scheme-technical-guidance">Spirit Drinks Verification Scheme: technical guidance</a>.

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Certificates of age and origin</h2>

<p>Certificates of age and origin attest to the authenticity of UK produced spirits. HMRC issues these to support exporters and producers of UK manufactured spirits and facilitate entry of their product into overseas markets.</p>

<p>The majority of issued certificates are in respect of Scotch whisky exports. The certificates are an essential part of the industry’s efforts to protect Scotch whisky in overseas markets from counterfeiting.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>	Applying for certificates of age and origin</h3>

<p>HMRC issues certificates of age and origin to UK applicants who are able to provide a satisfactory audit trail of the origin of the product. This is restricted to distillers and brand owners and manufacturers and holders of goods in duty-suspense.</p>

<p>We may also issue certificates of age and origin to overseas applicants for spirits previously consigned which are being sent on to a further overseas destination (for example, from UK to France to Taiwan), providing the applicant provides a certificate of non-manipulation and also holds satisfactory documentary evidence of the spirits’ origin.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span>	Certificates of age and origin</h3>

<p>The following certificates are currently in use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C&amp;E 94 (USA)</li>
  <li>C&amp;E 94D (Japan)</li>
  <li>C&amp;E 94H (Singapore)</li>

  <li>C&amp;E 94L (Philippines)</li>
  <li>C&amp;E 96 (General use) — is for general use and is not product or destination specific</li>
  <li>C&amp;E 96A (Canada) — is for Scotch whisky and is destination specific</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">14 Exports </span> of small producer spirits</h2>

<p>If you export duty suspended spirits you’ll need to make sure the consignee is authorised to receive the spirit in advance of delivery or exportation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span> Small producers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland exporting spirits to outside the EU</h3>

<p>If the country you are exporting to operates a small producer’s scheme for spirits, the consignee may ask you to provide a certificate, endorsed by HMRC, that the spirit you’re exporting is small producer spirit distilled in the UK. This is so they can establish in advance of the importation to their country that the producer in the UK and the spirit is eligible under their rules. It is your responsibility to be aware of the rules and production volume limits of the small producer scheme for spirits in the country you are exporting to, so that their requirements are met.</p>

<p>If a certificate is required, you’ll need to make a self-declaration of your production volumes which HMRC will certify. The following process applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>copy the certificate template shown at section 14.3 in this notice, and paste or save as a word document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>complete the first part of the document, then print and sign it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scan the document and attach to an email</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send the email to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:nru.alcohol@hmrc.gov.uk">nru.alcohol@hmrc.gov.uk</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Excise Processing Teams will validate by completing the ‘Certification — For Official Use’ part of the document and return it to you</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span> Review and appeal procedures</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.1 </span>	Disagreements with decisions made</h3>

<p>When we make a decision that you can appeal against, we’ll tell you and offer you a review. We’ll explain the decision and tell you what you need to do if you disagree with, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of an assessment</li>
  <li>the issue of a civil penalty</li>
  <li>a decision specifically connected to the relevant duty</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll usually have 3 options. Within 30 days you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send new information or arguments to the officer you’ve been dealing with</li>
  <li>have your case reviewed by a different officer</li>
  <li>have your case heard by an independent tribunal</li>
</ul>

<p>A different officer from the one who made the decision will handle the review. If you prefer to have an independent tribunal hear your case, you must write directly to the Tribunals Service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.2 </span>	Time limit for a review</h3>

<p>If you want us to review a decision, you must write to the person who issued the decision letter within 30 days of the date of that letter. We’ll complete our review within 45 days, unless we agree another time with you.
You cannot ask the tribunal to hear your case until 45 days (or the time we agreed with you) has expired, or we’ve told you the outcome of the review.</p>

<p>If you’re not satisfied with the review’s conclusion, you have 30 days within which to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<p>If we cannot complete our review within 45 days, or any time we agreed with you, we’ll ask you whether you’re willing to agree to an extension so that we can complete the review. If you do not agree to an extension, the review is treated as concluding that the decision being reviewed is upheld.</p>

<p>We’ll write and tell you this: you then have 30 days from the date of that letter to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.3 </span>	Information to include in a request for review</h3>

<p>Your request should set out clearly the full details of your case, the reasons why you disagree with us and provide any supporting documentation. You should also state what result you expect from our review.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.4 </span>	Appeal to independent tribunal</h3>

<p>If you do not want a review, you may appeal to an independent tribunal. You need to send your appeal to the Tribunals Service within 30 days of the date on the decision letter.</p>
