<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>A representative cross-section of volunteers in England, aged 5 and over, tested themselves with swabs from 8 March to 31 March 2022 (inclusive). Swabs were analysed using polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Over the 24 days of testing which form these round 19 findings of REACT-1, 6,902 samples tested positive from a total of 109,181 valid swab results, giving a weighted prevalence of 6.37% (6.21%, 6.53%) or 637 people per 10,000 infected. This compares to a weighted prevalence in the previous round, round 18 (8 February to 1 March 2022), of 2.88% (2.76%, 3.00%), and is the highest weighted prevalence observed throughout the REACT-1.</p>

<p>In round 19 we observed very high and increasing weighted prevalence at all ages ranging from 4.61% (4.20%, 5.07%) in those aged 75 years and over to 8.81% (7.89%, 9.82%) in those aged 5 to 11 years.</p>

<p>Weighted prevalence increased between round 18 and round 19 and showed a peak in round 17, a decrease in round 18 and a subsequent increase in round 19 at all ages.</p>

<p>Weighted prevalence in those aged 5 to 11 years in round 19 final was higher than in all other age groups and has more than doubled since round 18.</p>

<p>P-spline model fit to all REACT-1 data in 4 broad age groups separately showed rapidly increasing weighted prevalence between round 18 and round 19 final at all ages and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a possibly decreasing prevalence within round 19 in those aged 5 to 17 years</li>
  <li>a possibly plateauing prevalence in those aged 18 to 35 and 35 to 54 years</li>
  <li>a within-round increasing trend in those aged 55 years and over</li>
</ul>

<p>At regional level, weighted prevalence in round 19 was very high and higher than in round 18 in all regions across England. The highest weighted prevalence in round 19 was 8.13% (7.59%,8.71%) in South West, and the lowest weighted prevalence observed was in the West Midlands at 5.28% (4.85%, 5.75%).</p>

<p>The highest weighted prevalence in round 19 was observed in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>larger households including 2 persons at 6.03% (5.79%, 6.28%), 3 persons at 6.91% (6.54%, 7.30%), 4 persons at 7.13% (6.74%, 7.53%) and 5 persons at 6.97% (6.28%, 7.73%), compared to 5.26% (4.92%, 5.63%) in single-person households</li>
  <li>households with one or more children at 7.55% (7.22%, 7.89%) compared to 5.89% (5.71%, 6.08%) in households without children</li>
  <li>those having been in contact with a confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) case at 17.8% (17.2%, 18.5%) or a suspected COVID-19 case at 12.5% (11.3%, 13.8%) compared to 4.00% (3.86%, 4.16%) for those without such contact</li>
  <li>those reporting not shielding at 6.64% (6.45%, 6.84%) compared to 6.00% (5.66%, 6.37%) in those reporting shielding</li>
  <li>those reporting classic COVID-19 symptoms (loss or change of sense of smell or taste, fever, new persistent cough) in the month prior to swabbing at 27.6% (26.7%, 28.5%) or other symptoms at 7.87% (7.43%, 8.33%) compared to 2.60% (2.47%, 2.74%) in those without symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>Of those who tested positive and reported on symptoms, 26.7% reported no symptoms in round 19 final compared to 28.6% in round 18.</p>

<p>Viral lineages were determined for 3,383 of 4,038 positive samples collected up to 22 March 2022, 89.7% corresponded with the Omicron BA.2 variant or its sub-lineages. The other determined samples corresponded with Omicron BA.1 (10.2%), BA.3 (0.16%) and the Delta AY.4 sub-lineage (0.003%).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>During the 24 days covered by the period of this report, high levels of infection with SARS-CoV-2 were observed in England in March 2022.</p>

<p>The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections overall was 637 per 10,000 people infected. The highest rates were observed regionally in the South West and nationally in those aged 5 to 11 years.</p>

<p>Of all the positive samples sequenced in this round, 99.9% all but one of those were Omicron variant, with one sub-lineage of Delta detected.</p>
