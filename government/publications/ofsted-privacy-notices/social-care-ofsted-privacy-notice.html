<p>Ofsted is the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills, a non-ministerial government department. We inspect and regulate services that care for children and young people, and inspect services providing education and skills for learners of all ages.</p>

<p>Ofsted is the data controller for the personal data described in this notice, except where we inspect services jointly with other organisations. You can find out more about these in the sections for <a class="govuk-link" href="#local-area-send-inspections">local area <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr></a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#joint-targeted-area-inspections">joint targeted area</a> inspections.</p>

<h2>Registered children’s care services</h2>

<p>‘Registered children’s care services’ refers to social care services that are regulated and inspected under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/14/part/II" rel="external">Care Standards Act 2000</a>. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children’s homes, including secure children’s homes</li>
  <li>residential family centres</li>
  <li>residential holiday schemes for disabled children</li>
  <li>independent fostering agencies</li>
  <li>voluntary adoption agencies</li>
  <li>adoption support agencies</li>
</ul>

<p>You can jump directly to the relevant section if:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#work-for-childrens-service-provider">you’re registered to provide/manage these services</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#work-for-childrens-service-provider">you work for a registered children’s care service provider, or with the children who stay in/are helped by registered children’s care services</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#parent-childrens-care-services">you are the parent of a child who has used registered children’s care services</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Why we process this personal data</h3>

<p>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/14/contents" rel="external">Care Standards Act 2000,</a> Ofsted is the registration authority for, and has the power to, inspect children’s homes, residential family centres, residential holiday schemes for disabled children, fostering agencies, voluntary adoption agencies and adoption support agencies in England.</p>

<p>We get and process a wide range of personal data about individuals who are employed in and others involved in the provision of registered children’s care services. While carrying out these functions and conducting inspections, we may also obtain personal details of children, their parents or other individuals associated with the children.</p>

<p>We only process information when necessary in performing our role as the registration authority for registered children’s care services.</p>

<h3>How we will use information about you</h3>

<p>This section sets out how we will use data for different types of people.</p>

<h4>I am registered to provide or manage registered children’s care services</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-registration-for-childrens-social-care-services">You need to register with Ofsted</a> if you are providing or managing a children’s home, adoption support agency, independent fostering agency, residential family centre, voluntary adoption agency or residential holiday scheme for disabled children.</p>

<p>If you are carrying on an establishment or agency referred to above, you must register with Ofsted under the Care Standards Act 2000 before the establishment or agency can operate. Anyone who manages an establishment or agency (other than a voluntary adoption agency) must also register.</p>

<p>Because Ofsted needs to ensure that you are and remain fit to carry on or manage a registered children’s care service, it is necessary for us to look at and keep a range of your personal data for as long as you may provide these services. We will retain relevant information about your suitability to provide registered children’s care services for as long as you are registered to provide these services. We may keep this information under review for a longer period of time if any regulatory issues or concerns were raised during the period of registration.</p>

<p>We process your personal data under Part II of the Care Standards Act 2000.  In particular, we undertake the following regulatory activities with regards to registered persons’ personal data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registration</li>
  <li>cancellation or suspension of registration</li>
  <li>regulation of establishments and agencies</li>
  <li>inspection</li>
  <li>prosecuting offences within the Care Standards Act 2000 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002</li>
</ul>

<h4>I work for a registered children’s care service provider or with the children who stay in or are helped by registered children’s care services</h4>

<p>We may collect information about you while we regulate or inspect registered children’s care services. This can include information written by inspectors or given by you, the provider, children or the public in their correspondence about the provider.</p>

<p>Our role is primarily to ensure that registered providers and managers continue to meet the relevant legislation and remain suitable to be registered. This means that we will not specifically try to collect information about staff or others who work with children unless as part of an inspection or general regulatory work.</p>

<p>We may, however, examine lists of staff to make sure that the provider has made proper checks or to check that staff have appropriate qualifications, speak to you and privately record your views about the provider or, if you are a staff member, to discuss your performance with the provider in the context of the services being delivered.</p>

<p>We may keep relevant information about you as part of inspection evidence and, when it relates to the suitability of people who are registered to provide registered children’s care services, for at least the length of that registration. We may also keep this information under review for longer if any regulatory issues or concerns were raised during the period of registration.</p>

<p>We may also collect information from you if you decide to whistleblow about your employer in a way that is protected by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.</p>

<h4>I am a child who has been in contact with registered children’s care services</h4>

<p>This affects you if you stay in a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children’s home</li>
  <li>residential family centre</li>
  <li>residential holiday scheme for disabled children</li>
</ul>

<p>or if you are/have been helped by an:</p>

<ul>
  <li>independent fostering agency</li>
  <li>voluntary adoption agency</li>
  <li>adoption support agency</li>
</ul>

<p>We will collect information about you and your experiences to help us check whether you have been provided with a good service which helps and protects you. Some of this information will be given by you, the people who run the services you use, local authorities, social workers or other government agencies.</p>

<p>We will always keep any information we hold or share as secure as possible. However, we sometimes have to share information about you or other children to other public authorities, such as the police and local authority child protection services, when we feel this will help and protect you or other children.</p>

<p>The people who run the place you stay in or the service you are helped by are required by law to send information about children to Ofsted when certain things happen. This is to ensure that Ofsted can check whether you have been provided with a good service which helps and protects you. These events include where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children have been involved in or subject to sexual exploitation</li>
  <li>a child has died</li>
  <li>children have been involved in a serious incident that required police involvement</li>
  <li>a child protection enquiry has started or ended</li>
  <li>children have been involved in any other serious incidents</li>
</ul>

<p>We will normally hold this information alongside our information about your home or service provider. We may keep relevant information about you as part of inspection evidence and when it relates to the suitability of people who are registered to provide registered children’s care services for at least the length of that registration.</p>

<p>The Department for Education gives us data about looked after children. This contains date of birth and gender and will also identify which service may be looking after each child. This can also include ‘special category’ data on disabilities or ethnicity.</p>

<p>We will use this data to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry out research and analysis</li>
  <li>help us with policy development</li>
  <li>help us  understand the lives and journeys of the children in public care (whose provision and corporate parents we inspect)</li>
  <li>develop and test hypotheses relating to services for children in care to inform future inspection framework development</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/40/section/121" rel="external">we must publish an annual report about our work</a>. We also have further powers to produce surveys and reports based on the information we hold.</p>

<h4>I am the parent of a child staying in a children’s home or a child helped by registered children’s care services</h4>

<p>We may collect important and sometimes sensitive information about you, your child and their experiences, to help us check whether your child was helped and protected and has been provided with a good service. Some of this information will be provided by you, the people who run the services you and your child uses, other government agencies or people who work with your child, such as social workers.</p>

<p>We will keep any information we hold or share as secure as possible. However, we sometimes have to share information about you or your child to other public authorities, such as the police and local authority child protection services, when we feel this will help and protect your child or other children.</p>

<p>We may hold this information alongside other information about the home or service.</p>

<p>We may keep relevant information about you as part of inspection evidence and, where it relates to the fitness of those registered to provide registered children’s care services, for at least the length of that registration. We may also keep this information under review for longer, depending on whether any regulatory issues or concerns were raised during the period of registration.</p>

<h4>I am, or want to be, a foster carer or adopter</h4>

<p>We may obtain information about you when Ofsted registers and inspects adoption and fostering agencies you use. We may hold this information alongside other information about these agencies.</p>

<p>We may obtain important and sometimes sensitive information about you or the children you care for, to help us check whether the children have been helped and protected and whether the agency has provided a good service. Some of this information will be given by you or the people who run the agencies you use.</p>

<p>We annually collect data on foster carers and fostered children directly from agencies. We use the data from independent fostering agencies, which we both regulate and inspect, to support our inspection of those agencies. We publish this data as a statistical release. We use it to understand wider sectorial issues.</p>

<p>We may keep relevant information about you as part of inspection evidence and, where it relates to the fitness of those registered to provide registered children’s care services, for at least the length of that registration. We may also keep this information under review for longer, depending on whether any regulatory issues or concerns were raised during the period of registration.</p>

<h3>Types of personal data that we might hold</h3>

<p>We hold a wide range of personal data because of our regulation and inspection of the provision of registered children’s care services in England. Specifically for those who are registered to provide registered children’s care services, this can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>address/contact details</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>health information</li>
  <li>information about their compliance with regulations</li>
  <li>financial/contractual information</li>
  <li>previous employment/references</li>
  <li>details of criminal convictions and alleged offences</li>
  <li>performance information</li>
  <li>relevant information received about personal life and relationships</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also hold the following information about any person working in registered children’s care services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their personal opinions relating to their work</li>
  <li>safeguarding information</li>
</ul>

<p>For children in children’s homes or using social care services, we may be given information about their life and experiences from which they may be identified. This will include details where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children have been involved in or subject to sexual exploitation</li>
  <li>children have been involved in a serious incident that required police involvement</li>
  <li>a child protection enquiry has started or ended</li>
  <li>children have been involved in any other serious incidents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who we might share personal data with</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ofsted-safeguarding-policy">We share information with child protection agencies</a> in accordance with our duties, powers and statutory guidance issued by the government.</p>

<p>Ofsted may also share personal data with a number of other public authorities. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>any appropriate persons, for the purpose of protecting children from harm or neglect</li>
  <li>Health and Care Professions Council</li>
  <li>Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals services</li>

  <li>Care Inspectorate Wales</li>
  <li>the Office of the Children’s Commissioner</li>
  <li>the police</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also share information with colleagues who need it within Ofsted, such as inspection planning teams or inspectors when carrying out inspections.</p>

<h3>How long we keep personal data</h3>

<p>We will keep relevant information about the suitability of those registered to provide registered children’s care services at least for the duration of that registration. We may keep this information under review for longer, depending on whether any regulatory issues or concerns were raised during the period of registration.</p>

<h3>Where personal data comes from</h3>

<p>We collect personal data about people involved in carrying on and managing registered children’s care services in England, the staff who work for these services, and the children who use them. As well as the information recorded by our own inspectors, this personal data can also come from a variety of sources outside Ofsted.</p>

<p>Information is given mainly by the individuals themselves, but Ofsted also receives information from public authorities and members of the public. Public authorities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the police</li>
  <li>children’s care services registered under the Care Standards Act 2000</li>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>The Charity Commission</li>
  <li>Care Inspectorate Wales</li>
  <li>National Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panels</li>
  <li>Health and Care Professions Council</li>
  <li>the Health &amp; Safety Executive</li>

  <li>medical professionals</li>
  <li>Disclosure &amp; Barring Service (DBS)</li>
  <li>other government departments, such as the Department for Education</li>
  <li>other inspectorates</li>
</ul>

<p>Members of the public include:</p>

  <li>the press</li>
  <li>other registered persons</li>
</ul>

<p>We receive this information through our telephone contact centre, emails, written correspondence, social media, online forms, referrals from other internal teams or from inspection.</p>

<h3>The legal requirement to give us this information</h3>

<p>Inspectors require information to be provided when they carry out inspections. Failure to cooperate by failing to provide information required as part of an inspection carried out under sections 31(1) or 32(1) is an offence under section 31(9) of the Care Standards Act 2000.</p>

<p>Registered persons and those applying to be registered persons have to meet legal requirements to provide information to Ofsted. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information required as part of an application by a person seeking registration under the Care Standards Act 2000 (Registration) (England) Regulations 2010</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unregistered children’s care services</h2>

<p>‘Unregistered children’s social care services’ refers to children’s social care services, or those managing them, that we suspect or believe should be registered under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/14/part/II" rel="external">Care Standards Act 2000</a>.</p>

<p>Services that require people who carry on or manage them to be registered are:</p>

  <li>voluntary adoption agencies (no requirement for managers to be registered)</li>
  <li>adoption support agencies</li>

<p>We have the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/14/section/31" rel="external">power to enter and inspect</a> premises and records if we suspect unregistered children’s social care services are being carried out. It is a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/14/section/11" rel="external">criminal offence</a> to carry on or manage one of the services listed above without registration.</p>

<p>As a result of this, we can request and process a wide range of personal data that we need to detect, prevent and investigate criminal offences or to safeguard children. As part of this, we may also get personal details of children, parents or any other individual associated with suspected unregistered services.</p>

<h3>How we will use information about you</h3>

<p>This section sets out how we will use data for different types of people.</p>

<h4>I provide or manage a children’s social care service suspected of being unregistered</h4>

<p>If you are providing a children’s social care service referred to above, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-registration-for-childrens-social-care-services">you must register with Ofsted</a> before the service can operate. Anyone who manages any of these services other than voluntary adoption agencies must also register.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/14/section/11" rel="external">Failure to register is an offence</a>, and we may prosecute. There are also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/38/section/93" rel="external">offences under adoption</a>.</p>

<p>We may receive information from people who suspect unregistered children’s social care services are being provided. We will use that information and any additional information gathered by our inspectors to decide whether you are providing unregistered children’s social care services and whether we should prosecute.</p>

<h4>I work for a children’s social care service provider suspected of being unregistered or with the children using the service</h4>

<p>We may collect and see information about you as part of an investigation into whether your employer is providing unregistered social care. This can include information written by inspectors or given to us by you, the provider, children or members of the public.</p>

<p>Our role in these investigations is mainly to ensure that registered providers and managers are not providing unregistered children’s social care. We will not specifically try to collect information about staff or others who work with children unless as part of the investigation. We will store any information about you as securely as possible.</p>

<p>We may also collect and store information from you if you decide to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/whistleblowing">whistleblow</a> (share information about your employer in a way that is protected by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/23/contents" rel="external">Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998)</a>.</p>

<h4>I am a child who has used a children’s social care service suspected of being unregistered</h4>

<p>We may hold information about you if we suspect that where you stay, or the person who helps you, is not registered with Ofsted when they should be. We will keep this information alongside our other information about the unregistered service.</p>

<p>We will keep any information we hold or share as securely as possible. However, we sometimes have to share information about you or other children to other public authorities, such as the police and local authority child protection services, when we feel this will help and protect you or other children.</p>

<h4>I am the parent of a child who has used a children’s social care service suspected of being unregistered</h4>

<p>We may receive and hold information about you or your child if we suspect that your child is staying in, or using, a children’s social care service that is unregistered. We will hold this with our other information about the service to help us decide whether the people who run the service are committing an offence.</p>

<p>Some of this information will be provided by you, the people who run the services you and your child use, and other government agencies or people who work with your child, such as social workers.</p>

<p>We will keep any information we hold or share as securely as possible. However, we sometimes have to share information about you or your child to other public authorities, such as the police and local authority child protection services, when we feel this will help and protect your child or other children.</p>

<h3>Where the personal data comes from</h3>

<p>We collect personal data about people who work for local authority children’s services, and the children and care leavers who they provide services and support to and their parents. As well as the information recorded by our own inspectors, this personal data can also come from a variety of sources outside Ofsted. Information comes mainly from the individuals themselves, but we also receive information from other public authorities and members of the public. Public authorities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the police</li>
  <li>children’s services registered under the Care Standards Act 2000</li>
  <li>the Charity Commission</li>
  <li>Care Inspectorate Wales</li>

  <li>the press</li>
  <li>other registered persons</li>
</ul>

<p>We receive this information through our telephone contact centre, emails, written correspondence, social media, online forms, referrals from other internal teams or from inspection.</p>

<h3>The legal requirement to give us this information</h3>

<p>Section 140 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 provides the statutory basis for Ofsted to obtain personal data held by local authorities. We would not be able to carry out its inspections without the personal data.  It is an offence under section 140(9) to prevent such access to personal data as part of an inspection.</p>

<p>Section 141 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 gives Ofsted the power to request information from a local authority that may contain personal data. We would not be able to carry out its inspections without the personal data.  Failure to comply with such a request without reasonable excuse is an offence under section 141(4) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.</p>

<p>Under the statutory guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2">Working together to safeguard children</a>, local authorities are required to inform Ofsted of any incident involving the care of a child where:</p>

<h2>Local area <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> inspections</h2>

<p>This section covers inspections of local area provision for children and young people who have special educational needs and disabilities. These are also known as <abbr title="local area">LA</abbr> <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> inspections.</p>

<p>Ofsted and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/" rel="external">Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>)</a> jointly <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-area-send-inspection-guidance-for-inspectors">inspect local areas’ effectiveness in identifying and meeting the needs of children and young people who have special educational needs and/or disabilities</a>, under the Children Act 2004.  <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> is the independent regulator of health and adult social care in England.</p>

<p>Ofsted is the data controller for the personal data gathered through the shared IT systems used on inspections of local area provision for children and young people who have special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="local area">LA</abbr> <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> inspections).</p>

<p><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> is the data controller for personal data gathered by it directly (that is, data not gathered through the shared systems used for <abbr title="local area">LA</abbr> <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr> inspections).</p>

<p>You can jump directly to the relevant section if:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Why we process personal data</h3>

<p>The role of Ofsted and <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> is to inspect the effectiveness of the local authority and health authorities’ provision for children and young people who have special educational needs and disabilities in their local area. The inspection process involves evaluating the experiences of children and young people and their parents and carers, as well as the experiences of the educational institutions where these children and young people are placed. Inspectors may also scrutinise and discuss a sample of children and young people’s cases alongside discussions with professionals working with them. We will only get information about staff or others who work with children or young people when it is necessary for our inspection work.</p>

<p>On inspection, we collect and process a wide range of personal data about individuals who work for relevant local agencies and educational institutions. We also collect personal data about children/young people and their parents and/or carers who are provided with services by the local area.</p>

<p>We use this personal data to inform our report to the Secretary of State following a local area inspection. We never identify individuals in our reports. We only process information that we need to carry out the inspection or to write the report.</p>

<h3>How we will use information about you</h3>

<p>This section sets out how we will use data for different types of people.</p>

<h4>I work for a local authority or a relevant educational/health institution</h4>

<p>We may collect information about you as part of our inspection. This can include information provided by you, your employer, children or young people and their parents or carers, members of the public and other practitioners working in your local area, or information recorded by inspectors.</p>

<p>We may keep relevant information about you as part of inspection evidence. The names of individuals are not recorded in the evidence base but the information we have about your role may make it possible to identify you.</p>

<p>This information will be stored securely for at least 3 years.</p>

<h4>I am a child or young person who has special educational needs and/or disabilities</h4>

<p>We may collect important and sometimes sensitive information about you and your experiences to help us evaluate whether local area agencies have properly identified and effectively supported your needs.</p>

<p>Some of this information will be provided by you. Some information will be provided by the nursery, school or college you attend, or by the people who run the agencies that assess or support you (like educational psychologists, social workers and doctors or nurses). We also get information from other government agencies.</p>

<p>We hold this information as part of the inspection evidence. We will not use your name but other information we record about you may make it possible to identify you. We may keep this information for at least 3 years.</p>

<p>We will always keep any information we hold or share as secure as possible. We may have to share information about you with other public authorities, such as the police and local authority child protection services, if we feel this is necessary to protect you or another child or young person.</p>

<p>The local area also gives us data about children and young people who have special educational needs or disabilities. This data includes date of birth and gender and will also identify the special educational need/disability. It will include information about which service may be assessing/supporting each child or young person. This can also include ‘special category’ data on disabilities or ethnicity.</p>

<p>We use this data to carry out research and analysis and to assist us with policy development.</p>

<h4>I am the parent or carer of a child or young person who has special educational needs or disabilities</h4>

<p>We may collect information about you and your child’s experiences to help us evaluate whether the local area agencies have properly identified and effectively supported your child’s needs.</p>

<p>Some of this information will be provided by you or your child. Some will be provided by the people who run the local area institutions that assess or support you and your child or that have done so in the past.</p>

<p>We hold this information as part of the inspection evidence. We may keep this information for at least 3 years.</p>

<p>We will keep any information we hold or share as secure as possible. We may have to share information about you or your child with other public authorities, such as the police and local authority child protection services, if we feel that this is necessary to protect your child or other children.</p>

As a result of this, we ask for and process a wide range of personal data about individuals who work in the schools or colleges where this allows the school or college to prove that staff working there are suitable to do so. We may also obtain personal data about children and young people who are or have been accommodated by the schools or colleges, and their parents or other individuals associated with these schools and colleges.</p>

<h3>How we will use information about you</h3>

<p>This section sets out how we will use data for different types of people.</p>

<h4>I work for a residential school or college</h4>

<p>We may collect information about you as part of our inspections. This can include information recorded by inspectors or provided by you, your employer, from children or by the public in their correspondence about the school or college.</p>

<p>Our role is primarily to inspect the quality of the service provided to the children and young people who are accommodated by the school or college, and to evaluate whether their welfare is being safeguarded and promoted.</p>

<p>We may examine staff records to make sure that the school or college has made proper checks or to check that staff have appropriate qualifications or to speak to you privately and record your views about the residential provision or employer or, if you are a member of staff, discuss your performance with your employer in the context of the services being provided.</p>

<p>We may keep relevant information about you as part of the inspection evidence. We will store this information securely for a minimum of 3 years.</p>

<p>We may also collect information from you if you decide to ‘whistleblow’ about your employer in a way that is protected by the Public Information Disclosure 1998.</p>

<h4>I am a child or young person who attends a residential school or college that Ofsted inspects</h4>

<p>If you attend a school or college with residential provision, we may obtain important and sometimes sensitive information about you and your experiences to help us check whether your welfare was safeguarded during the time you were living in a residential school or college. Some of this information will be given to us by you or the people who run the school or college or other government agencies.</p>

<p>We will always keep any information we hold or share as secure as possible. We sometimes have to share information about children and young people to other public authorities, such as the police and local authority child protection services, when we feel this will help and protect you or other children.</p>

<p>We may hold this information alongside our other information about the school or college. We may keep relevant information about you as part of inspection evidence for a minimum of 3 years.</p>

<h3>Types of information we hold</h3>

<p>We hold a wide range of information because of our inspection of residential provision in boarding schools, residential special schools and further education colleges in England. Specifically for those who must be suitable to work in educational setting like these, this can include:</p>

<h3>Who we might share personal data with</h3>

<h3>How long we keep personal data and how we decide this</h3>

<p>Ofsted will usually keep relevant information as part of our inspection evidence for a minimum of 3 years.</p>

<h3>Where the personal data comes from</h3>

<p>As well as the information recorded by our inspectors, personal data can come from a variety of sources outside of Ofsted. Information comes mainly from the individuals themselves, but we also receive information from other public authorities and members of the public.</p>

<p>Other public authorities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the police</li>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>national child safeguarding practice review panels</li>

<ul>

  <li>the press</li>
  <li>other registered persons</li>
</ul>

<p>We receive this information through our telephone contact centre, emails, written correspondence, social media, online forms, referrals from other internal teams or from inspection.</p>

<h3>The legal requirement to give us this information</h3>

<p>Section 87(3) of the Children Act 1989 and the National Care Standards Commission (Inspection of Schools and Colleges) Regulations 2002 set out why we can get personal data. We would not be able to carry out inspections and prepare reports without that personal data.</p>

<p>It is an offence to intentionally obstruct an inspector exercising these powers.</p>
