<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> The basics</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Wine and made-wine</h3>

<p>In the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979, ‘wine’ is defined as “any liquor which is of a strength exceeding 1.2% and which is obtained from the alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes or of the must of fresh grapes, whether or not the liquor is fortified with spirits or flavoured with aromatic extracts”.</p>

<p>‘Made-wine’ means “liquor which is of a strength exceeding 1.2% and which is obtained from the alcoholic fermentation of any substance or by mixing a liquor so obtained or derived from a liquor so obtained with any other liquor or substance but does not include wine, beer, black beer, spirits or cider”.</p>

<p>Made-wine, for example, will include products similar to wine but not made from fresh grape and some ‘ready to drink’ products (<abbr title="ready to drink’ products">RTDs</abbr>) that are made using fermented alcohol — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#trade-facility">section 25</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Licences and paying duty</h3>

<p>If you produce wine for sale, you must be licensed with HMRC for duty purposes and hold a wine producer’s licence (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#licensing">section 3</a>).</p>

<p>Wine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>becomes liable to duty when it is made (that is, when its strength exceeds 1.2% alcohol by volume (<abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>)) or imported — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#duty-becomes-due">section 5</a>
</li>
  <li>can be held on or, in certain circumstances, moved between licensed premises or to excise warehouses in duty suspension — that is, without payment of duty but always remaining liable to duty.</li>
</ul>

<p>Duty:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is charged on the quantity and in bands determined by alcoholic strength (<abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>) of the wine — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#duty-becomes-due">section 5</a>
</li>
  <li>is normally calculated by reference to the quantity and alcoholic strength stated on the package label or invoice — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#quantity">sections 8</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#alcoholic-strength">9</a>
</li>
  <li>becomes payable when wine is released from or consumed in licensed premises or excise warehouses — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#duty-becomes-due">section 5</a>
</li>
  <li>may also be paid on the constructive removal of wine held in duty suspense in licensed premises — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#paying-duty-in-advance">paragraph 5.12</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Wine becomes liable to duty once it has been produced or passes a UK duty point this can be when it is imported into the UK — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#liability%20to%20duty">paragraph 5.3</a>. In the case of Northern Ireland duty may also be chargeable on wine moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, however you may be able to off-set any excise duty-paid in Great Britain against the charge to excise duty that arises on entry to Northern Ireland — <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> How to calculate and pay the duty</h3>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep records of all wine produced</li>
  <li>keep records of all wine leaving licensed premises, or otherwise passing the duty point — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#passing-the-duty-point">paragraphs 5.7</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#paying-duty-in-advance">5.12</a>
</li>
  <li>calculate duty due on all wine released for UK home market use — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#duty-becomes-due">section 5</a>
</li>
  <li>keep records of all wine destroyed</li>
  <li>complete a monthly duty return and send it to the TAPS and CCL Cumbernauld Accounting Team <a class="govuk-link" href="#where-to-send">paragraph 7.11</a>
</li>
  <li>pay the duty by the due date by one of the methods described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#paying-duty">section 7</a>
</li>
  <li>keep a record of any excise duty off-set calculation you’ve made — see Notice 197</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Your responsibilities</h3>

<p>You must exercise control over your wine-making activities. Unless you do not need to be licensed (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#producing-wine-without">paragraph 3.2</a>), you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>license your wine premises</li>
  <li>make entry of your wine premises</li>
  <li>maintain your business records to acceptable standards</li>
  <li>render returns as required and pay any duty owing no later than the due date</li>
  <li>comply with the requirements of this notice</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also register for the Alcohol Wholesaler Registration Scheme if you sell duty paid alcohol to another business. It’s the responsibility of any business who purchases alcohol for onward sale or supply to check that the wholesaler they purchase from has been approved by HMRC.</p>

<p>Therefore, from April 2017, any business purchasing wine for onward sale or supply from you should check that you’ve been approved as an alcohol wholesaler.</p>

<p>To apply for approval, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-2002-alcohol-wholesaler-registration-scheme">Excise Notice 2002: Alcohol Wholesaler Registration Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Visits by HMRC</h3>

<p>We’ll make visits to make sure duty is being correctly assessed and accounted for on all wine leaving licensed premises. This will be done by auditing your commercial, accounting and management control systems, and physical checks on production, stock and movements of wine in duty suspension.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> HMRC checks</h3>

<p>When we want to carry out checks, we’ll make a prior appointment. Occasionally, we may visit without appointment but the attending officer will give the reason for this. At any reasonable time, you must allow our officers access to any area of the licensed premises. You must make sure that all your security personnel are aware that we may visit without appointment. All of our officers carry identification and will show this when they arrive.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span> If I fail to meet my legal obligations</h3>

<p>If you fail to comply with the law and regulations relating to this notice (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#find-the-relevant-law">paragraph 1.4</a>) or do not account for the correct amount of excise duty, we may take action including the issue of assessments and or civil penalties. These are explained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/excise-assessments-interim-guidance">Notice 208: Excise assessments</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-209-civil-penalties-fixed-geared-and-daily">Notice 209: Civil Penalties: fixed, geared and daily</a>.</p>

<p>You may also be liable to penalties if you fail to apply to register with HMRC at the right time or if your monthly duty return is inaccurate — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#production-by-unlicensed">paragraphs 3.12</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-to-avoid-a-penalty">7.7</a>. In many cases you’ll have the right to appeal. Full details of the appeals procedure are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#appeal-pen">section 28</a> of this notice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Licensing</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Wine producer’s licence</h3>

<p>If you produce or intend to produce wine for sale, you must hold an excise licence. For the purpose of this notice, this type of excise licence is known as a wine producer’s licence.</p>

<p>You must also be licensed if you render wine sparkling, unless you intend to carry out this process in an excise warehouse. You may produce wine and render wine sparkling on the same licensed premises.</p>

<h4>Changes in ownership</h4>

<p>Where an existing business (including all of its assets, liabilities and obligations) is sold to a new owner, the new owner must apply for a license prior to trading. The existing license will not transfer to the new owner upon the sale of a business.</p>

<p>Upon the sale of the business, the new owner should apply at least 45 working days in advance of the date they intend to start trading. The new owner will not be able to trade until they have received confirmation from HMRC that their application has been successful. If they do so, it will be treated as production by unlicensed persons, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#production-by-unlicensed">paragraph 3.12</a>.</p>

<p>This only applies where there has been a complete change in ownership. Significant changes must still be notified to HMRC.</p>

<p>Examples of when a change of ownership takes place and a new application is required include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>share sales involving a complete transfer of shares of the business from the original owner to the new owner, including all assets, liabilities and obligations</li>
  <li>business sales involving a complete transfer of all assets, liabilities and obligations as part of the terms of the sale of the business</li>
</ul>

<p>A partial sale of shares or a business’s assets or liabilities, where an original owner remains in place may not require a new application, but any changes must still be notified to HMRC as set out in this section.</p>

<p>The above examples are not exhaustive. If you are unsure if a new application is required, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">contact HMRC for clarification</a>.</p>

<p>The new owner should also ensure that any financial security required by HMRC from the business, such as a guarantee, is valid and in place when they take over the business. Guarantees held by the previous owner may not transfer to the new owner, who should seek clarification from HMRC and the guarantor, if necessary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Producing wine without a licence</h3>

<p>You may only produce wine without an excise licence if it is not for sale.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Licensed producers making wine from growers’ fruit</h3>

<p>If you do not intend to sell the wine produced for you by a licensed producer, you can receive it without payment of duty if you give the producer a written declaration that it will not be sold.</p>

<p>If you intend to lease vines, you must observe the conditions in <a class="govuk-link" href="#consumption">section 16</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re a commercial grower, or lessee, and you intend to sell the wine produced by a licensed producer on your behalf, the producer must pay the duty on the wine when it leaves their licensed premises.</p>

<p>We’ll also allow you to receive your wine from the licensed producer, without them having paid any duty on the wine, provided you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take out an excise licence</li>
  <li>make entry of your premises</li>
  <li>observe the requirements of this notice over storage</li>
  <li>pay the duty due when the wine is sent out from your licensed premises</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise Enquiries Helpline</a> for more information about these arrangements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> How to become licensed</h3>

<p>To get an excise licence, complete form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-application-for-a-licence-as-a-wine-or-made-wine-producer-or-commercial-grower-wmw1">WMW1</a> and either submit it online attaching your entry of premises (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#make-entry-of-the-premises">paragraph 3.6</a>) or send it by post along with your entry of premises, as soon as possible, to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

HMRC
<br>Excise Processing Teams
<br>BX9 1GL
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>If you have a question about your application once it has been sent, contact the Excise Processing Teams (<abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr>). For enquiries before this stage, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise Enquiries Helpline</a>.</p>

<p>A separate licence is needed for each set of premises at which you intend to make wine. A licence will be issued in the name of the proper legal entity (sole proprietor, partnership, limited company, and so on). However, you may want to submit only one duty return for all licensed premises owned by the same legal entity — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#paying-duty">section 7</a>.</p>

<p>Wine producers applying for a licence for the first time must arrange for a guarantee to cover any duty due on wine, removed from your licensed premises to the UK home market, until it is paid to HMRC — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#financial-security">section 4</a>.</p>

<p>Where an existing business (including all of its assets, liabilities and obligations) is sold to a new owner, the new owner will need to secure their own licence before trading, check <a class="govuk-link" href="#licensing">paragraph 3.1</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, it may take up to 45 days to process your application.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> What you can do with an excise licence</h3>

<p>As a licensed wine producer you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>produce wine on your licensed premises</li>
  <li>carry out operations and procedures in this notice, including the removal of duty suspended product to other appropriately approved UK and EU warehouses</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland based licenced wine producers can also remove duty suspended products to appropriately approved EU warehouses</li>
  <li>receive wine, in duty suspense, from other appropriately approved warehouses for further processing</li>
  <li>receive back, in duty suspense, your own product from other appropriately approved warehouses (that are approved to receive wine) where it has undergone further processing, for example aeration, pasteurisation and bottling</li>
</ul>

<p>You are not allowed to receive spirits, beer, cider or imported wine in duty suspense. You are also not allowed to receive wine, not previously produced on your licensed premises, in a ready for sale state from other licensed premises or approved warehouses. You can do so if you’re a commercial grower who is licensed as a ‘wine producer’ so you can receive wine produced on your behalf by a licensed producer (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#licensed-producers">paragraph 3.3</a>).</p>

<p>If you want to receive spirits for fortification or beer, cider or imported wine for use in the production of wine or made-wine, you must apply for approval as a Trade Facility Warehouse — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#trade-facility">section 25</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> How to ‘make entry of the premises’</h3>

<p>As part of your licence application, you must make entry of the premises you intend to use.</p>

<p>An entry of premises is a plan showing the position and description of each vessel or other piece of plant you intend to use in the production of wine and where the wine is to be stored. It should include any identifying marks on your vessels or plant and the full address of the premises.</p>

<p>A commercial grower or lessee who intends to take out an excise licence (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#licensed-producers">paragraph 3.3</a>), must provide a plan of where the wine will be stored and the full address of the premises.</p>

<p>The plan must be A4 size or less and in black and white with duty suspended areas shaded. The plan should be submitted to the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> with your application.</p>

<p>You do not have to make an excise entry of your premises if the wine you produce is not for sale.</p>

<p>Retail premises, within or attached to your licensed premises, are not considered part of the licensed premises. Any wine moved to the retail premises will have to be duty paid on removal from the licensed premises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> What happens after you apply for a licence</h3>

<p>Your application will be vetted and is subject to background checks. If these checks do not give enough assurance that the business is suitable for licensing, more information may be requested. Until this information is received, your application will be put on hold. A visit to your place of business may also be needed.</p>

<p>If we accept your application, we’ll issue you with an excise licence, which will confirm the date of licensing and any conditions. You should keep the licence on the premises to which it refers and make it available to our officers on request.</p>

<p>Your premises will be licensed as a tax warehouse but not as an excise warehouse. Information on excise warehouses can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Notice 196 Excise goods: authorisation of warehouse keepers, approval of premises and registration of owners</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Notice 197 Excise goods: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</p>

<p>If we refuse your application, we’ll inform you in writing and give our reason or reasons. We’ll offer you a review of our decision or you can appeal direct to the independent tribunal — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#appeal-pen">section 28</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> Duration of licence</h3>

<p>Your licence will last until production ends. You must tell us in writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you intend to stop production</li>
  <li>when you’ve stopped production</li>
</ul>

<p>If you sell your business in it’s entirety (whether by sale of shares or contract of sale), your licence will not transfer to the new owner. Check <a class="govuk-link" href="#licensing">paragraph 3.1</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span> Stopping production</h3>

<p>After production has stopped and your wine is finished and packaged (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#simplification-procedures">paragraph 22.2</a>), you’ll have to pay the duty due on any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remaining stock in hand</li>
  <li>unexplained shortages</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also allow you to destroy the wine stock in hand as if it were unfit for sale. If you want to do this, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#wine-is-spoilt">paragraph 11.7</a>. However, duty must still be paid on unexplained shortages.</p>

<p>When we’re satisfied that you’ve accounted for all duties and or destroyed your stock of wine, we’ll cancel your licence and your entry of the premises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> Using your licensed premises for other excise trades</h3>

<p>You can use your premises for other excise trades (for example, a compounder of spirits) if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re licensed or registered to carry out that trade</li>
  <li>you observe the requirements in the appropriate notice and any restrictions or conditions imposed by us</li>
  <li>your working practices and records readily identify the particular trade being carried out in any room, vessel or piece of equipment that can be used for 2 or more trades</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span> Changes affecting your licence</h3>

<p>You must write to the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> (<a class="govuk-link" href="#become-licensed">paragraph 3.4</a> has the address) to tell them about changes that may affect your licence, including ending production — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#stopping-production">paragraph 3.9</a>.</p>

<p>These changes would need a new application <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-application-for-a-licence-as-a-wine-or-made-wine-producer-or-commercial-grower-wmw1">form WMW1</a> and entry of premises to be submitted, changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>of legal entity, for example, formation of a limited company</li>
  <li>in the ownership or control of your business, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#licensing">paragraph 3.1</a>
</li>
  <li>to VAT status such as you become VAT registered or de-registered</li>
</ul>

<p>It may take up to 45 working days to process your new application, so notify the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> of any changes as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You must also tell the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change of partner details</li>
  <li>change of director details</li>
  <li>change of address of your licensed premises — entry of premises would also need to be submitted</li>
  <li>cessation of production</li>
  <li>the production of other excisable goods on your premises</li>
  <li>financial difficulties or impending insolvency</li>
  <li>you becoming VAT registered or de-registered</li>
</ul>

<p>It may take up to 15 working days to make changes to your current registration, so notify the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> of any changes as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.12 </span> Production by unlicensed persons or on unlicensed premises</h3>

<p>The production of wine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by a person who is not licensed</li>
  <li>on premises which are not licensed</li>
</ul>

<p>is an offence for which there is a penalty. You can avoid a penalty by applying to be licensed at the correct time.</p>

<p>If you purchase an existing licensed business in it’s entirety, the existing licence will not transfer to you. You must apply for a licence (including premises licence) prior to trading, check <a class="govuk-link" href="#licensing">paragraph 3.1</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve not applied for a licence, you must tell us as soon as possible. Depending on circumstances, we may reduce the penalty. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hm-revenue-and-customs-leaflets-factsheets-and-booklets#compliance-checks-factsheets-penalties">Find more information on penalties</a>.</p>

<p>You have the right to appeal if we impose a penalty. For more information on appeals, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#appeal-pen">section 28</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-appeals">disagree with a tax decision</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Financial security</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Guarantees</h3>

<p>For the purpose of this notice, financial security is a guarantee given by an approved guarantor (for example a financial institution) who will pay money to us if there is an irregularity covered by the guarantee. Guarantees are the only form of security acceptable to us.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> When a guarantee is needed</h3>

If satisfied, we’ll accept the guarantee and return a signed copy to the guarantor. We’ll write to you to confirm the guarantee has been approved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> When you do not need a guarantee</h3>

<p>You’ll not have to provide a guarantee if you’re eligible for authorisation under <abbr title="Excise Payment Security system">EPSS</abbr>. Where an eligible business is approved for <abbr title="Excise Payment Security system">EPSS</abbr>, they may defer payment of duty without providing a guarantee — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#qualifies-for-EPSS">paragraphs 4.4.1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#providing-a-guarantee">4.4.2</a>.</p>

<h4>4.4.1 Who qualifies for <abbr title="Excise Payment Security system">EPSS</abbr>

<p>Your guarantee should be set at a maximum amount that is sufficient to cover all the duty likely to be due on wine removed from your licensed premises to the UK home market, in any given accounting period.</p>

<p>If you’re not eligible to apply for <abbr title="Excise Payment Security system">EPSS</abbr> and you do not want to provide a guarantee then you can pay your duty liability up front. The payment is an annual one and you must pay a year’s estimated duty in advance. Contact the Environmental Taxes Team to make the arrangements.</p>

<p>Licensed wine producers who have premises that are also approved as an excise warehouse must have a separate deferment guarantee to cover any duty due on removals from the excise warehouse — unless they are eligible to apply for authorisation to make payments without providing a guarantee.</p>

<p>You’ll not be authorised for duty deferment unless you have a guarantee or are authorised under <abbr title="Excise Payment Security system">EPSS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>4.4.4 What will happen if you do not provide a guarantee</h4>

<p>If you fail to provide a guarantee, you must pay the duty due when the duty point occurs, which is as soon as you despatch wine to home-use from your licensed premises, rather than delaying payment of the duty until the 15th day of the following month.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Who can be your guarantor</h3>

<p>Only companies approved by us may act as guarantors. Most banks and insurance companies have this approval, but if you want to check a company, contact the Financial Security Centre (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#guarantee">paragraph 4.3</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Cost of guarantee</h3>

<p>The cost of the guarantee is a commercial arrangement between you and the guarantor.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Duty rates and when duty becomes due</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Where to find duty rates</h3>

<p>The duty rates for wine are structured in bands according to the strength of the product and whether it is sparkling or not. They are stated as amounts per hectolitre (100 litres).</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise Enquiries Helpline</a> will advise you of current rates of duty bands or you can find the rates in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowance-excise-duty-alcohol-duty">alcohol duty rates</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Wine duty categories</h3>

<p>There are 6 duty categories for wine and made-wine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all wine/made-wine exceeding 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but not exceeding 4.0% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>all wine/made-wine exceeding 4.0% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but not exceeding 5.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>still wine/made-wine exceeding 5.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but not exceeding 15% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>still wine/made-wine exceeding 15% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but not exceeding 22% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>sparkling wine exceeding 5.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but less than 8.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>sparkling wine from 8.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but not exceeding 15% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Any wines exceeding 22.0% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> are dutied as spirits.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> When wine becomes liable to duty</h3>

<p>Wine becomes liable to duty once it has been produced or when it is imported into the UK — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#passing-the-duty-point">paragraph 5.7</a>. For movements of wine from Great Britain to Northern Ireland refer to section 2.2 and 2.3 for information on the charge to excise duty and how to account for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> When wine is liable to the sparkling rates of duty</h3>

<p>Wine is liable to the sparkling rates of duty if it has an actual alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 5.5% but not exceeding 15% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in a closed bottle with excess pressure, due to carbon dioxide, of 3 bars or more at 20°C</li>
  <li>regardless of pressure, is contained in a closed bottle with a ‘mushroom shaped stopper’ held in place by a tie or fastening</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> When wine is made</h3>

<p>Wine is deemed to be made or produced at the point during fermentation when the strength of the product first exceeds 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span> Duty on low strength wine</h3>

<p>No duty is chargeable in the UK on wine that does not exceed 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>. You must record details of the manufacturing operations in your production records. The wine may be moved using your commercial despatch documents.</p>

<p>If you want to produce low strength wine by removal of alcohol, you should consult the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise Enquiries Helpline</a> who will advise you on revenue requirements that may affect the process you intend to use.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span> Passing the duty point</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#liable-to-duty">Paragraph 5.3</a> explains when wine becomes liable to duty, but duty only becomes payable when the wine passes the duty point, that is when it leaves duty suspension. Duty ceases to be suspended when:</p>

<p>(a) the wine leaves licensed premises, unless it is delivered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to other appropriately approved premises for further processing</li>
  <li>to an excise warehouse</li>
  <li>for exportation</li>
  <li>for shipment as stores</li>
  <li>to HM Ships</li>
  <li>to entitled diplomats</li>
  <li>to entitled members of visiting forces</li>
</ul>

<p>(b) the wine is constructively removed (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#paying-duty-in-advance">paragraph 5.12</a>)</p>

<p>(c) the wine is lost</p>

<p>(d) the wine is irregularly diverted</p>

<p>(e) you’re no longer licensed</p>

<p>(f) the premises on which you’re holding the wine cease to be licensed</p>

<p>Wine is considered to have left duty suspension when there is a failure to comply with requirements of the duty suspension arrangements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span> Duty liability</h3>

<p>The person holding the wine at the duty point is liable for the duty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span> When to pay your duty</h3>

<p>Normally, the duty should be paid by the 15th day following the end of your ‘accounting period’ in which the wine passed the duty point — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#paying-duty">section 7</a> (but also read <a class="govuk-link" href="#guarantee-is-needed">paragraphs 4.2</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#dont-provide-a-guarantee">4.4.4</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.10 </span> How to calculate duty on wine and made-wine removed from a licensed winery</h3>

<p>Unless HMRC has permitted the use of a different method of calculation that does not disadvantage the revenue, you must work out each constituent stage of the duty calculation process to a minimum of 4 decimal places.</p>

<p>To complete the EX606 wine/made-wine duty return declaration, round down the quantity of wine to the nearest whole litre.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>(a) 407 × 3 litre container of still wine at 11% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr></p>

<p>407 × 3 = 1,221 litres in total<br> 
1,221 × duty rate of *£2.7784 = £3,392.4264, rounded down to £3,392.42<br><br>
*this is the hectolitre duty rate of £277.84 converted to litres for the purposes of completing the duty return.</p>

<p>(b) 137 cases of still wine, each containing 12 × 750 millilitres (<abbr title="millilitres">ml</abbr>) at 13% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr></p>

<p>12 × 750ml = 9 litres per case <br> 
9 × 137 = 1,233 litres in total<br> 
1,233 × duty rate of £2.7784 = £3,425.7672, rounded down to £3,425.76</p>

<p>(c) 1,246 cases of still wine, each containing 12 × 750ml at 11% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr></p>

<p>12 × 750ml = 9 litres per case<br>
9 × 1,246 = 11,214 litres in total<br> 
11,214 × duty rate of £2.7784 = £31,156.9776, rounded down to £31,156.97</p>

<p>(d) 245 cases of sparkling wine, each containing 12 × 750ml at 12% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr></p>

<p>12 × 750ml = 9 litres per case<br> 
 9 × 245 = 2,205 litres in total<br> 
2,205 × duty rate of £3.5587 = £7,846.9335 rounded down to £7,846.93</p>

<p>Duty rates used in these calculations are those in place at the time of publication of this notice. Find details of current duty rates by contacting the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise Enquiries Helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.11 </span> What happens if you do not pay duty</h3>

<p>If you do not pay the duty by the due date, you’ll be liable to a civil penalty of 5% of the duty or £250 — whichever is greater. More penalties may be incurred for each day that you fail to pay the duty. Details of civil penalties are contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-209-civil-penalties-fixed-geared-and-daily">Excise Notice 209: civil penalties — fixed, geared and daily</a>.</p>

<p>At any time after the due date for payment, our officer may take action to take possession of all wine, materials and equipment used in making wine or connected with your trade as a wine producer, which are either owned by you or are in your possession and auction them to recover duty due plus pay any Taking Control of Goods fees. Also read <a class="govuk-link" href="#fail-to-meet-my-legal-obligations">paragraph 2.7</a> of this notice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.12 </span> Paying duty in advance of wine leaving licensed premises</h3>

<p>If you think that it would help your business to account for duty on any duty suspended wine in advance of delivery from licensed premises, you may do so. This is known as ‘constructive removal’ and allows the licensed holder of the wine to change the status of the wine held on licensed premises from duty suspended to duty paid, on payment of the proper duty, without the need to remove the wine from those premises.</p>

<p>The duty should be paid (<a class="govuk-link" href="#paying-duty">section 7</a>) by the 15th of the month following the calendar month in which the wine was constructively removed.</p>

<p>The next 2 bullets have the force of law under regulation 12A (3) of the Wine and Made-wine Regulations 1989.<br> 
You must record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date of any change of status of any wine from duty suspended to duty paid</li>
  <li>the product(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>When wine has been constructively removed, it cannot be returned to duty suspension in licensed premises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.13 </span> Duty rate changes</h3>

<p>You’re responsible for declaring the correct amount of duty from the effective date of change. When the duty rate changes, we’ll notify you of the new rates, the effective date and the time of the change. Following the budget, find details of the duty rate changes by contacting the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise Enquiries Helpline</a>.</p>

<p>When the rate changes during an accounting period, you must complete 2 separate returns for the period — one at the old rates and one at the new rates. Mark the returns pre or post budget as appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.14 </span> Carrying out any operation/dilution on wine or made wine after Excise Duty has been accounted for on it</h3>

<p>If you mix or add water or any other substance to wine or made wine after the excise duty point, and if the addition had been carried out before the duty point the amount of excise duty would have been greater than the amount payable, you’ll be liable to a civil penalty and the new product that is a result of the addition will be liable to forfeiture.</p>

<p>For example, if wine or made wine is produced and excise duty is accounted for at say 13% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>, if it is subsequently diluted to produce more volume at a lower <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> a civil penalty will be applied and the diluted wine or made wine will be liable to forfeiture, as this would effectively reduce the duty liability on the volume of the finished wine or made wine.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> Storing original documents</h3>

<p>You can keep your records on any form of storage technology as long as copies can be easily produced and there are adequate facilities for allowing our officer to view them when required.</p>

<p>You should advise the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise Enquiries Helpline</a> before you transfer records. You may need to operate the old and new systems side by side for a limited period of time. We may refuse or withdraw approval if any requirements are not met.</p>

<p>Make sure you keep your original registration certificate in a safe place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span> Keeping your records on a computer</h3>

<p>If you keep your records on a computer, we’ll need access to it so that we can check its operation and the information stored. We may ask for help from you or anyone else having charge of, or otherwise concerned with, the operation of the computer or its software.</p>

<p>If a computer bureau is employed, you’re responsible for arranging for the bureau to make your records available to us when we want to see them. Normally this will be at your principal place of business.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Accounting for and paying duty</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Working out duty</h3>

<p>At the end of each ‘accounting period’, that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calendar month</li>
  <li>4 or 5 week period (provided this arrangement is agreed beforehand with HMRC)</li>
</ul>

<p>you must total up all the wine sent out from your premises during that period, work out the duty due, complete a duty account and transfer the appropriate totals to a monthly return — EX606 (Wine/Made-Wine/Cider/Perry Return).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Where to get a duty return</h3>

<p>EX606s are routinely sent out to all licensed wine producers. If you fail to receive a return, contact the Environmental Taxes Team (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#dont-send-a-duty-return">paragraph 7.4</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> How to fill in your return</h3>

<p>You must fill in your monthly duty return, EX606, with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the quantity of wine in each relative duty band you sent out for home-use (or constructively removed) during the previous accounting period</li>
  <li>any allowable deductions</li>
  <li>the amount of duty you owe</li>
</ul>

<p>You may only make deductions from your duty liability as outlined in this notice if we have allowed you to do so.</p>

<p>The EX606 has full instructions on the completion of the return.</p>

<p>Returns must be completed in ink and any changes must be initialled and dated by the person who signs the declaration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> What happens when you do not send a duty return</h3>

<p>If you do not send a return on time, you’ll be liable to penalties — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#fail-to-meet-my-legal-obligations">paragraph 2.7</a>. We have the authority to estimate the duty which would have been due and to pursue that debt through the civil courts — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#you-dont-pay-duty">paragraph 5.11</a>.

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span> Who can sign your return</h3>

<p>The proprietor, a partner, the company secretary or a director of the company should sign the declaration on the return. If this is not possible, you can, as one of the above-mentioned persons, authorise someone to sign the return on your behalf.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span> Submitting a single duty return for more than one site</h3>

<p>If you have more than one licensed premises owned by the same legal entity, you may, on request, combine the duty liability for each in the one duty return. However, an individual duty summary should be maintained for each site and consolidated in a duty account by the site submitting the return.</p>

<p>If you’re approved to produce both cider and wine/made-wine, or if you produce either products on more than one set of premises, you may, as above, combine the duty liability for both products and or premises in the 1 duty return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.7 </span> How to avoid a penalty</h3>

<p>You can avoid a penalty by checking that you’ve given complete and accurate information in your duty return. You may be liable to a penalty if your return is inaccurate and, as a result, you do not pay enough duty or if you do not notify us that a duty assessment we have sent you is too low.</p>

<p>If you’re aware you’ve made a mistake on your return, you must tell us as soon as possible. Depending on circumstances, we may reduce the penalty.</p>

<p>If you deliberately make a false duty return, you may face prosecution for the offence and incur a heavy penalty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.8 </span> Reporting errors from earlier accounting periods</h3>

<p>If you find under-declarations relating to previous accounting periods which total less than £1,000 duty, you must enter the amounts against lines 23 to 32 on the reverse of the EX606 as appropriate, and carry the total forward to lines 35 and 17 for the current accounting period.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you discover over-declarations totalling less than £1,000 duty, you must enter the amounts against lines 23 to 32 on the reverse of the EX606 as appropriate and carry the total to lines 36 and 18 for the current accounting period. You do not have to send written advice, but details of the errors must be kept for inspection.</p>

<p>If the total under-declaration or over-declaration is £1,000 duty or more, you must make the adjustments outlined above and then send full details in writing to the Environmental Taxes Team (<a class="govuk-link" href="#dont-send-a-duty-return">paragraph 7.4</a> has the address) with the return.</p>

<p>You must submit your return and payment so that they arrive not later than the 15th day of the month following the ‘accounting period.’ When the 15th day falls at a weekend or on a public holiday the return and payment must be received by the previous working day.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.10 </span> How to pay</h3>

<p>HMRC accepts payment by various methods but recommends you pay electronically using one of the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>approve a payment through your online bank account</li>
  <li>Bacs Direct Credit</li>
  <li>CHAPS</li>
  <li>internet or phone banking</li>
</ul>

<p>A cap was introduced on 31 May 2012 by the Board of Bacs Payments Schemes Ltd (Bacs) which limits the maximum value of any single Bacs transaction. If you have a payment to make by Bacs Direct Credit which exceeds £20 million, you need to make arrangements with your own bank to make sure payment reaches HMRC on the due date, by an alternative payment method such as CHAPS.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.11 </span> Where to send your completed return</h3>

<p>Licensed wine producers must send returns to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

HMRC
<br>TAPS and CCL
<br>Cumbernauld Accounting Team
<br>Accounts Office
<br>St Mungo's Road

<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.12 </span> Nil return</h3>

<p>If you make no deliveries of wine to home-use during an accounting period, you must still send us an EX606 return form. Insert ‘nil’ in the quantities box, sign the return and send to us.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Measurement of quantity</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>We can ask for duty to be accounted for on the actual quantity of wine in each container as it passes the duty point. However, most packagers do not measure this in each container as they use the ‘average system’ of quantity control.</p>

<p>Under this arrangement, used widely throughout the EU, the average contents of packages must not be less than the declared contents marked on the can or bottle or label. Within specified limits, the actual contents of any particular container may be more or less than the declared contents.</p>

<p>Packagers using the average system conform to a Weights and Measures Code of Practice which has been agreed with Trading Standards. Packagers are obliged to monitor and record the actual quantity of wine by sampling a proportion of packages to make sure they fulfil the code’s requirement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Duty on small pack</h3>

<p>Small pack refers to containers of 10 litres capacity and less. When sending out wine for UK consumption from your licensed premises, you should charge duty on the quantity declared on the label of the can or bottle.</p>

<p>Evidence of compliance with weights and measures legislation will be sufficient to accept the labelled contents as the duty base, unless there are grounds for believing that deliberate duty avoidance is involved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> Samples</h3>

<p>You must take samples as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least one sample should be taken for each production run</li>
  <li>each sample must be a minimum of 5 packages</li>
</ul>

<p>The average of the samples taken to comply with average contents rules will be treated as the quantity of wine in a container.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span> ‘Due diligence’</h3>

<p>‘Due diligence’ is the term used for measures you have in place to monitor the filling process and actions you take to prevent and rectify any instances of excessive over-filling or under-filling.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5 </span> Proving due diligence</h3>

<p>You must monitor the filling process to make sure that the quantity put into the package does not regularly excessively exceed the amount declared on the label. You should record these checks and provide an adequate audit trail to satisfy our officer about due diligence.</p>

<p>Where there is evidence of consistent and excessive over-filling, more duty will be due.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.6 </span> When more duty needs to be paid</h3>

<p>Duty becomes payable at the end of the accounting period in which a container of wine is delivered to home-use and then passes the duty point.</p>

<p>Where you’ve incurred more duty liability because of overfilling, it should be paid in the accounting period when wine is supplied to home-use from your licensed premises, or from licensed premises or Excise warehouses owned or operated by your company.</p>

<p>If you do not correctly record or pay the duty due on excess volume that you’ve delivered to home-use, we’ll assess how much you owe. If you cannot produce accurate records upon which the extra duty can be readily established, including quantities delivered to home-use, we’ll use ‘best judgement’.</p>

<p>For over-filled containers of wine supplied in duty suspension to third parties, record details of these deliveries separately in your records. The law states that the person holding the goods at the time of their delivery to home-use, is liable for the duty, including that on the volume in excess of the declared quantity. If we are satisfied that the third party was unaware that the container had been over-filled and is independent of you, we’ll not normally recover the duty. In deciding whether to pursue the extra duty, we’ll take into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the relationship between you and the third party</li>
  <li>contracts of supply, if appropriate</li>
  <li>the price paid for the goods</li>
  <li>any other information considered relevant</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.7 </span> When you can combine monitoring results</h3>

<p>For small pack, you should assess the monitoring results separately for each product. In exceptional circumstances, for example, where a small amount of a seasonal product is packaged and separate monitoring would produce an inequitable outcome, we’ll consider requests for combining the monitoring results for a number of products.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.8 </span> Where to record volume of wine delivered</h3>

<p>Your commercial records should be acceptable if they have enough information for calculating duty. You’ll also need to enter the total volume of wine delivered during the accounting period on the EX606 duty return — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#paying-duty">section 7</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.9 </span> Why you must record the volume of wine delivered</h3>

<p>Apart from commercial considerations, you must record the volume of wine delivered because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the volume will affect the calculation of the duty</li>
  <li>if the delivery is under duty suspension and subject to pilferage, an accurate assessment of the loss will be needed</li>
  <li>our officers will want to be satisfied about the accuracy and completeness of your systems and the adequacy of any duty guarantees</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.10 </span> Which method to check quantity in large pack or bulk</h3>

<p>By ‘large pack’, we mean containers in excess of 10 litres or more.</p>

<p>The dutiable quantity of wine should be the actual contents found by dipping, metering or weighing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.11 </span> How to deal with imports</h3>

<p>International obligations mean we cannot treat imports any less favourably than domestic product. As importers will not necessarily be aware of the actual contents of containers, we’ll apply the same principle in <a class="govuk-link" href="#duty-needs-to-be-paid">paragraph 8.6</a>.
In the case of Northern Ireland only, imports only apply to any other country outside the EU.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Alcoholic strength</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> percentage</h3>

<p>Alcoholic strength is the percentage of <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> in the wine at 20°C. For duty purposes, this should be truncated to one decimal place, for example, 5.59% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> becomes 5.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span> How to measure alcoholic strength</h3>

<p>You may use any method to measure the strength of wine as long as it produces results that agree with those achieved using the distillation analysis method (also known as the reference method) described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#distillation-analysis">section 26</a>. This is important if the strength of your wine is close to the top of its duty banding.</p>

<p>If you do not use distillation analysis to measure your <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>, you must be prepared to explain your method and show that your results agree with those that would have been achieved had it been used.</p>

<p>For any methods not based on laboratory analysis, an independent analyst must test the <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> of each of your products, at least annually, to confirm consistency with calculated results. The results of the independent analyses must be held in your business records.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span> Alcoholic strength for duty purposes</h3>

<p>For duty purposes, the alcoholic strength of wine is the actual strength when it passes the duty point.</p>

<p>However, if you comply with certain conditions, we’ll accept for duty purposes the declared strength.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span> Conditions for declared strength</h3>

<p>If you want to use the declared strength for duty purposes, you must be able to show that you’ve shown due diligence in the control of your process to make sure that, on average, the actual <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> of each finished product equates to that you’re declaring.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.5 </span> How you must show due diligence to record <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You must continuously monitor and record your <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> results, which should normally fall randomly on either side of the target strength. The average of your results should equate closely with the target which must be the declared strength.</p>

<p>It is recognised that the <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> of the same product may occasionally vary, but provided appropriate action is taken quickly to return the strength of the wine to within its normal specification, due diligence will have been demonstrated. You must keep records of action taken to maintain product strength within control limits.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.6 </span> How you should measure the strength of each product</h3>

<p>You must establish the strength of each discrete batch for each of your products. Where wine from one batch is packaged into different container types, for example, boxes and bottles, you may combine the results.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.7 </span> Infrequent or one-off products</h3>

<p>If you can show us that, based on available information and experience, due care was taken when deciding target ABVs for new and or infrequently produced qualities (and that all decisions, actions and so on were properly recorded), we’ll accept the declared strength for duty purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.8 </span> How we check your results</h3>

<p>We’ll examine your results and your record of actions taken. Where the target strength coincides with the limit of a duty band, and where the results are consistently above target, we’ll ask you to show that action was taken to bring the process back into control or to change the declared <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> as soon as the problem was identified. If you’ve failed to take action, an assessment will be raised for the extra duty due.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.9 </span> Using the same arrangements for measuring strength of wine which may be delivered under duty suspension</h3>

<p>It is likely that the wine will subsequently be delivered on payment of duty, so the same arrangements will apply for all wine you produce.</p>

<p>As it is the responsibility of the person holding the wine at the duty point to account for the duty, if you despatch packages in duty suspension on which the strength is understated, you must tell the consignee accordingly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.10 </span> What happens if there is a dispute over strength</h3>

<p>We may take samples of wine which will be analysed using the reference method described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#distillation-analysis">section 26</a>. The analysis result will establish the actual dutiable strength of the wine for legal purposes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Duty reliefs — general information</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span> What duty reliefs you’re entitled to</h3>

<p>Natural losses, wastage and other legitimate causes for lost product are not liable to duty if we’re satisfied that they are genuine losses caused by the production process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Irregularities, losses and deficiencies in licensed production premises</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> What are your responsibilities as a licensed wine producer</h3>

<p>As a licensed wine producer, you’re responsible for the control of wine in your licensed premises. You must have the necessary systems to control and safeguard your stocks. You must examine critically all losses and deficiencies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> If you accidentally lose duty suspended wine</h3>

<p>You do not have to pay duty if we’re satisfied that the wine has been lost in licensed premises and has not been consumed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span> Which records of losses you must keep</h3>

<p>You need to keep records of production and processing and these should show how much wine you lose during routine operations. For example, the losses you incur during packaging operations.</p>

<p>The next 4 bullets have the force of law under regulation 6 of the Revenue Trader (Accounts and Records) Regulations 1992.<br> 
For accidental losses you must record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date and time the loss occurred</li>
  <li>the description (product name) and the volume of wine lost, and the alcoholic strength if the loss occurred after production had been completed</li>
  <li>vessels in which it was contained</li>
  <li>the reason why the accidental loss occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span> Unexplained losses</h3>

<p>If wine cannot be accounted for after the start of production, and there is no acceptable explanation, you’re liable for duty on the missing wine. It is in your own interest to keep proper records of all losses.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span> Offsetting stock losses against surpluses</h3>

<p>You can offset stock losses against surpluses if you have documentary evidence showing they are related. Your records must contain a clear audit trail to justify any adjustments to stock records after finding errors. You must justify each offset. We do not allow you to accumulate losses and surpluses from various sources and then offset gross totals.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.6 </span> Losses of duty paid wine</h3>

<p>Normally there is no duty relief in for wine which is lost after it has passed the duty point.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.7 </span> If duty suspended wine is spoilt</h3>

<p>You’ll not have to pay the duty if we’re satisfied the wine has been unintentionally spoilt, contaminated or otherwise rendered unfit for consumption in the licensed production premises and has not been consumed. You can ‘write off’ the quantities after you’ve recorded the information in your records and destroyed any spoilt product.</p>

<p>We may examine your records as part of our audit process. If we’re not satisfied with your explanation and supporting evidence, you’ll have to pay the duty on the quantity previously ‘written off’.</p>

<p>Other legislation may apply when you destroy spoilt wine — for example, pollution.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.8 </span> Records of spoilt wine you must keep</h3>

<p>The next 5 bullets have the force of law under regulation 6 of the Revenue Trader (Accounts and Records) Regulations 1992.<br>

  <li>be clearly labelled ‘not for sale’</li>
  <li>be supplied only to a wholesaler or distributor or to a potential trade customer within the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>There must be a genuine trade purpose for supplying the samples, for example, for analysis and tests to be carried out on the wine before purchase.</p>

<p>Wine used for promotions and for tasting at, for example, UK trade fairs, shows, exhibitions and supermarkets must be duty paid.</p>

<p>If samples are not supplied free of charge then you must pay duty on them.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span> What duty paid samples to take</h3>

<p>You may take duty paid samples for any business purpose. There is no restriction on size or number. You should pay duty in the normal manner and record details in your business records.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Duty on domestic consumption</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span> Wine that you or your employees drink</h3>

<p>If you’re a grower or beekeeper who produces, or has produced for you, wine from your own fruit or honey, you can deliver from your premises duty free approved quantities of wine for your own domestic consumption, or for drinking free of charge by your employees.</p>

<p>The term ‘grower’ refers to a person who owns or leases vines for which they are responsible for the cultivation, nurturing and harvesting. This does not need to be done personally as the grower may contract others to carry out the work for them, but they are responsible for the supervision of any contracted work.</p>

<p>The term ‘domestic consumption’ means consumption or use by the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grower and the growers family or, in the case of a limited or public company, its directors</li>
  <li>grower’s employees and guests</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span> Entitlement to relief</h3>

<p>Entitlement is based on the quantity of wine produced in the preceding calendar year (January to December) and must not exceed the actual amount produced.</p>

<p>If no wine is produced in the preceding calendar year there is no entitlement to domestic consumption. No part of your entitlement can be carried forward from one year to the next.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span> Calculating domestic relief</h3>

<p>The maximum quantity which can be delivered for domestic drinking free of duty in any calendar year from January to December is:</p>

<p>(a) 5.5 hectolitres, plus</p>

<p>(b) 10% of the quantity above 5.5 hectolitres produced in the preceding calendar year.</p>

<p>The total of (a) plus (b) must not be more than 11 hectolitres. Should the wine produced in the preceding year be less than 5.5 hectolitres, the maximum entitlement for relief will be limited to that actually produced.</p>

<p>If you want to claim this relief, you must record your domestic consumption calculation in your business records before you remove your entitlement. You’ll be liable to pay duty on any quantity over claimed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#consumption">Section 16</a> explains more about vine leasing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.4 </span> Duty on wine for visitors</h3>

<p>Visitors can be considered as guests. You do not pay duty as long as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no charge is made for admission to the premises</li>
  <li>no charge is made for the wine</li>
  <li>the wine is supplied by the glass and not in bottles or other take-away packaging</li>
</ul>

<p>Drink consumed may be taken from your domestic consumption allowance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span> Vine leasing for domestic consumption</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span> How vine leasing works</h3>

<p>Vine leasing is when the owner of a vineyard leases a number of vines (or rows of vines) to an individual or group of individuals in order that they (the lessees) may receive the wine produced from the grapes of their leased vines.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span> Lessees receiving duty free wine</h3>

<p>Lessees can receive wine duty free if it is for their own domestic use and there are no commercial considerations such as sale promotion agreements and so on.</p>

<p>You may be asked by our officer to produce contracts or agreements for inspection.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.3 </span> Rules for a lessee deemed to be a grower</h3>

<p>The lessee may only receive wine produced from their own grapes.</p>

<p>They must take responsibility for all the work on their vines such as the cultivation, nurturing, harvesting and present the grapes from only their own vines for vinification by a winemaker.</p>

<p>This does not need to be done personally. The lessee/grower may contract others to carry out the work for them, but they are responsible for the supervision of any contracted work.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.4 </span> Rules for the vineyard owner to allow lessees to receive wine duty free</h3>

<p>Under this scheme, the vineyard owner must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not attend to the cultivation, nurturing or harvesting of the leased vines unless they or their employees are separately contracted to do so by the lessee</li>
  <li>not supplement the harvest of any leased vines from any other source</li>
  <li>allow the lessee to take his grapes elsewhere for making into wine (vinification)</li>
  <li>maintain records of each lessee and the quantity of grapes presented for vinification with relative dates and times</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the vineyard owner may make into wine the grapes from more than one lessee at the same time, each lessee must receive only that proportion of wine which relates to their grapes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.5 </span> What will happen if any of these rules are not observed</h3>

<p>If any of these rules are not observed, the wine produced will be liable to Excise Duty.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span> Removals from wine premises</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.1 </span> Removals you must pay duty on</h3>

<p>To summarise information from previous sections of this notice, duty must generally be paid on all removals from your licensed premises for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for UK consumption (usually known as a removal to home-use)</li>
  <li>when wine is constructively removed — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#paying-duty-in-advance">paragraph 5.12</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Duty must also be paid if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the wine has been lost</li>
  <li>other irregularities are discovered</li>
  <li>you’re no longer licensed</li>
  <li>the premises in which you’re holding wine cease to be licensed premises</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.2 </span> Removals you’ll not pay duty on</h3>

<p>Provided you comply with conditions HMRC may impose, you can remove wine from your licensed premises without paying duty for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exportation, removal to the Isle of Man or shipment as stores — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#removals">sections 18</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#exports">19</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#removal-of-goods">20</a>

  <li>use as trade samples — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#duty-samples">section 14</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also remove wine without paying duty if it is for your own consumption, as long as it is produced from ingredients you’ve grown — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#domestic-consumption">section 15</a>.</p>

<p>You must record all removals in your business records.</p>

<p>Any shortage in removal or transit will be charged with duty if you cannot give us a satisfactory explanation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.3 </span> Financial guarantees</h3>

<p>You’ll need financial security to guarantee the duty on the wine for movements from Northern Ireland to an EU country.
The guarantee must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>valid throughout the UK, and in the case of Northern Ireland throughout the EU</li>
  <li>sufficient to cover the full amount of potential duty on the wine — <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Notice 197 Excise goods: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In certain circumstances, guarantees may be needed for the holding and movement of wine within the UK.
For more information on financial guarantees, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#financial-security">section 4</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.4 </span> Documents you need</h3>

<p>All intra-UK movements of wine will be submitted through the Excise Movement and Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>) unless they qualify for the simplified procedures, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#simplification-procedures">paragraph 22.2</a>.</p>

<p>An electronic administrative document (<abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr>) will have to be raised on <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> before the movement can start. <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> automatically allocates an Administrative Reference Code (<abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr>) that uniquely identifies the movement. The <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> will be on the printed copy of the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> or should be noted on the commercial document and must travel with the goods.</p>

<p>For more information on <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> procedures, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Notice 197 Excise goods: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.
In the case of movements between Northern Ireland and EU countries these will also need to be submitted through the <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If movements of wine are under simplified procedures and are as described in first bullet point of <a class="govuk-link" href="#simplification-procedures">paragraph 22.2</a>, your normal commercial despatch documents will be suitable if they have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name and address of your premises</li>
  <li>a unique reference number</li>
  <li>the name and address of the premises you’re sending the wine to</li>
  <li>the date of despatch</li>
  <li>a description of the wine, including the quantity</li>
  <li>a statement indicating that the wine is being moved in duty suspension</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve been paid, or expect to be paid, in cash for the supply of wine in duty suspension (or any service you provide for wine in duty suspension), read <a class="govuk-link" href="#telling-us-about-cash-transactions">section 27</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.3 </span> Northern Ireland — Sending duty-suspended wine to a non-registered trader or private individual in an EU country</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.4 </span> Northern Ireland — May I despatch duty-paid wine to EU countries</h3>

<p>Yes, the duty in the EU country of destination must be secured before the despatch of the goods and then paid on receipt. How this is done depends on the rules in the receiving EU country. Unless the goods are being despatched to a private individual (see paragraph 18.3), the goods must be accompanied at all times by a Simplified Accounting Administrative Document.</p>

<p>You may be able to reclaim the UK duty on the grounds that you despatch.

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span> Exports of wine</h2>
<p>For Northern Ireland exports of wine means exports to non-EU countries only.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.1 </span> Small producer exports</h3>

<p>If you export duty suspended wines you will need to establish in advance of delivery or exportation that the consignee is authorised to receive the wine.</p>

<h4>19.1.1 Small producers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland exporting wine to outside the EU</h4>

<p>If the country you are exporting to operates a small producer’s scheme for wine, the consignee may ask you to provide a certificate, endorsed by HMRC, that the wine you’re exporting is produced in the UK by a small wine producer. This is so they can establish in advance of the importation to their country that the small producer in the UK and the wine is eligible under their rules. It is your responsibility to be aware of the rules and production volume limits of the small wine producer’s scheme in the country you are exporting to, so that their requirements are met.</p>

<p>If a certificate is required, you will need to make a self-declaration of your production volumes which HMRC will certify. The following process applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>copy the certificate template shown at section 19.2 and paste or save as a Word document</li>
  <li>complete the first part of the document, then print and sign it</li>
  <li>scan the document and attach to an email</li>
  <li>send the email to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:nru.alcohol@hmrc.gov.uk">nru.alcohol@hmrc.gov.uk</a>
</li>
  <li>the Excise Processing Teams will validate by completing the ‘Certification – For Official Use’ part of the document and return it to you</li>
</ul>

<p>The process is temporary until a new print and post iform is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>You’ll need to use <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> when moving wine in duty-suspension to the place of export.</p>

<p>The following statement that wine is ‘small producer’s wine’ will be required in box 17 on the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr>:</p>

<p>‘It is hereby certified that the product described has been produced by an independent small wine producer.’</p>

<p>The annual production of alcoholic beverages of the small independent producer shall be declared in box 17n of the administrative document.</p>

<p>The above statement will let the person who removes the wine from duty-suspension to establish that the wine is small producer’s wine.</p>

<p>A movement guarantee is required for exports.</p>

<p>The receiving wine producer or cider maker must issue a receipt within 5 days of receiving the wine in their licensed or registered premises. If you do not receive a receipt, you should contact them. If you do not receive a receipt within 4 months, you’ll be liable for the duty due on the wine. If you subsequently receive a receipt, you may credit your duty account with the appropriate amount of duty.</p>

<p>When wine is delivered to home-use from the receiving winery, duty will become due. Duty must be paid by the producer who finally delivers the wine to home-use.</p>

<p>Finished or packaged wine must not be moved, without payment of duty, from one set of licensed premises to another, with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bottlers/packagers may return wine to the premises from which it was received</li>
  <li>wine may be delivered to a commercial grower, licensed as a wine producer, provided you’ve produced the wine on their behalf — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#licensed-producers">paragraph 3.3</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.2 </span> What are the new simplification procedures</h3>

<p>Simplification procedures apply to certain UK movements and allow for wine to be moved under duty suspension using commercial documentation or Customs documentation instead of <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>. These procedures are limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wine moving between UK licensed wine producers or third party packagers or excise warehouses approved to receive and store the wine — ownership of the wine must remain with the producer during the course of the movement</li>
  <li>movements for direct export only from the UK where the dispatching wine producer is authorised for <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedures">LCP</abbr> and can provide a full customs export declaration — movement guarantee details must be shown on the declaration, more information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Notice 197 Excise goods: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If movements do not meet the above criteria, then <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> will have to be used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.3 </span> What is a finished and packaged product</h3>

<p>This is any product which is canned, bottled or otherwise packaged and will not undergo any further process of production.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">23. </span> Removal of wine to an excise warehouse</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">23.1 </span> Movements of wine</h3>

<p>All intra-UK movements of wine will need to be submitted through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> unless they qualify for the simplification procedures.</p>

<p>You may remove wine, without payment of duty, to an excise warehouse (approved under section 92 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979) for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fortification</li>
  <li>export, shipment as stores or removal to the Isle of Man</li>
  <li>use in the manufacture of goods allowed to be produced in an excise warehouse</li>
  <li>bottling</li>
  <li>storage and subsequent delivery to<br> — home-use<br> — another warehouse</li>
  <li>rendering sparkling</li>
</ul>

<p>After fortifying, bottling or rendering sparkling, the wine may be returned to your winery.</p>

<p>In the case of finished and packaged products, each package must carry a satisfactory identifying mark and number. Containers must be full, and each case must hold containers of uniform size.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">23.2 </span> What documents must accompany the wine</h3>

<p>If the movement is under <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>, an <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> will have to be raised on <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> before the movement can start. <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> automatically allocates an <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> that uniquely identifies the movement. The <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> will be on the printed copy of the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> or should be noted on the commercial document and must travel with the goods.</p>

<p>If the movement is under simplified procedures and is as described in first bullet point of <a class="govuk-link" href="#simplification-procedures">paragraph 22.2</a>, your normal commercial despatch documents will be suitable if they have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the description of the wine</li>
  <li>its alcoholic strength</li>
  <li>details of the quantity contained in each package (and if appropriate, the capacity of each container)</li>
  <li>the total quantity sent</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep a copy of the despatch document, and the warehouse keeper’s receipt, for your own records. For more details on the procedures for inter-warehouse removals, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Notice 197 Excise goods: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">24. </span> Receipt of wine in licensed premises</h2>

<p>All intra-UK movements of wine will need to be submitted through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> unless they qualify for the simplification procedures.</p>

<p>On receipt of wine you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inspect the delivery vehicle to make sure it is secure and any locks and seals are intact</li>
  <li>examine containers for signs of damage</li>
  <li>check the delivery against the document accompanying the wine</li>
  <li>issue a receipt within 5 days of the wine being received — if movement under <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>, this will be a report of receipt or, if under simplified procedures, a certificate of receipt (for example, copy of delivery note) signed by an authorised person</li>
  <li>record issue of the receipt</li>
  <li>enter the quantity received into your stock records</li>
  <li>keep the accompanying document</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find a discrepancy between the wine received and the accompanying document, you must issue a receipt only for the wine you actually receive. Show the discrepancy clearly on the certificate of receipt or include an inventory of the shortage or loss in the report of receipt.</p>

<p>The wine received becomes part of your stock and is subject to the same rules as the product you produce on your licensed premises.</p>

<p>If you’re not approved as an excise warehouse, you can only receive wine in a ready for sale state if you produced it yourself, or if you’re a commercial grower who is licensed as a wine producer, and the wine in question has been produced on your behalf (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#licensed-producers">paragraph 3.3</a>).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">25. </span> Trade facility warehouses</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.1 </span> What is a trade facility warehouse</h3>

<p>A trade facility warehouse is an excise warehouse approved under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 section 92(1). You’ll need a trade facility warehouse approval, as well as your winery licence, if you want to receive and store duty free:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spirits for fortifying</li>
  <li>beer, cider or imported wine for use in the production of wine or made-wine</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC will restrict any approval as a trade facility warehouse to the specific trade need as detailed on your application. For more details on approval of premises and HMRC requirements, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Notice 196: Excise goods — registration and authorisation of warehouse keepers, approval of warehouse premises, owners of goods and registration of registered owners</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.2 </span> Physical security in a trade facility warehouse</h3>

<p>You may have to provide a secure compartment for storage of dutiable materials. The entrance door and any approved compartments must be secured in accordance with the requirements for warehousing premises — <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Notice 196: Excise goods — registration and authorisation of warehouse keepers, approval of warehouse premises, owners of goods and registration of registered owners</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.3 </span> Guarantee as security</h3>

<p>You may need to get a guarantee to have part of your winery approved as a trade facility warehouse — <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Notice 196: Excise goods — registration and authorisation of warehouse keepers, approval of warehouse premises, owners of goods and registration of registered owners</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.4 </span> How to deal with receipts into warehouse</h3>

<p>The deposit of goods in a trade facility warehouse is governed by the Excise Warehousing (Etc) Regulations 1988 (Statutory Instrument 1988/809).</p>

<p>The procedure and requirements set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#wine-received-from-other">paragraph 24.1</a> of this notice and in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods for operations in a trade facility warehouse</a> apply to the receipt of all eligible goods deposited in a trade facility warehouse.</p>

<p>You must keep a record of all receipts and usage of goods deposited in your warehouse.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.5 </span> Conditions and restrictions to operations in trade facility warehouses</h3>

<p>You must follow the general procedures set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods for operations in a trade facility warehouse</a>. We’ll tell you of any restrictions or conditions on your operations or the way you conduct them.</p>

<p>You may fortify wine in your trade facility warehouse if it has been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>produced in your winery</li>
  <li>received from another winery without payment of duty</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.6 </span> Notice of operations</h3>

<p>Unless we inform you in writing, you may start operations as soon as you’ve recorded what you intend to do in your production records.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.7 </span> Classification and duty liability of products</h3>

<h4>25.7.1 Conditions or restrictions on the fortification of wine or made-wine</h4>

<p>Fortification of wine (including UK produced wine) is governed by regulations which are administered by the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>). It may be necessary to consult <abbr title="Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> before we can approve your application.</p>

<p>You can fortify wine or made-wine with added alcohol, provided the final strength does not exceed 22% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> and the resulting product would not be classified as a spirit under the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (Combined Nomenclature).</p>

<p>If you fortify wine or made-wine to a strength above 22%, or the resulting product would fall to be treated as a spirit under the Tariff, then the product will be dutied in line with the spirits rate.</p>

<h4>25.7.2 How to tell if product would be classified as a spirit under the UK Tariff</h4>

<p>A fermented beverage, to which distilled alcohol has been added, will remain classified as such if it keeps its character. If it does not, it must be classified as a spirituous beverage.</p>

<p>In classifying, we applied the ‘3-stage’ test, which looked at whether the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fermented beverage or the added spirit accounted for more of the overall volume of the product</li>
  <li>fermented beverage or the added spirit accounted for more of the alcohol content</li>
  <li>external characteristics of the product (for example, its taste, presentation and labelling) were those of a fermented or spirituous beverage</li>
</ul>

<p>If 2 or more answers are ‘fermented beverage’, it was to be classified as such. Otherwise, it was to be classified as a spirituous beverage.</p>

<p>There will be some cases which may differ. For example, a product might derive slightly more of its volume and alcoholic strength from the fermented beverage, but taste and smell overwhelmingly like a spirituous beverage and be marketed as such. The product will be classified as a spirituous liquor.</p>

<p>Conversely, if a product tastes and smells very much like a fermented beverage, and is marketed as such, it will not matter that the added spirit might slightly predominate in terms of overall volume and alcohol content.</p>

<p>If the beverage has already been fortified, the spirituous liquor used in the fortification counts towards the total contribution of spirituous liquor.</p>

<h4>25.7.3 Taste tests</h4>

<p>We may also carry out taste tests to make a decision about the proper classification of a product. Tests are carried out by a UKAS-accredited laboratory approved by HMRC and in line with approved methods designed to give the most objective results. If we perform a test, you’ll need to provide us with samples of the product.</p>

<p>You can get information about tests and samples from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/tariff-classification-service">Tariff Classification Service</a>.</p>

<h4>25.7.4 Exceptions to taste tests</h4>

<p>We do not carry out tests if the finished product falls under the Combined Nomenclature headings 2204 or 2205, detailed in Volume 2, Part 2 of the UK Tariff.</p>

<h4>24.7.5 Getting a Binding Tariff Information (<abbr title="Binding Tariff Information">BTI</abbr>)</h4>

<p>A <abbr title="Binding Tariff Information">BTI</abbr> is a written decision on the proper tariff classification of a product. It is given by HMRC on application, provided it relates to an import or export in contemplation. The application must be made to the Tariff Classification Service on form C103 and you should also provide samples of the product.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Binding Tariff Information">BTI</abbr> is legally binding on HMRC and all customs authorities in the EU for 6 years from the date of issue (although in some circumstances it may be revoked or annulled before then). You’re under no obligation to obtain a <abbr title="Binding Tariff Information">BTI</abbr> and you should find it possible to work out for yourself how your products should be classified by reading the Tariff and consulting the guidance in this notice.</p>

<p>The tariff classification does not always govern excise duty liability and countries in the EU may apply a different rate of Excise Duty to your product.</p>

<p>For help and advice, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/tariff-classification-service">Tariff Classification Service</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.8 </span> Records</h3>

<p>In all cases you should keep records giving the full product specification, the step-by-step manufacturing process and any labelling and marketing material as well as a clear audit trail showing how you worked out the duty liability of the product.</p>

<p>This must include calculations you’ve made to decide how your product should be classified — read <a class="govuk-link" href="#classification">paragraph 24.7</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.9 </span> Additional authorisations</h3>

<p>Besides your warehouse authorisation, you’ll need to be licensed as a compounder if the products you’re manufacturing are compounded spirits — read <a class="govuk-link" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402154654/http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_PublicNoticesAndInfoSheets&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_032375" rel="external">Information Sheet — Excise Info Sheet 11 (2012) authorisation requirements for rectifiers and compounders of spirits</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.10 </span> Mixing wine or made-wine with beer</h3>

<p>You can mix wine or made-wine with beer, but only in a trade facility warehouse. If the alcoholic strength of these mixtures does not exceed 5.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>, do not contain any spirits and the predominant ingredient is beer, they will attract the beer rate of duty.</p>

<p>Mixtures exceeding 5.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> that do not contain spirits are chargeable with duty as made-wines at the rate appropriate to their strength band.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.11 </span> Accounting for duty</h3>

<p>For products classified as made-wines, duty is paid in the normal way on your EX606.</p>

<p>For those classified as beer or spirits, duty is accounted for on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-warehousing-remittance-advice-for-alcohol-goods-w5">W5 Excise warehouse — remittance advice for alcohol goods</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-warehousing-deferment-advice-for-alcohol-goods-w5d">W5D Excise warehouse — deferment advice for alcohol goods</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25.12 </span> Completing a stock return</h3>

<p>On a monthly basis, excise warehouse-keepers must submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stock returns</li>
  <li>schedules and more information we need relating to the goods</li>
</ul>

<p>The authorised warehouse-keeper (the warehouse proprietor, a partner, or if a company, a director or company secretary) must certify each return as true and complete.</p>

<p>More information on stock records and stock returns for excise warehouses can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Notice 197 Excise goods: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">26. </span> Distillation analysis: determining the strength of wine</h2>

<p>This method is referred to in <a class="govuk-link" href="#alcoholic-strength">section 9</a>.</p>

<p>If there is a dispute over strength, our officer may take samples of wine which will be analysed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taking a representative sample and, after clearing it of sediment and gas in an approved manner, a definite quantity by measure at the temperature of 20°C is made alkaline by the addition of calcium hydroxide, and then distilled</li>
  <li>making up the distillate at the temperature of 20°C with distilled water to the original measure of the quantity before distillation</li>
  <li>ascertaining the strength of the distillate by determining its density in air at the temperature of 20°C by means of an approved pycnometer used in an approved manner</li>
  <li>the strength of product is the percentage of alcohol by volume in the Laboratory Alcohol Table (a table of which a copy, signed by the Chairman of the Commissioners and identifying it as relating to the Spirits Regulations 1991, has been deposited in the office of the Queen’s Remembrancer at the Royal Courts of Justice) which corresponds to the density determined by this method — where the density falls between 2 consecutive numbers in the table, the strength will be determined by linear interpolation</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the result from this method is inaccurate because of the presence of substances other than alcohol, that method shall be adjusted, as may be approved by HMRC, to produce an accurate result.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">27. </span> Telling us about cash transactions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">27.1 </span> If you’re paid in cash for wine supply</h3>

<p>As a licensed wine producer, you must notify us if you’ve been paid, or expect to be paid, in cash for the supply of duty suspended wine which is more than £9,000 (or equivalent in other currencies).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">27.2 </span> How to tell HMRC about supply</h3>

<p>You must fill out form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-cash-payments-for-alcohol-goods-or-services-in-duty-suspension-w7">W7 Notification of cash payments</a>. For information on completion of the W7, refer to the explanatory notes on the reverse of the form.</p>

<p>Send the completed form to the fax number or email address shown on the W7.</p>

<p>If you’re paid, or expect to be paid, in 2 or more instalments, which individually are below the £9,000 notification threshold but in total will exceed this amount, you must also notify us on form W7 when the first cash payment is received.</p>

<p>Provided you’ve told us about the transaction, you do not need to wait for us to respond to receipt of the W7 before removing duty suspended wine to other licensed premises, excise warehouses or EU member states.</p>

<p>You must also tell us of any cash payments received, exceeding £9,000, for any service you provide relating to duty suspended wine, for example, storage facilities, handling charges, packaging of wine or use of an excise movement guarantee.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">28. </span> Review and appeal procedures</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.1 </span> If you disagree with our decision</h3>

<p>When we make a decision that you can appeal against, we’ll tell you and offer you a review. We’ll explain the decision and tell you what you need to do if you disagree.</p>

<p>For example with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of an assessment</li>
  <li>the issue of a civil penalty</li>
  <li>a decision specifically connected to the relevant duty</li>
</ul>

<p>Within 30 days you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send new information or arguments to the officer you’ve been dealing with</li>
  <li>have your case reviewed by a different officer</li>
  <li>have your case heard by an independent tribunal</li>
</ul>

<p>A review will be handled by a different officer from the one who made the decision. If you prefer to have an independent tribunal hear your case, write to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/first-tier-tribunal-tax">Tribunals Service</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.2 </span> Time limit in asking for a review</h3>

<p>If you want us to review a decision, you must write to the person who issued the decision letter, within 30 days of the date of that letter.</p>

<p>We’ll complete our review within 45 days, unless we agree another time with you.</p>

<p>You cannot ask the tribunal to hear your case until the 45 days (or the time we agreed with you) has expired, or we have told you the outcome of the review.</p>

<p>If you’re not satisfied with the review’s conclusion, you have 30 days to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<p>If we cannot complete our review within 45 days, or any time we agreed with you, we’ll ask you whether you’re willing to agree to an extension so that we can complete the review. If you do not agree to an extension, the review is treated as concluding that the decision being reviewed is upheld.</p>

<p>We’ll write and tell you this. You then have 30 days from the date of that letter to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.3 </span> What to include in your request for review</h3>

<p>Your request should state the full details of your case, the reasons why you disagree with us and provide supporting documentation. You should also state what result you expect from our review.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.4 </span> What if you do not want a review</h3>

<p>If you do not want a review, you may appeal to the independent tribunal. You need to send your appeal to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/first-tier-tribunal-tax">Tribunals Service</a> within 30 days of the date on the decision letter.</p>
