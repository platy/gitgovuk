<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>Nigeria is Africaâs biggest economy ($429 billion in 2020) and most populous country. Its current population (202 million WB estimate in 2020) is projected to double, reaching approximately 400 million by 2050. The potential of its markets, human capital and natural resources is enormous.</p>

<p>Nigeria has the worldâs 10th largest proven oil reserves and 9th largest proven gas reserves, large seaports connected to global trade routes, vast and underutilised agricultural land, a large population and a growing middle class. It is geographically well-placed as the economic hub for West Africa. Despite falling into recession in 2020 caused by the covid-19 pandemic an associated decline in oil prices and spikes in risk aversion in global capital markets, Nigeria remains Africaâs largest economy.</p>

<p>The IMF forecasts the medium-term rate of growth at around 2.7% (compared to a population growth of 2.6%) whereas a stronger set of economic reforms could deliver 4.0% growth in the medium term. By December 2021, inflation was recorded at 16%, the result of both food price pressures and weak monetary policies. Of particular concern to investors is the multiple exchange rate system with businesses reporting significant FX shortages.</p>

<p>The UK has a long and historic relationship with Nigeria. This creates competitive advantages for UK business including an entrepreneurial Diaspora, strong cultural links, good flight connections and minimal time difference. Though there was a rapid fall of Nigeria students in the UK in 2015/16 and 2016/17 it stabilised, then increased by 35% in 2019/21 to 7,400 Nigerian students.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1055029/nigeria-trade-and-investment-factsheet-2022-02-18.pdf" rel="external">The UK â Nigeria bilateral trade relationship</a> is worth Â£3.2bn (2020). UK imports from Nigeria are dominated by petroleum and petroleum-related products. Nigerian vulnerability to the global economic disruption caused by COVID-19 has shaped the pattern of trade in recent times. This is reflected in the top five UK exports to Nigeria in Q2 2020, which includes refined oil, toilet &amp; cleansing preparations, textile fabrics, general industrial machinery and medicinal &amp; pharmaceutical products.</p>

<p>The UK and other developed countries offer Nigeria generous unilateral market access preferences on certain goods through the WTO Generalised Scheme of Preferences. However, uptake is very low due to poor products and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) standards.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Political</h2>

<p>Nigeria operates an Executive Presidential system of government. This American-style model was first introduced in 1979, during the last period of civilian rule, and retained on the return to civilian rule in 1999. General elections held in February 1999 marked the end of 15 continuous years of military rule and the return to multiparty democracy.</p>

<p>President Muhammadu Buhari assumed office in May 2015. His election victory was the first time an incumbent president was defeated in Nigeria, and the quick and peaceful acceptance of the result was important for Nigerian and African democracy. Current government priorities include tackling corruption, improving security and strengthening the economy. These are long-term processes and although some progress has been made, significant challenges remain.</p>

<p>President Buhari secured a second term at the 2019 presidential election and a majority of the seats in the National Assembly elections were mostly won by the ruling All Progressive Congress party (APC) which holds 217 out of 360 seats at the National Assembly, 64 out of 109 seats in the Senate and 19 out of 36 state Governors (may change as serving state Governors cross from one party to another).</p>

<p>Nigerians are due to go to the polls on 25 February 2023 to elect a new President. The incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, will stand down at the end of his second term, in line with the constitution.  In addition to the Presidential election, there will also be elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Economic</h2>

<p>The Nigerian economy is characterised by extreme inequality and significant economic disparities between the North and the South, poor infrastructure, a complex and opaque regulatory environment, corruption and a fast-growing population. Oil provides the bulk of Nigeriaâs government revenue, and almost all of its foreign exchange earnings. The Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) and the Petroleum Industries Bill were passed into law in 2021 giving some clarity to the private sector. Both laws have significant possibilities of improving  the ease of doing business in Nigeria. Implementation will be imperative.</p>

<p>The economy was hard hit by COVID-19, contracting by 1.8% in 2020. In 2021, the economy rebounded growing by 2.6% largely as a result of base effects. Should Nigeriaâs oil production have improved over the past year, its economy would have benefited from increasing oil prices (Nigeriaâs bonny light crude oil was listed at $95/bbl as of January 31st 2022). The IMFâs SDR injection of $3.35 billion however has improved the countryâs foreign reserves, giving it ample support to withstand foreign exchange pressures.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the impact of the pandemic coupled with inadequate structural reforms to address underlying macroeconomic weaknesses continue to be a drag on the economy and will likely push up the unemployment rate (last reported at 33% in the Fourth Quarter of 2020). Higher inflation pushed roughly 8 million people below the poverty line between 2020 and 2021. Nigeria  has been slow to undertaken further reforms agreed with the IMF to ensure that the exchange rate reflects market fundaments, arguing that the Naira over-valuation is temporary, but also pointing to a fear of inflation and capital flight if the currency is allowed to find its market value. In January 2022 there was still a significant differential between the Investor-Exporter (IEFX window to serve as the defacto market rate N416/USD) window and the parallel market (N568/USD) with multiple windows existing.</p>

<p>Slow economic growth is of concern. Latest IMF forecasts  project that the economy is to grow by 2.7% in 2022 and is expected to grow between 2.6% and 2.7% over the 2022 to 2026 period, just barely above population growth estimates, and insufficient to create the scale of jobs required and to reduce poverty being experienced. Too few jobs are being created for the 3.5 million young Nigerians coming of working age annually, adding to the pool of under or un-employed.</p>

<p>The large oil sector partly masks weaknesses such as: a very low revenue to GDP ratio (8% of GDP), low investment (16% of GDP) and weak monetary and exchange rate framework that work against economic diversification. Inflation is currently at 16%, the result of both food price pressures and weak monetary policies. Public debt increased sharply from 29% of GDP in 2019 to 34% of GDP in 2020 and is projected to rise to around 43% in the medium term. Liquidity-based indicators, such as interest payments will continue to constitute a high share of government revenues, putting Nigeriaâs fiscal space at risk and making its low debt-to-GDP ratio highly vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks.</p>

<p>Of particular concern to investors is the multiple exchange rate system; businesses report significant FX shortages which are being met by a combination of delayed payments, use of own FX funds and purchases in the parallel market, where premiums relative to the IEFX exchange rate have risen to 37% in January 2022. In addition, there is also an estimated $2 to $3 billion backlog of requests for FX from divestment by foreign portfolio investors (FPI) of Naira assets, which are being gradually cleared by the CBN. Bureaucratic and burdensome customs procedures also add significant cost and delays to cross border trade. Energy access remains a challenge to businesses and households. Power outages are frequent, leading to widespread use of backup generators which adds significant cost to business operations.</p>

<p>With UK and international support, notable progress is being made in the upskilling of the work force, particularly in the technology and digital space. Nigeria has a growing tech and creative industry attracting a young, passionate and talented workforce.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Labour and human rights</h2>

<p>Nigeria has a democratic framework which guarantees human rights within its constitution. It has an independent judiciary and a strong civil society.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Child labour</h3>

<p>Nigeriaâs laws regarding minimum age for child labour are inconsistent: Article 59 of the Labour Act of 1974 sets the minimum age of employment at 12, and it is in force in all 36 states of Nigeria. The Act permits children of any age to do light work alongside a family member in agriculture, horticulture, or domestic service.</p>

<p>Nigeria adopted the Child Rights Act (CRA) in 2003, which incorporated the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and provided a comprehensive framework for preventing and responding to violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of children. However, this law must be ratified by each State to become law in its territory and it is not yet universal.</p>

<p>The CRA restricts children under the age of 18 from any work aside from light work for family members; however, Article 59 of the Labour Act applies these restrictions only to children under the age of 12. This language makes it unclear what minimum ages apply for certain types of work in the country. Therefore, children are vulnerable to dangerous work in industrial undertakings, underground, with machines, and in domestic service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Modern slavery</h3>

<p>Nigeria is in the top three countries of origin for modern slavery victims in the UK. The UK is supporting President Buhariâs drive to crack down on human trafficking and prevent vulnerable people from falling prey to traffickers. The Government of Nigeria adopted the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition), Enforcement and Administration Act of 2015 on March 26, 2015.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>LGBT persons</h3>

<p>In May 2013, Nigeriaâs House of Representatives voted to pass the Same-Sex Marriage Bill, which prohibits gay marriage and public displays of affection between same-sex couples and apportions up to fourteen years in prison to those engaged in same-sex relationships. It also allows punishment for those knowingly associating with members of the LGBT community or aiding these individuals in becoming married or pursuing that lifestyle. The Bill also criminalizes any association with gay identity and the promotion of lesbian and gay rights, such as gathering privately with gay people.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Rights of Association (trade unions)</h3>

<p>Nigeriaâs constitution guarantees the rights of free assembly and association and protects workersâ rights to form or belong to trade unions. Several statutory laws, nonetheless, restrict the rights of workers to associate or disassociate with labour organizations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents" rel="external">The UK Bribery Act</a>
</h3>

<p>Bribery undermines democracy and the rule of law and poses very serious threats to sustained economic progress in developing and emerging economies and to the proper operation of free markets more generally. The United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 was intended to respond to these threats and to the extremely broad range of ways that bribery can be committed. The Bribery Act applies to non-UK companies operating in the United Kingdom and to UK companies working overseas.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Bribery and corruption in Nigeria</h3>

<p>Corruption is a significant obstacle to doing business in Nigeria: companies are very likely to encounter bribery and other corrupt practices. Corruption risks are pervasive throughout all institutions but in the oil sector particularly. Corruption is criminalised primarily by the Criminal Code and the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act. Accepting or giving gifts as well as facilitation payments is illegal and individuals can be penalised with up to 7 yearsâ imprisonment. Despite a strong legal framework and the work of anti-corruption agencies in Nigeria, corruption is still an issue: in practice there is still an expectation from many that gifts, bribery and facilitation payments will be made. There has also been reports of fixing or adjusting tenders to suit specific preferred suppliers in advance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Terrorism</h2>

<p>There is a high threat from terrorism in Nigeria. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including government, security and educational institutions, international organisations as well as public venues and areas such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres, places of worship and other areas frequented by expatriates, foreign tourists and business travellers. There is also a threat of kidnapping throughout Nigeria. Kidnappings can be for financial or political gain, and can be motivated by criminality or terrorism. Westerners have been the target of kidnaps. Recent incidents have occurred in northern Nigeria and in the Delta region.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nigeria/terrorism">FCDOâs travel advice for Nigeria</a> for more information on the threat from terrorism.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Security</h2>

<p>Visitors to Nigeria should always check our latest (FCDO) safety and security advice before travelling, bearing in mind any specific threats affecting the areas of the country you intend to visit.</p>

<p>The FCDO advises against travel to several areas of the country. Before considering any travel to areas to which the FCDO advises against all or all but essential travel, you should take professional security advice. The DIT team in Nigeria can put you in touch with professional security advisors in country.</p>

<p>There is a high threat of terrorist and criminal kidnaps in Nigeria. Since 2019, there has been an increase in kidnaps for ransom by criminal gangs in Northern Nigeria.</p>

<p>The threat level of such attacks, particularly in Northern Nigeria is increasing.</p>

<p>Visitors to Nigeria are advised to follow news reports and be alert to developments that might trigger civil unrest, as violence can erupt quickly and without warning. If you are working in Nigeria, you should follow your employerâs local security guidelines. You should also regularly check FCO Travel Advice or register for email updates whilst in country.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Organised Crime</h2>

<p>As with Bribery and Corruption, organised crime is widespread in Nigeria. The main areas of organised crime activity are cyber-crime, drugs trafficking, human trafficking and kidnapping for ransom.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Intellectual property</h2>

<p>Nigeria is a signatory of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wipo.int/members/en/details.jsp?country_id=128" rel="external">World Intellectual Property Organisation</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/nigeria_e.htm" rel="external">WTO TRIPS agreement</a>. Registration of patents and trademarks are the responsibility of the Nigerian Trademark Patents and Designs Registry, part of the Commercial Law Department of the Ministry of Trade and Investment. Enforcement of intellectual property ownership remains a problem in Nigeria, despite the existence of copyright laws and enforcement efforts. British businesses looking to protect their intellectual property rights in Nigeria should seek advice from a local lawyer or IP advisor before they start selling into the Nigerian market. A list of lawyers can be provided by the DIT team in country.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Department for International Trade (DIT) contacts</h2>

<p>The team in Nigeria is based in Lagos and Abuja and although covering every sector their main focus sectors include Financial &amp; Professional Services, Technology / ICT, Infrastructure, Healthcare and Agriculture. Services include giving good and practical advice to UK companies, identifying and resolving market access barriers, commissioning reports, finding reliable agents and partners in Nigeria, holding events and arranging meetings with relevant Government officials.
