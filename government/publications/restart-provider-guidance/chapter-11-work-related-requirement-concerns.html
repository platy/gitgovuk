<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>11.1. The purpose of this chapter is to provide information and guidance where you identify that your Participant may not be able or willing to satisfy the work-related requirements that they have agreed with their Jobcentre Plus work coach.</p>

<p>11.2. This guidance will support you to identify concerns and explore them with Jobcentre Plus and your Participant. It also provides information on the possible steps to resolve these concerns, including amendments the Jobcentre Plus work coach may choose to make to work-related requirements, and how to formally notify them where a formal concern exists.</p>

<p>11.3. This chapter should be read in conjunction with Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 8A – Mandating participants to undertake activity and Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 9A – Raising a compliance doubt.</p>

<h2>Work availability and work-related requirements</h2>

<p>11.4. Participants on the Restart Scheme will be in the Intensive Work Search Regime (<abbr title="Intensive Work Search Regime">IWSR</abbr>) when referred and will have work-related requirements agreed with their Jobcentre Plus work coach, as a condition of their entitlement to claim Universal Credit.</p>

<p>11.5. These consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work availability requirements – these require Participants to be available for work and able and willing to take up paid work immediately</li>
  <li>work search requirements – these are reasonable activities Participants should be taking to look for work, for example carrying out work searches</li>
  <li>work preparation requirements – these are activities that prepare Participants for work and make it more likely that they will obtain work, for example taking part in training</li>
  <li>work focused interview requirements – these require Participants to take part in work focused interviews to improve their chances of finding work, for example to identify training opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>11.6. The above requirements will be tailored to reflect your Participant’s personal circumstances and capability, and reviewed and amended as appropriate throughout the lifetime of their claim.</p>

<p>11.7. You will be notified of your Participant’s work search, work availability and work preparation requirements when they are referred to the Restart Scheme. Further information regarding the referral process can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2A – Referral process and initial engagement.</p>

<p>11.8. Your Participant’s work search, work availability and work preparation requirements may change during their time on the Restart Scheme, for example where they move into another Universal Credit Labour Market Regime. Further information regarding Labour Market Regimes and their associated work availability and work-related requirements can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 5A – Ongoing interventions.</p>

<h2>Concerns about a Participant’s work-related requirements</h2>

<p>11.9. It falls to the Jobcentre Plus work coach to establish and make the decision that a formal doubt exists regarding a Participant’s work-related requirements.</p>

<p>11.10. However, you may have a concern regarding your Participant satisfying their work-related requirements during your engagement or attempts to engage with them. This may be where there has been a change in your Participant’s circumstances which mean their work-related requirements are no longer reasonable or achievable, or where they seem unwilling to participate in the scheme without satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>11.11. Universal Credit claimants must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of all change of circumstances as part of their conditions to claim benefit. Where you identify that your Participant potentially has a change of circumstance which may affect their ability to satisfy their work availability or work-related requirements, you should advise them to notify their Jobcentre Plus work coach by updating their journal so that their Claimant Commitment can be reviewed.</p>

<p>11.12. You may also wish to initiate a two-way conversation with the Jobcentre Plus work coach to discuss concerns and resolve between you.</p>

<p>11.13. It may also be appropriate to involve your Participant in the discussion with the Jobcentre Plus work coach, via a three-way conversation. This may be to review their circumstances and discuss any changes to their participation on the Restart Scheme, or to remind them of their requirements to participate where they are not demonstrating this. Further information regarding how to arrange a three-way conversation can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2A – Referral process and initial engagement.</p>

<p>11.14. During these conversations the Jobcentre Plus work coach may feel a formal doubt may exist regarding your Participant’s work-related requirements and they may ask you to notify them of your concerns in writing, for further consideration. This notification is done by the Work-related requirements doubt process.</p>

<p>11.15. It is not a requirement to hold a two-way or three-way conversation prior to raising a Work-related requirements doubt and you may notify the Jobcentre Plus work coach via the doubt process without prior contact. However, you are strongly encouraged to make use of these first, as the discussion with the Jobcentre Plus work coach and your Participant may address your concerns and negate the need to raise a formal notification.</p>

<h2>Work-related requirements doubt process</h2>

<p>11.16. You can formally notify the Jobcentre Plus work coach of your concerns by completing a UCD602 ‘Work availability and work-related requirements doubt’ form.</p>

<p>11.17. The UCD602 form will provide the Jobcentre Plus work coach with information to understand and consider your concern.</p>

<p>11.18. When completing the UCD602 form, it is important that you only provide specific and factual information as it may be shared with your Participant during the consideration process. You must not include any opinions or information which cannot be supported by evidence on your internal systems.</p>

<p>11.19. Once completed you must send the completed UCD602 form to the District Restart Triage inbox by unencrypted email and include only the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> reference number in the e-mail subject box. i.e. Subject: <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> 1a. You will have been notified of the email addresses for these inboxes during implementation activity</p>

<p>11.20. During the decision-making process the Universal Credit Decision Maker may contact you for clarification on the participation or activities of your Participant. You should respond to this request as quickly as possible to support the decision-making process and prevent any unnecessary loss or delay to the Participant’s Universal Credit payments.</p>

<p>11.21. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will monitor the doubt on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> systems and notify you of the outcome of the doubt to inform your ongoing support offer.</p>

<p>11.22. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will also advise you where your notification does not progress to a doubt being raised including the reasoning, for example where your Participant has had a change in circumstance.</p>

<p>11.23. You must continue to engage with your Participant and provide support alongside this process, where you choose to use it.</p>
