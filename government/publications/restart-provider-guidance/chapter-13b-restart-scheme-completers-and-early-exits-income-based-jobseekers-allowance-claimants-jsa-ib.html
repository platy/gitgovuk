<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>13.01. This chapter sets out the steps that you and Jobcentre Plus will take to ensure that all Restart Scheme Participants exit the scheme at the appropriate stage in their journey by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completing their allotted time</li>
  <li>Achieving an employed or self-employed Job Outcome</li>
  <li>Deemed to be an “Early Exit” due to a change of your Participants personal circumstances</li>
</ul>

<p>13.02. A Participant is deemed as completing the Restart Scheme (a Completer) in either of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant reaches end of allotted time having not achieved an employed or self-employed Job Outcome</li>
  <li>Participant achieves employed or self-employed Job Outcome</li>
</ul>

<h2>Restart Scheme completers where Participant reaches end of allotted time (365 calendar days) without having achieved an employed / self-employed job outcome</h2>

<p>13.03. Your Participant will have completed their time on the scheme where they have reached the end of their allotted time and have not achieved either an employed or self-employed Job Outcome. For further information on relating to employed or self-employed Job Outcome validation requirements. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17 – Funding Model and Claim Process.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>13.04. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Provider Referral and Payment System (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) will automatically calculate the end date for your Restart Participant for 365 calendar days based on the start date you input following the initial meeting. The line will automatically close and therefore become an exit on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> on day 366.</p>

<p>13.05. You will be responsible for recording and updating any of your internal systems as appropriate.</p>

<h2>Restart Scheme completers where Participant achieves an Employed Job Outcome</h2>

<p>13.06. Your Participant will have completed their time on the Restart Scheme where they have achieved the earnings threshold applied to an Employed Job Outcome.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your Participant meets or exceeds the pre-set earnings threshold as outlined in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17 – Funding Model and Claim Process</li>
  <li>The Employed Job Outcome payment is generated and made to you the provider via&nbsp;<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>&nbsp;automatically generates your Participants exit reason and end date</li>
</ul>

<h2>Restart Scheme Completers where Participant achieves a Self Employed Job Outcome</h2>

<p>13.07. Your Participant will have completed their time on the Restart Scheme where they have achieved the durational threshold applied to a Self-Employed Job Outcome.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your Participant achieves 6 months of Self-Employment</li>
  <li>You submit Self-Employment Job Outcome claim on&nbsp;<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Self-Employment Job Outcome payment is generated via&nbsp;<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Self-Employment Job Outcome payment generates your Participants exit reason and date on&nbsp;<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p>13.08. You will be notified via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> where your Participant has achieved the earnings threshold applied to the employed Job Outcome or the durational threshold applicable to the self-employed Job Outcome. The provision line will automatically close in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> when the final outcome payment has been made to you the provider via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>13.09. You will only be responsible for recording and updating any appropriate tracking activity you undertake on your internal systems as required.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: There is no requirement for you to deliver any support to your Participant beyond their allotted time on the Restart Scheme. However, regular contact with your Participant throughout the contracted tracking period could enable timely, tailored and beneficial intervention e.g. where your Participant may be at risk of falling out of employment.</p>
</div>

<p>See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17 – Funding Model and Claim Process for further detailed guidance relating to Participant tracking periods and potential outcome validations.</p>

<h2>Early Exits due to Change of Circumstances</h2>

<p>13.10. There is no responsibility for you to action any change of circumstance notified directly by your Participant, however, you should encourage your Participant to use the <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> Helpline or inform their reporting Jobcentre Plus in writing, of any change of circumstance which may impact their entitlement to benefit.</p>

<p>13.11. You are required to take appropriate&nbsp;<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>&nbsp;activity should you receive a CEPD1 from Jobcentre Plus relating to your Participant prior to their 365 days allotted time on the Restart Scheme being achieved due to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your Participant is deceased</li>
  <li>your Participant moves outside England / Wales for period equal to or longer than remainder of allotted time</li>
  <li>your Participant is in prison for period equal to or longer than remainder of allotted time</li>
  <li>your Participant has terminal illness and chooses to leave the Restart programme</li>
</ul>

<p>13.12. The Restart Scheme should be delivered as prescribed until such time that Jobcentre Plus advises you that your Participants change of circumstance has been notified, accepted and any subsequent conditionality impact has been updated.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>13.13. You must only action the exit on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> upon receipt of a CEPD1 from Jobcentre Plus. The form must clearly state one of the early exit reasons listed above. Should it fail to do so, contact your Single Point of Contact (<abbr title="Single point of contact">SPOC</abbr>) in Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>Please note a <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> 14 is not necessary for early exits. You will be responsible for manual input to <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> of any notified change of your Participant’s circumstance as follows:</p>

<h2>Participant is Deceased</h2>

<p>13.14. You are required to take appropriate <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> activity should you receive a CEPD1 from Jobcentre Plus relating to this change of circumstance as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should input the outcome ‘Deceased’ using Leaver Code 43 with the exit date as date of death (It is not input automatically or by Jobcentre Plus)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Participant moves outside England / Wales for period equal to or longer than remainder of allotted time on the Restart Scheme</h2>

<p>13.15. You are required to take appropriate <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> activity should you receive a CEPD1 from Jobcentre Plus relating to this change of circumstance as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should input the outcome ‘Exceptional Circumstances’ using Leaver Code 46 with the exit date as leaving England/Wales (It is not input automatically or by Jobcentre Plus)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Participant is in prison for a period equal to or longer than the remainder of their allotted time on the Restart Scheme</h2>

<p>13.16. You are required to take appropriate <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> activity should you receive a CEDP1 from Jobcentre Plus relating to this change of circumstance as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should input the outcome ‘Exceptional Circumstances’ using Leaver Code 46 with the exit date as date of imprisonment (It is not input automatically or by Jobcentre Plus)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Participant has a terminal illness and chooses to leave the Restart Scheme</h2>

<p>13.17. You are required to take appropriate <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> activity should you receive a CEPD1 change of circumstance from Jobcentre Plus detailing your Participants decision to exit the Restart programme as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should input the outcome ‘Exceptional Circumstances’ using Leaver Code 46 with the exit date as date of decision to exit made by your Participant (It is not input automatically or by Jobcentre Plus)</li>
</ul>
