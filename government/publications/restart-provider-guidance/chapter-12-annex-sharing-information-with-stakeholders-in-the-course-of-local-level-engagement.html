<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>1. Two-way sharing of information and insight between stakeholders and providers can help to align provision, facilitate joint working and avoid duplication of effort.</p>

<p>2. The Department recognises that it will often be useful for providers to share their own service delivery information. The Department supports such sharing of information and insights where it can contribute to Participants being able to benefit from better, more joined up services, maximising their chances of achieving a job outcome.</p>

<p>3. Providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Must not share Departmental performance data</li>
  <li>Should only share their own management information and insights</li>
  <li>Should be clear that any information shared is not accredited by the Department; and,</li>
  <li>Should avoid using written products and absolute numbers where unnecessary</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>4. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-12-stakeholder-and-employer-engagement">Chapter 12, Stakeholder and Employer Engagement</a> sets out guidance regarding the contractual requirements to deliver a locally tailored service, and to engage with relevant stakeholders in local areas within <abbr title="Contract Package Areas">CPAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>5. This annex to Chapter 12 sets out guidance from the Department on how to respond to stakeholder requests for service delivery information. It suggests some examples of information that providers may collect which could be useful to share, and gives guidance on the appropriate caveats.</p>

<p>6. This guidance does not apply to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> performance information, including numbers of referrals, numbers of starts, number of job outcomes and Customer Satisfaction Survey results. Providers must not share <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> performance information.</p>

<p>7. This guidance does not alter or concern the areas of the contract which cover data sharing: Clause F7 from the Consolidated Full T&amp;Cs; Schedule 8; and, Schedule 11.</p>

<p>8. This guidance does not alter or concern the guidance set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-20-data-sharing-between-dwp-and-providers" rel="external">Chapter 20 of the provider guidance, Data Sharing</a>.</p>

<p>9. This guidance does not pertain to the sharing of Participants’ personal data or sensitive personal data.</p>

<h2>Prospective information/insights</h2>

<p>10. The table below provides a non-exhaustive illustrative list of different types of information and insights that it may be useful to share and discuss with stakeholders. It is not an instruction or requirement to capture the information listed.</p>

<p>11. The Department expects that providers will seek to review the information they capture and share over time as more Participants are supported.</p>

<p>12. Effective conversations with stakeholders will involve a two-way sharing of information and insight, with stakeholders sharing their own insights which may support the Restart Scheme service delivery. Providers may wish to consider what sort of information they might find useful to receive from stakeholders, including making use of the insights of Jobcentre Plus (<abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>) Group Partnership Managers.</p>

<p>13. Stakeholders have indicated that, from their perspective, information will be most useful when broken down to Local Authority level.</p>

<h2>Sharing format, guidance and restrictions</h2>

<p>14. The Department’s intention is for stakeholder engagement to focus on working together to align services and maximise job outcomes for Participants. Information and insight should be shared to this end, rather than reporting against targets or via other means that would imply a performance management consideration.</p>

<p>15. In line with this approach, where the objective can be met via oral information sharing – particularly with respect to more sensitive topics such as anonymised participant characteristics or barriers faced – this would be preferred. Where the objectives of the conversation can be achieved without using absolute numbers (for example, replacing with percentages), this would be preferred. We acknowledge that absolute numbers would sometimes be required (for example, in ascertaining how many referrals to a particular service are planned, or in ascertaining the extent of the need).</p>

<p>16. Sharing the information is at providers’ discretion. In considering whether or not to share, providers are encouraged to consider requests with an open mind, and make decisions based on whether they consider that sharing the information and insights would genuinely improve joint working and local tailoring and therefore improve outcomes for Participants.</p>

<p>17. Providers would need to be clear that the information is their own, and therefore not accredited or sponsored by the Department in any way. Providers would be responsible for any and all sharing agreements or infrastructure required to share the information.</p>

<p>18. Any written information/presentations shared with local stakeholders containing providers’ service delivery information should also be copied to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager.</p>

<h2>Information sharing queries</h2>

<p>19. Should providers wish to share information and feel unclear on whether or not this would be acceptable to the Department, providers should contact their Performance Managers in the first instance, who will endeavour to provide clarity as soon as practicable.</p>
