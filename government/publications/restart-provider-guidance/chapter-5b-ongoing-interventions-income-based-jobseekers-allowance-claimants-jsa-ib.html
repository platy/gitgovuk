<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>5.01. This chapter sets out your role and responsibilities following the Initial Meeting and Early Intervention stages. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapters 3 – Initial Meeting and Start and Chapter 4B – Early Interventions. You will need to work in collaboration with your Participants and other stakeholders to maximise your provision of ongoing support to your Participants until they have reached 365 days of support (from the Participant’s Start Date on the Restart Scheme), or until they have achieved an employed or self-employed outcome, or they have become an early completer.</p>

<h2>Meetings</h2>

<p>5.02. Regular meetings, which started with the Initial Meeting and continued through your early intervention activities with your Participant, must continue throughout their time on the Restart Scheme. Through these regular engagement meetings, you should endeavour to develop a positive relationship with your Participant to enhance their engagement and commitment throughout their time on the Restart Scheme. You must have regular engagement meetings that you undertake at least fortnightly, with a Face to Face Meeting (in person) no less frequently than every 4 weeks. All meeting contact with your Participant should be meaningful and provide opportunity to progress your Participant towards achieving their agreed goals. Basic communication - e.g. via a text message(s) - will not constitute a meeting.</p>

<p>5.03. Any additional engagement outside of these specified meetings may use a range of methods, including digital communications to support and develop the skills of your Participant, and to work towards goals identified during the development of the diagnostic assessment and action plan.</p>

<p>5.04. During your contact with your Participant you must address any identified sources of concern or employment barriers and discuss and agree with your Participant how these will be approached and remedied. You must ensure that this information is included in the updates to the action plan and this information is used to inform the diagnostic assessment reviews as your Participant progresses through the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>5.05. During your Participant’s time on the Restart Scheme, there may be exceptional circumstances where you identify that a three-way conversation between you, your Participant, and the Jobcentre Plus work coach would be appropriate. This may be helpful, for example, when a Participant is experiencing domestic violence so that you can jointly identify additional support to enable your Participant to make informed decisions, which will then contribute to their engagement and your support requirements. Three-way conversations can be requested by any party, at any point, during a Participant’s time on the Restart Scheme. You should liaise with the Jobcentre Plus work coach to arrange a mutually agreeable date and time. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2B – Referral Process and Initial Engagement.</p>

<p>5.06. You are responsible for ensuring that you are able to evidence all fortnightly and 4 weekly interventions, along with any other intervention meetings with your Participant that you deem necessary. The type of evidence may include but is not limited to: signed attendance registers and electronic confirmation or receipt from your Participant. You should also ensure that your internal systems are updated to show the details of the interventions that take place and that any reason for non-attendance is also recorded.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: You must have digital solutions in place for circumstances whereby Face to Face meetings in person are unable to take place e.g. COVID-19, Local Restrictions. The requirement to adopt this digital solution will be advised by or made in consultation with DWP.</p>
</div>

<h2>Tailored Support</h2>

<p>5.07. You must endeavour to work in consultation with your Participants to deliver personalised support, tailored to meet the needs of each of your Participants, to help them to obtain and secure sustainable employment or self-employment during their time on the Restart Scheme. This should include job vacancy identification, job applications and ad-hoc support and advice throughout the Restart Scheme.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: Once a Participant has started they will remain on the Restart Scheme for 365 calendar days, unless they satisfy one of the early completer criteria.</p>

<p>You should continue to deliver the full Restart Scheme support offer according to your contract, for the full time that the participant is on Restart, unless you have been notified by the Jobcentre Work Coach via CEPD1 that there should be no contact for a limited period of time.</p>

<p>Any adjustments to the offer for individual Participants must only be considered and applied as a result of information and advice received within a change of circumstances notification.</p>

<p>Where there has been a change of circumstances affecting your Participant, their ongoing engagement with your Restart Scheme support offer may be mandatory or voluntary, depending on the labour market regime that your Participant is subject to. You will be advised of any such changes by your Jobcentre Plus work coach via a CEPD1 Where no contact is to be made or a Participant who is classed as voluntary does not attend or avail themselves to the support offer, then you should record this. This evidence should be recorded to provide an audit trail which can be reflected within the PCO checks.</p>
</div>

<p>5.08. As part of their claim to benefit, Participants who are in receipt of Income-based Jobseekers Allowance (<abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr>) will have agreed to work search and work availability requirements with their Jobcentre Plus work coach. In consultation with your Participant you should tailor any support to compliment these requirements taking into account any information received through <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>, the warm handover or change of circumstances notifications.</p>

<p>5.09. During your Participant’s time on the Restart Scheme there may be instances where issues or events prevent your Participant from reasonably complying with their benefit conditionality, including participation on the Restart Scheme. <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> Regulations enable Jobcentre Plus work coaches, in particular circumstances, to tailor a Participant’s Claimant’s Commitment or put easements in place.</p>

<p>5.10. When working with your Participant you should tailor any interventions based on your knowledge of local labour market needs, utilising opportunities from local employment growth and training initiatives. Where appropriate you will need to tailor activities, to take into account your Participant’s ability, and capability in terms of the type and location of work sought. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 12 – Stakeholder and Employer Engagement.</p>

<p>5.11. You should provide a wide range of support in order to address barriers to employment. If you identify at any point that your Participant wishes to pursue self-employment, you will need to deliver an appropriate support package to help them achieve this. You should encourage your Participant to update their Jobcentre Plus work coach with this information at their fortnightly work search review.</p>

<p>5.12. Where there is a requirement for a Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>) check for your Participant as part of any agreed activity then you are responsible for the associated costs. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 6 – Expenses.</p>

<p>5.13. Throughout your Participant’s time spent on the Restart Scheme, you must ensure that your Participant is aware of and clearly understands any potential implications, of any paid employment and self-employment on benefits that they may be in receipt of. You should also support and encourage your Participant to utilise the independent benefits calculators via gov.uk so that your Participant can make an informed decision and understand the effect of any earnings if they start work. Where your Participant informs you of their intention to commence paid employment or self-employment you must ensure they are made aware of any potential or actual implications on any benefits they are receiving and encourage your Participant to update their Universal Credit journal with any changes. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17 – Funding Model and Claim Process.</p>

<p>5.14. Where a Participant is successful in gaining employment, but the hours worked do not result in the Participant signing off <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr>, then you will need to continue to deliver the full Restart Scheme support offer as set out in your contract, working with your Participant until their completion of the Restart Scheme or a job outcome is achieved. Participation remains mandatory until you receive a notification to say that the Participant is no longer in receipt of <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr>.</p>

<p>5.15. You will receive a change of circumstances notification from the Jobcentre Plus work coach and whilst the Participant remains entitled to the full Restart Scheme support offer, their continued participation will become voluntary. You will need to review the “Reporting on Employment Earnings Notifications from UCRTE” report to monitor the Participant’s earnings and any variations so that you can tailor your support appropriately and consider any actions required pending achievement of a job outcome. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 7B – Change of Circumstances, Chapter 17 – Funding Model and Claim Process and Chapter 18 – Validation.</p>

<p>5.16. At the point when your Participant’s engagement becomes voluntary, you should discuss with your Participant any in work support you are going to offer to enable the achievement of sustained employment. Remember, the Participant remains on the Restart Scheme for 365 days from the start date or until they have achieved an outcome (or are an early completer). See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 13B – Restart Scheme Completers and Early Exits.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>5.17. When your Participant attends a meeting with you, they should not be expected to travel by public transport for more than 90 minutes from their home address to your premises. For some Participant’s travel time may be below 90 minutes as agreed by the Jobcentre Plus work coach, where this applies, you will be informed as part of the referral or by a change of circumstances notification and you will be expected to make reasonable adjustments to meet your Participant at a location that will reflect the modified travel time.</p>

<p>5.18. You should not expect your Participant to conduct a work search, or take up paid employment, in any location which would result in your Participant being expected to travel for more than 90 minutes or modified travel time, by public transport from or to their home address. However, your Participant may choose to consider a wider geographical or travel to work area which would extend this travel time.</p>

<h2>Expenses</h2>

<p>5.19. You are responsible for funding your Participant’s travel costs to attend the Restart Scheme. For further information on travel expenses, childcare and caring responsibilities. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 6 - Expenses.</p>

<h2>Action Plan</h2>

<p>5.20. You will have agreed the action plan with your Participant during your early intervention activity. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 4B – Early Interventions. You must review the action plan with your Participant, taking into account the most recent diagnostic assessment, no less frequently than every 4 weeks. The reviewed action plan must continue to reflect sequential steps and activities carried out by both you and your Participant. The updated action plan must include progress to date to reach one or more goals, with the ultimate aim of securing sustained employment for your Participant.</p>

<p>5.21. During the discussions between yourself and your Participant, progress made against the current action plan should be reviewed, evidence of the activities undertaken and actions completed by your Participant since the action plan was put in place or last reviewed should be recorded.</p>

<p>5.22. During the review of the action plan in consultation with your Participant you may wish to consider the following methods of support if not already included, this is not an exhaustive list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing the Participant with job search skills and career guidance</li>
  <li>providing the Participant with job interview experience</li>
  <li>helping Participants overcome non-work based barriers, for example skills gaps, to support focus on moving towards employment</li>
  <li>providing the Participant with work-related skills, for example use of <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>addressing social and personal barriers to work such as housing issues, addiction problems, debt and/or long-term unemployment</li>
  <li>ensuring that any identified activity is broken down into manageable segments</li>
</ul>

<p>5.23. At the end of each review of the action plan and before sign off, having taken into account your Participant’s comments and input, ensure that they are clear on what they are required to do, why they are being asked to do it, what evidence is required to demonstrate completion and when it must be completed by. You must also take into account any complex needs your Participant may have, any additional support requirements, and make any reasonable adjustments accordingly.</p>

<p>5.24. You must continue to reflect in the action plan any advanced support issues or concerns that are identified by, or communicated to you by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or third parties. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 21 – Participants with Complex Needs Who May Require Advanced Support.</p>

<p>5.25. You are required to issue a copy of the updated action plan once it has been agreed and signed off by both you and your Participant and record the date of issue. Where Participants cannot sign the action plan reasons for this must be recorded. You must retain the action plan throughout your Participant’s time on the Restart Scheme and for the duration of the contract for audit and compliance purposes.</p>

<p>5.26. You must always use the latest version of the action plan to inform your review and update of the diagnostic assessment with your Participant.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: The action plan attracts performance and compliance checks and is subject to Customer Service Standards (CSS) 3 and 7. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 14 – Performance Management.</p>
</div>

<h2>Diagnostic Assessment</h2>

<p>5.27. You will have undertaken a diagnostic assessment with your Participant as part of your early intervention activity. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 4B – Early Interventions. You must review the diagnostic assessment no less frequently than every 4 months with the Participant.</p>

<p>5.28. The review of the diagnostic assessment must take into account the activities and actions completed by your Participant, as outlined in the action plan, along with any identified changes to the labour market and your Participant’s personal circumstances which may affect the actions and activities to be carried forward following the revised assessment.</p>

<p>5.29. During the review of the diagnostic assessment with your Participant, you must review the level of your Participant’s current skills and identify any additional barriers to employment that may have arisen since the last review of the diagnostic assessment. In doing this you may want to consider the following (this is not an exhaustive list):</p>

<ul>
  <li>employment sector changes</li>
  <li>identification of transferrable skills</li>
  <li>labour market barriers, including lack of skills</li>
  <li>personal wellbeing, health conditions and disabilities</li>
  <li>personal barriers, including housing issues</li>
  <li>financial barriers, including personal debt</li>
  <li>work-related independence skills e.g. understanding and use of public transport</li>
</ul>

<p>5.30. The reviewed diagnostic assessment will help identify additional support activities, which will inform the review and update of your Participant’s individual action plan. These may include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting the Participant to identify transferrable skills</li>
  <li>methodology to identify alternative employment options</li>
  <li>providing the Participant with job search skills and career guidance</li>
  <li>providing the Participant with job interview experience</li>
  <li>helping Participants overcome non-work based barriers, for example skills gaps, to support focus on moving towards employment</li>
  <li>providing the Participant with work-related skills, for example use of <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>addressing any new social and personal barriers to work such as housing issues</li>
  <li>addiction problems, debt and/or long-term unemployment</li>
  <li>identifying and addressing any new sources of concern and barriers for each Participant as they progress towards employment or self-employment</li>
  <li>delivering any personalised tailored support to meet the needs of each Participant to help them move into work</li>
  <li>identifying any internal/external resources available which will support the Participant to achieve any agreed goals</li>
</ul>

<p>5.31. You must continue to reflect in the diagnostic assessment any advanced support issues or concerns that are identified by, or communicated to you by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or third parties. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 21 – Participants with Complex Needs Who May Require Advanced Support.</p>

<p>5.32. At the end of each review of the diagnostic assessment you should ensure that you continue to take into account any complex needs and/or additional support requirements. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 21 – Participants with Complex Needs Who May Require Advanced Support.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: The diagnostic assessment attracts performance and compliance checks and is subject to CSS 2 and 6. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 14 – Performance Management.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ensuring Participants Are Not Exploited by Employers</h2>

<p>5.33. Whilst delivering the Restart Scheme you are responsible for ensuring that your Participants are not exploited, and that any work or training activity that you arrange with an employer does not contravene the National Minimum Wage Act.</p>

<p>5.34. When arranging work experience or other periods of attachment to an employer you must ensure that the opportunity on offer is genuine, and that the placement does not fulfil a role which would otherwise be advertised as vacant.</p>

<p>5.35. Once your Participant is participating in the activity you are responsible for monitoring their progress and in doing so you will have the opportunity to assure yourself that they are not being exploited.</p>

<p>5.36. In the event that a position becomes vacant and you find that a Participant you would have expected to be offered work is rejected, you should look carefully at the feedback received from the employer. If the employer gives you specific evidence of their unsuitability, there is no problem with continuing to utilise the placement. If the feedback is vague and evasive, or indicates any form of discrimination you should consider whether you should continue to use this employer. You must have systems in place to identify any patterns in the employer’s handling of your Participants to prevent exploitation.</p>

<h2>Unsuitable Types of Activity</h2>

<p>5.37. Participants must not be helped to engage in activities, including starting businesses which could put them at risk or bring <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or you as a Provider into disrepute. It would be difficult to produce an exhaustive list of unsuitable activities and some common sense is required on your part. However, participants subjected to Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (<abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr>) restrictions must not be helped into activities that breach these. If you are in doubt, or unsure regarding the suitability of an activity then you should discuss this with your Employment Account Division Performance Manager and they will seek further advice where appropriate.</p>

<p>5.38. You should also take into account your Participant’s personal beliefs when identifying job or training opportunities, for example, some individuals may have personal beliefs about working within certain types of employment, such as the food industry, and you should be sensitive to these.</p>

<h2>Mandation</h2>

<p>5.39. Where a Participant is not engaging with the Restart Scheme and there are no challenges or support needs which are preventing this, you may need to consider mandating your Participant where they are reluctant to fully engage with the Restart Scheme. This must only be utilised where you are satisfied that the requirements are met as detailed in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 11B - Work Availability and Work Doubt Requirements.</p>

<p>5.40. Mandation may be considered when setting activities which support your Participant to prepare for or move into work, including attending meetings with their Restart Scheme adviser.</p>

<p>5.41. There are certain activities you must undertake when mandating a Participant to undertake activity to ensure they are fully aware of the requirement and satisfy legal and policy requirements. These activities must be undertaken every time a Participant is mandated to undertake an activity, and are outlined in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 8B – Mandating Participants to Undertake Activity.</p>

<h2>Potential Work Search and Work Availability Doubts</h2>

<p>5.42. As part of the requirements to claim <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr>, Participants have agreed to work search and work availability requirements with their Jobcentre Plus work coach. You may establish a concern that they may not be satisfying these requirements during engagement with your Participant and you can contact their Jobcentre Plus work coach who will consider further. This may initially be done using a two-way conversation with the Jobcentre Plus work coach, or a three-way conversation where it is beneficial to include your Participant.</p>

<p>5.43. Where you and the Jobcentre Plus work coach agree a concern exists, they will advise you to notify them in writing. This notification is done by completing a JSA602 work availability doubt form and sending to the Participant’s Jobcentre Plus work coach using the referral details from <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Restart Scheme Completers</h2>

<p>5.44. At the end of the Restart Scheme, if your Participant has been unsuccessful in gaining employment they will revert wholly back to Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>5.45. The updated final action plan should be issued to Participants who have completed their allotted time on the Restart Scheme. This will be a key tool to determine the most appropriate support required for your Participant returning to Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>5.46. The final action plan should be completed and updated following your Participant’s final scheduled review where appropriate, i.e. prior to their natural end date of their allotted time. The final action plan will outline all individual activities agreed and those completed between you and your Participant during their time on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>5.47. You are not required to issue a copy of the final action plan to the Jobcentre Plus work coach, however, you must encourage your Participant to share the final action plan with the Jobcentre Plus work coach as part of your Restart Scheme completers post exit discussion.</p>

<h2>Customer Satisfaction Measure</h2>

<p>5.48. During the lifetime of the Restart Scheme there will be a regular customer satisfaction survey, the results of which will support the continuous improvement and identification of best practice.</p>

<p>5.49. The survey will be completed independently on a quarterly basis. A random sample of Participants will be chosen to take part in the survey.</p>

<p>5.50. You are not required to take any specific action regarding the operation of the survey. However, you might wish to discuss with Participants that they may be contacted by a third party, in relation to this survey, in order to encourage their participation. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 16 – Customer Satisfaction Measure.</p>

<h2>Additional provision and compatibility with the Restart Scheme</h2>

<p>5.51. The aim of the Restart Scheme is to provide Participants with individualised support, tailored specifically to them, improving their employability skills and moving them towards sustained employment. It is the Provider’s responsibility to determine the specific needs of the Participant, putting in place the support required to meet those needs.</p>

<p>5.52. For the majority of Participants this will be achieved through the Provider’s Restart Scheme offer; in some instances, however, it may be appropriate for additional support, outside of the Restart Scheme offer to be sourced for a Participant where a particular need has been identified.</p>

<p>5.53. There is a wide range of provision available to claimants, both nationally and locally to help them obtain the skills and experience they need to get work, more work or better paid work. This provision can be organised into 3 main types of support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Contracted Provision: A Participant on the Restart Scheme cannot be referred to any additional <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Contracted Employment Provision. This excludes Access to Work or Reducing Parental Conflict as support may be available whilst participating on the Restart Scheme.</li>
  <li>Additional Provision delivered as part of Jobcentre Plus Offer: A Participant on the Restart Scheme cannot usually be referred to provision that is delivered as part of Jobcentre Plus offer. This includes SWAPS which are not compatible with the Restart Scheme.</li>
  <li>Non <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Contracted Provision: Provision offered by Local Authorities, Charities the Private sector etc. (this list is not exhaustive) may be compatible with the Restart Scheme. It is the responsibility of the Provider to check the eligibility and suitability criteria of the specific provision or support being considered.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.54. Where an individual has support needs which are above and beyond those that will be addressed by the Restart Scheme, additional provision maybe considered. The decision to refer a Restart Participant to an additional provision should be done in consultation with the Participant; it must be deemed to be in their best interests and not in any way affect their ability to participate fully in the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>5.55. It is advised that Providers discuss this with the Participant’s work coach and a two or three way conversation is recommended at this stage. Providers should also be aware that it is their responsibility to ensure suitability and eligibility checks are made and it would be in their best interests to maintain documentation relating to the additional support being offered outside of the Provider Restart Scheme offer.</p>

<p>5.56. Other types of training/ work experience: To be compatible with the Restart Scheme these must not be official Sector-based Work Academy Programme (<abbr title="Sector-based Work Academy Programme">SWAPs</abbr>) opportunities that are part of the Chancellor’s ‘Plan for Jobs’.</p>

<p>A work experience opportunity subsidised or funded by a Provider, or through an arrangement the Provider has with an employer/ training partner (outside of the official <abbr title="Sector-based Work Academy Programme">SWAPs</abbr> initiative) would be compatible with the Restart Scheme and could be considered for a Restart Scheme participant.</p>

<p>Providers should however be aware that any earnings attached to a work experience opportunity would be ineligible earnings and would not count towards the ‘job outcome payment’. Please see the Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17 – Funding Model and Claim Process Paragraph 17.40 Ineligible Income for further information.</p>

<p>5.57. European Social Funded Provision (<abbr title="European Social Funded Provision">ESF</abbr>): Individuals receiving Restart Scheme support can also receive <abbr title="European Social Funded Provision">ESF</abbr> funded support where the individual has support needs which are above and beyond those that will be addressed by the Restart Scheme. <abbr title="European Social Funded Provision">ESF</abbr> funded support cannot replicate the support provided by the Restart Scheme Provider but can be used to fund that additional support.</p>

<p>The additional <abbr title="European Social Funded Provision">ESF</abbr> support package must be agreed between the <abbr title="European Social Funded Provision">ESF</abbr> project and the Restart Scheme Provider and documented. The document must set out clearly the specific support needs that will be addressed by the Restart Scheme Provider and the support needs that will be addressed through <abbr title="European Social Funded Provision">ESF</abbr> provision. The document must demonstrate that those support needs are in addition to those provided by the Restart Scheme.</p>
