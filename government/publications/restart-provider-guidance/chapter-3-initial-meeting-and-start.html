<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This chapter covers the things you need to do at your first meeting with your Participant (the “Initial Meeting”). You will introduce your Participant to the support you will offer during their time on the Restart Scheme. Following the Initial Meeting, you will record the start on the Provider Referral and Payment System (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Planning the Initial Meeting</h2>

<p>3.01. The initial meeting is the first Face to Face meeting between you and your Participant. It should take place, in person, at the earliest opportunity. You will continue to build the relationship and trust with your Participant, which in the majority of cases will have started at the Warm Handover meeting and will then continue to be developed through any other contacts you have had with them to ensure attendance at the Initial Meeting.</p>

<p>3.02. You should aim to complete the Initial Meeting within 15 working days of the referral, and no later than 30 working days of the referral.</p>

<p>3.03. At the Initial Meeting, you will confirm your Participant’s identity and issue them with an induction pack.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: For the purposes of the 15, 30 and 40 working days the first working day is the day following the creation of the referral.
In addition, the majority of referrals will have a warm handover and therefore you will have prior knowledge of the referral.</p>

<p>Please Note: You must have digital solutions in place for circumstances whereby Face to Face meetings in person are unable to take place for example, COVID-19, Local Restrictions. The requirement to adopt this digital solution will be advised by or made in consultation with DWP.</p>
</div>

<h2>Participant Attendance</h2>

<p>3.04. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will have confirmed the Potential Participant’s eligibility and suitability for participating on the Restart Scheme before referring them to you. In addition, as part of the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> referral and warm handover the Jobcentre Plus work coach will have advised you of any restrictions or other key information regarding your Participants work search and work availability requirements. However, at the Initial Meeting, you must check their identity and ensure that there has been no change in circumstances that affect the individual’s suitability and eligibility for the Restart Scheme. For further information on eligibility criteria, discretionary criteria and requirements, along with actions to be undertaken if the Participant is deemed to be potentially ineligible, see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 1 – Introduction and Overview and Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2 A/B – Referral Process and Initial Engagement.</p>

<p>3.05. At the start of the Initial Face to Face Meeting, to ensure a smooth transition on to the Restart Scheme, you will need to undertake the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the Potential Participant’s ID, see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 3 – Initial Meeting and Start</li>
  <li>check that the Potential Participant is not in any form of employment including zero hour contracts. For further information, where a Participant finds work or receives a job offer between referral and the Initial Face to Face Meeting, see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2 A/B</li>
  <li>establish the Potential Participant’s preferred method of communication</li>
  <li>identify and take into account any complex needs and/or additional support requirements, see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 21 – Participants with Complex Needs</li>
  <li>check that the Potential Participant is not in receipt of any payments that may contribute to triggering an outcome payment e.g. occupational pension or a retainer fee paid as an inducement to return to work.  If this is the case, see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17 - Funding Model and Claim Process</li>
  <li>for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of compliance, where the Potential Participant has previously failed to attend an Initial Meeting which was mandated</li>
</ul>

<h2>Identity Checks</h2>

<p>3.06. At the start of all communications or contacts with your Participant, you must ensure that you are satisfied that the Participant you are engaging with is the correct person.</p>

<p>3.07. To do this, you may decide to ask them to state, or physically provide, a combination of their personal information, that you feel provides appropriate security assurance to confirm identity, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>other information, such as details that were included within the original referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>details you hold on your records</li>
  <li>other means of identification, such as a passport, driving licence, or utility bill may be provided. These should be recorded as seen and the reference/serial number of these documents noted but copies do not need to be retained</li>
</ul>

<h2>Participant Initial Meeting Information and Actions</h2>

<p>3.08. At the Initial Meeting, you must ensure that you issue your Participant with an induction pack, for which you should obtain confirmation of receipt from your Participant. This should include as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and safety instructions</li>
  <li>your complaints procedure</li>
  <li>your responsibilities under the Data Protection Act (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>) and General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>information on travel, childcare and other expenses, including any evidence your Participant will need to produce to enable them to make a successful claim for example, Bus ticket. You should also retain a copy of a signed declaration to show that travel and expenses have been offered, see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 6 - Expenses</li>
  <li>location and contact details</li>
  <li>inform your Participant that failure to partake in agreed activities including meetings may result in mandation</li>
  <li>any other information relevant to the Participant for example Participants expected standards of behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>3.09. During the Initial Face to Face Meeting, you should remind your Participant that their length of time on the Restart Scheme can be up to 365 days and that this scheme has been designed to allow you to provide the intensity of support needed, to enable your Participant to move into employment or self-employment.</p>

<p>3.10. As part of the Initial Meeting you will need to explain to your Participant the purpose of your diagnostic assessment and their involvement in its completion, as well as how the diagnostic assessment will contribute to the completion of your Participant’s action plan, See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 4 A/B – Early Interventions</p>

<p>3.11. Prior to you ending the meeting, you will need to discuss your future contact and engagement arrangements with your Participant, along with the date, time and location of their next meeting, which must be within the 90 minutes (or the adjusted travel time agreed with the Jobcentre Plus work coach) by public transport from their home. If the next meeting is not Face to Face you will need to explain how that meeting will be taking place i.e. via digital channels, telephone or other suitable methodology.</p>

<h2>Registering a Start</h2>

<p>3.12. Following the completion of the Initial Face to Face Meeting you must record the date of the meeting in the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> system, as the Start Date on the Restart Scheme. You must ensure that the start date is recorded accurately as the earnings interest data marker is set based upon this date. Please note, mistakes cannot be rectified by the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> support team on the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> system.</p>

<p>3.13.You must record and retain evidence of the Start Date which you will be required to be produced during Performance and Compliance Officer checks, see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 14 – Performance Management. Examples of acceptable evidence could include but not limited to, induction pack items that have been signed for, site attendance register. If a Face to Face meeting can’t take place in person, then digital evidence could include, but not limited to, a dated electronic receipt from the Participant..</p>

<p>3.14. Once you have completed the Initial Meeting, this will count as day 1 of the 365 calendar days that you have to work with your Participant, to achieve an employed or self-employed outcome. This period may be less than 365 days where the Participant exits the Restart Scheme, see , see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapters 13A/B – Restart Scheme Completers and Early Exits.</p>

<p>3.15. If you are unable to facilitate the Initial Face to Face Meeting (in person or by other means, if restrictions apply) within 30 working days then this may impact on your ability to meet one of the Customer Service Standards. If multiple attempts have been made to engage the Potential Participant using a variety of communication methods, you may wish to consider mandation to require the Potential Participant to attend the Initial Face to Face Meeting.</p>

<p>3.16. Should you mandate a Participant to the Initial Meeting you must check whether the Participant is a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimant or a <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> (<abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr>) claimant and ensure that the correct <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> is issued. For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participants you must use a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> and for <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> (<abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr>) Participants a <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.17. If you fail to register a start this will mean that Real Time Earnings (<abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>) tracking will not start promptly and this may affect the ability to receive any resulting payments.</p>

<p>3.18. If your Potential Participant did not attend the initial meeting by the end of 30 working days you will need to record as Did Not Attend (<abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr>) in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> System in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> which will generate a notification to Jobcentre Plus, see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2A/B – Referral Process and Initial Engagement.</p>

<p>3.19. After 40 working days of the referral from the Jobcentre Plus work coach, the Potential Participant’s <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> record will be auto-closed with an Outcome of “auto cancelled referral” where a start has not been entered.</p>

<p>3.20. Should you have claimed a start and it is subsequently discovered that the Participant is on another provision, you must continue to work with the Participant unless notified otherwise.</p>

<p>3.21. Should you have claimed starts on more than one referrals to the Restart Scheme, you must immediately contact the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> support team with all the Purchase Order numbers so that they can investigate which referral has the earnings interest set. Do not take any action on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> until they inform you which Purchase Order number needs to be cancelled. Following this, you will need to raise a <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> 14 to have the duplicate referral start line backed out, cancelling the Acknowledgement and claiming “did not start”.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: Ensuring a timely start on the Restart Scheme is a customer service standard that you must achieve. 85% of referrals should start on the Restart Scheme within 30 working days of the referral, and at least 70% of all referrals must start within 15 working days of the referral.</p>
</div>

<h2>Participant Compliance: Universal Credit Claimants – <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>3.22. During the initial engagement period, you may have made repeated attempts to conduct the Initial Meeting before the Potential Participant attends and starts the Restart Scheme. When they attend, you must check whether one of these previous attempts was mandated, and consider whether they have met the compliance condition.</p>

<p>3.23. As Universal Credit low level sanctions have an open ended element, your Participant must undertake the original requirement unless it is no longer possible to meet the requirement to bring the open ended sanction to an end – this is called compliance. Depending on the compliance condition you set when mandating your Participant previously, you may be able to take subsequent attendance as compliance, see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 8a – Mandating Participants to Undertake Activity.</p>

<p>3.24. You must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> where the Participant’s subsequent attendance to the activity or meeting is accepted as compliance, by sending the UCD604 via unencrypted email.</p>

<p>3.25. You must do this promptly to ensure any sanction that is applied can be brought to an end and the Participant’s benefit can be reinstated quickly.</p>

<p>3.26. For further information regarding Participant compliance including how to send the UCD604, see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 10 – Participant compliance.</p>

<h2>Participant Compliance: Jobseekers Allowance Claimants – <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> (<abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr>)</h2>

<p>3.27. For <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> (<abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr>) Participants there is no need to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> should the Participant subsequently attend the activity or meeting that was mandated. There is no provision to revise the period of a <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> (<abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr>) sanction for failure to take part in the Restart Scheme without good reason, when the <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> (<abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr>) Participant re-engages. If the <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> (<abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr>) Participant complies with the mandated activity, they will still have to serve the full period of sanction.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
