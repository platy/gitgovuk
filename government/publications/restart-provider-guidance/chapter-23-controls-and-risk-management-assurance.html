<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>23.01. This chapter describes the role of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) in assessing the effectiveness of the controls for all Contract Management and Partner Delivery (<abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr>) programmes, including the Restart Scheme that providers have in place to manage the risks associated with the delivery of their Contracts.</p>

<p>23.02. The aim is to provide assurance to the <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> Director and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Senior Leaders that any payments made to providers are in accordance with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Her Majesty’s Treasury’s requirements.</p>

<h2>Provider Assurance Team Background and Purpose</h2>

<p>23.03. The Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) is part of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Finance Group in the <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> Directorate and has been in operation since October 2009.</p>

<p>23.04. Existing providers will already have a nominated Senior Assurance Manager (<abbr title="Senior Assurance Manager">SAM</abbr>) as a single point of contact within <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> for management of assurance related issues or concerns. Any new providers to the market will be allocated a <abbr title="Senior Assurance Manager">SAM</abbr> as a single point of contact within <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> following the award of your contract. Following award of the contract, all providers are offered the opportunity of an initial meeting to provide information on the assurance review process and enable providers to consider and reflect on their current processes and practices.</p>

<p>23.05. <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will review and test your systems of internal control, to establish how effective you are at managing the risks to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, in relation to provision expenditure and service delivery including the arrangements you have in place for your supply chain.</p>

<p>23.06. <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will review your internal systems of control to assess your ability to manage risk across three key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Governance – covering your governance arrangements, systems for tracking and reporting performance and your anti-fraud measures</li>
  <li>Service Delivery – includes your systems for your Participants starting, progressing through and finishing any in scope <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> programmes including the Restart Scheme. This also covers management of your supply chain</li>
  <li>Claim Procedures and Payments – ensuring that you have in place effective systems to support accurate claims for payment, including appropriate segregation of duties</li>
</ul>

<p>23.07. <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> operates at a national level enabling it to present a single view of the effectiveness of the Provider’s systems of control operating across different regions.</p>

<p>23.08. On completion of each review you will be awarded a <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> assurance rating in one of the following four categories: (i) strong, (ii) reasonable, (iii) limited or (iv) weak. You will be sent a formal report detailing the review findings including key strengths and areas for improvement, and where weaknesses have been identified.</p>

<p>23.09. Following receipt of the formal report, where appropriate steps for improvement have been identified, you will be required to complete and return an action plan, as agreed with <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>. Actions plans will be followed up until <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> is satisfied that all required actions have been undertaken.</p>

<p>23.10. The description of the four assurance levels are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strong Assurance – governance, risk management and control arrangements operated provide strong assurance that material risks are identified and managed efficiently and effectively, although improvements may be recommended;</li>
  <li>Reasonable Assurance – governance, risk management and control arrangements operated provide reasonable assurance that material risks are identified and managed efficiently and effectively. Remedial action is required to improve the control environment;</li>
  <li>Limited Assurance – governance, risk management and control arrangements operated provide limited assurance that material risks are identified and managed efficiently and effectively. Corrective action is required to resolve control weaknesses; and</li>
  <li>Weak Assurance – governance, risk management and control arrangements operated provide weak assurance that material risks are identified and managed effectively. Urgent and significant corrective action is required to resolve significant control weaknesses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Plan</h2>

<p>23.11. In order to manage review activity and direct our resources in the most effective way, <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> operates a national plan covering all <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> providers in scope for <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> reviews. Provider reviews are allocated in priority order according to risk. This is determined by a number of factors including the current assurance rating, length of time since the previous review, and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholder intelligence.</p>

<h2>Review Process</h2>

<p>23.12. <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> look for evidence that systems are in place across your organisations to manage key risks to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> expenditure. To facilitate this process, <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will examine your controls across the three scope areas to look at how effective you are in managing the risks identified.</p>

<p>23.13. The review process can take up to 23 weeks to complete and comprises of the following five stages:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Planning Research and Initial Evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Field Work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final Evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow up of Action Plan</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The bulk of the provider facing activity takes place within field testing which generally lasts no longer than five weeks.</p>

<h2>Planning Research and Initial Evaluation</h2>

<p>23.14. During this stage <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will pull together all relevant information about you, form a paper-based opinion about your systems and develop the testing strategy to be used at your Premises.</p>

<p>23.15. <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will send two documents to you at the beginning of the review:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Provider Systems Questionnaire (<abbr title="Provider Systems Questionnaire">PSQ</abbr>) which asks a series of questions about your systems across each of the three scope areas</li>
  <li>a site information stencil to confirm information about your Premises and delivery locations</li>
</ul>

<p>23.16. <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will also seek feedback from other stakeholders within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> who work closely with you. Intelligence is gathered from these sources during the planning process and used alongside the <abbr title="Provider Systems Questionnaire">PSQ</abbr> response from you, when forming an initial view of your risks and systems of controls and in the development of the test strategy.</p>

<h2>Field Work at Providers</h2>

<p>23.17. The Field work will commence following a formal start-up meeting between you and <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> on an agreed date. The purpose of this meeting is to brief you on the forthcoming review and agree the terms of engagement throughout, including timescales for final feedback and the timeframe for providing all required evidence.</p>

<p>23.18. Based on the planning, research and initial evaluation, visits are arranged at your Premises to carry out any testing deemed necessary to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the systems of control under review. Should site visits be restricted for any reason, <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will consult with you to enable testing to be undertaken digitally or by other means.</p>

<p>23.19. The fieldwork can be conducted at any of your Premises across the country and the choice of Premises to visit will be determined by a number of factors, e.g. the schemes, programmes and activities delivered at individual sites, any intelligence gathered during the planning stage which may indicate weaknesses in certain areas, or the availability of <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> resource.</p>

<p>23.20. The tests will typically include reviewing key policy documents, examining customer files, interviewing your staff, and performing checks in sufficient quantities to allow the team to form an opinion across your systems as a whole. This may mean there are variations to the duration of the testing period in some circumstance based on the outcomes of the checks.</p>

<p>23.21. During the testing period <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> provides interim written summaries of the key points, which allows you to understand and discuss the findings to date.</p>

<p>23.22. Throughout the testing period you will be given the opportunity to provide any supporting documentation or missing evidence that has been requested by <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>, however, all required evidence must be provided by the date agreed at the start up meeting.</p>

<h2>Final Evaluation</h2>

<p>23.23. Evaluation of your systems is continuous throughout the end-to-end <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> process.  Once testing is complete all the findings are considered and an overall assurance level will be awarded covering the three scope areas, based on the assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of your systems across all aspects of the schemes and programmes delivered under your Contracts.</p>

<p>23.24. The final evaluation and assurance level will be formally presented to you at a final feedback meeting, at a time agreed between you and <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>. At this meeting you and <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will discuss what actions are going to be taken to address any issues raised and timescales for satisfactory completion of those actions.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>23.25. Following the final feedback, a report will be produced and sent to you by <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>. The report will contain details of <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>’s findings and opinion against all key risk areas across the three scope areas as discussed at the final feedback meeting along with the overall assurance level.</p>

<p>23.26. An action plan will be attached to the report covering all the issues raised at the feedback meeting. You will then be required to return the action plan within 10 working days of receipt. Your response should contain timescales for implementing any necessary improvements.</p>

<p>23.27. You will also be issued with a feedback stencil, for completion and return to the allocated <abbr title="Senior Assurance Manager">SAM</abbr>. The information you provide will support and inform the continuous improvement of the <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> processes.</p>

<p>23.28. Where you have any issues or causes for concern within the <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> review process which cannot be addressed throughout the course of the review, then you may raise these in writing with the Head of the Provider Assurance Team.</p>

<p>23.29. There is no entitlement to appeal the level of assurance awarded as <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>will have undertaken an extensive period of evaluation to ensure that it has a good understanding of your systems and processes</li>
  <li>will have sought sufficient evidence throughout the testing process to reach a sound conclusion regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of your controls</li>
  <li>at the final feedback meeting will have allowed you ample opportunity to discuss the findings and proposed assurance level, before the final report is issued</li>
</ul>

<p>23.30. If you do not agree with the outcome of the <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> review, you may discuss your concerns with the <abbr title="Senior Assurance Manager">SAM</abbr> or Head of <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>. However, the assurance rating once awarded will not be reviewed by <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> unless the findings are factually incorrect.</p>

<p>23.31. The main focus of any meeting or correspondence after an assurance rating has been given will be to concentrate on the implementation of the areas for improvement, as detailed in the action plan issued to you, to strengthen your controls and how you will maintain a strong level of control in preparation for any subsequent review.</p>

<p>23.32. The report is also issued to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholders which typically include, but not exclusively:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance Managers</li>
  <li>Commercial Directorate</li>
  <li>Counter Fraud and Investigation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Follow Up of Action Plan</h2>

<p>23.33. Confirmation is sought by Employment Account Division (<abbr title="Employer Account Division">EAD</abbr>) performance managers on behalf of <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> that all actions detailed within your action plan have been implemented. This follow up will take place within the timescales agreed with <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Other Potential Actions</h2>

<p>23.34. Without prejudice to any other of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWPs</abbr> rights under your Contracts, there may be other actions required depending on the findings of the review, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overpayment Recovery – if overpayments are identified and evidence could not be produced during the review, then <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may seek to recover any overpayments; and</li>
  <li>Backtracking – if any overpayments, errors or discrepancies identified during the review indicate they are as a result of systemic weaknesses then you may be asked to ‘back track’. In such cases you will be required to provide the applicable evidence over a specified period of time and in doing so identify any overpayments. The results of the backtracking will be verified by <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> before any subsequent action is taken</li>
</ul>

<h2>Provider Assurance Team Reporting</h2>

<p>23.35. All <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> provider assurance reports are shared with the <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> Director and other senior managers within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. In addition, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has the right to periodically publish assurance levels awarded.</p>

<p>23.36. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may take remedial actions under the Contract in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if, following a weak or limited assurance level from <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>, your subsequent assurance level is the same or worse for the same reasons, or you are awarded a consecutive third weak or limited assurance, regardless of the reasons</li>
  <li>following a review, if you fail to submit or implement the action plan within the agreed timescales</li>
  <li>where there are suspicions that you may be acting inappropriately</li>
  <li>where there are serious concerns around data security</li>
</ul>
