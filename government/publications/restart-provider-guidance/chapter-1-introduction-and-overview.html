<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.01. Each chapter of the Restart Scheme Provider Guidance will have an introduction to set out what that chapter covers. For some chapters where benefit specific guidance is required, there is a chapter relating to Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) claimants and a corresponding chapter relating to claimants in receipt of Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA <abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr>). For some chapters the guidance is generic and relates to both <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> claimants. This chapter introduces the Restart Scheme and the Restart Scheme Provider Guidance.</p>

<h2>General information</h2>

<p>1.02. COVID-19, and the public health measures introduced in response to it have had unprecedented economic impacts in the UK and globally. The impact on out of work benefit claims was immediate, with over 1 million declarations to Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) alone in the first few months of the pandemic.</p>

<p>1.03. At the Spending Review on 25th November 2020, HM Treasury confirmed a new £2.9 billion Restart Scheme covering three years of referrals to provide intensive and tailored support to over 1 million unemployed people and help them find work’.</p>

<p>1.04. The Restart Scheme will provide intensive support designed to help Participants into sustained work, targeting people who are currently in the Intensive Work Search Regime and have been claiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> or <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> for a minimum of 9 months. There will be an opportunity for discretionary referrals to Restart at the right time in an individual’s journey. Claimant and work coach discussions will provide an opportunity to decide if someone would benefit from the scheme and that this would be the most appropriate route into work for them.</p>

<p>1.05. The Restart Scheme will provide additional tailored support above what is available through Jobcentre Plus, supporting Participants into sustainable work.</p>

<p>1.06. This <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Programme-Specific Provider Guidance supports you, in your delivery of the Restart Scheme on behalf of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. It provides guidance on processes for the Restart Scheme and requirements, supporting the scheme contract details and the legal arrangements for delivery.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</h2>

<p>1.07. The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is responsible for welfare and pension policy and is a key player in tackling child poverty. It is the biggest public service delivery department in the UK and serves over 20 million people.</p>

<p>1.08. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions/about">further information about <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Aims of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Provision</h2>

<p>1.09. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> aims to deliver the best possible service to the people who are its Participants on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> programmes. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-procurement-policies-and-procedures">values and aims of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>1.10. The aim of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision is to support these values by helping and supporting people who are out of work to move into work and remain in work; recognising work as the primary sustainable route out of poverty and reducing the number of children in workless households.</p>

<p>1.11. Your performance contributes directly to that of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> overall and we therefore have a shared interest in the success of your provision. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> operates a policy of continuous improvement in which we work to raise all aspects of quality and performance in the services we deliver and you are expected to work with us in doing so. All <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision is designed to tackle specific barriers that unemployed people face in finding and retaining work. In keeping with that, you are expected to provide people with a professional, high quality, personalised and work-like experience that delivers to them a sense of pace and purpose in their efforts to find work.</p>

<h2>What you can expect from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</h2>

<p>1.12. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is the largest government department with a presence in almost every UK town and city, and an annual expenditure of around £3.8 billion on externally supplied goods and services.</p>

<p>1.13. Information on what you can expect from delivering to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and its Agency, Jobcentre Plus, including the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Supplier Charter that sets out the standards you can expect from us and what your responsibilities are in return, can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-procurement-policies-and-procedures"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> procurement policies and procedures</a>.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Customer Charter</h2>

<p>1.14. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is committed to providing high quality and efficient services to our customers. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-customer-charter"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Customer Charter</a> sets out the standards that customers can expect and what their responsibilities are in return.</p>

<p>1.15. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is dedicated to raising the standards of all our contracted provision and require all providers and sub-contractors to embed the principles of the Customer Charter into the services you deliver on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s behalf. The ‘shared promise on customer care’ developed by the Employment Related Services Association and supported by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, makes the commitments given in the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Customer Charter more specific for welfare to work providers to sign the Shared Promise, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would expect you and your sub-contractors to support the commitments contained in it.</p>

<h2>This guidance</h2>

<p>1.16. This Provider Guidance is not a contractual document and is intended to help you to deliver the service as outlined in your contract.</p>

<p>1.17. The Restart Provider Guidance will sometimes use the term “you” or “your” to mean the providers of the Restart Scheme. Likewise, it will sometimes say “we” to mean <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>1.18. It also uses different terms depending whereabouts someone is in relation to their journey on the provision. For example</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whilst a person remains entitled to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, they may still be referred to as a claimant by Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>Once a Jobcentre Plus work coach considers someone to be eligible and suitable for Restart, they may be referred to as a “Potential Participant” until the point at which they attend their initial meeting and start on the provision or are no longer being considered for referral</li>
  <li>After attending their initial Face-to-Face meeting and starting on the provision, the person then may be referred to as a “Participant”</li>
</ul>

<p>1.19. Whilst the Restart Scheme is designed to include Face to-Face contact, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown how circumstances can suddenly change and make Face to Face contact impractical.  This guidance has been written as though Face to Face contact will be permissible. However, should the circumstances make this not possible, either due to national or local circumstances, then alternative arrangements such as telephone or video conferencing should be utilised. Please refer to Annex 1 in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2</a> – Referral Process and Initial Engagement for further information.</p>

<p>1.20. All Restart Provider Guidance must be read in conjunction with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The “Restart Call-Off Specification”</li>
  <li>Your Terms and Conditions</li>
  <li>Your Contract</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> Systems User Guidance, and</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Supplier Code of Conduct</li>
</ul>

<p>1.21. This guidance provides additional information to the schedules of your contract(s). Provider Guidance does not look to replicate the details within your contract and you are responsible for ensuring you read, understand and are complying with your contract.</p>

<p>1.22. You must ensure that any organisations with which you have a sub-contractual relationship also have access to, and have read, the Restart Provider Guidance.</p>

<p>1.23. If you have any questions which are not covered by this guidance, please raise with your Employment. Account Division Performance Manager in the first instance.</p>

<h2>Overview of Restart</h2>

<p>1.24. The key aim of the Restart Scheme is to help eligible claimants get back into work as quickly and efficiently as possible, whilst ensuring all Participants receive a quality, personalised service.</p>

<p>1.25. To ensure the Restart Scheme fits into both the wider <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and cross-government response to COVID-19, and delivers the Ministerial intent, there are four objectives which need to be met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Job outcomes – The Restart Scheme should help long-term unemployed claimants to get back into work on a secure, sustained basis. The Restart Scheme should provide job outcome focussed support, tailored towards the Participants’ needs</li>
  <li>Providing a locally tailored, adaptable support offer – The Restart Scheme should design and tailor interventions in accordance with the labour market at a local level. This means seeking out and taking advantage of opportunities such as local growth sectors and local training initiatives and flexing the offer throughout the lifetime of the Restart Scheme based on emerging labour market challenges and opportunities. The Restart Scheme should maintain strong working relationships with key local stakeholders to ensure the Restart Scheme’s offer is complementary to local efforts on an ongoing basis</li>
  <li>Value for Money – The Restart Scheme should deliver support as effectively as possible, so that the fiscal return measured for the Restart Scheme (from additional employment gained and time on benefits reduced) should exceed the cost of the Restart Scheme</li>
  <li>Evidence – The Restart Scheme should build the evidence base for the design and delivery of large scale employment programmes for long-term benefit claimants</li>
</ul>

<p>1.26. The underpinning ethos of the Restart Scheme is based around principles of engagement, collaboration and joint endeavour between the Participant, Jobcentre Plus work coach and you. Warm Handovers, facilitated by the Jobcentre Plus work coaches are designed to support these principles by enabling you to introduce yourself at a time when the Potential Participant is with someone who they already have a relationship with resulting in a smooth handover and sharing of key information. The Participant will also continue to meet regularly with their Jobcentre Plus work coach to discuss progress. This may include a review of their Participant’s Action Plan.</p>

<p>1.27. Participants, Jobcentre Plus work coaches or yourselves can initiate a three-way conversation at any point during the Participant’s time on the scheme. They will allow open dialogue between all parties and encourage participation on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: Participants will continue to meet their benefit conditionality requirements such as regular interviews with Jobcentre Plus work coaches whilst on the Restart Scheme, their participation on the scheme will be incorporated into their claimant commitment.</p>

<p>Please Note: Restart is a mandatory employment programme which means that you may mandate Participants to undertake activity to help them to prepare for or move into work, subject to their circumstances and capabilities. However, DWP has introduced a range of policy requirements which means mandation must only be considered where alternative attempts to engage and encourage the Participant to undertake activity has failed, and it was reasonable to expect the Participant to undertake them.</p>
</div>

<h2>Claimant Eligibility</h2>

<p>1.28.To be eligible the claimant must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> for at least 9 months, with no upper limit and in the <abbr title="Intensive Work Search Regime">IWSR</abbr> at the point of referral, with time in receipt of new style Jobseeker’s Allowance counting towards this</li>
  <li>have no sustained PAYE earnings at the point of referral</li>
  <li>not be identified as Gainfully Self-Employed
have the right to work in the UK</li>
  <li>reside in England or Wales</li>
  <li>be of working age</li>
  <li>not currently on other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Contracted Employment Provision</li>
  <li>not be in a Control Group or public Sector Comparator where participation on this scheme would affect the validity of those groups</li>
  <li>not have previously participated on the Restart Scheme</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> Claimant Eligibility</h2>

<p>1.29. To be eligible the claimant must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be currently in receipt of <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have been in receipt of <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> for a minimum of 9 months with no upper limit</li>
  <li>have no sustained PAYE earnings at the point of referral</li>
  <li>have the right to work in the UK</li>
  <li>reside in England or Wales</li>
  <li>be of working age</li>
  <li>not currently on other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Contracted Employment Provision</li>
  <li>not be in a Control Group or public Sector Comparator where participation on this scheme would affect the validity of those groups</li>
  <li>not have previously participated on the Restart Scheme</li>
  <li>Self-employed <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> claimants can be eligible for the Restart Scheme</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: In England and Wales “working age” is defined as starting from 16 years of age to State pension age. However, in England 16 to 17 year olds who are not in work are required to stay in education or training, so whilst 16-17 year olds can access the Restart Scheme in Wales, in England they will not be able to access the Restart Scheme until they reach 18 years of age.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Claimant Suitability</h2>

<p>1.30. Checks will be carried out by the Jobcentre Plus work coach prior to referral to determine if the Restart Scheme is suitable for the claimant and their current circumstances. In addition to confirming eligibility, the following factors will be considered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>claimants who are considering self-employment and those who have not been found to be gainfully self-employed (<abbr title="gainfully self-employed">GSE</abbr>), can be considered for the Restart Scheme. This includes those that may continue to report self-employed earnings</li>
  <li>is the claimant likely to be given a start date for employment in the near future?</li>
  <li>are there any Easements in place? (Although this does not automatically exclude someone)</li>
  <li>is there other support which may be more appropriate?</li>
  <li>has the claimant previously completed the Restart Scheme?</li>
  <li>is there a Work Capability Assessment or appeals interest? (Although this does not automatically exclude someone)</li>
  <li>is the claimant ready to take advantage of the support? (i.e. there aren’t more complex barriers to work that will need addressing before they can benefit from the Restart Scheme support)</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> Claimant Suitability</h2>

<p>1.31. Checks will be carried out by the Jobcentre Plus work coach prior to referral to determine if the Restart Scheme is suitable for the claimant and their current circumstances. Alongside confirming eligibility as above, the following factors will be considered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is the claimant likely to be given a start date for employment in the near future?</li>
  <li>are there any Easements in place? (Although this does not automatically exclude someone)</li>
  <li>is there other support which may be more appropriate?</li>
  <li>has the claimant previously completed the Restart Scheme?</li>
  <li>is the claimant ready to take advantage of the support? (i.e. there aren’t more complex barriers to work that will need addressing before they can benefit from the Restart Scheme support)</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<h2>Claimants who are on a Health Journey</h2>

<p>1.32. The Restart Scheme has been designed to support the majority of claimants in the Intensive Work Search Regime (<abbr title="Intensive Work Search Regime">IWSR</abbr>) and <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr>. Claimants in this group will have a variety of needs; including <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants who are on a health journey.</p>

<p>1.33. All <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants currently on a health journey can be considered for a referral to the Restart Scheme. This includes claimants who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a fit note</li>
  <li>are awaiting a Work Capability Assessment (<abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr>), or</li>
  <li>are awaiting the outcome of a <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: If any claimant is within the first 14 days of their fit note, the (Potential) Participant will have been informed by their Jobcentre Plus work coach that any work search activities are voluntary until the 14 days expires. This requirement does not prevent a referral to the Restart Scheme.</p>
</div>

<p>1.34. Jobcentre Plus work coaches consider each referral to the Restart Scheme and assess a claimant’s suitability for the Restart Scheme. If participation on the Restart Scheme is considered to be realistic and achievable for the Claimant, and they are likely to benefit from this additional support, a referral will be made. The expectation is that for a significant number of claimants, the Restart Scheme will be suitable. In all cases, the Jobcentre Plus work coach will have made the claimant aware that participation in the Restart Scheme is mandatory.</p>

<p>1.35. A referral to the Restart Scheme can also be made for claimants in the <abbr title="Intensive Work Search Regime">IWSR</abbr>, who are not on a health journey but have an ongoing health condition or disability. This includes claimants who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not have a current fit note or medical evidence</li>
  <li>are not awaiting a <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr>, or</li>
  <li>have been found fit for work and continue to submit a fit note or medical evidence for a condition which is the same (or substantially the same) as the condition on which the <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr> decision was made</li>
</ul>

<p>1.36. In all cases where the claimant has a health condition or disability, you are expected to accept all Potential Participants onto the Restart Scheme. You should make reasonable adjustments which enable the Participants to receive the full benefits of the Restart Scheme. You may wish to consider the following methods of support; this is not an exhaustive list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using alternative methods to face-to-face interventions</li>
  <li>using alternative methods of communication such as braille</li>
  <li>ensuring appointments are conducted at an accessible location, or</li>
  <li>booking interactions around medical appointments</li>
</ul>

<p>1.37. If you use alternative methods of support, these methods should be clearly noted in the Participant’s notes. This includes recording why an alternative method had to take place to evidence the customer service standards have been met, despite the alternative arrangements. A Participant’s Induction Pack must be provided in hard copy. If a face-to-face intervention could not take place due to a health condition, an induction pack can be issued electronically followed by a hard copy in the post, to be returned with the Participants signature. A Participant’s action plan should also include what steps will be taken to help the Participant overcome barriers, progress towards participating in face-to-face interventions and into employment. Where the health condition presents an ongoing barrier to employment, you should work with the Participant to identify suitable employers and job roles to aspire to.</p>

<p>1.38. The Restart Scheme is designed to meet the needs of claimants who are on the health journey or have an ongoing medical issue. Having a health condition does not, of itself, preclude claimants from participation on the Restart Scheme and is not a reason to reject the referral. You should accept all referrals of Potential Participants who are deemed suitable by the Job Centre Plus work coach. If you have any concerns about the suitability of a Potential Participant, you should speak to your Jobcentre Plus Single Point of Contact or the Potential Participant’s work coach, please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2</a> – Referral Process and Initial Engagement.</p>

<h2>Claimants with communication needs and/or have complex needs</h2>

<p>1.39. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and its contracted providers have a legal duty to enable communication with participants who do not speak English as a first language and/or require tailored support in response to their complex needs. This is sometimes referred to as English for Speakers of Other Languages (<abbr title="English for Speakers of Other Languages">ESOL</abbr>).</p>

<p>1.40.The Restart Scheme has been designed to suit Participants with a range of needs including those with communication needs and/or complex needs. Providers are expected to make reasonable adjustments to help support these Participants whilst on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>1.41. For further information on working with clients with communication and/or complex needs, please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 21</a> – Participants with Complex Needs.</p>

<h2>Provision Duration</h2>

<p>1.42. Once your Participant has started on the Restart Scheme you will have 365 days to offer support to them.</p>

<p>1.43. After the 365 days has elapsed, there will be a tracking period of 182 days, where you may claim an outcome. During this period, you will not be required to provide support to your Participant.</p>

<p>1.44. The duration of your support offer may be less than 365 days in circumstances where your Participant exits the scheme as an early completer, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance 13</a> – Restart Scheme Completers and Early Exits.</p>

<h2>Travel costs and additional costs</h2>

<p>1.45. You must ensure your Participants are not worse off by virtue of attending the Restart Scheme. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-6-expenses">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 6</a> – Expenses</p>

<p>1.46. You must at your expense pay Participants costs for travel, childcare, replacement care and additional support costs whilst they are on the Restart Scheme. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 6 – Expenses.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>1.47. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the Restart Scheme to understand the impact of the scheme, its value for money, and the quality of delivery. The Evaluation will consider factors including, but not limited to, the early implementation of the scheme, the delivery and nature of provision, Participant experience and outcomes, the cost effectiveness of the scheme, and Providers’ interaction with other local services and stakeholders.</p>

<p>1.48. Part of the Evaluation will be conducted by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> analysts, and the rest will be conducted by research contractors commissioned by the Department. As part of the evaluation <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> researchers and our research contractors may visit, interview, observe, and survey Participants, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff, Provider staff, and subcontractors. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will require Providers to provide information on their own activities and staff, as well as local partners and networks, who may also be included in the research. Providers will be notified in advance of any research activity, and will be expected to co-operate fully with the Evaluation as required</p>

<h2>Annex 1 – Potential COVID-19 scenarios</h2>

<h3>If a Potential Participant is advised to self-isolate following a “ping” from the NHS Test and Trace at the time of the warm handover?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You should accept the referral and set a date for the initial meeting after the self-isolation period has ended. Guidance on self-isolation can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus</a> This should be achievable within the 15 working day window from referral to achieve the Customer Service Standard 1(b)</li>
  <li>If for any reason the Participant continues to self-isolate and looks unlikely to be able to attend a face-to-face initial meeting within 15 working days of the date of the referral, you may undertake the initial meeting using alternative communication methods</li>
  <li>You should clearly note on their records the reason why the intervention did not take place face to face and the reason the alternative method was appropriate</li>
  <li>Where evidence is needed that the Participant has been told to self-isolate, you should ask the Participant to get a self-isolation note from NHS Test and Trace. Guidance can be found at Get an isolation note - NHS (111.nhs.uk)</li>
  <li>You will not be judged to have “failed” the Customer Service Standard where there are reasonable grounds that the Participant would not be able to access face to face support, provided the reasons and evidence are clearly recorded</li>
</ul>

<h3>What should you do if a Restart Scheme Participant is unable to attend a face to face intervention because they are self-isolating?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You should establish the dates of the self-isolation period. Where evidence is needed that the Participant has been told to self-isolate, you should ask the Participant to get a self-isolation note from NHS Test and Trace. Guidance can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://111.nhs.uk/isolation-note/" rel="external">Get an isolation note - NHS (111.nhs.uk)</a>
</li>
  <li>You should seek to re-arrange the intervention once the self-isolation has come to an end. If this is not possible, you may undertake the intervention using alternative communication methods</li>
  <li>You should clearly note on their records the reason why the intervention did not take place face to face and the reason the alternative method was appropriate</li>
  <li>You will not be judged to have “failed” a customer service standard where there are reasonable grounds that the Participant would not be able to access face to face support, provided the reasons and evidence are clearly recorded</li>
</ul>

<h3>What should you do if a Restart Scheme Participant is unable to attend a face to face intervention because they are have tested positive for COVID-19?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>On no account should an individual with COVID-19 be asked to attend a face to face intervention</li>
  <li>You should ascertain whether the individual has symptoms and whether they are able/willing to participate in Restart Scheme activity using digital or other communication</li>
  <li>Where interventions do not take place due to COVID-19, or where face to face interventions are replaced by digital interventions, the Provider should clearly note on their records the reasons</li>
  <li>You will not be judged to have “failed” a Customer Service Standard where there are reasonable grounds that the Participant would not be able to access face to face support, provided the reasons and evidence are clearly recorded</li>
</ul>

<h3>What should the Provider do if a Participant is unwilling to attend a face to face intervention or otherwise participate in Restart Scheme activity because they are anxious about the possibility of contracting COVID-19?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If no national or local lockdowns or restrictions are in place, the Participant is expected to attend and participate in all Restart Scheme activity, in line with their Universal Credit conditionality regime</li>
  <li>You should explain this to the Participant. If they remain unwilling to attend, you should explain that participation is mandatory and refusal may result in a benefit sanction</li>
  <li>If the Participant still refuses to attend, and you believe they do not have good reason, you may wish to:
    <ul>
      <li>Implement mandation activity by issuing a completed Mandatory Activity Notification (<abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr>); or</li>
      <li>Implement a three way conversation involving the Participant and the Jobcentre work coach to discuss the individual circumstances</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What should you do if your premises are closed due to a COVID-19 outbreak or if individual advisers are required to self-isolate?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Where premises are closed but your advisers are not infected nor required to self-isolate, you may be able to arrange a face-to-face intervention at another location (which should be within the Participant’s usual expected travel time – normally 90 minutes)</li>
  <li>Where this is not possible, and it is not possible for the intervention to be conducted by a different adviser on a “one-off” basis, the intervention should be conducted via digital or other communication methods</li>
  <li>Where face to face interventions are replaced by digital interventions, you should clearly note on their records the reasons</li>
  <li>You will not be judged to have “failed” a customer service standard where there are reasonable grounds that your adviser would not be able to conduct face to face support, provided the reasons and evidence is clearly recorded</li>
</ul>
