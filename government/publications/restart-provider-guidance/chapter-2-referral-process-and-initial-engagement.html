<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>2.1. This chapter explains how the Jobcentre Plus work coach will refer eligible and suitable claimants onto the Restart Scheme. It covers your roles and responsibilities during the initial stages of a claimant’s journey to becoming your Participant and the steps that you need to take as part of this process. The chapter includes how you should appropriately manage those who do not start in a timely manner. It also explains how you should complete actions that are required at different stages of the referral process.</p>

<h2>Jobcentre Referral to Restart</h2>

<p>2.2. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will identify claimants who are both eligible and suitable for the Restart Scheme as the next step of their journey towards employment. See Restart Provider Guidance Chapter 1 - Introduction and Overview. Places are allocated via a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> standardised selection process.</p>

<p>2.3. In addition, discretionary referrals can be made. Where discussion between a claimant and their Jobcentre Plus work coach results in identifying a claimant who has been in the Intensive Work Search regime (<abbr title="Intensive Work Search Regime">IWSR</abbr>) but has been claiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> for less than 9 months and who would benefit from the scheme, a discretionary referral can be made at this or any other appropriate point in the claimant’s journey. Discretionary referrals will account for a small proportion of overall volumes.</p>

<p>2.4. In all cases the Jobcentre Plus work coach will assess the Potential Participant, confirm their overall eligibility and suitability for the Restart Scheme, and discuss their engagement requirements.</p>

<p>2.5. The focus will be on engagement and encouragement, with the mandation process only being used where other positive engagement attempts have been unsuccessful (see para 2.72 Mandation).</p>

<p>2.6. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will then make the arrangements for the “Warm Handover” conversation to take place, at a suitable date and time, in conjunction with the claimant using the process agreed with you. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will either phone your call centre or access your booking tool, depending upon which system you have set up, and book the Warm Handover appointment. You should organise local processes to support these arrangements. Should this be by phone conversation, then you will need to ensure that you are available for calls to arrange the Warm Handover.</p>

<h2>Warm Handover</h2>

<p>2.7. A minimum of 90% of referrals will have a Warm Handover. Jobcentre Plus work coaches will be present and  facilitate these.</p>

<p>2.8. The majority of Warm Handover meetings will be held via a three-way conference call between the Potential Participant, Jobcentre Plus work coach and you.</p>

<p>2.9. The Warm Handover enables you to engage with your Potential Participant when they are in the presence of someone with whom they are familiar. This presents an opportunity to engage with your Potential Participant in a positive and collaborative manner to encourage their participation on the Restart Scheme, and to support them in a joined up approach alongside Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>2.10. During the three-way Warm Handover conversation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Jobcentre Plus work coach will introduce the Potential Participant to you</li>
  <li>you will explain how the Potential Participant can benefit from the Restart Scheme</li>
  <li>the Potential Participant will be able to raise any issues or concerns they may have and discuss any reasonable adjustments</li>
</ul>

<p>2.11. The Warm Handover meeting will enable the sharing of appropriate information about the Potential Participant to assist you in offering an individualised service, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advanced support concerns or needs</li>
  <li>any restrictions to the Potential Participant’s work search or availability</li>
  <li>where time permits, you may wish to discuss the steps already taken on their journey towards employment</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>2.12. The Warm Handover meeting will enable you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>actively promote the benefits of the Restart Scheme</li>
  <li>reassure the Potential Participant and provide practical information as to travel, meeting locations, etc.</li>
  <li>gather sufficient personal information to arrange the Initial Face to Face Meeting, agreeing a date, time and location; or make alternative arrangements should Face to Face meetings not be possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Information, such Potential Participants’ address or National Insurance number etc, are not to be asked for at the Warm Handover as this information is includedall of which are included in the subsequent Provider Referral and Payment System (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) referral.</p>

<p>2.13. The date, time and location of the Initial Face to Face Meeting between you and the Potential Participant must be agreed during this conversation.</p>

<p>2.14. If you have a doubt or wish to question a Potential Participant’s eligibility or suitability to the Restart Scheme this must not be raised during the Warm Handover with them present. This should be raised with the Jobcentre Plus Single Point of Contact or the work coach following the call and before the referral is acknowledged in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.15. For Potential Participants where English is not their first language and/or have communication needs (for example, hearing impaired) it is the Jobcentre Plus work coach’s responsibility to ensure appropriate communication methods (for example, translators) are available up to and including the Warm Handover.</p>

<p>2.16. Following the Warm Handover it is the responsibility of the Provider to ensure that appropriate communication methods are available so that all Participants and Potential Participants have full access to the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>2.17. If the Potential Participant cannot attend the warm handover due to Covid-19, please refer to Annex 1 of Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 1 – Introduction and Overview.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: At the end of the warm handover meeting, you must have arranged the Initial Face to Face Meeting with your Potential Participant, and have identified any advanced support concerns or needs.</p>
</div>

<p>2.18. Immediately after the Warm Handover, the Jobcentre Plus work coach will issue the Potential Participant with information you have supplied about your support offer and the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>2.19. Following a successful Warm Handover, the Jobcentre Plus work coach will make a referral to you using the Find and Refer (<abbr title="Find and Refer">F&amp;R</abbr>) <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Information Technology (<abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>) system. This will generate a referral on the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will issue a notification to the Potential Participant confirming that participation on the Restart Scheme is mandatory.</p>

<p>2.20. The <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> Purchase Order Number (PO Number) will start with 70 for Universal Credit claimants. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will issue a notification to the Potential Participant confirming that participation on the Restart Scheme is mandatory.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: You must record all initial engagement actions on your own internal Restart system as part of the audit process. The Warm Handover will be the first significant engagement activity, and therefore needs to be recorded.</p>
</div>

<h2>Initial Engagement activity</h2>

<p>2.21. You must check and then acknowledge the referral on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>. There may be exceptional circumstances where the referral may need to be rejected, see paras 2.44 to 2.54. Depending upon your own internal systems, you may then need to match the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> referral to the record of the Warm Handover or initial engagement that you have already generated for this Potential Participant to ensure your audit record is complete.</p>

<p>2.22. When checking the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> referral, you should be checking for things such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is the Participant a JSA (<abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr>) or Universal Credit claimant?</li>
  <li>is the information complete?</li>
  <li>is there information relating to a need for additional support?</li>
  <li>does the Potential Participant live in England or Wales?</li>
  <li>is the Potential Participant on another contracted provision, for example Work and Health Programme, New Enterprise Allowance etc (this list is not exhaustive)</li>
  <li>is this a duplicate referral to the Restart Scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>2.23. When checking a referral on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>, if a Potential Participant’s email address is listed as noemail@dwp.gov.uk, you should be aware this is a dummy email address and must not be used. This email address is input into the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> systems for Potential Participants who do not have a registered email address.</p>

<p>2.24. At this time, you must identify any advanced support needs from the information that has been shared, and tailor your engagement and activities accordingly.</p>

<p>2.25. During the period between the Warm Handover and the initial meeting, you should maintain contact with your Potential Participant to ensure on-going engagement. This will allow any changes to their circumstances to be taken into account, for example, where they receive the offer of work, or have changes to their travel arrangements or support needs.</p>

<p>2.26. You can choose any additional appropriate methods of notifying your Potential Participant of the agreed Initial Face to Face meeting following the Warm Handover. You may wish to utilise more than one method to encourage their attendance, including reminders in advance of the meeting. Activities that you may wish to use to help encourage your Potential Participant’s engagement on the Restart Scheme might include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discuss with them how they will travel to the Initial Face to Face meeting</li>
  <li>provide a map to them</li>
  <li>consideration with regards to travel expenses and/or child care (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-6-expenses">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 6</a> – Expenses), or</li>
  <li>see if there is anything further that you can do to help them</li>
</ul>

<p>2.27. You must not mandate your Potential Participant to attend the Initial Face to Face meeting at this point but engage with them to encourage their participation. Mandation can be considered after repeated attempts, see paragraph 2.72.</p>

<p>2.28. If the Potential Participant cannot attend the initial face to face intervention due to Covid-19, please refer to Annex 1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-1-introduction-and-overview">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 1</a> – Introduction and Overview.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> Referral Not Received</h3>

<p>2.29. A Participant cannot start on the Restart Scheme without you receiving a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> systems referral via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>. Following a Warm Handover call, the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> referral should be received within 2 working days. Should there be an outage of the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> system, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will issue a <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> bulletin to inform you, and this will advise accordingly.</p>

<p>2.30. Should you not receive a <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> referral within 2 days of the Warm Handover call and you have not received notification of any issues relating to the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> system, then you will need to contact your Single Point of Contact for either the Jobcentre Plus District or individual Jobcentre Plus site, depending upon the arrangements that you have in place. This will enable the Jobcentre Plus work coach to take corrective action and for the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> referral to be received before the Initial Face to Face Meeting. Should this be a persistent issue, then you will need to discuss this with your Employment Account Division Performance Manager so that it can be addressed.</p>

<h3>No Warm Handover</h3>

<p>2.31. Exceptional circumstances may mean that a Warm Handover conversation does not happen, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>COVID-19 restrictions (either local or national)</li>
  <li>office outages</li>
  <li>exceptionally high levels of claims, where resources across an area (or nationally) are targeted at making payments</li>
  <li>exceptionally high levels of sickness within a Jobcentre Plus site</li>
  <li>unable to book a Warm Handover following a number of attempts to do so</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, this list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>2.32. In such an instance you will receive a <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> referral, but you will not have a record already detailing a Warm Handover call, and you won’t have had the opportunity to receive the appropriate Participant information. Not having a Warm Handover is not a reason to reject a referral. You will be required to utilise the initial engagement activity period to discuss the Restart Scheme with your Potential Participant, identify any support needs and arrange the time, date and location for the initial Face to Face meeting, using the appropriate methods available. Continue actions on initial engagement activity as from paragraph 2.21.</p>

<p>2.33. The term “Cold Handover” or “Cold Referral” maybe used in reference to referrals to the Restart Scheme where no warm handover has occurred.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: All referrals with an advanced support element will be prioritised to have a Warm Handover.</p>
</div>

<h3>Failure To Attend Initial Face To Face</h3>

<p>2.34. Should your initial engagement attempt be unsuccessful, you must make repeated attempts to engage with your Potential Participant before the 30th working day from the referral.</p>

<p>2.35. You should check for any advanced support needs from information shared and tailor your initial engagement accordingly. In the instance that your Potential Participant has failed to attend the initial meeting, you must contact them to discuss if there were any issues which prevented them from being able to attend and make arrangements for another Face to Face meeting. A variety of communication methods should be used to do this if necessary. If some of these are proving to be unsuccessful, you may wish to contact the Jobcentre Plus work coach to ensure that the details you have received are correct.</p>

<p>2.36. If you do not get a response from your Potential Participant, you must continue to book an Initial Face to Face Meeting and notify your Potential Participant via other methods such as email or post, with enough advance notice to facilitate your Potential Participant being able to attend the specified date and time.</p>

<p>2.37. You can choose the communication methods for arranging the Initial Face to Face Meeting, and may wish to utilise more than one to encourage attendance, including reminders in advance of the meeting.</p>

<p>2.38. These steps should be repeated several times should your Potential Participant repeatedly fail to attend their Initial Face to Face meeting.</p>

<p>2.39. Where your Potential Participant does not attend the initial meeting and you have made repeated attempts to conduct it, you may consider setting it as a mandatory activity. The intent of mandating your Potential Participant to the initial meeting is to encourage attendance, and must only be considered where they have not demonstrated engagement voluntarily and there are no known challenges that would prevent them from taking part. These challenges may include advanced support or where meetings have been scheduled outside of agreed work availability restrictions.</p>

<p>2.40. You should continue to book Face to Face meetings with your Potential Participant even if they fail to attend the mandated meeting. See paragraph 2.72 on mandating to the Initial Face-to-Face Meeting.</p>

<h3>Repeated failure to attend the Initial Face to Face Meeting after 30 days</h3>

<p>2.41. Where you have made repeated attempts to engage with your Potential Participant and they have not attended an Initial Face to Face Meeting after 30 working days from the date of the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> referral, then you must close the referral as a “Did not Attend” on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: If you have raised a compliance doubt after mandating your Potential Participant to an Initial Face to Face Meeting, and they have not attended at 30 days, you must notify DWP that there is no longer a requirement for the Potential Participant to undertake the mandatory activity of the compliance condition you set using form UCD604.</p>
</div>

<p>2.42. It is only at this stage that you can close the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> referral as “Did not Attend”.</p>

<p>2.43. The claimant will then be referred back to their Jobcentre Plus work coach, and may subsequently become a new referral to Restart.</p>

<h3>Inappropriate and Duplicate Referrals</h3>

<p>2.44. In exceptional cases, inappropriate referrals may occur, for example where information regarding a claimant’s circumstances is identified after referral. Inappropriate referrals could be identified either before the Initial Face to Face Meeting has happened (Potential Participants) or after someone has started on the Restart Scheme (Participants). In this section, “Participant” means both Participant and Potential Participant.</p>

<p>2.45. Inappropriate referrals are defined as a referral made where a Participant is either not eligible or not suitable for the provision (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-1-introduction-and-overview">Restart Provider Guidance Chapter 1</a> - Introduction and Overview).</p>

<p>2.46. Where you identify an inappropriate referral, you must notify your Single Point of Contact (<abbr title="single point of contact">SPOC</abbr>) (for either the Jobcentre Plus District or individual Jobcentre Plus site, depending upon the arrangements that you have in place) and subsequently receive confirmation of the next steps from the Jobcentre Plus work coach prior to taking any action in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.47. Should the inappropriate referral be identified by the Jobcentre Plus work coach, you will be notified and then you must record the rejection or cancellation using the tables below.</p>

<p>2.48. Reasons to record for referrals that have not been acknowledged</p>

</table>

<p>Please note, a rejection or cancellation reason in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> cannot be rectified.</p>

<p>2.50. Likewise, where the eligibility criteria are met, but not the suitability criteria, your Participant will be given the choice to continue with the Restart Scheme by the Jobcentre Plus work coach. Where the eligibility criteria are met, but not the suitability criteria, the Participant may meet the discretionary referrals criteria. Your Participant will be given the choice by the Jobcentre Plus work coach, at the next Jobcentre Plus intervention, whether to continue with the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>2.51. You will be informed, by the Jobcentre Plus work coach, of your Participant’s decision and any impact that this may have, i.e. of any easement that has been applied or whether any remedial activity is required (See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 7a</a> – Change of Circumstances). Otherwise, you will be advised by the Jobcentre Plus work coach to close the referral. Please refer to the tables above for the appropriate reason to enter on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.52. Duplicate referrals are where a referral has been made for a Participant who has already been referred to and has not yet started, or is already taking part in, the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>2.53. Where a Participant has been referred more than once to the Restart Scheme but has not started on the scheme, the earlier open referral is deemed to be correct. If the duplication is discovered after the Participant has started, the referral that has the start date recorded first on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> is deemed correct. The Participants allotted time on the Restart Scheme will be calculated from this Start Date. If you have more than one Start Date recorded for different duplicate referrals see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 3</a> – Provision Start.</p>

<p>2.54. Where you identify a potential duplicate referral, you must notify your Single Point of Contact (for either the Jobcentre Plus District or individual Jobcentre Plus site, depending upon the arrangements that you have in place) and subsequently receive confirmation from the Jobcentre Plus work coach prior to rejecting or removing the new referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>. Should the duplicate be identified by the Jobcentre Plus work coach, then the Jobcentre Plus work coach will inform you so that you can reject or remove the duplicate referral from <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (<abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr>)</h2>

<p>2.55. <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> are the statutory arrangements for managing sexual and violent offenders. <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> is not a statutory body in itself but is a mechanism through which agencies can better discharge their statutory responsibilities and protect the public in a co-ordinated manner. Agencies at all times retain their full statutory responsibilities and obligations.</p>

<p>2.56. In England and Wales, the Responsible Authority (<abbr title="Responsible Authority">RA</abbr>) consists of the Police, Prison Service and Probation Service.</p>

<p>2.57. The RAs are charged with the duty and responsibility to ensure that Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (<abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr>) are established in their area and for overseeing the assessment and management of the risks of all identified <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> offenders.</p>

<h3>Employment and training restrictions</h3>

<p>2.58. Once the risk assessment has been completed, the <abbr title="Responsible Authority">RA</abbr> will notify the nominated officer within Jobcentre Plus on form <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> J/referral form of the restrictions placed upon the claimant.</p>

<p>2.59. Offenders who are released into the community and <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> managed may have time limited restrictions placed upon them by a variety of legal requirements which may affect the type of employment and training accessible to them. These restrictions could include specific license conditions or civil order prohibitions or obligations (in Scotland) such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exclusion zones and non-contact license conditions</li>
  <li>Sexual Offences Prevention Orders (<abbr title="Sexual Offences Prevention Orders">SOPO’s</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Restrictions of Liberty Order (<abbr title="Restrictions of Liberty Order">ROLO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Disqualification Orders, or</li>
  <li>Being subject to the Vetting and Barring scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>2.60. Whilst the reasons for the restrictions will be given, neither Jobcentre Plus, nor yourselves will be told about the offence/reason for a (Potential) Participant having been given <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> status, you will only be told of any restrictions placed on the (Potential) Participant by the <abbr title="Responsible Authority">RA</abbr>; these restrictions must be strictly adhered to.</p>

<p>2.61. Jobcentre Plus will be given additional information about the (Potential) Participant if it is considered that they pose a serious risk of harm to their staff, these details will be shared with your nominated officer.</p>

<p>2.62. Where a potential participant has a <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> status the warm handover will be arranged in the normal way and in that meeting the JCP Work Coach will disclose that the potential participant has “Training Restrictions” to indicate this status.  No further information will be given at this meeting.</p>

<p>2.63. As soon as practically possible after the referral has been made, but before the initial Face to Face meeting, the local Job Centre Plus <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> <abbr title="single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> will contact the Provider <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> <abbr title="single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> by telephone and disclose any restrictions that might be in place for the participant.  <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> J forms will no longer be posted out in line with security advice. Should any restrictions impact on the appropriateness of the initial face to face appointment it is the Providers responsibility to re-schedule this for a time and venue that does not conflict with the restrictions imposed on the Participant.</p>

<h2>Unacceptable Customer Behaviour (<abbr title="Unacceptable Customer Behaviour">UCB</abbr>)</h2>

<p>2.64. Claimants with Unacceptable Customer Behaviour (<abbr title="Unacceptable Customer Behaviour">UCB</abbr>) markers can be considered for a referral to the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>2.65. Where a claimant has been referred to the Restart Scheme and they have a <abbr title="Unacceptable Customer Behaviour">UCB</abbr> marker on their claim, the <abbr title="Unacceptable Customer Behaviour">UCB</abbr> <abbr title="single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> must be informed.</p>

<p>2.66. Once a referral has been made, the Jobcentre Plus <abbr title="Unacceptable Customer Behaviour">UCB</abbr> <abbr title="single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> will share any restrictions with you, that are currently being imposed on the Participant</p>

<h2>Three-way Conversations</h2>

<p>2.67. Along with the warm handovers, three-way conversations are available during the referral period or whilst the Participant is on the Restart Scheme. This can happen at the request of any of the three parties (Jobcentre Plus work coach, the Participant or you). Whilst the expectation is there will be on average, no more than two three-way calls per Participant whilst on the Restart Scheme, these conversations can positively aid engagement.</p>

<p>2.68. Should you wish to arrange a three-way conversation, then raise this with your <abbr title="single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> depending upon the local arrangements that you have in place. Following this a UC605 form can be requested by Jobcentre Plus, however, the use of this form is optional. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will then make arrangements for the three-way conversation in the same way as they make the Warm Handover arrangements. This does not mean, however, that the Participant has to be present with the Jobcentre Plus work coach for this conversation.</p>

<p>2.69. If there is a need for an urgent three-way conversation, for example, where there is a safeguarding issue, you should contact the Work Coach who will book the appointment as soon as possible, without the requirement for a UC605 form.</p>

<p>2.70. Likewise, should the Participant inform you (rather than their Jobcentre Plus work coach) that they would like a three-way conversation then follow the process above, informing your Single Point of Contact that the request has come from the Participant.</p>

<p>2.71. Any persistent non-compliance by Jobcentre Plus work coaches in attending three-way conversations (including Warm Handovers) should be raised with your Single Point of Contact (for either the Jobcentre Plus District or individual Jobcentre Plus site, depending upon the arrangements that you have in place) in the first instance.  Should the situation not be resolved, then you will need to discuss this with your Employment Account Division Performance Manager so that it can be addressed.</p>

<h2>Mandation</h2>

<p>2.72. You may consider mandation to require attendance at the initial meeting where the Potential Participant has failed to attend on previous occasions and there are no known challenges preventing them from doing so.</p>

<p>2.73. You must complete the following activities to mandate the Potential Participant to attend the Initial Face to Face Meeting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the requirement is reasonable in the Potential Participant’s circumstances</li>
  <li>consider whether the Potential Participant has any complex needs and/or additional support requirements which may affect their ability to understand or comply with the requirement</li>
  <li>notify the Potential Participant of the requirement by issuing a Mandatory Activity Notification (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>2.74. Further information regarding complex needs and advanced support can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance">Restart Provider Guidance Chapter 21</a> – Participants with Complex Needs Who May Require Advanced Support.</p>

<p>2.75. Further information regarding mandating the Potential Participant to undertake activity can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance">Restart Provider Guidance Chapter 8a</a> – Mandating Participants to Undertake Activity.</p>

<h3>Raising a compliance doubt</h3>

<p>2.76. Where you mandate a Potential Participant to attend the initial meeting and they failed to attend, you must notify the Department by raising a compliance doubt using form UCD603.</p>

<p>2.77. Further information regarding raising a compliance doubt can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance">Restart Provider Guidance Chapter 9a</a> – Raising a Compliance Doubt.</p>

<p>2.78. Once you have raised a compliance doubt, you must continue to make use of the 30 working day period to encourage attendance. However, you may not use further mandation unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have received an outcome notification and</li>
  <li>a sanction has not been imposed</li>
</ul>

<p>2.79. These further attempts may result in attendance at the initial meeting within the 30 working day period. Depending on the compliance condition you chose when mandating the Potential Participant to an initial meeting, you may accept this as compliance and must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> promptly to ensure any sanction imposed is brought to an end.</p>

<p>2.80. Where these further attempts do not result in attendance by the end of the 30 working day period and you have utilised mandation, any further requirement for the Potential Participant to take part will cease. In addition to the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> activities you are required to undertake, you must also notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> that there is no longer a requirement for the Potential Participant to undertake the mandatory activity or the compliance condition you set using form UCD604.</p>

<p>2.81. Further information regarding compliance and ceasing mandatory requirements can be found in Restart Provider Guidance Chapter 10 – Participant Compliance.</p>
