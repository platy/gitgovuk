<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>14.01. This chapter covers how we will manage performance of the Restart Scheme. To do this, we will apply our Performance Management Intervention Regime (<abbr title="Performance Management Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>) - a structured and escalating course, over four levels, of interaction and intervention, focusing on both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of your performance.</p>

<p>14.02. Working with you, this regime aims to ensure the quality delivery of provision, looking closely at customer service, job outcomes and achieving value for money for the taxpayer, all as outlined in your contract.</p>

<p>14.03. As part of the <abbr title="Performance Management Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> you will need to have in place a Provider Action Plan which should clearly focus on your top priority areas for improvement, including appropriate time-bound actions to address and resolve identified performance deficiencies.  An example of a standard Provider Action Plan along with guidance for completion is included at Annex 4 and Annex 5 respectively.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: You must have digital solutions in place for circumstances whereby Face to Face meetings in person are unable to take place, for example. COVID-19, Local Restrictions. The requirement to adopt this digital solution will be advised by or made in consultation with DWP.</p>
</div>

<p>Further information on the <abbr title="Performance Management Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> is in Annex 1.</p>

<h2>Working Together</h2>

<h3>Contract Performance Reviews</h3>

<p>14.04. An integral part of the <abbr title="Performance Management Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> is the Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>). These meetings take place on a regular basis, usually each month, and are chaired by your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager (<abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>). Local colleagues from Jobcentre Plus may also attend these meetings.</p>

<p>14.05. At least five calendar days prior to each <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>, you will need to upload your Provider Action Plan to the Jaggaer system. Information from your Monthly Performance Return, your Action Plan and our Management Information will form a key basis for the discussion. Your performance will be viewed against the performance metrics and your obligations, as detailed in your contract.</p>

<p>14.06. If you have sub-contractors within your delivery model for this contract, your responsibility and how you manage their delivery will also form part of the discussions, including, for example, how you plan to address any poor performance.  You will need to ensure that all systems and processes used for the monitoring and recording of performance are robust and provide a clear audit trail of evidence providing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with the assurance that you and your supply chain are delivering the contract as required.</p>

<p>14.07. More detailed information about <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPRs</abbr> can be found in Annex 2.</p>

<h3>Performance Compliance Officers (<abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCOs</abbr>) and their checks</h3>

<p>14.08. Performance Compliance Officers (<abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCOs</abbr>) work closely with the <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> and undertake regular evidence-based reviews to check your performance against Customer Service Standards 2-7 and provide assurance that you, as a provider, are adhering to the delivery model set out in your contract.</p>

<p>14.09. <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCOs</abbr> will check a sample of Restart Scheme Participant records held by you, to determine what required activities have been undertaken, and when. The scope of these compliance checks will be shared with you.</p>

<p>14.10. The checking sample will be selected randomly using <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Provider Referral and Payments (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) system. The frequency, periodicity and size of the samples may change throughout the life of the contract and, for example, where a Provider holds two Restart Scheme contracts, a single sample may be drawn from across both contracts.</p>

<p>14.11. Details of the sample to be checked, will be uploaded to the Jaggaer system no less than five working days prior to the checks being carried out, see example at Annex 3a. We expect that you will undertake your own compliance checks on the sample and upload the completed sample to the Jaggaer system at least 24 hours in advance of the agreed meeting date. This will allow time for the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> to review your findings and ensure that you and the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> can have a fully informed discussion as the checks are undertaken.</p>

<p>14.12. Our checks may be conducted through the use of digital channels or by face to face means, or a combination of both, and we will let you know the logistics in advance. For example, digital checks may be conducted using Microsoft Teams, where you will be expected to share your screen with the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> completing the evidence checks.  If the checks are face to face, these may be centralised in a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> location.</p>

<p>14.13. All evidence must be available on your <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> system for inspection and you should utilise equipment which can be used remotely and which complies with the relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policies for face to face and digital use, as defined in your contract’s Terms and Conditions.  In the case of face to face checks, if the location to be used is a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> location, you should bring the necessary equipment to enable the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> to carry out centralised checks of your systems - this includes the provision of any necessary electronic evidence that is required by the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> to undertake the checks effectively.</p>

<p>14.14. The findings from the checks will be shared with you and relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholders on the Summary Report. An example of a completed Summary Report can be found at Annex 3b. This will usually be within 12 working days of the checks being completed. <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPRs</abbr> will usually include a discussion about the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> checks, especially any issues that have been identified and the actions that you are undertaking to resolve these. These actions should be included on your Action Plan. An example of an Action Plan is included at Annex 4, with guidance on the completion of this shown at Annex 5.</p>

<h3>Checks and Visits undertaken by your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>
</h3>

<p>14.15. Your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> may undertake other, additional checks to complement those already undertaken by the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr>, at their discretion if they have performance concerns or an area of weakness is identified. Your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will normally discuss with you in advance the reasons for these checks, and how they will be undertaken – this could be by digital means or by visiting your premises. However, the <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> may also conduct an unannounced visit if they have, for example, concerns regarding customer facing interactions.</p>

<p>14.16. This may include a ‘go-look-see’ approach where your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will observe a range of activities, including initial face to face meetings, diagnostic assessments, job search, and other support you deliver in line with your contract. This approach will include your end-to-end delivery partners and/or sub-contractors (if appropriate). PMs may also undertake ‘deep dives’ into specific areas to help to identify and better understand areas of weakness.</p>

<p>14.17. Your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>, or other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance colleague(s) such as the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr>, may ask to attend your sub-contractor/end-to-end delivery and supply chain partner meetings and may also visit your premises on an ad-hoc (announced and unannounced) basis to better understand your performance.</p>

<p>14.18. Your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will provide you with a summary of the findings from these activities, and they will discuss with you at your next <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> or other appropriate forum. Any remedial action you plan to do is agreed and added to your action plan.</p>

<h3>Performance Assurance Team (<abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) and their work</h3>

<p>14.19. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) seeks to provide <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with an assurance that your internal control systems are such that payments made to you are in accordance with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s and HM Treasury’s requirements.</p>

<p>14.20. The <abbr title="Performance Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> reviews will test your internal control systems to establish how effective they are at managing risk to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in relation to expenditure and service delivery. These reviews will also include the arrangements you have with your supply chain partners, where appropriate.</p>

<p>14.21. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-23-controls-and-risk-management-assurance">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 23</a> – Controls and Risk Management Assurance.</p>

<h3>Local Engagement Meetings (<abbr title="Local Engagement Meetings">LEMs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>14.22. The LEMS in your Contract Package Area (<abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>) are attended by Jobcentre Plus Partnership Managers, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> and other representatives from local authorities.  Feedback from this meeting may form part of the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-12-stakeholder-and-employer-engagement">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 12</a> – Stakeholder and employer engagement.</p>

<h3>Stakeholder Forums</h3>

<p>14.23. At a national level, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will host regular Operations, partnership and engagement, and stakeholder forums. These meetings will look to provide an opportunity to review the performance and delivery of the Restart Scheme at a more strategic, and higher, level.</p>

<h2>Performance and the Performance Metrics</h2>

<p>14.24. From the start of your contract, we expect you to achieve each of the Performance Metrics. These are the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delivery Fee Standards</li>
  <li>Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Performance Indicator (<abbr title="Performance Indicator">PI</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Minimum Performance Level</li>
  <li>Tender Performance Level</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance Delivery and Expectations</h3>

<p>14.25. Throughout the life of the contract, we will review your performance in each of the above areas. To do this, we will use our available management information, whether from our systems and/or from the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> checks, the Management Information that you provide, and with the approach as detailed in our <abbr title="Performance Management Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>.</p>

<p>14.26. If any of the above Metrics are not achieved, whether that’s on an in-month, rolling basis, cohort, or cumulative basis, we may consider using an appropriate contract lever as detailed within your contract. We may also consider recovering any costs we incur as a result of our performance improvement activity with you, again as detailed in your contract.</p>

<h3>Delivery Fee Standards</h3>

<p>14.27. For the first year of your contract, the Delivery Fee that you receive will be dependent on your staffing levels covered in the next two paragraphs and also the achievement of <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> covered in para 14.30-14.36, and if appropriate this includes those of your supply chain partners.</p>

<p>14.28. On the first working day each month, you will need to provide <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, via the Jaggaer system, with detailed information about the staff Full Time Equivalent (<abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr>), in a management or direct delivery role, who are employed on your contract.  We will provide a standardised template for this purpose. We will compare this information against the agreed monthly staffing levels that you detailed in your contract.</p>

<p>14.29. If any monthly return does not show the numbers, or level of staff <abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr> that are expected to be working on this contract, we will consider reducing the monthly Delivery Fee should the % of staff <abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr> fall below 95%. Further information about forfeiture of the monthly Delivery Fee can be found in the Restart Specification Section 4 paras 4.47-4.51.</p>

<h3>Customer Service Standards  (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>14.30. There are eight <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>, that we expect you to deliver against, within this contract. These are shown in Annex 6.</p>

<p>14.31. We will use a mixture of Management Information held on our systems, findings from our <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> checks, and from regular customer-focused surveys, to review your performance against the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>.</p>

<p>14.32. The <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> focus on key elements in the participant’s journey on this provision, with the CSS1 looking at the time taken from the point of the referral from Jobcentre Plus to completing the initial face to face meeting – performance here will be determined by the management information derived from the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> system.</p>

<p>14.33. The remaining <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>, with the exception of the one focusing on Customer Satisfaction (CSS8), will be measured through structured and periodic checks conducted by our <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCOs</abbr>. These checks, of a sample of cases and usually each month, will look to assure you are delivering your service in accordance with your delivery model and, as a minimum the monthly sample of checks are compliant in at least 95% of cases.   Where more than one of these checks is marked as a ‘fail’, we will look to undertake further work, which may include more checks.</p>

<p>14.34. The final CSS8 is focused on Customer Satisfaction rates and will be measured through a survey of a number of your participants. We expect to see a high degree of customer satisfaction and your performance here will be assessed, on a relative basis, against the performance in each of the provision’s <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPAs</abbr>. The surveys will be carried out by an independent third party who is contracted to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for this purpose.</p>

<p>14.35. Performance against each <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr> will form a key part of your <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> discussion with your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> each month.</p>

<p>14.36. Each <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr> will be treated independently, therefore if your performance against any of the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> falls below the level that we expect, we will consider whether the amount of your monthly Delivery Fee is deferred, forfeited or whether other contractual action is appropriate.  Further information about the deferral or forfeiture of part of the monthly Delivery Fee in relation to <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr> 1-7 can be found within Restart Specification Chapter 4 paras 4.52-4.56.</p>

<h3>Performance Indicator (<abbr title="Performance Indicator">PI</abbr>)</h3>

<p>14.37. As one of the Performance Metrics, the Earnings Performance Indicator (<abbr title="Performance Indicator">PI</abbr>) provides an early insight on the number of job outcomes you may achieve in the coming months.</p>

<p>14.38. This <abbr title="Performance Indicator">PI</abbr> will show the number of participants, each month, that need to start work and receive their first earnings so that the relevant Required Number of Outcomes (<abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr>), is achieved. We will regularly review the <abbr title="Performance Indicator">PI</abbr> and if we see that the level is not being achieved or we believe that without further intervention, the <abbr title="Performance Indicator">PI</abbr> will fall to a level that means the <abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr> won’t be achieved, then we may issue a Performance Indicator Course of Action Notice (<abbr title="Performance Indicator Course of Action Notice">PICAN</abbr>). Further details on this Notice can be found in your contract.</p>

<h3>Tender Performance Level (<abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr>) and Minimum Performance Level (<abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr>)</h3>

<p>14.39. As part of your contract, we expect that you will achieve your Tender Performance Level (<abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr>) and accordingly, our Minimum Performance Level (<abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr>). The <abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr> is part of the offer you made within your successful bid and is the percentage of starts you believe will move into employment and achieve the Earnings Threshold. This threshold is calculated at 16 hours per week for 26 weeks at the National Living Wage (<abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>).</p>

<p>14.40. The <abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr> is set as our minimum expectation that 25% of starts will achieve the Earnings Threshold.</p>

<p>14.41. For each of the <abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr> and <abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr>, we will apply a performance curve, or expectation for the month in which we expect the threshold to be reached for a given percentage of the participants who have entered employment. This helps to calculate the <abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr> in any given month. Further detail on how this calculation is made can be found in Annex 8 of the Specification.</p>

<p>14.42. If the <abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr> expected for the <abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr> or <abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr> is not achieved in any given period, we will consider intervention action as outlined in our <abbr title="Performance Management Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> and/or contractual action as detailed in your contract.</p>

<h3>Relative Performance</h3>

<p>14.43. Across all of the Performance Metrics, and not just for CSS8, we will review performance on a relative basis.</p>

<p>14.44. We will use ranking tables to monitor performance across <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPAs</abbr> and Providers, to drive continuous improvement within this provision.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr>, cohorts, and Management Information</h2>

<p>14.45. As outlined in earlier paragraphs within this chapter, achieving the <abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr> is how we will determine if you are meeting the <abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr> and <abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr> for this provision.</p>

<p>14.46. As well as the performance curve, a percentage of the <abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr> and <abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr> that is to be achieved increases year on year, is also part of the calculation of <abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr>. This percentage starts at 85% of the <abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr> and <abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr> to be achieved in the first year, rising to 90% for year 2, 100% for year 3 and 115% in years 4 and 5. It is important that you ensure that as one year moves into the next, that sufficient outcomes are being achieved to prevent any possible shortfall in the coming year.</p>

<p>More detailed information about this calculation, can be found in Annex 8 of the Specification.</p>

<p>14.47. Throughout the life of your contract, we will measure your RNO performance against the <abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr> and <abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr> on a cohort basis, viewed in-month, on a rolling 3-month, rolling 12-month, and cumulative basis from day one of the contract.</p>

<p>14.48. Performance data will be taken from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> data for employed participants, our <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> system and, in the case of self-employed participants, from outcome claims submitted by you.</p>

<p>14.49. Each month, we will produce a Management Information Pack detailing performance against the <abbr title="Performance Indicator">PI</abbr>, <abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr>, <abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr>, CSS1 and CSS8 which we will share with you.  You must treat this information, and any other information for this provision that you have access to, as confidential and for your sole use.</p>

<h3>Employed and Self-employment Job Outcomes Information</h3>

<p>14.50. As part of the Payment by Results (<abbr title="Payment by Results">PbR</abbr>) funding model, Job Outcomes (and the resulting performance) can be categorised as being employed and self-employed.  Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-17-funding-model-and-claim-process">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17</a> – Funding model and claim process.</p>

<p>14.51. For employed participants, we will use <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Pay as you Earn (<abbr title="Pay as you Earn">PAYE</abbr>) data captured through Real Time Earnings (<abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>) to monitor your progress and achievement towards meeting the <abbr title="Performance Indicator">PI</abbr> and the <abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr> and the <abbr title="Tender Performance Level">TPL</abbr>.</p>

<p>14.52. An employed Job Outcome will be automatically paid when a Restart Scheme Participant, within 547 calendar days from a participant start on provision, accumulates earnings that are equal to or exceed the equivalent of someone working for 16 hours per week for 26 weeks earning the <abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr> ‘earnings threshold’.</p>

<p>14.53. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> on-line data is submitted by employers each time an employee is paid and outcomes achieved by you will be based on this data. We will share this information with you, in the form of a <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> Notifications Report, via our <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> system.</p>

<p>14.54. This report includes</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a participant’s earnings are first declared to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, following a confirmed start on this provision;</li>
  <li>when a participant’s earnings reach both £1,000 and £2,000;</li>
  <li>when the earning threshold is reached; and</li>
  <li>if a participant’s employment has ended, and when</li>
</ul>

<p>14.55. These individual notifications are often referred to as ‘pings’.</p>

<p>14.56. For self-employed Participants, a Job Outcome will be achieved when a Participant has achieved a cumulative period of not less than 6-months of self-employment within the 547 days qualifying period, having started their self-employment within 365 days on provision. The 547-day qualifying period comprises of the allotted time on the programme (365 days) plus the 182-day tracking period.</p>

<p>14.57. Further information regarding employed and self-employment Job Outcomes can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-17-funding-model-and-claim-process">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17</a> – Funding model and claim process.</p>

<h2>Monthly Performance Return</h2>

<p>14.58. In addition to the above performance data, you will be required to provide a Monthly Performance Return (<abbr title="Monthly Performance Return">MPR</abbr>) of further key information, for example, staffing levels and caseload sizes, including those of your supply chain by the first working day of the month.  This will form part of the discussions you have with your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> around performance and performance improvement and, for example, for the Delivery Fee Standards.</p>

<h2>Annex 1: Performance Management Intervention Regime (<abbr title="Performance Management Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>)</h2>

<p>We operate a robust Performance Management Regime (<abbr title="Performance Management Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>), the aim to provide support, and hold you accountable for achievement of the performance metrics stipulated in your contract.</p>

<p>You are expected to meet as a minimum, the performance levels attached to each of the performance metrics as stipulated in your contract, and we consider formal action where such performance levels are not met.</p>

<p>You will need to provide us with a named contact who will work with our <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> to ensure the performance metrics at <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> level are achieved.</p>

<p>There are four levels of the <abbr title="Performance Management Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> which can run independently or concurrently and we will be able to take action at any level, at any time for example we will be entitled to take formal action at Level 4 whether or not it has taken all of the steps outlined at levels 1, 2 and/or 3.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The PMIR framework will be used to address under performance, however nothing in the PMIR will prejudice the remedies available to DWP for failure to meet any Performance Metrics.</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Standard Action:  <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager Led</li>
  <li>Level 2: Enhanced action: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager/Senior Performance Manager Led</li>
  <li>Level 3: Informal action: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Senior Management Led, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> National Provision Lead</li>
  <li>Level 4: Formal action: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Senior Management Led, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> National Provision Lead and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Commercial Lead</li>
</ul>

<p>Your <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> must have in place a provider action plan submitted by your Contract Operational Lead to the <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> regardless of what intervention level you are in. The provider action plan is required to be in place immediately following the contract implementation period (from contract go live).</p>

<p>The purpose of the Provider Action Plan is to provide us with assurance that you have identified the top priority areas for improvement. All actions in the plan should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound (<abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time bound">SMART</abbr>) and any longer term actions should incorporate <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time bound">SMART</abbr> milestone targets. It may also include incremental performance and pipeline data that may lead to outcomes to improve the achievement of the performance metrics in line with the Contract.</p>

<p>An example of a standard Provider Action Plan along with guidance for completion is included at Annex 3 and Annex 4 respectfully.  Although we strongly encourage use of the standard Action Plan, you may use your own format provided it covers as a minimum all elements of the standard Action Plan.</p>

<p>At each level of intervention, your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will continue to work closely with you with, the frequency of meetings, scope and types of activity increasing where improvements are not seen, examples of these activities are listed within Intervention Level 1 below.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will hold regular <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPRs</abbr> with you at <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> level focussing on the performance against quantitative and qualitative aspects of the contract including, but not limited to in-month, rolling 3-months, rolling 12-month cohort or cumulative basis from Day 1 of the contract. More detail on <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPRs</abbr> is covered in Annex 2.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPRs</abbr> will be arranged by your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>, Jobcentre Plus representatives and other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff may also attend these meetings, for example <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> or SPM Manager. Your first <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> will be arranged during the contract implementation period.</p>

<h3>Level 1: Standard action: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Management led</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will hold regular <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> meetings with you which will focus on achieving the contractual Performance Metrics. This will include for example</p>

</ul>

<h3>Level 2: Enhanced Action: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager/Senior Performance Manager led</h3>

<p>Whilst at Level 1, if it is determined that you may not achieve the performance levels expected, your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> may undertake informal action to escalate you to Level 2 intervention and you will be notified of this in writing.</p>

<p>You will be required to enhance your Provider Action Plan, to capture all agreed actions for performance improvement. You will also be required to provide a flightpath including incremental performance and pipeline data that may lead to outcomes to improve the achievement of the performance levels and <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> in line with the Contract with the format to be agreed with your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>.</p>

<p>Some of the Key activities which may be utilised in level 2 are as listed within level 1 intervention.</p>

<h3>Level 3: Informal Action: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Senior Management Led – <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> National Provision Lead</h3>

<p>If the remedial actions at Level 2 were unable to lift your performance in order to meet the performance levels and <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> in the Contract, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> SPM can propose escalation to Level 3.</p>

<p>You will be invited to a meeting to discuss your performance with Senior Managers and you will receive a Management letter requesting that your performance improves. At this stage you will be informed that formal action could be taken in the event that performance doesn’t improve.</p>

<p>Some of the key activities which may be utilised are as listed in Level 1 intervention.</p>

<h3>Level 4: Formal Action: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Senior Management Led – <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> National Provision Lead and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Commercial Lead</h3>

<h2>Annex 5: Provider Action Plan Completion Guidance</h2>

<p>This annex covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>General principles for completion</li>
  <li>Header Table completion</li>
  <li>Monthly Contract Update completion</li>
  <li>Specific Areas Requiring Action</li>
  <li>Annexes to Action Plan</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This guidance has been produced to support the completion and application of the standard Provider Action Plan (<abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr>). You are encouraged to use of the standard <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr>.  An <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr> should be in place unless you are notified otherwise.</p>

<h3>General principles for completion</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr> should be succinct and <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time bound">SMART</abbr> (Specific; Measureable; Achievable; Realistic; Time-bound) focussing on activities to improve performance, delivery and address key risk areas at <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> level, it should be focussed avoiding lengthy narratives.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will review your completed <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr> to ensure that it addresses areas of concern, that the content is fit for purposes and focusses on appropriate actions to address and resolve identified performance deficiencies.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr> should be a living document which is reviewed monthly, with completed actions removed and new actions added as risks/issues arise. Actions should only be removed or added by mutual consent of the Provider Accountable Lead and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> (usually at the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>).  A new version should be forwarded by the provider each month, and previous versions archived.</p>

<p>You should upload your updated monthly <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr> to the Jaggaer system five working days prior to the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Header Table completion</h3>

<p>You should complete the header table with details specific to the contract: i.e. Date, Provider name, <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>, Provider Accountable Lead, <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> and SPM.</p>

<p>The “date updated” box should initially show the date of first completion and then be amended to reflect the date of each subsequent monthly update.</p>

<p>The “Provider Accountable Lead” named on the <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr> should have overall accountability regardless of who is undertaking each action on the plan within your organisation.  This should normally be your contract operational lead who attends <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> meetings. They will have overall responsibility for delivering the plan and reporting progress against actions and milestones on a monthly basis.</p>

<h3>Monthly Contract Update completion</h3>

<p>Each month you should complete a narrative giving an overview of current contract performance and activity, highlighting any changes since the previous month’s update and reasons why.  This may include an explanation of any variance from the flight path (if applicable), an account of what went well and not so well (and reasons for it) and an assessment of any emerging risks and opportunities identified.  You should additionally highlight any action being taken to rectify issues and mitigate risks.</p>

<h3>Specific Areas Requiring Action</h3>

<p>You should identify all areas of contract concern impacting performance and delivery.  Where you are subject to an intervention regime higher than Level 1, <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr> should include actions specifically to address the reasons you have been placed in the regime level.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr> template provides a tab for each area identified which should be numbered sequentially.  You should add further tabs as required as new areas are identified.  It should be clear what the area is to be addressed and what the outcome objective is, i.e. the specific performance uplift expected.</p>

<p>Every area identified should then have corrective action(s). It is suggested that the <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr> should contain a maximum of 5 top priority areas for improvement/corrective actions, e.g. job starts, <abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr>, staffing, caseload sizes (this list is not exhaustive).  Each action should be clear and <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time bound">SMART</abbr>, showing how they are to be achieved.  If someone other than the Provider Accountable Lead will be responsible for undertaking an action, the Provider may wish to provide a name, however, the Provider Accountable Lead shall have ultimate responsibility for delivering on the actions and providing progress updates.</p>

<p>Avoid lengthy documents being created by long, narrative filled columns, there is a column to the right of the actions for the provider to specify a target date for completion of each action.</p>

<p>Each month you should complete an update on progress made against the action(s).  Once an Action is completed, this will be removed the following month.</p>

<h3>Annexes to Action Plan</h3>

<p>Not all levels of intervention will require you to produce a Flightpath (<abbr title="Flightpath">FP</abbr>), however, we will inform you where this is a requirement.  Where this is the case, you should embed your completed <abbr title="Flightpath">FP</abbr> template in the Flightpath Tab and update it each month.</p>

<p>You should complete a summary breakdown of current performance of all direct delivery sites and Supply Chain partners in a format to be agreed with your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>, updated each month.  This can either be presented in a single tab or by inserting the appropriate performance information in a tab which corresponds with the ‘Area to be addressed and outcome objective’.</p>

<p>Additional Annexes should be kept to a minimum to avoid the <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr> becoming a bulky document that is onerous to review and manage.  Your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will agree with you any other information to be supplied to support their scrutiny of a contract and help identify further actions to be included on the <abbr title="Action Plan">AP</abbr>.</p>
