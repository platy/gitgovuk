<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>6.01. This chapter covers your role and responsibilities in respect of the reimbursement of expenses for your Participants.</p>

<h2>General Expenses Requirements</h2>

<p>6.02. You are required to actively promote the access to funding for travel, childcare and other expenses to your Participants throughout their time on the Restart Scheme, and ensure that they are no worse off.</p>

<p>6.03. You must make your Participant aware of any out of pocket expenses that they can claim from you for their initial meeting, and that they are offered access to, and reimbursement of any appropriate expenses at all future interventions whilst they remain on the Restart Scheme. You should advise your Participants of the evidence you will need them to produce to claim refunds of travel costs e.g. bus tickets when they commence the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>6.04. Whilst your Participants are expected to travel by the cheapest method available to them, there will be occasions where some Participants will be unable to travel by the cheapest method, e.g. due to a disability. In these instances, you will need to refund any additional costs incurred, which you will have agreed taking into account all viable options with your Participant prior to their travel.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: You must ensure that you comply with current HMRC Guidance if you make payments or provide benefits e.g. travel cards, to your Participants after they have started work, which relate to that employment. You should inform your Participant that Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) are payable and how this will be done. Failure to account for Tax and NICs that are due on payments made to Participants in employment may be subject to penalties in accordance with current HMRC regulations.</p>
</div>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>6.05. You are responsible for funding travel costs incurred by your Participant when attending interventions and activities in connection with the Restart Scheme. This includes interviews arranged by you, for example, to undertake work related activities, job interviews, or other related interviews.</p>

<p>6.06. If your Participant commences work, then you are not responsible for travel costs connected with that employment. Should you wish to offer to fund travel costs, this will be at your discretion and needs to comply with any <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> guidelines, and are not claimable from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. However, you remain responsible for travel expenses relating to any actual Restart Scheme activity, until your Participant becomes an early exit or Restart Scheme completer.</p>

<h2>Childcare</h2>

<p>6.07. You must provide funding for childcare, to support your Participant in an activity that you have, or are approving, where it has been identified as a barrier for your Participant to achieve agreed goals and objectives. Childcare needs to be provided by the following to qualify for funding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carers registered with OFSTED</li>
  <li>a carer accredited under the Childcare Approval Scheme, run on school premises out of school hours or as an out of hours’ club by a Local Authority</li>
  <li>schools or establishments exempted from registration under the Children Act 1989 or operated on Crown property</li>
</ul>

<p>6.08. Where your Participant makes alternative arrangements, costs should only be reimbursed where the provision of childcare falls into one of the above categories.</p>

<p>6.09. Prior to the reimbursement of childcare costs, you must check that the child or children satisfy the age requirement, and are a dependant of and reside with your Participant. Support for childcare costs can be paid for each child up to and including the 31st August, following that child’s sixteenth birthday.</p>

<p>6.10. To ensure that you or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> do not take on liability for the safety of children, you must not recommend any particular childcare facilities to your Participants. It is always the parents’ responsibility to decide whom they entrust the care of their children with. In addition, whilst you may have crèche facilities or childcare facilities on your premises that adhere to current legislation, it must be the parent’s choice to use those facilities.
Replacement Care</p>

<p>6.11. You are expected to provide funding for replacement care costs, to support your Participant in an activity that you have, or are approving, where it has been identified as a barrier for your Participant to achieve agreed goals and objectives for Participants who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are aged 18 or over</li>
  <li>are eligible and currently on the Restart Scheme</li>
  <li>have spent a significant proportion of their lives providing unpaid support to relatives, partners or friends who are ill, frail, disabled or have a mental health or a substance misuse problem</li>
</ul>

<p>6.12. Prior to agreeing the payment for replacement care costs you may wish to consider other alternatives, such as moving the time or date of the activity or meeting. Where replacement care costs have been accepted, then carers must be participating in an approved activity or incur one-off replacement care costs when attending an interview with you or an employer, which has been pre-arranged and agreed by you.</p>

<p>6.13. You need to ensure prior to agreement of funding for any costs that the replacement care is provided by a Local Authority Registered Provider, a Local Authority Preferred Provider, or a recognised care organisation within the local area.</p>

<p>6.14. To ensure that you or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> do not take on liability for the safety of the individual requiring care you must not recommend any particular providers, organisations or facilities to your Participant. It is always the responsibility of the carer or person being cared for to make any arrangements.</p>

<h2>Disclosure and Barring Service Checks</h2>

<p>6.15. Where your Participant undertakes any activity, in agreement with you, that requires a basic check permitted by the Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>), then you are responsible for funding any associated costs with regard to undertaking this check.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: Disclosure and Barring Service helps employers make safer recruitment decisions each year by processing and issuing DBS checks for England, Wales, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. DBS also maintains the adults’ and children’s Barred Lists and makes considered decisions as to whether an individual should be included on one or both of these lists and barred from engaging in regulated activity. Employers will retain the responsibility for the higher level DBS check if employing your Participant.
