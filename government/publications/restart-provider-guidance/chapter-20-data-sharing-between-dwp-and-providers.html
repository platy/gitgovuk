<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>20.01. This Chapter covers what elements of information and data will be shared between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and yourselves. Explaining the different types of data that will be shared with you, the sources and the overarching data security processes and principles. The use of and specific processes associated with different data sources is covered elsewhere in the Restart Scheme Provider Guidance.</p>

<p>20.02. Please note that Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 14 – Performance Management specifically covers management information and data-capture linked to the performance management of the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>20.03. In relation to receiving, sharing, and storing information, you will have submitted your policies, plans and specific information to Commercial Directorate during the procurement or start-up phases of the programme. Once this information has been assured by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> it demonstrates your suitability to receive and store information and confirms you comply with our <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Security Policy (which includes compliance with standards such as ISO/IEC27001). Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-procurement-security-policies-and-standards"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Procurement: Security Policies and Standards</a> and Schedule 6 of your contract.</p>

<p>20.04. It is also essential that your organisation understands what is required under <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> within each of your contracts, if you are unsure you should seek <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> advice from your Performance Manager.</p>

<h2>Data transfer at the start of the Restart Scheme</h2>

<p>20.05. When potential Participants are referred to the Restart Scheme, we will send you personal and sensitive information. This data must be securely stored with procedures in place which allow it to be retrieved from your systems. Some or all the data may be forwarded to your sub-contractors. Individual data items are listed here:</p>

<p>(Note: this list is not exhaustive):</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name including title</li>
  <li>National Insurance number (<abbr title="National Insurance number">NINO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>full address including post code</li>
  <li>telephone number(s) including mobile or area code</li>
  <li>unique Provider Referral and Payments (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) Referral identifier</li>
  <li>client number</li>
  <li>qualifications
    <ul>
      <li>level</li>
      <li>subject</li>
      <li>outcome</li>
      <li>start date</li>
      <li>end date</li>
      <li>basic skills assessment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>employment status / previous job dates</li>
  <li>aims (free text Field)</li>
  <li>job preferences / preferred hours</li>
</ul>

<p>20.06. This information will be transferred to you via the Department’s Provider Referral and Payment System (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>). For Participants under Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangement (<abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr>) restrictions, however, the address, postcode and contact telephone number will not be supplied. Further information on arrangements for <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> referrals can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2: Referral Process and Initial Engagement.</p>

<p>20.07. If you are unsure as to which data-transfer method should be used, please consult with your Performance Manager in the first instance.</p>

<p>20.08. <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> has a robust security level in relation to data storage which is reviewed annually or via system updates. In addition to this other controls include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ability to limit provider access until they have met the Department’s security standards</li>
  <li>Access Control – audits are undertaken every 60 days to ensure the right people have access</li>
  <li>provider access via Government Gateway - this is a secure internet gateway which has its own security standards (owned by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>))</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data transfer during the Restart Scheme</h2>

<p>20.09. When we become aware of any changes to your Participant’s information, we will alert you via a change of circumstances notification. If you are made aware your Participant’s circumstances have changed, you must tell them that it is their responsibility to declare any changes of circumstances. <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants should inform their Jobcentre Plus work coach directly or by updating their Universal Credit account. Income-based Jobseekers Allowance (JSA (IB)) claimants should do this by contacting the Jobseekers Allowance Helpline or writing to their local Jobcentre Plus. Further information can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 7 A/B – Change of Circumstances.</p>

<p>20.10. There are also circumstances, in relation to your Participant’s undertaking activities on the Restart Scheme, where we expect you to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. For example, if you have mandated your Participant to an activity and they fail to attend or if Participant’s fail to engage with the Scheme. Please see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 8 A/B - Mandating Participants to Undertake Activity.</p>

<p>20.11. You must also notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> when you or your sub-contractors directly employ a Restart Scheme Participant in your employment business. Please refer to and follow the process outlined in the Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17 – Funding Model and Claim Process.</p>

<p>20.12. Claiming job outcomes under the Payment by Results (<abbr title="Payment by Results">PbR</abbr>) funding model will also be done via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will validate employment outcomes using employer <abbr title="Pay as you Earn">PAYE</abbr> (Pay As You Earn) earnings data submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, we will share some information about your Participant’s earnings with you. You will be able to view reports in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> via the iSupplier Portal, which will include information of when your Participant’s first earnings have been recorded, when earnings reach £1,000 and £2,000, and confirmation that they have reached the earning threshold to achieve an outcome.</p>

<p>20.13. For Participants entering self-employment, you will manually submit claims for payment to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> which will include specific information that allows the validation process to be fully carried out. Further information on employed and self-employed job outcomes can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17 – Funding Model and Claim Process, and Chapter 18 – Validation.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

<p>20.14. You must have policies and controls to manage information sharing with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, subcontractors, service delivery partners and other third parties. This includes the need for procedures and policies for the use of encryption where appropriate. You may only share information in line with your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contract. If you require advice regarding sharing information, please discuss with your Performance Manager in the first instance.</p>

<h2>Email security</h2>

<p>20.15. When sending <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> data by email you and your sub-contractors must first ensure that the recipient is entitled to receive that data and has a legitimate business need for the information to be sent.</p>

<p>20.16. The sender is responsible for ensuring the safe transmission of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> data ensuring all relevant standards are always adhered to.</p>

<p>20.17. The method that you choose must be the most secure method available to you and have been reviewed and approved by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> during the life of the contract.</p>

<p>20.18. You should only send the minimum amount of data needed to make the communication effective.</p>

<p>20.19. Any failure to follow these standards will result in a reportable security incident occurring. Should you have any queries regarding these standards please complete the Security Incident Response Team Referral Form (<abbr title="Security Incident Response Team Referral Form">SIRF</abbr>) at Annex 4 and send the completed form to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Security Incident Response Team. <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:SECURITYINCIDENT.RESPONSETEAM-SIRT-@DWP.GOV.UK">SECURITYINCIDENT.RESPONSETEAM-SIRT-@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>

<p>20.20. If your security incident is very serious please contact SIRT on 0191 216 2566. The SIRT telephone number is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and is reserved for very serious incidents only. A very serious security incident could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a significant risk to the rights and freedoms of a citizen</li>
  <li>when data has been lost that includes personal identifiable information</li>
  <li>when there is evidence of reputational damage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use of unencrypted email</h2>

<p>20.21. You are permitted to use unencrypted email when sharing data with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will inform you of when specific processes and other scenarios where unencrypted email may be used which will be referenced in each specific Chapter of this guidance. We recommend you regularly review the use of unencrypted email with your Performance Manager.</p>

<p>20.22. The following, are typical examples of when unencrypted email will be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>raising a Compliance Doubt and notifying Participant re-compliance following a sanction</li>
  <li>reporting Changes of Circumstances</li>
  <li>notifying <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> team that you or your supply chain are employing a Participant, using the Restart Scheme - Provider Employing a Participant template</li>
  <li>performance Reporting returns</li>
  <li>compliance Monitoring returns/correspondence</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This list above is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>20.23. Please ensure emails contain clear subject line titles so your communication intent is clear and concise to the recipient. When using unencrypted email, you should be mindful of what data is being sent, who the recipient is and if there is a genuine business need to send that data as failure to adhere to this constitutes a reportable incident.</p>

<p>20.24. The following restrictions relate to the processes in the above paragraph and will include all or part of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only one record per email (except for the requirements to share information between Prime Providers, their Supply Chain and Third parties)</li>
  <li>standard email content</li>
  <li>standard template completed and included in email</li>
  <li>where instructed, email sent from and to a designated inbox</li>

  <li>if incorrectly addressed mail is received; you must ensure appropriate care is taken to safeguard the package until the correct recipient is known. The package should then be sent to the correct recipients using a similar ‘fully tracked’ service</li>
  <li>it is the sender’s responsibility to consider the scale and sensitivity of the information that is being sent, and whether additional security (i.e. using a fully tracked service) is required</li>
</ul>
