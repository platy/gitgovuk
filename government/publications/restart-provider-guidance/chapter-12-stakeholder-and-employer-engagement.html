<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>12.01. A key objective of the Restart Scheme is that it should be tailored to local needs and responsive to changes in the labour market, at a local level throughout the contract. This objective was designed to support the delivery of a tailored service for each Participant, allowing the best possible chance of getting into employment. Collaborative working at a local level will aid in building a positive perception for the Restart Scheme amongst stakeholders and Participants, which is critical to securing the buy-in necessary to achieve outcomes for individuals.</p>

<p>12.02. This chapter sets out what you should and must do to identify and engage with stakeholders as part of delivering a flexible, locally tailored offer.</p>

<h2>Effective Stakeholder Engagement</h2>

<p>12.03. Your Restart Scheme delivery model, as set out in your contract, should be locally tailored, and adaptable to complement local initiatives in your Contract Package Area (<abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>). You must design interventions which are aligned to local growth sectors, opportunities (e.g., training initiatives) and challenges (e.g., transport barriers, skills gaps) and work closely with employers and stakeholders to maximise local job opportunities for your Participants. The design of your Restart Scheme support offer and local stakeholder engagement, should add value locally and avoid duplication.</p>

<p>12.04. Restart Scheme <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPAs</abbr> typically cover large geographic areas, and will cover local economies with differing needs, employers and employment growth areas. The design and delivery of your Restart Scheme offer should be flexible to address specific local circumstances and demographics, and this should be reflected in your stakeholder engagement activity and plan.</p>

<p>12.05. You must identify and engage with key stakeholders to inform the design, implementation and delivery of your support offer. This will include large strategic stakeholders and smaller organisations who you may engage with at a more local level.</p>

<p>12.06. Key strategic partners have a large geographic footprint and may be capable of contributing to the Restart Scheme across all (or most of) the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>. Typically, these might include Local Enterprise Partnerships (<abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnerships">LEPs</abbr>), Combined Authorities, Welsh Government and Jobcentre Plus Partnership Managers. You should be mindful that <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> boundaries may not coincide with the areas covered by your stakeholder organisations.</p>

<p>12.07. You will also have engagement with organisations with a more localised focus and delivery who, by their size and nature, contribute to your offer in specific locations but not across the whole <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>. They can bring detailed local insight and access to existing local services that might not be visible at the strategic level. Such organisations could include (but are not limited to) Local Authorities, Jobcentre Plus (Districts or local offices), local service providers and charities, chambers of commerce, and employer sector bodies.</p>

<p>12.08. Your core Restart Scheme offer should be flexible to adapt to local conditions according to labour market needs and the availability of services that can support your Participants. Engaging the right local partners can contribute to better intelligence about the local labour market and help you develop additional support offers appropriate to the needs and opportunities in the local economy.</p>

<p>12.09. There may be existing forums that you can engage with and you should seek to be an active participant in these. There will be different forums in each <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> and you should adapt to work with the best and most effective existing networks. Where no such local networks exist, you should be ready to bring stakeholders together. Your stakeholder activity should work cooperatively and collaboratively to offer a joined up, personalised support offer to your Participants. It should work effectively and avoid duplication of existing engagement structures, and existing provision (where it is already sufficient).</p>

<p>12.10. To ensure that stakeholder engagement is coordinated effectively across your <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>, it is good practice to have dedicated staff and resource tasked with engagement. You should review and refresh your engagement activity regularly.</p>

<h2>Stakeholder Engagement Plan</h2>

<p>12.11. You must produce, review and maintain an engagement plan which sets out how you will identify and engage with stakeholders in order to deliver high quality, appropriate and individualised employment support, to maximise job outcomes throughout the lifetime of the Restart Scheme contract. Your engagement plan will support your Local Engagement Meetings (<abbr title="Local Engagement Meetings">LEMs</abbr>) and associated objectives whilst informing your performance management discussions and reviews. You must ensure that your stakeholder engagement plan is available for review by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>12.12. There will be different stakeholders in each <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>, and you should use your own judgement and knowledge to ensure that key organisations who can bring value to the Restart Scheme are included in your engagement. However, there are some organisations that have a significant profile and who we would expect to see included in your stakeholder engagement plan.</p>

<p>12.13. Where present, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would expect the following specific organisations to be engaged with in England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mayoral Combined Authorities (<abbr title="Mayoral Combined Authorities">MCAs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Local Authorities</li>
  <li>Local Employment Partnerships (<abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnerships">LEPs</abbr>) (including European Structural Investment Fund subcommittees)</li>
  <li>Skills Advisory Panels (<abbr title="Skills Advisory Panels">SAPs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Local recovery boards (these may be called different names in each area)</li>
  <li>Association of Employment and Learning Providers</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also wish to approach sector bodies such as the National Council for Voluntary Organisations.</p>

<p>12.14. Where present, we would expect you to engage with the following specific organisations within the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPAs</abbr> in Wales:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Welsh Government</li>
  <li>Local Authorities (including European Funded Regional Engagement Teams)</li>
  <li>Careers Wales</li>
  <li>Regional Skills Partnerships</li>
  <li>National Training Federation Wales</li>
  <li>Wales Council for Voluntary Action</li>
</ul>

<p>12.15. The above is a list of the organisations we would expect to see included in your engagement plan as a minimum, where they exist in your <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>. Your plan should be augmented by other local organisations who can play a part in the successful delivery of your provision of the Restart Scheme.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: You must have a stakeholder engagement plan in place which you must maintain throughout the duration of your contract, and this must be available for review by DWP on demand.</p>
</div>

<h2>Engaging with Employers</h2>

<p>12.16. You must engage with employers and employer representative bodies as part of the design, implementation and delivery of your support offer. Your engagement model should be tailored to local and national labour markets, and must be flexible to respond to change over the lifetime of your Restart Scheme contract.</p>

<p>12.17. Your employer engagement should be linked to your Restart Scheme support offer. For example, training offered to your Participants should reflect available jobs and growth sectors in the local economy. You could use your engagement with employers to identify these opportunities and link them with the training offered by other organisations within your stakeholder plan, and provide your Participants with individual bespoke training or work-based sector training. Through your engagement activity you may be able to identify forthcoming job opportunities or creating employment pipelines and guaranteed interviews for your Participants.</p>

<p>12.18. You should collaborate with other providers and <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPAs</abbr> to engage with and account manage national and large employers whose vacancies span multiple <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPAs</abbr>. This will assist the development of a joined up approach.</p>

<h2>Engagement with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Jobcentre Plus</h2>

<p>12.19. It is essential that you build and maintain strong working links with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Jobcentre Plus, maintaining these throughout the duration of your Restart Scheme contract. You will have regular contact with Jobcentre Plus Partnership Managers; <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Managers; and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Commercial managers, amongst others in addition to the Jobcentre Plus work coaches, who you will have frequent engagement with, for example to undertake Warm Handover meetings and complete referrals to you. This approach will support collaboration and partnership working along with the sharing of opportunities that can support your Participant’s journey towards achievement of employment.</p>

<h2>Local Engagement Meetings</h2>

<p>12.20. You are required to deliver regular <abbr title="Local Engagement Meetings">LEMs</abbr>, no less frequently than monthly. They should be attended by Jobcentre Plus Partnership Managers, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Employer Account Division (<abbr title="Employer Account Division">EAD</abbr>) Performance Managers (or equivalent roles) and other representatives from strategic bodies, where applicable in your area, including local authorities, <abbr title="Mayoral Combined Authorities">MCAs</abbr>, Welsh Government, <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnerships">LEPs</abbr>, <abbr title="Skills Advisory Panels">SAPs</abbr>, Local Recovery Boards training providers, employer forums and employment sectors. Membership of the <abbr title="Local Engagement Meetings">LEMs</abbr> should be inclusive as practicable, with no arbitrary exclusion of interested stakeholders. Some stakeholders on your engagement plan may be local stakeholders who may stand to gain or contribute little value from attending a <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> level <abbr title="Local Engagement Meeting">LEM</abbr>, however it is important to ensure that their views are represented.  Your local stakeholder engagement plan, including planned meetings or groups below <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> level, should reflect this.</p>

<p>12.21. The objective of the <abbr title="Local Engagement Meeting">LEM</abbr> is to ensure that regular contact with stakeholders is maintained and that stakeholders remain fully engaged with the Restart Scheme delivery, and are able to feed back to providers and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on delivery. It provides an opportunity to review and refresh your stakeholder engagement plan, if necessary. Objectives for consideration during the <abbr title="Local Engagement Meeting">LEM</abbr> are listed below although this list is not exhaustive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enable strategic coordination and alignment of provision, to avoid duplication and make the best use of the Restart Scheme and that which is delivered by Local Government and their suppliers</li>
  <li>discuss changes in local labour market conditions and seek views on necessary adaptations to the Restart Scheme service delivery</li>
  <li>to share intelligence regarding local labour markets to enhance joint working</li>
</ul>

<p>12.22. At the <abbr title="Local Engagement Meeting">LEM</abbr> you and your strategic partners, including <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Jobcentre Plus representatives should review the roles of your stakeholders to ensure that your Restart Scheme offer remains appropriate to the labour market across the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> and is responsive to local needs.</p>

<p>12.23. Each <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> will have differing stakeholder plans and different economic challenges. The Terms of Reference for your <abbr title="Local Engagement Meeting">LEM</abbr> should reflect your specific stakeholder plan.</p>
