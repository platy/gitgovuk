<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>9.1.	The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance to enable you to raise a compliance doubt when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Potential Participant has failed to attend their Initial Face to Face Meeting which you have mandated them to, or</li>
  <li>a Participant has failed to undertake an activity during their time on the Restart Scheme which you have mandated them to</li>
</ul>

<p>9.2.	The process for raising a compliance doubt in these two instances are the same. For the purposes of this chapter, references to raising a compliance doubt where a Participant fails to comply with an activity includes where a Potential Participant fails to attend the Initial Face to Face Meeting.</p>

<p>9.3.	This chapter only applies to activities which you have mandated the Participant or Potential Participant to undertake and they have failed to comply. You are not required to raise a compliance doubt for voluntary activities which the Participant or Potential Participant has failed to undertake.</p>

<p>9.4.	This chapter must be read in conjunction with Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 8B – Mandating a Participant to undertake activity.</p>

<h2>Sanctions</h2>

<p>9.5.	A sanction is a financial reduction that is imposed on a Job Seekers Allowance (<abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> <abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr>) claimant who doesn’t comply with their requirements without good reason.</p>

<p>9.6.	The types of activity you may mandate your Restart Scheme Participant to undertake attracts a low level sanction, where they fail to comply without good reason.</p>

<p>9.7.	A low level sanction will lead to the Participant’s <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> payments ceasing for a fixed period of four weeks for a first failure, followed by 13 weeks for any second or subsequent failure within a 52 week period of their last failure. Please be aware that different sanctions will be applied for 16/17 year olds.</p>

<p>9.8.	Further information regarding compliance conditions can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 8B – Mandating Participants to undertake activity.</p>

<p>9.9.	Further information regarding low level sanctions can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>When to raise a compliance doubt</h2>

<p>9.10.	Where your Participant is mandated to undertake an activity and they fail to comply without good reason, this is a sanctionable failure. This may be where they have failed to attend an activity or fully take part, dependant on the requirement.</p>

<p>9.11.	You are required to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of the sanctionable failure after it has occurred, this is a compliance doubt.</p>

<p>9.12.	You must raise a compliance doubt for every sanctionable failure without exception.</p>

<p>9.13.	There may be instances where your Participant contacts you after the date of the mandatory activity to explain their reasons and you feel it is understandable why they did not comply. However, you must still raise a compliance doubt. This is because accepting your Participant’s reasons for the failure constitutes the making of a decision on good reason, and you do not have the authority to do this. Decisions on good reason can only be made by the Secretary of State, or Labour Market Decision Makers (<abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr>) on their behalf.</p>

<p>9.14.	You must raise a compliance doubt promptly following your Participant’s failure to comply. Whilst there is no minimum or maximum timeframe for this, it is important that you raise a compliance doubt as quickly as possible after the sanctionable failure. Delays in doing so may mean a sanction is not imposed, for example where too much time has passed for a Participant to reasonably recall the reasons for their failure.</p>

<p>9.15.	To support you in raising a compliance doubt as quickly as possible, you are not required to undertake any preliminary activities first, such as making your Participant aware that you will be notifying <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>9.16.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will monitor compliance doubt referrals on an ongoing basis and information will be available to inform discussions with your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager.</p>

<h2>How to raise a compliance doubt</h2>

<p>9.17.	You must raise a compliance doubt by completing a JSA603 ‘Failure to participate in the Restart Scheme’ form.</p>

<p>9.18.	The JSA603 form will provide the Labour Market Decision Maker (<abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr>) with information to enable them to progress the compliance doubt to the right outcome.</p>

<p>9.19.	It is important you complete all relevant sections of the JSA603 form and take care to complete it accurately. Any JSA603 forms which are incomplete or incorrectly populated will be cancelled and returned to you, as we will be unable to progress them.</p>

<p>9.20.	You will be required to confirm you made attempts to encourage your Participant to undertake the activity voluntarily before utilising mandation. You are not required to provide additional detail or supply evidence to demonstrate this, but irrespective of whether or not the individual goes on to start the Restart Scheme, you should keep records on your internal systems, in the event of appeal.</p>

<p>9.21.	For Restart Scheme Participants who have complex needs requiring advanced support, you will be required to confirm you are satisfied there were no known challenges which affected their ability to understand the requirement or consequences of failing to comply, or their ability to undertake the activity. You are not required to provide additional detail or supply evidence to demonstrate this, but you should keep records in the event of appeal.</p>

<p>9.22.	There is the opportunity within the JSA603 form for you to provide any supporting evidence which may be helpful for the Labour Market <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> to know, for example any reasons for the failure provided by your Participant.</p>

<p>9.23.	There is no requirement to send a copy of the Mandatory Activity Notification (<abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr>) or any other supporting evidence with the compliance doubt.</p>

<p>9.24.	Once completed, you must send the JSA603 to the following email address: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dundee.restartjsaibdoubtteam@DWP.GOV.UK">dundee.restartjsaibdoubtteam@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>

<p>9.25.	Finally, you must record your actions on your internal systems to enable any <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> to be gathered.</p>

<h2>The decision-making process</h2>

<p>9.26.	On receipt of the compliance doubt the Labour Market <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> will undertake a quality check to ensure only referrals which are complete and correct will be progressed for decision-making. Those which are incomplete or incorrect will be cancelled at this point and returned to you. The compliance doubt must be resubmitted once errors are rectified, but this will create nugatory work for you and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and avoidable delays to the decision-making process. 
9.27	Your Participant will then be contacted by the Labour Market <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> to provide their reasons for failing to undertake the mandated activity. This will happen even if you were aware of their reasons and included this information in the compliance doubt.</p>

<p>9.28.	The Labour Market <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> will take into account all of the circumstances and evidence presented and will determine whether or not there was good reason for the failure to comply.</p>

<p>9.29.	If no good reason for the failure to comply can be established  the Labour Market <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> will make a decision.</p>

<h2>Outcome of the compliance doubt</h2>

<p>9.30.	If a sanction has been applied you will receive a JSA136 from the Labour Market <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> notifying you of the outcome of the compliance doubt. The Participant will also be notified of the decision.</p>

<p>9.31.	Where a sanction is not imposed the JSA136 notification will include the reasons for this, for example where there has been a change in circumstances. Further information regarding change of circumstances can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 7B – Change of circumstances.</p>

<p>9.32.	Where a sanction is imposed, you must update your internal systems to enable <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> to be collected.</p>

<p>9.33.	There is no provision to revise the period of a <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> claimant’s sanction for failure to take part in the Restart Scheme without good reason when the <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> Participant re-engages. Therefore, even if the <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> Participant complies with the mandated activity, they will still have to serve the full period of sanction.</p>

<p>9.34.	A Lower level sanction: includes, without good reason, failure to comply with a “work for your benefit” scheme, such as the failure to take part in the Restart Scheme. If a sanction is imposed it will lead to the Participant’s <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> payments ceasing for a fixed period of 4 weeks for a first failure, followed by 13 weeks for any second or subsequent failure within a 52 week period of their last failure.</p>

<h2>Recoverable Hardship Payments</h2>

<p>9.35.	Recoverable Hardship Payments are available to claimants who have their <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> payments reduced because of a sanction. <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> will not be payable for the full period of any sanction imposed regardless of whether they re-engage.</p>

<p>9.36.	A Participant on the Restart Scheme may apply for a Recoverable Hardship Payment from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> if they are unable to meet their household’s basic, immediate and essential needs for housing, food, heating and hygiene costs only.</p>

<p>9.37.	If a <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> Participant receives a Recoverable Hardship Payment, there will still be a 2 week wait where they will not have access to funds. <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> Participants who are classed as vulnerable may receive hardship provision from day 1 of the sanction. This may need to be taken into account when requesting them to take part in Restart Scheme activities.</p>

<p>9.38.	If a Participant asks about or requests information about Recoverable Hardship Payments, you must direct them to their Jobcentre Plus office as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Annex 1 – Failure to Participate in the Restart Scheme</h2>

<p>Should you require an accessible version of any of the Restart Scheme forms listed in this guidance you will need to request them via email at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CMPD.PMO@DWP.GOV.UK">CMPD.PMO@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>
