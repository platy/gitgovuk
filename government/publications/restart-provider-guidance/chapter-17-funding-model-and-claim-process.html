<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>17.01. This chapter tells you about the different elements of the funding model for the Restart Scheme, including: the qualifying definitions and conditions, which payment types should be manually claimed or are made automatically, how and when payments will be made to you, and what you should do to submit accurate claims for payment.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>17.02. There are two distinct elements to the Restart Scheme funding model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delivery Fee</li>
  <li>Job Outcome Payment</li>
</ul>

<p>17.03. To encourage the delivery of services that will help your Participants get back into work on a secure, long-term basis, the funding for the Restart Scheme is predominantly a Payment by Results (<abbr title="Payment by Results">PbR</abbr>) model.</p>

<h2>Monthly Delivery Fee Overview</h2>

<p>17.04. The delivery fee is an amount payable by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to you monthly, starting from the first month of the contract going live up to a maximum of 48 months. The delivery fee over this period equates to 30% of the estimated Total Contract Value (<abbr title="Total Contract Value">TCV</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Payment by Results: Job Outcome Payment Overview</h2>

<p>17.05. The remaining 70% of the <abbr title="Total Contract Value">TCV</abbr> is payable through job outcome payments on a Payment by Results basis. This means you will only be paid a job outcome payment when <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has confirmed the qualifying conditions described later in this section have been met.</p>

<p>17.06. Job outcomes are categorised as being employed or self-employed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employment is typically where there is a contract of employment with an employer. Payment is made through Pay as You Earn (<abbr title="Pay as you Earn">PAYE</abbr>) with tax and National Insurance contributions (Class 1) automatically deducted and there is access to employee benefits</li>
  <li>Self-employment is typically where someone runs their business for themselves and takes responsibility for its success or failure. They carry out a trade, profession or vocation and normally report their income and pays tax and Class 2 National Insurance contributions through self-assessment, or Construction Industry Scheme (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>17.07. Only one job outcome will be paid per Participant on achievement of either an employed or a self-employed outcome. Employment and self-employment cannot be combined for the purpose of achieving an outcome.</p>

<p>17.08. There is no price differentiation between employed or self-employed job outcome payments, however, there is a price acceleration model linked to job outcome performance. An increased outcome payment rate will be paid for each outcome achieved above the cohort volume agreed with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Please see the Accelerator Payment Mechanism section later in this Chapter.</p>

<h2>Definitions, Qualifying Conditions and Claiming a Payment</h2>

<h3>Delivery Fee Payments</h3>

<p>17.09. You will not need to submit claims for delivery fee payments. The delivery fee will be automatically paid to you monthly in arrears from month 1 of the contract going live, up to and including month 48.</p>

<p>17.10. The value of the monthly payments will vary, as shown in the table below.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Month</th>
      <th scope="col">Percentage of Total Contract Value Per Month</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>4.00%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2-12</td>
      <td>1.00%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>13-36</td>
      <td>0.50%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>37-48</td>
      <td>0.25%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>17.11. For the first year of your contract, the Delivery Fee that you receive will be dependent on your staffing levels, and if appropriate those of your supply chain partners, as detailed in your contract.</p>

<p>17.12. By the 1st working day of each month you will need to provide, via the Jaggaer system, detailed information about your staff, their Full Time Equivalent (<abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr>) status, working in a management or direct delivery role and who are employed on your contract. We will compare this information against the agreed monthly staffing levels that you detailed in your contract.</p>

<p>17.13. If any monthly return does not show the numbers, or level, of staff that we expect to be working on this contract, we will consider reducing the monthly Delivery Fee.</p>

<p>17.14. Both during Year 1 and throughout the life of the contract your performance against the Customer Service Standards can also affect the amount of monthly Delivery Fee that you may receive. If you fail to meet Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>), delivery fee payments may be deferred or forfeit. See Restart Scheme Specification Chapter 4 Performance Management for more details.</p>

<p>17.15. Further information about the checks that will be made in relation to <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr> achievement and how they are used to whether deferral or forfeiture of part of the monthly Delivery Fee is appropriate see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-18-validation">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 18</a> – Validation.</p>

<h3>Employed Outcomes</h3>

<p>17.16. An employed outcome payment will be automatically paid to you when, within 547 calendar days from a Participant’s start date on the Restart Scheme (the qualifying period):</p>

<ol>
  <li>the Participant starts employed work, and</li>
  <li>accumulates earnings that are equal to or exceed the equivalent of someone working for 16 hours per week for 26 weeks, earning the National Living Wage (<abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>) (earnings threshold).</li>
</ol>

<p>17.17. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use real time earnings information (<abbr title="real time earnings information">RTI</abbr>) data supplied by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> to identify achievement of employed job outcomes. Payment decisions will be based solely on the <abbr title="real time earnings information">RTI</abbr> data supplied, no additional evidence or requests to review will be accepted.</p>

<p>17.18. Any earnings from one or multiple employers reported via <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> within the qualifying period will count towards meeting the earnings threshold.</p>

<p>17.19. During this time reports will be available on Provider Referral and Payments (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) iSupplier portal for you to be able to view:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a Participant’s earnings are first declared to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, following a confirmed start on the Restart Scheme (multiple notifications are possible with two or more jobs)</li>
  <li>when a Participant has achieved income milestones of £1,000 and £2,000 during their employment</li>
  <li>when <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is notified that the Participant’s employment has ended (multiple end notifications possible with two or more jobs)</li>
  <li>when an automatic outcome payment has been triggered once the earnings threshold is reached (final notification)</li>
</ul>

<p>17.20. When an employed outcome has been achieved or a Participant exits the Restart Scheme early, we will stop tracking earnings via <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 13 A/B – Restart Scheme Exits, contains more information on Scheme Completers/Early Completers.</p>

<p>17.21. If, however, a Participant’s employment ends before an outcome is achieved and they are still eligible for support from the Restart Scheme (within their allotted time) you should re-commence Restart activity with them as soon as possible. You will receive a notification that the Participant has ended employment via the <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> Notifications Report and in addition a change of circumstances notification from Jobcentre Plus. For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participants this will be a UC78e/UC78 and for JSA (IB) Participants a CEPD1.</p>

<p>For more information about what action you need to take see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 7A/B – Change of Circumstances.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note:  Allotted time is the maximum 365-day duration each Participant can remain on the Restart Scheme, commencing from their start date.</p>
</div>

<p>17.22. Although you will not need to provide any evidence of earnings or submit a claim for payment there may, however, be occasions when a Participant is receiving or has received income that should not contribute towards the achievement of an outcome. If you become aware of any ineligible income you must take the action described in Ineligible Income section of this Chapter and notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> immediately so the relevant action can be taken.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: The National Living Wage (NLW) is reviewed annually and any changes to the rate will be reflected in the earnings threshold expectation for employed outcomes. The ‘earnings threshold’ used for measuring achievement of an employed outcome will be based on the NLW rate applicable at the point the outcome criteria described above are met.</p>
</div>

<h2>Self-Employed Outcomes: Universal Credit Participants</h2>

<p>17.23. As self-employed earnings are not available from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> in real time, you will need to have systems in place to monitor and track periods of self-employment, gather supporting evidence, and submit outcome claims for payment through the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> system.</p>

<p>17.24. You will become entitled to claim a self-employed outcome payment when a Universal Credit Participant has achieved a cumulative period of not less than 6 months of self-employment within the 547-day qualifying period, having started that 6-month period of self-employment within their 365-day (allotted time) on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: For the purposes of the Restart Scheme self-employed outcomes, a month is a Participants Universal Credit (UC) Assessment Period (AP) which will be individual to each person on the Scheme.</p>

<p>UC APs run for a complete calendar month and start on the same date every month, starting from the date that the Participant made their claim. For example, for a new claim made on 6th September, the first assessment period runs from 6th September to 5th October, with a new assessment period starting on 6th October.</p>

<p>The UC AP can vary between January &amp; March if the AP starts on either 30th or 31st of the month (due to only 28/29 days in Feb). E.g. if the AP starts on 30th, the periods may be: 30/1 to 28/2; 1/3 to 29/3.</p>
</div>

<h3>Action When a Universal Credit Participant Starts Self-Employment</h3>

<p>17.25. When a Participant starts self-employment, you must update the job details screen in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> with the date the self-employment started. Entering this date in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> in a timely manner is important, as failure to do this could result in the payment line in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> being closed for the Participant and you being unable to claim associated outcomes.</p>

<p>17.26. It is also in your interest to provide support and encouragement to ensure the Participant fully complies with the requirements of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> in respect of being gainfully self-employed. Namely that the Participant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reports a change of work and earnings to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as soon as they start self-employment, via their online <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> journal, and</li>
  <li>declares, within each 30-day <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Assessment Period, all relevant self-employed earnings, and</li>
  <li>attends quarterly review interviews with their Jobcentre Plus work coach</li>
</ul>

<p>17.27. Compliance with these requirements will provide evidence that can be used by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to positively validate any subsequent outcome claim you submit.</p>

<h3>Action You Need to Take to Confirm Validity of a Universal Credit Participant Outcome Claim</h3>

<p>17.28. Before submitting a self-employed outcome claim you must have assured yourself that the claim is valid by gathering sufficient evidence to provide confirmation that the Participant was self-employed for the required duration and the self-employment itself was organised, developed, regular and carried out in reasonable expectation of profit.</p>

<p>17.29. The evidence you may gather will not form part of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s validation process but can be used to provide assurance to yourselves prior to making a claim, this could include, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirmation that the UCD150 / UCD151 form has been uploaded to the Participant’s <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Journal following attendance at a Gateway Intervention with their Jobcentre Plus work coach</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>business plan or other evidence demonstrating the activity was marketed/advertised in order to generate and or increase income</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of work generated including ‘jobs’ quoted for and work or delivery of services undertaken or in the pipeline</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a record of hours spent each week (or each 30-day <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Assessment Period) working on the activity and the regularity of the work demonstrating the activity was the Participant’s main employment and was self-employment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> registration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bank statement showing details of recent transactions or earnings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>invoices, purchase orders received or sent recently which are clearly in relation to the running of business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>although the Participant does not need to have made a specific level of profit, you should be confident from the evidence you have gathered that the activity across the claim period was in expectation of profit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note: Any period of self-employment can only be counted once regardless of whether the Participant has one or multiple self-employed occupations during that period.</p>
</div>

<p>17.30. For audit and internal assurance purposes, you will be expected to retain evidence that supports any claims for payment.  In addition, you may also be expected to make available to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, any further information that the Authority requests.</p>

<h3>Submitting a Claim for a Self-Employed Outcome</h3>

<p>17.31. Once you are satisfied that the qualifying conditions are met in full, and you have sufficient evidence to support your claim (as described later in this chapter) you will need to:</p>

<p>1. update the job details screen, with the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>current, accurate and valid contact details, including the current address, contact name, full business telephone number and email address (where applicable)</li>
  <li>the Participant’s contact details, where different from above</li>
  <li>start date of self-employment (Date 1 on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>end date of self-employment (where already known)</li>
</ul>

<p>and</p>

<p>2. complete the appropriate outcome line in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> with the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Date 1. The date that the Participant started self-employment</li>
  <li>Date 2. Should be at least 6 months from date 1</li>
</ul>

<p>17.32. You must submit all claims within 90 days of the qualifying conditions being met (Date 2 in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>). A check is in place to calculate the time elapsed between Date 2 and the date you submit your claim.</p>

<p>17.33. You must also provide a valid telephone number for each outcome claim submitted as this is the primary contact method used when validating a self-employed outcome with a Participant. You should also use the additional information box on the job details screen to record anything that might impact on the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Provider Payment Validation Team (<abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>) being able to contact the Participant or confirm self-employment details. For example, health conditions that might require alternative methods of communication or information about the best time to attempt to contact the Participant.</p>

<p>17.34. You are only allowed a total of three attempts to claim a self-employed outcome. Any claims which are submitted that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are incomplete / do not supply enough information to allow the validator to attempt to verify the outcome, or</li>
  <li>Have been submitted more than 90 days after Date 2 in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Could result in a validation fail and be counted as one of the maximum 3 attempts allowed.</p>

<p>17.35. If your self-employed outcome claim fails manual validation, at all three attempts it will remain a fail and be recorded as an outcome fail. At this point the line will be closed to prohibit any further self-employed outcome claims.</p>

<p>17.36. Although you will no longer be able to claim a self-employed outcome after your third attempt has failed, tracking of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>/<abbr title="real time earnings information">RTI</abbr> earnings data will continue to the end of the Participant’s 547-day qualifying period to identify potential employed job outcomes. If an employed outcome is subsequently achieved within this period, it will be paid and counted as an employed outcome for performance purposes.</p>

<h2>Participant Moving to Another Geographical Area</h2>

<p>17.37. If a Participant moves to another <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> (Contract Package Area) within England or Wales, you are still entitled to any eligible outcome payment relating to that Participant, provided these earnings derive from within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and all other qualifying conditions for payment are met. Further information relating to Participants moving to another geographical area can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 7 A/B – Change of Circumstances.</p>

<h2>Accelerator payment mechanism</h2>

<p>17.38. The Restart Scheme uses a price acceleration model to encourage you to provide a good level of service to all customers. Price Acceleration takes place when the number of outcomes achieved by you exceeds the volume of outcomes based on the performance offer as set out in the contract. This allows an increased outcome payment to be paid in respect of each outcome achieved above the volume specified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>17.39. For each calendar month cohort of Participants starting on the Restart Scheme (all customer groups to be included in the monthly calculation of the number of starts for accelerator payment purposes), a standard outcome payment will be paid for the first 21% of the contracted outcome volumes at aggregated Participant group level. All further outcomes achieved (above and beyond) will be paid at a higher rate. This higher rate is set at 140% of the standard rate.</p>

<h2>Ineligible Income</h2>

<p>17.40. To protect public funds and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s reputation the Restart Scheme funding model includes the additional controls, described below, ensuring that only income derived from employment or self-employment that commenced after the Participant started on the Restart Scheme will count towards achievement of an outcome.</p>

<p>17.41. Although the scenarios listed below have provided some preventative solutions which incorporate you having prior knowledge that ineligible income may be incorrectly being counted as earnings from employment, it is important to note that if we later become aware that ineligible earnings have contributed towards the achievement of a paid outcome these outcome payments may be reviewed, could impact on your performance, or be included in any end of cohort reconciliation or extrapolation calculations.</p>

<p>17.42. Tax refunds, payments in lieu of notice, payments made as a part of being Armed Forces Reservists and other retainer payments such as Reserve Fire Fighters, and payments that are not related to qualifying employment generated whilst on the Restart Scheme, can trigger a non-qualifying outcome payment. You must inform <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PRAP.SUPPORT@DWP.GOV.UK">PRAP.SUPPORT@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a> as soon as you are made aware of these payments so that an outcome payment is not made. Once you inform <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>, the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> payment line will be put on hold to avoid ineligible payments being made then this payment will be considered during the End of Cohort Reconciliation process.</p>

<h3>Employment prior to starting on the Restart Scheme</h3>

<p>17.43. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will determine if a potential Participant is in work or has a job offer prior to referral to the Restart Scheme. If they identify the potential Participant is in any form of work at that point in time, they will not make a referral. Any earnings that a Participant has accumulated prior to starting on the Restart Scheme will not count towards achievement of an employed job outcome.</p>

<p>17.44. There may, however, be some Participants who move into employment or self-employment, or have had a job offer between referral and starting the Restart Scheme. Therefore, before you start a Participant on the Restart Scheme, you must confirm their employment status. If you find the Participant is in any form of employment or has had a job offer, you must enter a Did Not Attend (<abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr>) on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> and return the Participant to Jobcentre Plus. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-3-initial-meeting-and-start">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 3</a> – Restart Scheme Initial Meeting and Start.</p>

<h3>Tax Refunds, payment in lieu of notice, late payment of final salary and occupational pensions</h3>

<p>17.45. Tax refunds, payments in lieu of notice, payments made as a part of being Armed Forces Reservists and other retainer payments such as Reserve Fire Fighters, and payments that are not related to qualifying employment generated whilst on Restart Scheme, can trigger a non-qualifying outcome payment.  You must inform <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>)  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PRAP.SUPPORT@DWP.GOV.UK">PRAP.SUPPORT@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a> when you are aware of these payments so that an outcome payment is not made.</p>

<h3>Intermediate labour market opportunities (<abbr title="Intermediate labour market">ILM</abbr>)</h3>

<p>17.46. Restart Scheme outcome payments are intended to be made in response to Participants entering sustained, genuine employment (which can include seasonal work). You will not be eligible to receive an outcome payment for; <abbr title="Intermediate labour market">ILM</abbr> opportunities, such as employment that is an additional economic activity intended to be a “bridge” into sustainable, genuine employment; undertaken on a temporary contract and where there is any contract or agreement or proposed contract or agreement between the provider their supply chain and/or any third party; or in situations where individual Restart Scheme Participants are repeatedly referred to and started on work placements. If you therefore have a Participant undertaking a <abbr title="Intermediate labour market">ILM</abbr> opportunity, please refer to the steps outlined in paragraph 17.45 above.</p>

<h3>Providers and supply chains employing Restart Scheme Participants</h3>

<p>17.47. Where you or supply chain partners employ Restart Scheme Participants within a part of your employment business directly relating to delivery of the Restart Scheme, any income during the earnings period relating to this employment will not contribute to the cumulative calculation of earnings for the purposes of paying an outcome.</p>

<p>17.48. Where the employment is on a self-employed basis, this period of employment will not contribute to the achievement of a self-employment outcome.</p>

<p>17.49. If you or a supply chain partner employ a Restart Scheme Participant within a part of your business directly relating to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> employment contracts you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> at least 5 working days before first salary payment by completing a Restart Scheme Provider Employing a Participant template. This is a vital requirement. You should complete all details on the template, including date started and date of first earnings.</p>

<p>17.50. The completed Restart Scheme Provider Employing a Participant template must be sent via unencrypted email, to the Department’s <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) Central Inbox <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PRAP.SUPPORT@DWP.GOV.UK">PRAP.SUPPORT@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>. You will receive a receipt notification.</p>

<p>17.51. When the Participant leaves employment with you (or a member of your supply chain) you must complete Part 2 of the Restart Scheme Provider Employing a Participant template and send via unencrypted email to the <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> Central Inbox <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PRAP.SUPPORT@DWP.GOV.UK">PRAP.SUPPORT@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>. This should be sent as soon as the information is available and must include the date the employment ceased and date of last earnings. Any forms received after the 547-calendar day period from the date the Participant started on the Restart Scheme will not be accepted.</p>

<p>17.52. On receipt of the Restart Scheme Provider Employing a Participant template, the payment line will be suspended. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will review <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Pay as you Earn">PAYE</abbr> data (and any other information it deems appropriate) at the end of the validation period to establish if the outcome criteria has been achieved from employment or self-employment, excluding the period of earnings from the non-qualifying period. If the outcome criteria are satisfied, the appropriate payment will be made</p>

<p>17.53. Please note – To submit a self-employed outcome claim where a Restart Scheme Participant has previously been contracted to work for you or a supply chain partner on a self-employed basis, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will require you to complete a <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> 11 clerical form and send this to the department’s  <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PRAP.SUPPORT@DWP.GOV.UK">PRAP.SUPPORT@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a> by unencrypted email.</p>

<h2>Financial incentives</h2>

<p>17.54. You must not provide any financial incentive (for example funding or payment) to support the employment of Participants. You may provide appropriate services and support to employers to help with the engagement and employment of Participants. A Participant in self-employment to whom you have provided, whether directly or indirectly, financial incentives other than any allowed working capital and/or equipment payment, cannot qualify as a self-employed outcome or count towards a self-employed outcome payment.</p>

<p>17.55. For Participants in self-employment, where the Participant has a clear business plan which would benefit from financial support through either working capital and or equipment, you may provide up to a maximum of £1,000 for working capital and or equipment per Participant for the purpose of the self-employed business. You must retain evidence of the Business Plan and any payments related to the working capital and or equipment.</p>

<p>17.56. If you decide to provide working capital and or equipment to the Participant to support their self-employed business, this cannot be in the form of a loan to the Participant.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note:  You must ensure that you comply with current HMRC Guidance if you make payments or provide benefits to your Participants after they have started work, which relate to that employment.</p>

<p>You should inform your Participant that Tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) are payable and how this will be done. Failure to account for Tax and NICs that are due on payments made to Participants in employment may be subject to penalties in accordance with current HMRC regulations.</p>
</div>

<h2>Payments to suppliers</h2>

<p>17.57. All payments will be made through the appropriate <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> system or <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> in line with the amounts set out in the contract. Please note that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> can only make direct payments to United Kingdom (<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) bank accounts.</p>

<h3>VAT</h3>

<p>17.58. Your VAT obligations are covered in the Terms and Conditions of the contract.</p>

<h3>Additional VAT requirements for self-billing contracts</h3>

<p>17.59. The following guidance should be read in conjunction with the <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> guidance VAT Notice 700/62: Self-Billing.</p>

<p>17.60. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> guidance states that under a self-billing contract both parties are responsible for ensuring that the VAT is charged correctly on invoices. As part of your bid, you were asked to provide the VAT rate or rates that should be charged for each part of the funding model (Delivery Fee or relevant Job Outcome Payment).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Important</h3>

<p>You will be asked to confirm that the VAT rate or rates quoted as part of your bid are still correct prior to commencement date of the contract.</p>

<p>Please note that the onus is with you to provide the VAT rate for this contract as per HMRC guidelines. DWP will however, assist in this matter by providing an annual self-billing contract and requesting confirmation of the VAT rate or rates. If the self-billing agreement process is delayed for any reason, you are still responsible for notifying the VAT rate or rates to the Authority on an annual basis.</p>
</div>

<h3>
