<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>21.01. The purpose of this chapter is to provide advice where Participants have complex needs and therefore may require advanced support.</p>

<p>21.02. This guidance is intended to support you in providing tailored support to Participants who may have a range of complex needs, to support their safety and wellbeing and enable them to engage fully during their time on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>21.03. This chapter is in addition to the internal guidance in place within your organisation, and does not replace your own policies or legislative requirements regarding these Participants.</p>

<h2>Participants with complex needs</h2>

<p>21.04. Complex needs may be defined as difficult personal circumstances and/or life events. They may be permanent or temporary in nature and the degree to which they affect a Participant will vary from one to another.</p>

<p>21.05. Examples of complex needs may include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>learning disability</li>
  <li>recent care leaver</li>
  <li>drug/alcohol dependency</li>
  <li>unable to read or write</li>
</ul>

<p>21.06. There is no prescriptive list of complex needs which the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> can supply. Some Participants will have obvious physical conditions which mean they need extra support or that adjustments are required to enable them to fully engage and access support fully. Other Participants may have conditions that are less obvious.
You should refer to your organisations policies and guidance for further information regarding identification.</p>

<p>21.07. As a minimum you are expected to assess your Participants during every interaction, supported by information from Jobcentre Plus to identify complex needs and provide a support offer that is tailored to meet these needs where appropriate. This includes the activities you agree to support them to find and retain work, and where you are considering mandating them to undertake an activity.</p>

<p>21.08. Discussions with your Participant will encourage them to divulge more detail about their circumstances and enable them to agree the nature and extent of additional support you can offer, whilst ensuring those who feel capable of managing without the need for further support do not feel compelled to. You may wish to make use of three-way conversations to involve your Participants Jobcentre Plus work coach to share and verify information where it may impact their work availability and work-related requirements. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2 A/B – Referral Process and Initial Engagement.</p>

<p>21.09. Support may be appropriate in the short, medium or long term. Discussions will also enable you to review the support you are providing if your Participant’s needs change. This includes where you both agree adjustments are no longer needed.</p>

<p>21.10. This discussion should also extend to your Participants appointee or representative as appropriate, to gain their input on the most appropriate type of support. Further information regarding engagement with appointees and representatives can be found in ‘Working with a Participant’s appointee or representative’ within this chapter.</p>

<h2>Supporting vulnerable Participants</h2>

<p>21.11. A vulnerable Participant is a Participant who is at greater than normal risk of abuse or neglect.  Supporting vulnerable Participants is key in making sure they are supported in getting access to the help they need and anyone at risk is protected.</p>

<p>21.12. This should be considered during every interaction with your Participant, both to inform the most appropriate way to engage with your Participant and to identify possible concerns. Your organisation’s policies should support you in making these considerations.</p>

<p>21.13. During engagement with your Participant you may identify their behaviour or communication as being unusual, for example they may appear frustrated or angry, or may provide brief or one word answers. Other indicators may help you in identifying and supporting your Participants, in addition to discussions with them and information from Jobcentre Plus. e.g. non-physical signs such as extreme weight loss and paranoia may indicate addiction, attending appointments with family or friends may indicate learning difficulties.</p>

<p>21.14. You should also consider the involvement of your Participants appointee or representative, where they have one, as they may provide additional information to help you provide the most appropriate type of support. Further information regarding engagement with appointees and representatives can be found in ‘Working with a Participants appointee or representative’ within this chapter.</p>

<p>21.15. It is important that all Participants are aware of the support they can access whilst taking part in the Restart Scheme, including how they can access it. This must include signposting to support where they are at risk and deemed vulnerable, as awareness of the support available may enable them to access it and prevent harm from occurring. This may be part of your induction approach, you may also wish to remind your participant of the available support and signpost them at regular intervals throughout their time on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>21.16. This support may include local initiatives and organisations’ identifiable via your organisation’s local engagement activity and agreed sharing of information methodology. You must signpost your Participants appropriately should they require access to any suitable and available support.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note:  Where you choose to share your Participants information with other organisations you must only do so in line with GDPR requirements.</p>

<p>Please Note: It is important that you maintain professional boundaries when supporting Participants and signposting them to appropriate support. The DWP does not require you to make formal referrals to this support as part of the Restart Scheme.</p>
</div>

<h2>Working with Jobcentre Plus where a Participant has complex needs or / and requires advanced support</h2>

<p>21.17. Where a Participant has known complex needs or requires advanced support at the point they are referred to the Restart Scheme, you will be notified by Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>Further information regarding the referral process can be found in the Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2 A/B – Referral Process and Initial Engagement.</p>

<p>21.18. Your Participant may develop complex needs or a requirement for advanced support during their time on the Restart Scheme, or their existing needs may change. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will notify you of these using the change of circumstances process, and they may conduct a three-way conversation with you and your Participant to discuss the complex needs and any specific support further.</p>

<p>Further information regarding change of circumstances and associated three-way conversations can be found in the Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 7 A/B – Change of Circumstances.</p>

<p>21.19. You may identify complex needs or Participants requiring advanced support during your engagement with your them. It is important that you share this information with Jobcentre Plus, to provide appropriate support and to prevent concerns from materialising or escalating where possible. Again, a three-way conversation may be an opportunity to encourage your Participant to divulge information and encourage them to contribute to the discussion, gaining their input into any adjustments to the support you, or Jobcentre Plus provide.</p>

<p>21.20. You should encourage your Participant to share information and to attend activities agreed with Jobcentre Plus as part of their Claimant Commitment, and likewise the activities you agree and document in their Action Plan. Your Participant cannot be required to share this information but you should encourage them by highlighting the benefits including receiving joined up support.</p>

<h2>Working with a Participant’s appointee or representative</h2>

<p>21.21. Where your Participant has an appointee, you should include them during your discussions as they are responsible for acting on your Participant’s behalf in all dealings with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> whilst on the Restart Scheme. This includes their engagement and participation with you. They will be key to gaining information about your Participant’s circumstances and agreeing appropriate activities during their time on the Restart Scheme. Appointees are legally empowered to act on behalf of your Participant and there is no need to secure permission to disclose information to them.</p>

<p>21.22. You may also wish to engage with your Participant’s representative, where they have one, for example during the first few interactions during their time on the Restart Scheme or inviting them to attend your interviews. Representatives do not have the same status as appointees, but can be valuable in helping your Participant and yourselves during engagement. You must ensure you have your Participants explicit consent before disclosing information with their representative.</p>

<p>21.23. You will be notified by the Jobcentre Plus work coach during the referral process where your Participant has an appointee or representative.</p>

<p>21.24. You will be notified by the Jobcentre Plus work coach via the change of circumstances process where your Participant authorises an appointee or nominates a representative during their time on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<h2>Participants where English is not their first language or have communication needs</h2>

<p>21.25. Providers must ensure that they remain compliant with current and future changes in the law including any <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Policy, supporting the Secretary of State in meeting all obligations under the relevant legislation and regulations as set out in the Terms and Conditions. This includes (but is not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring the Restart Scheme supports <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Public Sector Equality Duty as outlined in the Equality Act 2010;</li>
  <li>providing appropriate services to ensure compatibility with the Equality Act 2010 eg, to enable communication with Participants who do not speak English as a first language, or who are deaf, hearing impaired or have a speech impediment;</li>
  <li>where the Provider is operating in an area with a high minority ethnic population, materials in the appropriate minority ethnic language must be made available on request; and</li>
  <li>the requirements set out in the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>21.26. The work coach will consider, for Participants with a communication need (I.e. <abbr title="English for Speakers of Other Languages">ESOL</abbr>/ deaf, hearing impaired or have a speech impediment) all the options of support including whether the Participants needs could be addressed through other more appropriate support.</p>

<p>21.27. Once a Participant has been referred to the Restart Scheme, the Restart Providers are required to deliver support in response to these needs throughout a Participant’s time on provision and, where necessary, adapt their approach to ensure clear appropriate support is in place.</p>

<p>21.29.  For Potential Participants where English is not their first language and/or have communication needs (e.g., hearing impaired) it is the Jobcentre Plus work coach responsibility to ensure access to the Restart Scheme during the Warm Handover appointment. Once a Participant has been referred to the Restart Scheme, you are responsible for ensuring these Participants can access all the services offered through the Restart Scheme.</p>

<h2>Additional provision compatible with the Restart Scheme</h2>

<p>21.30. For the majority of Participants their support needs will be met by the Provider’s Restart Scheme offer; in some instances, however, it may be appropriate for additional support, outside of the Restart Scheme offer to be sourced for a Participant where a particular need has been identified. Further information regarding additional provision compatible with the Restart Scheme can be found in the Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 5 A/B – Ongoing Interventions.</p>
