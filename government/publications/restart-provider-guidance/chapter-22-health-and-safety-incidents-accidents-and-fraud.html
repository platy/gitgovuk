<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>22.01. This chapter pulls together various key pieces of information that you will need to be aware of in respect of working with your Participants while they are with you on the Restart Scheme.  Please Note: Although several sections in this chapter are also referenced in Generic Provider Guidance (Chapter 8: Information Security) the elements highlighted below are specific to the Restart Scheme.</p>

<h2>Health and Safety</h2>

<p>22.02. All of your Participants on the Restart Scheme are entitled to train and work in a healthy and safe environment with due regard to their welfare. Under Health and Safety Law they are regarded as your employees, whether they are paid by you or not. You must, therefore, comply with your Duty of Care under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and the Act’s associated regulations in the same way as you would do for any other member of your workforce.</p>

<p>22.03. You must ensure that your Participants receive appropriate health and safety induction, training and supervision, and that systems are in place for checking this, both within your own organisation and at any of your supply chain partners.</p>

<p>22.04. You must complete risk assessments, instruct, inform and train your participants on the control measures identified. There are specific risk assessments for young people, pregnant workers, lone workers and employees who are engaged in manual handling activities. In addition, there may be specific risks flagged by the Jobcentre Plus work coach such as participants who have restrictions imposed on them by probation e.g. they are not allowed to use <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> due to probation conditions in the short or long term etc. This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>22.05. We may visit you and your supply chain partners for a variety of reasons. When doing so we will, in the course of our duties, adopt an ‘awareness’ approach to health and safety. In doing this we will not be conducting a health and safety inspection, nor will we be able to offer advice on whether something is safe or not. Instead, we will approach this from the position of any layperson.</p>

<p>22.06. If, however, we do spot something on which we require assurance or clarification we will raise this with you or your supply chain partner’s representative at the location we are visiting. If it is subsequently decided that the issue raised is one that requires follow up, this will be arranged with you through your local Jobcentre Plus contact.</p>

<h2>Unacceptable Behaviour</h2>

<p>22.07. Participants on the Restart Scheme have a responsibility to behave in an appropriate manner just as they would if they were in employment. You should explain what constitutes appropriate behaviour as part of the induction.</p>

<p>22.08. As participation on the Restart Scheme is mandatory for all eligible Universal Credit claimants you will experience a wide range of behaviour, including some individuals who exhibit difficult, aggressive, or sometimes violent behaviour.</p>

<p>22.09. Where cases of misconduct or unacceptable behaviour by your Participants arise, you should immediately deal with it in the most appropriate manner. Where the inappropriate behaviour is of a minor nature, such as an initial refusal to co-operate, you should aim to handle the issue internally in the first instance. It is important to note that you keep an audit trail of all misconduct communications and record the situation, date and method of communication used to address this in case this is needed for investigation at a later date.</p>

<p>22.10. If an incident is more serious or there is a pattern of unacceptable behaviour, for example, damage to property or continued refusal to co-operate with reasonable requests, you should notify the Jobcentre Plus work coach or other nominated contact point.</p>

<p>22.11. You are required to notify the Jobcentre Plus work coach of all incidents of unacceptable behaviour that involve your Participants. We consider the following as examples of unacceptable behaviour (this list is not exhaustive):</p>

<ul>
  <li>violence</li>
  <li>verbal abuse</li>
  <li>verbal abuse of a sexual or racist nature</li>
  <li>threats, which are implied or otherwise</li>
  <li>intimidation</li>
  <li>sexual innuendo</li>
  <li>harassment</li>
  <li>unwelcome attention</li>
  <li>attempted or actual assaults, and/or</li>
  <li>inappropriate use of the internet or provider’s information technology (<abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>) system</li>
</ul>

<p>22.12. When notifying <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of an Incident you should complete the Clerical Incident Report form (Annex 1). You should also arrange for a manager to complete the managers’ section of the form and forward it to your named contact at the Jobcentre immediately, preferably by secure email. A Jobcentre Plus nominated manager will take appropriate action in consultation with you.</p>

<h2>Exclusions from Provider Premises</h2>

<p>22.13. Only in extreme circumstances should you request that your Participant be excluded from your site(s). Before any such request you are required to attempt to manage your Participant within your business, moving them to alternative provision/ sites where available and necessary. As a last resort you may request that your Participant is excluded from your site(s).</p>

<p>22.14. Please note that this is not exclusion from the Restart Scheme, only from your site(s).</p>

<p>22.15. If your Participant’s behaviour is consistently unacceptable and other methods of engaging or issuing verbal or written warnings prove ineffectual, you may wish to request that your Participant is excluded from your premises. The situation must be one of genuine risk to staff and not just because your Participant is difficult, and you would have to supply evidence about why exclusion is appropriate.</p>

<p>22.16. If exclusion is sought, a request should be made via your Performance Manager, who will forward the details to the Jobcentre Plus work coach for a decision to be made based on the individual circumstances.</p>

<p>22.17. Participants will not be excluded based on potentially violent or inappropriate behaviour (for example, racial or sexual verbal assault, foul language or the issuing of threats, or in the event that your Participant refuses to engage). However, you must show a duty of care to your Participants and staff and in certain circumstances the only immediate option may be to temporarily remove your Participant from the situation.</p>

<p>22.18. In some circumstances your Participants who have an incident marker recorded against them may be considered as posing a risk to the health and safety of staff. These Participants will be subjected to certain control measures to ensure staff safety. Further information on your Participant’s incident marker can be requested by contacting the Jobcentre Plus work coach.</p>

<p>22.19. Examples of behaviours that would result in control measures being implemented would be where a Participant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has committed an actual physical assault on a member of staff or another Participant, regardless of injury</li>
  <li>has committed an actual physical assault on a member of staff’s family</li>
  <li>has attempted to commit a physical assault on a member of staff or another Participant</li>
  <li>stalked a member of staff or another Participant (which is defined as “the wilful, malicious and repeated following and harassing of another person”)</li>
  <li>suffers from a severe mental illness, and a qualified medical practitioner or social worker states that they are likely to pose a danger to staff</li>
  <li>has made a threat of violence either face to face, over the phone, or in writing, and/or</li>
  <li>has displayed threatening or aggressive behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>22.20. Where incidents such as this occur or where control measures have been introduced by Jobcentre Plus then you may decide how best you can handle your Participant, suggested controls include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>holding interviews in public areas;</li>
  <li>having a colleague present at interviews, and</li>
  <li>informing senior staff or managers of interview details</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fast Track Incidents</h2>

<p>22.21. While all incidents of unacceptable Participant behaviour are serious, some may have to be afforded a particular importance and dealt with as a priority because of their nature and circumstances.</p>

<p>22.22. Therefore, in addition to completing a report, you are expected to telephone the Jobcentre Plus work coach urgently if an incident occurs that can be defined as:</p>

<p>A serious incident occurs, which compromises the health and safety of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff or the staff of our supply chain partners, or our ability to safely use our premises. The serious nature or sensitivity of the incident warrants an immediate notification to senior management, prior to further investigation.</p>

<p>Note:  This also applies when the participant is on work experience or periods of attachment to an employer, in addition to time spent with yourself or supply chain partners.</p>

<p>22.23. The following is not an exhaustive list; sometimes a serious incident may not neatly fit within the criteria below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>actual assault (intentional physical contact) has occurred – which is directed at <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or partner employees in connection with their duties</li>
  <li>weapon, or other item presenting a similar level of threat, has been used to harm, attempt to harm or intimidate</li>
  <li>is significant disruption to normal business</li>
  <li>is a significant cost implication (i.e., estimated at over £2,000) for your business, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or your supply chain partners’ business, for example, damage to property</li>
  <li>has been a viable targeted or personalised threat (and police advice has been sought)</li>
  <li>suicide, attempted suicide or self-harm incident, understood to be directly connected to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> business</li>
</ul>

<p>22.24. Incidents occurring on either your own, your supply chain, co-located premises, or in your Participants homes may need to be Fast Tracked.  If this is the case, you should indicate this on the Clerical Incident Report Form (Annex 1) and alert your Jobcentre Plus contact immediately via telephone, who will raise the incident on your behalf. You should also make your Performance Manager aware, as soon as possible.  If you are unclear as to whether an incident should be considered a Fast Track, you should contact your Performance Manager for further advice and support.</p>

<h2>Overview of Incident Referral Process</h2>

<p>22.25. Outlined below is the process you should follow if unacceptable behaviour occurs:</p>

<p>a.	You notify your Performance Manager and Jobcentre Plus work coach of incident via the incident report form at Annex 1.</p>

<p>b.	You attempt to manage your Participant’s behaviour.</p>

<p>c.	Has the incident been resolved? <br>
i.	If yes, go to Step e<br>
ii.	If no, go to Step f</p>

<p>d.	No further action is required.</p>

<p>e.	Has your Participant consistently ignored all attempts by you to resolve the issue?<br>
i.	If yes, go to Step g<br>
ii.	If no, go back to Step c</p>

<p>f.	The Jobcentre Plus work coach and/or Performance Manager are notified to consider control measures.</p>

<p>g.	Have control measures resolved the issue?<br>
i.	If yes, no further action is required<br>
ii.	If no, you may request the exclusion of your Participant from your premises via your local Jobcentre Plus contact</p>

<h2>Accidents</h2>

<h3>Arrangements for Managing and Reporting Accidents</h3>

<p>22.26. In reporting and managing accidents, which involve a Restart Scheme Participant, you and your supply chain partners may wish to consider using similar or the same procedures as you use for existing employees. However, these procedures should include ensuring that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>immediate action is taken to ensure the safety of your Participants and prevent reoccurrence</li>
  <li>all accidents, including minor incidents, are recorded in your accident book</li>
  <li>all accidents covered by the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR) are reported to the appropriate enforcing authority</li>
  <li>an investigation is carried out to assess whether any changes should be made to the workplace or procedures following the accident or incident</li>
  <li>Risk Assessment Control Measures are reviewed and, if necessary, revised to ensure their effectiveness and that they remain suitable and sufficient</li>
  <li>In doing this you will wish to take into account the full range of factors relating to the incident including, for example, whether:</li>
  <li>your Participant had received appropriate Health and Safety awareness and instruction and that they understood the implications</li>
  <li>the activities undertaken by your Participant at the time of the accident were required as part of the Restart Scheme</li>
  <li>supervision was adequate</li>
  <li>appropriate clothing and equipment were being used</li>
  <li>the work environment was organised in a safe manner</li>
</ul>

<p>22.27. Should your Participant need to make a claim to an industrial injuries benefit you should direct them to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit">Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (<abbr title="[Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>)</a> site on GOV.UK for an application form and contact details for the <abbr title="[Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> contact Centre.</p>

<h2>Fraud Prevention</h2>

<p>22.28. If you suspect that your Participant is committing fraud you should follow the procedures outlined in this link: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-benefit-fraud">https://www.gov.uk/report-benefit-fraud</a>.</p>

<p>22.29. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> places the utmost importance on the need to prevent fraud and irregularity in the delivery of its contracts. You are required to, as a minimum, adhere to the following four principles:</p>

<p>i. have an established system that enables your staff to report inappropriate behaviour by colleagues in respect of any claims for payment in relation to the Restart Scheme contract</p>

<p>ii. ensure that your (and your supply chain partners) performance management systems do not encourage individual staff to make false claims for payment in relation to the Restart Scheme contract</p>

<p>iii. ensure a segregation of duties within your and your supply chain operations between those staff directly involved in delivering the services and those making claims for payment in relation to the Restart Scheme contract</p>

<p>iv. establish an audit system to provide periodic checks, at a minimum 6 monthly intervals, to ensure effective and accurate recording and reporting of performance of the services</p>

<p>22.30. You are reminded that you must endeavour to safeguard funding of the contract against fraud generally and, fraud on the part of your directors, employees or sub-contractors. You must pay the utmost regard to safeguarding public funds against misleading claims for payment and shall notify us immediately, via the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> WPD Security inbox, if you have reason to suspect that any serious irregularity or internal fraud has occurred or is occurring.</p>

<p>22.31. If you, your staff or your supply chain partners commit fraud in relation to any contract with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, we may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>terminate the contract and recover from you the amount of any loss suffered by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> resulting from the termination, including the cost reasonably incurred by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of making other arrangements for the supply of the services and any additional expenditure incurred by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> throughout the remainder of the contract period, or</li>
  <li>recover in full from you any other loss sustained by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>22.32. You are required to report all incidents of allegations of provider fraud via the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> WPD Security inbox using the ‘Fraud Reporting Form’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> WPD security</li>
  <li>Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:wpd.security@dwp.gov.uk">wpd.security@dwp.gov.uk</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>22.33. You must co-ordinate fully with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and assist in the identification of any of your Participants who may be unlawfully claiming state benefits. We may from time to time brief you as to the co-operation and assistance we require, including the provision of information regarding fraud by your Participants. On receipt of the information, further evidence may be collected by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or other department, office or agency of Her Majesty’s government with a view to prosecution.</p>
