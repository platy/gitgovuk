<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>7.1.	There will be occasions where a Participant’s circumstances change during their time on the Restart Scheme. This could be their personal information, employment status, or other circumstances that impact on their participation on the Restart Scheme. This chapter covers your role and responsibilities when advised of a change of circumstances for a Participant, either directly by the Jobcentre Plus work coach or by the Participant themselves.</p>

<h2>Change of Circumstances Communications</h2>

<p>7.2.	You must maintain regular contact with your Participant to ensure that you hold their latest personal information. Your Participant is responsible for notifying the <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> Helpline or by contacting their reporting Jobcentre Plus in writing of any changes in their circumstances, that occur whilst attending the Restart Scheme. If you become aware of any change of circumstances which would impact on any benefits your Participant may be in receipt of, you must remind them of their obligation to notify their reporting Jobcentre Plus of the change(s).</p>

<p>7.3.	As part of your stakeholder engagement you will have been developing, building and maintaining relationships with Jobcentres in your Contract Package Area (<abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>). If you have not received an expected change of circumstance notification CEPD1 within a reasonable period from the date that your Participant made you aware of the change in their circumstances, you should consider a two-way conversation with your agreed Jobcentre Plus Single Point of Contact or Jobcentre Plus work coach. If the change of circumstances is deemed to require immediate action i.e. Participant’s telephone number has changed but details have not been received from the Jobcentre Plus work coach, then you should consider whether a two-way conversation would be appropriate.</p>

<p>7.4.	There is an option for a three-way conversation to take place, to support the interactions between you, your Participant and the Jobcentre work coach, where the change of circumstances is an exceptional situation. This may be helpful, for example, where your Participant is experiencing domestic violence, so that you can jointly identify and address any change of circumstances, along with any potential easements and required actions to enable you and your Participant to make informed decisions. See Para 7.19 below.  In addition, where you feel a situation requires more immediate intervention and a three-way conversation is not possible, then you should invoke a two-way conversation with Jobcentre Plus accordingly. Where appropriate the Jobcentre Plus work coach will then issue a change of circumstances notification to you. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2B – Referral Process and Initial Engagement.</p>

<h2>Notifications of Change of Circumstances</h2>

<p>7.5.	You must have processes in place to receive, consider and action notifications of changes of circumstances from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The Jobcentre Plus work coach will send a notification CEPD1 via unencrypted email to your dedicated inbox with details of any relevant changes to your Participants circumstances. In the event of a significant <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> failure then a clerical change of circumstances notification CEPD1 will be issued by the Jobcentre Plus work coach.</p>

<p>7.6.	If there are any changes to the restrictions placed on the Participant while they are on the Restart Scheme the local Jobcentre Plus <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> <abbr title="Single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> will communicate these to the Provider <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> <abbr title="Single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> verbally over the phone, <abbr title="Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> J forms will no longer be posted out in line with <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> guidelines. You should be aware that it may take extra time for the Jobcentre Plus work coach to action these changes as they may have to consult with the Responsible Authority prior to communicating any changes. You should also be aware that these Participants are unable to start work until they have been given permission from their Responsible Authority to do so. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2B – Referral Process and Initial Engagement.</p>

<p>7.7.	Where you make a compliance doubt referral for your Participant, Labour Market Decision Makers may notify you of a specific change of circumstances on the sanction decision notification that they send you via unencrypted email. If any complex needs or additional support requirements are identified, these will be included in the notification and you will then need to review your support in conjunction with your Participant and take any appropriate action.</p>

<p>7.8.	If you receive a change of circumstances for someone who is not your Participant, you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> immediately so that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> can re-direct the notification to the correct provider/person and ensure that the incorrect notification that you have received is destroyed confidentially. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 20 - Data Sharing Between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Providers.</p>

<p>7.9.	A Jobcentre Plus work coach will notify you of the following change of circumstances using the appropriate CEPD1 notification. This list is not exhaustive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>phone number</li>
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>vulnerability status</li>
  <li>appointee / Power of Attorney</li>
  <li>a change of Jobcentre Plus and/ or work coach</li>
  <li>entitlement to benefit work search and work availability requirements (including Easements and tailored conditionality)</li>
  <li>where a Participant in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> closes their claim and makes a claim for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Participant is in prison or leaves prison</li>
  <li>Participant death</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: Whilst the majority of change of circumstances notifications will be issued by the Jobcentre Plus work coach on occasions they may be issued by a Universal Credit agent.</p>
</div>

<h2>Participant Personal Information Changes</h2>

<p>7.10.	On receipt of CEPD1 you must update your records immediately with any changes to your Participant’s personal information, including name, address, phone number, email address, vulnerability and appointee/power of attorney, change of work coach or Jobcentre which have been notified to you by the Jobcentre Plus work coach, to ensure that you hold the most up to date Participant’s details.</p>

<p>7.11.	Where your Participant experiences changes to their vulnerability status, to ensure your Participant receives appropriate advanced support, you must take immediate action to review and tailor your engagement, support and intervention activity taking into account the information and advice contained within the CEPD1. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 21 – Participants with Complex Needs Who May Require Advanced Support.</p>

<p>7.12.	If your Participant relocates to another <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> within England or Wales, they will remain your responsibility. You must arrange appropriate support which may be via strategic partners to deliver the service requirement until the end of the Participant’s time on the Restart Scheme. For Wales, a participant who moves from Wales into England and is under 18 years old, continues to remain eligible for the Restart Scheme offer and the original Provider is responsible for arranging ongoing support.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: For Participants who move outside of England and Wales for a period that is expected to be longer than the Participant’s remaining time on the Restart Scheme, their participation on the Restart Scheme will end.</p>

<p>For those Participants who are expected to return within their allotted time, they will remain on the Restart Scheme and you should continue to engage with them accordingly.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note:  During your regular review of the Provider Referral Payment System (PRaP) Reporting on Employment Earnings Notifications from UCRTE report via the iSupplier portal you may identify prior to the Jobcentre Plus work coach that a Participant has ceased work. If a Change of Circumstances notification has not been received from the Jobcentre Plus work coach, you may wish to confirm if the Participant is now in receipt of UC and which regime they are now assigned to and request a change of circumstances notification if appropriate. Where it is confirmed that the participant is in receipt of UC you must follow the specific UC guidance.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note:  Once a Participant has started, they will remain on the Restart Scheme for 365 calendar days, unless they satisfy one of the early completer criteria.</p>

<p>You should continue to deliver the full Restart Scheme support offer according to your contract, for the full time that the participant is on the Restart Scheme, unless you have been notified by the Jobcentre Work Coach via CEPD1 that there should be no contact for a limited period of time.</p>

<p>Where there has been a change of circumstances affecting your Participant, their ongoing engagement with your Restart Scheme support offer may be mandatory or voluntary.  You will be advised of any such changes by your Jobcentre Plus work coach via CEPD1. Where no contact is to be made or a Participant who is classed as voluntary does not attend or avail themselves to the support offer, then you should record this. This evidence should be recorded to provide an audit trail which can be reflected within the PCO checks.</p>
</div>

<h2>Easements and tailoring for <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> <abbr title="Income–based">IB</abbr> claimants</h2>

<p>7.13.	Participants in receipt of Income-based Jobseekers Allowance will have claimant commitments which are tailored to their individual circumstances. Whilst Participants in receipt of <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> must be available and willing to start work and attend a job interview immediately, there are certain circumstances where your Participant may be given more time and their claimant commitment will reflect this. During your initial engagement and intervention activity you will have developed and agreed goals with your Participant taking into account any restrictions that will have been advised through <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> as part of the referral and during the warm handover with the Jobcentre Plus work coach. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2B – Referral Process and Initial Engagement and Chapter 4B - Early intervention.</p>

<p>7.14.	During your Participant’s time on the Restart Scheme there may be instances where issues or events prevent your Participant from reasonably complying with their benefit conditionality, including participation on the Restart Scheme. <abbr title="Income–based Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA (IB)</abbr> Regulations enable Jobcentre Plus work coaches, in particular circumstances, to tailor a Participant’s Claimant’s Commitment or put easements in place.</p>

<p>7.15.	The Jobcentre Plus work coach will review the circumstances with your Participant to determine if tailoring or an easement is appropriate, and the Participant’s Claimant Commitment will be changed to reflect this.</p>

<p>7.16.	The purpose of an easement is to give your Participant the opportunity to resolve any immediate issues arising from the situation, such as finding new accommodation, or completing an agreed activity. The easement requirement will be regularly reviewed by the Jobcentre Plus work coach.</p>

<p>7.17.	If your Participant notifies the Jobcentre Plus work coach of a situation where an easement or tailoring is deemed appropriate, the Jobcentre Plus work coach will send you a change of circumstances notification CEPD1 via unencrypted email with information relating to what has been agreed with your Participant.</p>

<p>7.18.	The change of circumstances notification will explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the Participant is currently unable to attend or take part in the Restart Scheme</li>
  <li>whether the Participant is subject to other work related requirements, which may include work preparation requirements, work focused interview requirements, or limiting work search or work availability requirements to ensure that the requirements imposed on Participants are reasonable given their capability and circumstances</li>
  <li>the reason</li>
  <li>date of commencement (it may also include details of the duration)</li>
  <li>that you will be notified when the circumstances change.</li>
</ul>

<p>7.19.	Where there is a change to your Participant’s Claimant Commitment as a result of tailoring or an easement being applied, this will need to be reflected in the engagement and support you offer; in some instances this may mean no contact for a specific period of time.</p>

<p>7.20.	You will need to review the identified limitation(s) with your Participant and amend the action plan and diagnostic assessment accordingly. However, if you are advised that your Participant is unable to attend or take part, then you will need to suspend your engagement and have no contact with your Participant until the easement has ceased. For example, your Participant may lose a partner or child, in these circumstance you could be advised that contact is switched off for a period of three months, this could then be followed by a period of optional support for a further three months which might be meetings without mandation being applicable.</p>

<p>7.21.	If an easement means a suspension of engagement with your Participant, you should only raise a compliance doubt where a mandated activity was due for completion prior to the easement start date. When the easement period ends, the Jobcentre Plus work coach will send you another notification confirming the end date (unless already advised via the first notification), at which point you can resume engagement with your Participant.</p>

<p>7.22.	When you receive notification via a change of circumstances notification CEPD1 that the easement period has ended or agreed limitations no longer apply, you will then need to review the action plan and diagnostic assessment with your Participant to ensure that on-going intervention is in line with the Restart Scheme requirements.</p>

<p>7.23.	Where your Participant has been awarded a period of easement they will not have their time on the Restart Scheme extended, it will remain at 365 calendar days.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note:  For full information on data sharing and action to take during any IT disruption. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 20 - Data Sharing Between DWP and Providers.</p>
</div>

<h2>Early Completer</h2>

<p>7.24.	Where it is identified that Restart Scheme is no longer appropriate for your Participant, resulting in them being an early completer you will receive a change of circumstances notification from the Jobcentre Plus work coach. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 13B – Restart Scheme Completers and Early Exits.</p>

<h2>Participant Death</h2>

<p>7.25.	If your Participant’s representative notifies you that your Participant has died you must direct your Participant’s representative to contact <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Bereavement Service to report the death.</p>

<p>7.26.	At this stage you should only note your records and must not undertake any action to input an end date and completer reason, until you receive confirmation of your Participant’s death from the Jobcentre Plus work coach.</p>

<p>7.27.	If the Jobcentre Plus work coach becomes aware that your Participant has died, they will contact you immediately and formally notify you by issuing a change of circumstances notification CEPD1 which will be sent via unencrypted email.</p>

<p>7.28.	Once you receive the information from the Jobcentre Plus work coach you should update the Provider Referral and Payment (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) system. The actual date of death must be recorded and not the date that the notification of your Participants death was received. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 13B - Restart Scheme Completers and Early Exits.</p>

<h2>Participant is in prison or leaves prison</h2>

<p>7.29.	If your Participant is imprisoned, you will receive a change of circumstances notification CEPD1and they will remain on the Restart Scheme if the period of detainment is shorter than their balance of time. You will then need to cease engagement including the use of mandation until their release. When your Participant is released you will need to re-engage as per the full Restart Scheme support offer and consider the impact of imprisonment in consultation with your Participant when reviewing the diagnostic assessment and action plan. This engagement and support will need to reflect the labour market regime that your Participant returns to. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 5B – Ongoing Interventions.</p>

<h2>Identification of inappropriate referrals following a start</h2>

<p>7.30. Following your Participant’s start on the Restart Scheme, the Jobcentre Plus work coach may identify an inappropriate referral. 
As a start will have been recorded, it is important that the appropriate action is taken on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the Jobcentre Plus work coach indicates one of the following reasons on a change of circumstances notification CEPD1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Participant was in and remains in paid employment before the start was recorded.</li>
  <li>The Participant was identified as been gainfully self-employed before the start was recorded.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must claim an end line (Line 3) using leaver reason 46 ‘exceptional circumstances’. A request for a <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> 14 should be sent to the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) requesting them to back out all lines, clearly stating one of the reasons above.</p>

<p>Once the action has been completed by <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>, you must cancel the acknowledgment and claim ‘did not start’.</p>

<p>7.31. If the Jobcentre Plus work coach indicates that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is a duplicate referral to the Restart Scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>You must immediately contact <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> with the customers Purchase Order number. You must not take any action in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>. <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> will investigate which Purchase Order number has the Real Time Earnings interest set against it. Once identified, you will be advised as to the Purchase Order number requiring a <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> 14 request to be raised in order to back out the start line. This will be the Purchase Order number that does not have an interest set against it.</p>

<p>Once the action has been completed by <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>, you must cancel the acknowledgment and claim ‘did not start’.</p>

<p>7.32. Should you receive a change of circumstances notification CEPD1 form requesting an end to participation that does not indicate any of the exit reasons in Chapter 13B – Restart scheme completers and early exits or the inappropriate referral criteria above, you must contact your single point of contact within Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p><abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> 14s for the Restart Scheme, will only be accepted by <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> for the reasons listed within this section of guidance.</p>

<p>Should you have claimed an end line (Line 3) in error you will need to contact your performance manager and explain how this has occurred, so that this request can be considered by them and Restart Policy team.</p>

<p>Should you require an accessible version of any of the Restart Scheme forms listed in this guidance you will need to request them via email at:  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CMPD.PMO@DWP.GOV.UK">CMPD.PMO@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>
