<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>8.01. The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance when mandating a Universal Credit Participant to undertake activity during their time on the Restart Scheme, and particular considerations when mandating a Potential Participant to the initial meeting. It provides advice regarding the factors you must take into account when choosing to mandate, and outlines the steps which must be undertaken to correctly mandate a Participant.</p>

<h2>Mandation</h2>

<p>8.02. Universal Credit claimants may be required by their Jobcentre Plus work coach to undertake particular action where it will help them prepare for or move into work – this requirement is mandation. A claimant may be sanctioned, if they fail to complete without a good reason, an activity that was reasonable and achievable in their circumstances.</p>

<p>8.03. You are also able to mandate Participants to undertake activities during their time on the Restart Scheme, subject to the legal and policy requirements outlined within this chapter.</p>

<p>8.04. The relationship you establish with each Participant during their time on the Restart Scheme is key to providing quality and tailored support to help them prepare for and move into work. Engagement and collaboration between your Participant and you, in conjunction with the Jobcentre Plus work coach, is key to developing this.</p>

<p>8.05. Your interactions with each Participant must reflect their personal circumstances and preferences, and all activities should be agreed together to encourage them to complete them voluntarily. You must have a variety of methods and approaches to achieve this.</p>

<p>8.06. Where you have attempted engagement via these various methods and approaches but they have not been successful, mandation may be another approach to encourage the Participant to complete activities.</p>

<p>8.07. You may consider using mandation to require Participants to undertake activity, such as to attend an appointment or complete an activity that helps them prepare for or move into work. Further information regarding low level sanctions can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>8.08. Engagement with Restart Scheme Participants should not be through the use of permanent mandation for each/every activity. However, if for example, repeated attempts to engage have failed, then you can consider the use of mandation to require a Participant to complete an activity, subject to the requirements outlined within this chapter.</p>

<h2>Considering mandating a Participant to undertake activity</h2>

<p>8.09. You must consider each of the following questions when considering mandation, and be confident that each is satisfied before requiring a Participant to undertake an activity:</p>

<h3>Will the activity help them prepare for or move into work?</h3>

<p>8.10. All activities your Participant undertakes during their time on the Restart Scheme must help them prepare for or move into work – this applies to activities you agree your Participant will complete on a voluntary basis and those you mandate them to undertake.</p>

<p>8.11. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> does not provide a prescriptive list of activities. You have the freedom to determine the activity you require your Participant to undertake, provided it has the clear aim of helping them prepare for or move into work.</p>

<p>8.12. The only restriction to this is mandating your Participant to complete work experience, apply for work, attend a job interview or take up work. You may agree these as voluntary activities, but you must not set these as mandatory requirements. Where you have concerns about your Participant’s willingness to attend job interviews, or take up work, you should raise these concerns with the Participant’s Jobcentre Plus work coach via a two-way or three-way conversation, as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Have I tried other ways to encourage the Participant to undertake the activity?</h3>

<p>8.13. The use of mandation should be used in a careful and considered manner, and in line with the engagement approach outlined in your organisation’s bids.</p>

<p>8.14. You must only consider mandating a Participant to undertake an activity where they have had the opportunity to complete it on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>8.15. If you have not yet made attempts which provide the Participant with the opportunity to complete the activity on a voluntary basis you must not use mandation at this point. You must first utilise other methods to encourage your Participant to undertake the activity, to give them the opportunity to demonstrate willingness and undertake the activity which will help them prepare for or move into work. Only where you have utilised the methods in 8.14 and they have not demonstrated this willingness can mandation be considered.</p>

<p>8.16. As stated above, these methods may include the use of two-way or three-way conversations. A two-way conversation with the Jobcentre Plus work coach can be held at any point, including prior to the Initial Face to Face Meeting, and may encourage initial engagement. A three-way conversation involving the Jobcentre Plus work coach and Participant is an option to be considered once the Participant has started on the Restart Scheme, and may be used to discuss and resolve any concerns regarding participation.</p>

<p>8.17. Further information regarding three-way conversations can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 2A – Referral process and initial engagement.</p>

<h3>Is the activity I am considering reasonable and achievable in the Participant’s circumstances?</h3>

<p>8.18. You must only consider mandating your Participant to undertake an activity where it is reasonable and achievable in their circumstances. Some Participants may have tailored work-related requirements which must be taken into consideration when setting activities. For example, Participants with a health condition may have limitations on their availability and the type of work they are available for, and it would not be reasonable to require them to undertake activities which do not align with this.</p>

<p>8.19. Information regarding tailoring work-related requirements will be shared with you in the referral from Jobcentre Plus, or via the change of circumstances process where it changes during your Participant’s time on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<h3>Are there any known complex needs or any challenges which mean mandation is not an appropriate approach?</h3>

<p>8.20. You must only consider mandating your Participant to undertake an activity where there are no known complex needs or other challenges which may prevent them from being able to complete it. Information gathered from Job Centre Plus during the referral process, including the Warm Handover, as well as any change of circumstance notifications will help you identify any concerns or challenges, in addition to the information you gather during your interactions with your Participant.</p>

<p>8.21. Participants with complex needs or challenges requiring additional support are not exempt from being mandated to undertake activities, where they have work-related requirements imposed. However, you must be satisfied that there are no challenges which affect your Participant’s ability to understand the requirement including its mandatory nature and the possible consequences of not completing it, or their ability to complete the activity.</p>

<p>8.22. You should consider whether mandating the Participant to an activity or the possible sanctionable consequence of failing to comply could have a negative impact. For example, the Participant may be suffering from mental health challenges which could worsen as a result of mandation or sanction. Although you may wish to proceed with mandating your Participant to undertake an activity, you must assess the possible impact and ensure measures are in place to minimise the possible negative impact on them – See Restart Provider Guidance Chapter 1.</p>

<p>8.23. Further information regarding advanced support needs can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-21-participants-with-complex-needs-who-may-require-advanced-support">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 21</a> – Participants with complex needs who may require advanced support. Further information regarding change of circumstances can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 7A – Change of circumstances.</p>

<h3>Is the Participant in a Labour Market Regime with work-related requirements which enables me to mandate to an activity?</h3>

<p>8.24. You must check that your Participant is in receipt of Universal Credit and in a Labour Market Regime which imposes work-related requirements. This information will be contained within the referral from Jobcentre Plus, and you will be notified where your Participant changes regimes during their time on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>8.25. All Participants will be in the Universal Credit Intensive Work Search Regime (<abbr title="Intensive Work Search Regime">IWSR</abbr>) when they are referred to the Restart Scheme, but they may move into another Labour Market Regime or close their claim to Universal Credit completely.</p>

<p>8.26. Participants in the <abbr title="Intensive Work Search Regime">IWSR</abbr>, Work Preparation Regime (<abbr title="Work Preparation Regime">WPR</abbr>) and Work Focussed Interview Regime (<abbr title="Work Focused Interview Regime">WFIR</abbr>) have differing work-related requirements which will affect the types of activity you may be able to mandate them to undertake. For example, Participants in the <abbr title="Work Focused Interview Regime">WFIR</abbr> do not have work preparation requirements and so must not be mandated to work preparation activity, for example to prepare a CV.</p>

<p>8.27. If your Participant is not in receipt of Universal Credit, for example they have had a change of circumstances since starting on the Restart Scheme and are and no longer in receipt of Universal Credit, their participation is on a voluntary basis, and they cannot be mandated to undertake any activity.</p>

<p>8.28. Further information regarding the Labour Market Regimes and work-related requirements can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 5A – Ongoing interventions.</p>

<h3>Does the Participant have any Easements which means work-related requirements may be switched off?</h3>

<p>8.29. You must check that your Participant is in a Labour Market Regime which imposes work-related requirements, and that there are no Easements in place which have resulted in the Jobcentre Plus work coach choosing to “switch off” conditionality for a period of time.</p>

<p>8.30. A Restart Scheme Participant may have an Easement in place where they have a change in their circumstances and it is not reasonable to expect them to complete their requirements, for example where they are the victim of domestic violence and abuse.</p>

<p>8.31. Whilst having an Easement in place may mean it is not appropriate to mandate your Participant to undertake an activity, they are still participating in the Restart Scheme and should have the full support offer available to them. It may be that you need to adapt your engagement approach to reflect the Participant’s circumstances, unless the Jobcentre Plus work coach advises engagement should be paused completely due to the nature of the Easement.</p>

<p>8.32. Jobcentre Plus will notify you of any change to your Participant’s work-related requirements including where Easements are in place, to inform your ongoing engagement including the use of mandation.</p>

<p>8.33. Further information regarding Easements and switching off requirements can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 5A – Ongoing interventions.</p>

<h3>Have I mandated the Participant to undertake this activity before and am I awaiting the outcome of a compliance doubt for a failure/is a sanction already in place?</h3>

<p>8.34. Finally, you must check if you have mandated your Participant to undertake this activity before and the status of the compliance doubt where they previously failed to comply.</p>

<p>8.35. Where you have previously mandated your Participant to undertake this activity and a sanction has been imposed for failure to comply, you must not mandate your Participant to undertake this activity again until they have met the compliance condition to end the open-ended element of any sanction.</p>

<p>8.36. Equally, you may be awaiting the outcome of the compliance doubt you have raised previously. Again, you must not mandate your Participant to undertake this type of activity at this point, and instead you must await the outcome and only mandate again where no sanction is imposed.</p>

<p>8.37. This is intended to prevent Participants experiencing multiple sanctions for the same activity and instead focus their engagement on compliance to bring an open-ended sanction to end.</p>

<p>8.38. If the activity is different, you may consider mandating them to undertake it.</p>

<p>8.39. For example, where your Participant was mandated to take part in a job search session and they failed to complete it, you must not mandate them to this again until you have received the outcome of the compliance doubt and no sanction has been imposed. If a sanction is imposed, you must not mandate them to this activity again until they have complied and brought the open-ended element of the sanction to an end. However, you may mandate them to complete another activity whilst you are awaiting the outcome of the compliance doubt or where a sanction is imposed, for example to attend an adviser interview.</p>

<p>8.40. Further information regarding compliance can be found in paragraph 8.53 and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-10-participant-compliance">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 10</a> – Participant compliance.</p>

<h2>Setting a mandatory activity</h2>

<p>8.41. Where you have considered the questions above and still wish to mandate your Participant to undertake an activity, you must follow each step below to ensure you meet the legal and policy requirements when setting the mandatory activity:</p>

<h3>Populate the Mandatory Activity Notification (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr>) template</h3>

<p>8.42. The <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> is the notification you must issue to a Participant each time you mandate them to undertake an activity. When mandating a Participant to undertake an activity you must ensure that the correct <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> template is used. For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participants you must ensure that you use the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr>. To clarify whether a Participant is a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimant please check the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> Purchase Order Number; it will start with 70 for records in respect of Universal Credit claimants.</p>

<p>8.43. The <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> must only contain details of one mandatory requirement – if you are considering mandating to more than one activity you must issue a separate <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> for each one.</p>

<p>8.44. The <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> must contain the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the specific action that the Participant is required to undertake to meet the requirement</li>
  <li>when or by when they must undertake it</li>
  <li>the location of the activity</li>
  <li>what evidence they must supply to demonstrate completion, if any</li>
  <li>a contact name and number of activity provider</li>
  <li>the compliance condition they must undertake if they fail to comply, and a sanction is subsequently imposed – see paragraph 8.56 for further information.</li>
</ul>

<p>8.45. The <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> is a template provided by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and designed to satisfy the legal requirements when mandating to an activity. It is intended to provide the Participant with written notification of the mandatory requirement you set, including details of how they complete it. You must always use the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> provided by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and not create any other versions. Aside from the sections available to you to input specific details of the activity, you must not amend any content.</p>

<p>8.46. The <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> template can be found in Annex 1 of this chapter.</p>

<h3>Issue the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> to the Participant</h3>

<p>8.47. You can issue the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> to your Participant face to face or by post. When choosing between these two methods you must take into account any known advanced support needs or challenges.</p>

<p>8.48. You must ensure the time between issuing of the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> and the date of the mandatory activity is reasonable. This may include additional time to enable your Participant to be able to attend, for example replacement care.</p>

<p>8.49. Where you choose to issue the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> by post, you must consider timing between posting and your Participant receiving the notification. To inform your timeframe when posting, for the purposes of the Restart Scheme the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> is taken to have been received on the second working day after posting.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: Working day is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or Public Holiday in England and Wales.</p>
</div>

<p>8.50. It is not a requirement to use registered post to ensure delivery, but you may wish to consider this to provide assurance that it has been delivered to your Participant.</p>

<p>8.51. There are no other permissible methods of issuing the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> to your Participant. However, you may wish to use additional methods to communicate with your Participant and remind them of the mandatory requirement, for example email, SMS.</p>

<p>8.52. You may wish to provide additional information with the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> to support your Participant’s understanding and maximise engagement, for example a map outlining the location of the activity.</p>

<h3>Update records to reflect mandation</h3>

<p>8.53. You must record the mandatory activity in your Participant’s action plan along with all other activities and steps they are expected to carry out.</p>

<p>8.54. You must keep a copy of each <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> you issue, as you may be asked to provide it in the event your Participant is sanctioned and appeals.</p>

<h3>Compliance condition</h3>

<p>8.55. When you mandate your Participant to undertake an activity, you must also decide an appropriate compliance condition and include this information in the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr>.</p>

<p>8.56. The compliance condition is the action your Participant must complete to stop the open-ended element of a sanction continuing where they have failed to undertake an activity.</p>

<p>8.57. It is important Participants are notified of the compliance condition when you mandate them to undertake an activity, as it outlines what they must to do bring an end to the open-ended element of a subsequent sanction as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>8.58. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has provided four compliance conditions and you must pick the most appropriate based on the mandatory activity and your Participant’s circumstances. The compliance conditions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the provider and agree a date for future attendance and attend re-arranged appointment</li>
  <li>undertake agreed work preparation activity (or agree to and undertake this activity at an agreed future date where it cannot be completed on the same day)</li>
  <li>supply specific information (relevant to work-related requirements)</li>
  <li>agree a date for future attendance at an appointment or placement with a third party (that is: college, skills training course) where the third party cannot arrange for the same day and attend the re-arranged appointment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Considering re-arranging a mandatory activity</h2>

<p>8.59. Your Participant may contact you in between the date you have set the mandatory activity and the date they are required to complete it, to request it is rearranged for another date. You have the discretion to agree whether to rearrange the activity or whether they are still required to complete it.</p>

<p>8.60. Where you choose to agree to a rearrangement, there is no longer a mandatory requirement for your Participant to undertake the activity as notified to them on the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr>, and you are not required to raise a compliance doubt.</p>

<p>8.61. If you agree to rearrange the activity and you still wish to mandate your Participant to undertake it, you must issue another <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> with the revised details and follow the earlier guidance in this chapter. You must also update your Participant’s action plan to reflect the change to the activity set.</p>

<p>8.62. You may choose not to agree to a rearrangement, which will mean your Participant is still required to undertake the activity. If they subsequently fail to undertake the activity you must raise a compliance doubt. Further information regarding raising a compliance doubt can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 9A – Raising a compliance doubt.</p>

<p>8.63. To support you when considering whether to rearrange a mandatory activity, you may wish to review their engagement up to this point. For example, repeated failure to undertake activity or repeated requests to rearrange may lead to you decide you will not agree to rearrange a mandatory activity.</p>

<p>8.64. You may also request evidence to support the reasons for the request to rearrange the mandatory activity, although this is not a requirement.</p>

<h2>Mandating a Potential Participant to attend the initial meeting</h2>

<p>8.65. You may consider utilising mandation to require a Potential Participant to attend the Initial Face to Face Meeting. If multiple attempts have been made, using a variety of communication methods, and they have not been successful, you should be aware, that if you are unable to facilitate the Initial Face to Face Meeting (in person or by other means, if restrictions apply) within 30 working days, then this will impact your ability to meet <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr> 1.</p>

<p>8.66. To mandate a Potential Participant to attend the initial meeting, you must consider the same requirements outlined in ‘Considering mandating a Participant to undertake activity’ within this chapter.</p>

<p>8.67. You must also complete the same activities outlined in ‘Setting a mandatory activity’ within this chapter.</p>

<p>The only difference in the activities you will undertake when mandating a Potential Participant to attend the initial meeting is that you will be unable to record the activity in an action plan, as one will not have been created at this point. In this scenario you must record the activity on your internal systems instead, so the record of the activity is accessible as required.</p>

<h2>Annex 1 – Mandatory Activity Notification</h2>

<p>Should you require an accessible version of any of the Restart Scheme forms listed in this guidance you will need to request them via email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CMPD.PMO@DWP.GOV.UK">CMPD.PMO@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>
