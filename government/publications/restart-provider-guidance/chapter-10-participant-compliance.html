<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>10.1. The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance on how to bring an end to a Participant’s open-ended sanction following compliance. It also provides advice where a Potential Participant is sanctioned for failing to attend the initial meeting and has not complied by the end of the 30 working day period.</p>

<p>10.2. The information in this chapter applies only to Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) Participants.</p>

<h2>Compliance</h2>

<p>10.3. Compliance occurs where a Participant undertakes a specific activity to bring an open-ended sanction to end.</p>

<p>10.4. A Participant has complied when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have completed the mandated activity or an alternative one that you mandate them to undertake</li>
  <li>it is no longer reasonable for them to undertake the mandated activity</li>
  <li>they have a change of circumstances which means they move to a Labour Market Regime which does not permit mandation. Further information regarding change of circumstances can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 7A – change of circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p>10.5. A fixed period sanction will be imposed once the open-ended element has been closed. Further information regarding sanctions can be found in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 9A – Raising a compliance doubt.</p>

<p>10.6. Where your Participant has failed to undertake a mandatory activity and you have raised a compliance doubt, you must continue to attempt to engage with them. You must not wait for your Participant to contact you. This will provide the earliest opportunity for your Participant to meet their compliance condition and bring the open-ended element of any sanction imposed to an end quickly, and make the most of the support available to them during their time on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<h2>Participant completes the mandated activity</h2>

<p>10.7. Your Participant may go on to complete the mandated activity you set, where it is possible for them to do so.</p>

<p>10.8. The date of compliance will be the day they complete the mandated activity.</p>

<p>10.9. Where the mandatory activity involves your Participant attending a meeting which cannot take place immediately, the compliance date will be the date that your Participant has contacted you, provided that they go on to attend the meeting.</p>

<h2>Participant undertakes the compliance condition</h2>

<p>10.10. It is for you to decide that your Participant has undertaken the compliance condition set when they were notified of the mandated activity.</p>

<p>10.11. Where the compliance condition involves your Participant attending a meeting which cannot be arranged immediately, the compliance date will be the date that your Participant has contacted you, provided that they go on to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>10.12. There may be instances where you feel your Participant has only partially met the compliance condition. You must then engage and work with your Participant so they are clear what else they need to do to fully comply. Where the Participant does not fully comply but feels that they have, you must follow the process outlined in the ‘Participant disputes not meeting the compliance condition’ section of this chapter.</p>

<h2>Participant is no longer required to undertake the mandated activity</h2>

<p>10.13. You may decide that it is no longer reasonable for your Participant to undertake the mandated activity, for example where a change in circumstances mean it is no longer appropriate for your Participant to undertake it.</p>

<p>10.14. Where this is the case, the date of compliance is the day before the date they are notified that they are no longer required to undertake the activity. For further information, see the ‘How to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of compliance’ section within this chapter.</p>

<h2>When to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of compliance</h2>

<p>10.15. Where your Participant has failed to undertake a mandated activity and you have raised a compliance doubt, you must continue to attempt engagement whilst you monitor receipt of the outcome notification. This will encourage your Participant to comply at the earliest opportunity and enable you to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> following compliance quickly to bring the open-ended element of any sanction imposed to an end quickly.</p>

<p>10.16. You must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of compliance promptly, even if you have not yet received the outcome of the compliance doubt. This may mean you are notifying <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of compliance at the same time as raising the compliance doubt or shortly after, depending on how quickly your Participant complies.</p>

<p>10.17. It is important that you notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of compliance as quickly as possible to avoid prolonging your Participant’s loss of Universal Credit payments.</p>

<p>10.18. The only instance where an open-ended sanction will be ended without your notification is where your Participant moves into the No Work Related Requirements regime, or a Labour Market regime where the activity cannot be set as a mandatory requirement. Here the Universal Credit Decision Maker (<abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr>) will undertake the actions required to bring any sanction to an end.</p>

<h2>How to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of compliance</h2>

<p>10.19. You must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of compliance by completing and sending a UCD604 ‘Information regarding a sanction for Universal Credit’ form.</p>

<p>10.20. The UCD604 form will provide the Universal Credit <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> with the information they need to bring the open-ended element of a sanction to an end and impose the fixed element promptly.</p>

<p>10.21. It is important you complete all relevant sections of the UCD604 form and take care to complete it accurately, to prevent any delays to reinstating your Participant’s Universal Credit payments and avoidable financial hardship. Any UCD604 forms which are incomplete or inaccurate will be returned to you for correction and resubmission.</p>

<p>10.22. You must take care to select the correct compliance scenario within the UCD604 form and the date of compliance where it is applicable.</p>

<p>10.23. Once completed you must send the completed UCD604 form to the District Restart Triage inbox by unencrypted email and include only the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> reference number in the e-mail subject box. i.e. Subject: <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> 1a. You will have been notified of the email addresses for these inboxes during implementation activity.</p>

<p>10.24. The Universal Credit <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> will accept your decision of compliance and will undertake the actions required on receipt of the UCD604 form. You will not receive a notification that the open-ended element of the sanction has been brought to an end or that the fixed element has been applied.</p>

<h2>Participant disputes not meeting compliance condition</h2>

<p>10.25. There may be instances where your Participant feels they have met the compliance condition you set, but you do not agree.</p>

<p>10.26. You should first discuss this with your Participant to resolve the disagreement, including explaining what you feel they should do to fully comply.</p>

<p>10.27. Where you are unable to reach an agreement, you must refer this to the Universal Credit <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> following the same process outlined in the ‘How to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of compliance’ section above. You should select the ‘I consider that the Participant has not fully complied’ option from the list of scenarios and complete sections A-D to provide information to enable the Universal Credit <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> to make a decision. This includes any information and evidence from your Participant regarding why they feel they have met the compliance condition.</p>

<h2>Potential Participant has not complied within 30 working day period</h2>

<p>10.28. Particular consideration must be given where your Potential Participant has had a sanction imposed for failing to attend the initial meeting, and has not complied by the end of the 30 working day period.</p>

<p>10.29. This is a unique scenario as beyond this point you will input ‘Did Not Attend’ (<abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr>) to the Provider Referral and Payment (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) system and return the Potential Participant to Jobcentre Plus. This means they will have no further opportunity to engage with you and comply to bring the open-ended sanction to an end.</p>

<p>10.30. To avoid claimant uncertainty and prolonging any open-ended sanction, you must deem the Potential Participant as no longer required to undertake the mandatory activity and notify the Universal Credit <abbr title="Decision Makers">DM</abbr> via the UCD604 form, at the same time you input <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> to <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>. You should follow the same process outlined in the ‘How to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of compliance’ section above.</p>
