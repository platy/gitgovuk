<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>16.01. This Chapter sets out the background to the Customer Satisfaction Measure, how you can encourage the participation in completion of surveys, and how the surveys will inform continuous improvement.</p>

<p>16.02. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will monitor the overall level of customer satisfaction with the Restart Scheme, through a Customer Satisfaction Measure. The measure will consist of a quarterly survey of a random sample of Participants in each Contract Package Area (<abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Survey Activity Information</h2>

<p>16.03. The survey will be conducted by an independent contractor. The survey will consist of an overall question about customer satisfaction and three to four additional questions focusing on specific aspects of the Participant journey.</p>

<p>16.04. The overall question on customer satisfaction will be; “Thinking about your overall experience of the services provided, how satisfied are you with the Restart Scheme?” This overall question will always be asked at each quarterly survey to provide consistency during the Restart Scheme lifetime.</p>

<p>16.05. Results from the overall question will form the basis of the measure for Customer Service Standard (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>) 8. In addition, Cabinet Office publish performance information on a quarterly basis against the Governments major projects. A summary of the Customer Satisfaction Survey results at national level will form one of the Restart Scheme’s three key performance indicators for publication by Cabinet Office.</p>

<p>16.06. Survey Participants will be asked three to four additional questions to establish satisfaction levels with regards to different aspects of service delivery. These additional questions may change over the lifetime of the Restart Scheme. The information gathered from these additional questions will be used to identify areas of potential improvement, and may be used during contract performance review meetings and at annual Contract Review Points. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 14 - Performance Management and Chapter 15 - Contract Review Points.</p>

<p>16.07. The sample size selected will allow meaningful <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> level analysis, as well as providing a national picture of satisfaction levels.</p>

<h2>Provider Action</h2>

<p>16.08. As the survey will be conducted independently, there is no direct action for you to take with regards to completion of this survey. However, it would be good practice for you to explain to your Participants that they may be contacted by the survey provider, and that completing the survey will help provide information that will be used to improve the future delivery of the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>16.09. Survey information will be shared with you and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. This information may be used in your contract performance review meetings with your Performance Manager and at the annual Contract Review Point meeting. See Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 14 – Performance Management and Chapter 15 - Contract Review Points.</p>

<p>16.10. You may still wish to carry out your own Participant surveys for your own information, during your delivery of the Restart Scheme.</p>
