<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>19.01. In this section we describe what you must have in place to ensure Participants who are unhappy with the service they receive are able to raise a complaint, and the processes you must follow to respond and resolve any issues raised.</p>

<p>19.02. A complaint is defined by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as any expression of dissatisfaction about the service provided which is not resolved by operational staff as normal business.</p>

<h2>Complaints Overview</h2>

<p>19.03. There should be no barriers to your Participants making a complaint – they or the person, organisation or professional body representing them should be able to make a complaint in the manner which best suits their communication needs.</p>

<p>19.04. Information about your complaint process should be widely available and easily understood by your staff and Participants. It should include details of the complaint process, timescales for responding and details of how to escalate a complaint if your Participant is not satisfied with your final response to their complaint.</p>

<p>19.05. To meet these expectations, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a complaints process in place for yourself and across the whole of your supply chain which can be easily accessed by your Participants or their representatives</li>
  <li>explain your internal complaints process to your Participants during your first contact with them - see Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 3 Initial Meeting and Start.</li>
  <li>take all steps outlined in your internal procedure to resolve the complaint at the earliest possible opportunity</li>
  <li>complete all action to your stated timescales</li>
  <li>ensure you retain a full log of complaints received, correspondence and phone calls as well as the complaint outcome in case this is information needed for an Independent Case Examiner (<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>) referral and/or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> audit teams. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may also request and expect you to supply this data on an ad hoc basis</li>
  <li>ensure your Participants are aware of their rights to bring their complaint to the Independent Case Examiner (<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>) within 6 months of your final response</li>
</ul>

<p>19.06. After following all steps in your process, you must include in your final response to your Participant a standard text which informs the customer to contact <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> should they wish to pursue their complaint. The text can be found in Annex 1.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note:  A final response can be written or verbal, but in all instances must include the information shown at Annex 1.</p>
</div>

<p>19.07. It is your responsibility to resolve any dissatisfaction, concerns or complaints internally through your own process. In some circumstances however, it may be necessary to contact the Jobcentre Plus work coach or your 
Performance Manager in the first instance for additional advice.</p>

<h2>Responding to and Handling Complaints</h2>

<p>19.08. Where your Participant is unhappy with the service they are receiving from you or Jobcentre Plus in relation to delivery of the Restart Scheme, they may raise a complaint. On occasions you may also receive complaints from employers or enquiries on your Participant’s behalf from elected officials.</p>

<p>19.09. The following section describes the steps you must take in each different scenario to respond to and resolve complaints.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Participant makes a complaint against your organisation or staff directly to you</h3>

<ul>
  <li>take all steps outlined in your procedure to resolve the complaint</li>
  <li>take all action to your stated timescales</li>
  <li>on reaching the end of your process you must include the information at Annex 1 in your final response</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Participant makes a complaint against you to Jobcentre Plus</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Jobcentre Plus staff will direct your Participant to raise their issue with you so you have an opportunity to resolve it to their satisfaction</li>
  <li>on receipt of the complaint, you should follow your complaints procedure as normal</li>
  <li>you must deal with your Participant’s complaint in the same way you would have done, had they raised it with you directly</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Participant makes a mixed complaint (against you and Jobcentre Plus)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>if your Participant raises this type of complaint with you, you should direct them to their Jobcentre Plus work coach. The Participant can raise their complaint with Jobcentre Plus either face to face in the Jobcentre or via their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Journal</li>
  <li>Jobcentre Plus will lead on responding to your Participant and will ask for a contribution from you regarding the element of the complaint which relates to your services</li>
  <li>if you are contacted by Jobcentre Plus you should where possible return any evidence or contribution within the stated timescales or if a deadline has not been stated within a maximum of 5 working days</li>
  <li>Jobcentre Plus will issue the final response, inclusive of your contribution, to your Participant</li>
  <li>if your Participant remains dissatisfied at this point, they will be advised to approach you directly about any issues which relate to the service you provide</li>
  <li>you should treat the first combined response from Jobcentre Plus as the first stage of your complaints process and escalate your Participant’s issue to the next stage of your complaint procedure</li>
  <li>Jobcentre Plus will deal independently with any remaining issues relating to its services</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Participant makes a complaint to you about Restart Scheme policy</h3>

<p>If a Participant raises a complaint with you regarding the requirement for them to participate in the Restart Scheme or any other issue relating to Restart Scheme policy, you should direct them to contact the Jobcentre Plus team dealing with their case to try to resolve the issue.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> An employer makes a complaint about you regarding the Restart Scheme</h3>

<p>During the life of the contract an employer, with whom you have placed or attempted to place a Participant may wish to raise a complaint about you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>on receipt of the complaint, you should follow your procedure as normal</li>
  <li>you must deal with the employer’s complaint in the same way as you would any complaint made against you</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> An elected member of a national or international body makes a complaint to you on behalf of your Participant</h3>

<p>There may be occasions when an elected member of a national or international body would write to you on behalf of your Participant, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Member of Parliament (<abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Member of the National Assembly for Wales (<abbr title="Member of the National Assembly for Wales">AM</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>These representatives do have the authority to act on behalf of your Participant, but where you have any doubt about responding to the elected member, you can ask for confirmation that they are acting on behalf of your Participant.</p>

<p>If the elected member came to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on behalf of your Participant with feedback that involved both <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and yourself, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would co-ordinate a joint response by getting a contribution from you.</p>

<h2>Independent Case Examiner Role and Processes</h2>

<p>19.10. The Independent Case Examiner’s (<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>) Office provides an impartial resolution and investigation service for people who are unhappy with the way their complaint has been dealt with.</p>

<p>19.11. <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> have two primary objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to act as an independent adjudicator if your Participant considers that they have not been treated fairly or have not had their complaints dealt with in a satisfactory manner</li>
  <li>to support service improvements by providing constructive comment and meaningful systemic recommendations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who Can Raise a Complaint to <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>?</h3>

<p>19.12. Participants who are unhappy with the way in which their complaint has been dealt with by either <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or their contracted service providers.</p>

<p>19.13. To raise a complaint with <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> the participant must however:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have given you or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> the opportunity to respond and resolve the issue, and</li>
  <li>have received the final response, that explained that they can take their complaint to <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> if they are not satisfied with the response they have received, and</li>
  <li>raise the complaint with <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> within 6 months of receiving the final response from yourself or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: ICE will only accept complaints for investigation if they meet all three of these criteria.</p>
</div>

<h3>What Happens When a Case is Raised with <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>?</h3>

<p>19.14. After they accept a complaint, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will contact you to confirm that each step of your internal process has been completed. If they feel that you have not completed your process satisfactorily you may be asked to revisit some steps to seek resolution before <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> are prepared to investigate further.</p>

<p>19.15. You must deal with any correspondence of any nature from <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> within the stated timescales and not more than 5 working days.</p>

<p>19.16. Once <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> has accepted a case, they will work to resolve the case by taking the following 3 stage approach, attempting to resolve matters at the earliest possible stage. At every stage, you will have the opportunity to give your version of events and offer any supporting evidence.</p>

<h4>Stage 1: resolution</h4>

<p><abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will first look to see if there is scope to resolve the concerns raised without requesting any evidence from you. If a complaint is relatively straightforward, and your Participant has reasonable expectations about what you could do to resolve it, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will liaise between the parties involved and try to reach an agreement which is satisfactory to all. <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will write to your Participant with details of what action you have agreed to take and will monitor the case until that action has been completed. If a complaint is resolved at this stage, then no determination of fault will be made.</p>

<h4>Stage 2: settlement</h4>

<p>If the complaint cannot be resolved, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will request the evidence from you to establish what happened. Following the review of evidence, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will propose a way forward. If you agree the actions that <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> propose, and your Participant is satisfied that they address their complaint, the case will be closed. Again, no determination of fault will be made.</p>

<h4>Stage 3: investigation report</h4>

<p>If following a review of the evidence the case cannot be ‘settled’, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will prepare and issue a report. The report will set out its findings in respect of each element of the complaint detailing findings and any recommendations for redress (including potential financial redress). Examples of previous cases can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/independent-case-examiner">Independent Case Examiner website</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will send you a draft, allowing you the opportunity to check factual accuracy and comment on proposed findings and recommendations. You will be expected to provide any comments on the draft within stated timescales (or not more than 5 working days). Your comments will be considered (though not necessarily accepted) by <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> before the report is finalised.</p>

<p>If a complaint is upheld against you at the investigation stage, £5,000 contribution to costs will be recovered from you, to go towards funding the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> service for provider complaints in the following year. There will be a periodic review of the fee level between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Providers. You will also be liable to pay any financial redress deemed by <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> to be due your customer. <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will apply the following <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy when considering if any redress is due to your customer, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-for-poor-service-a-guide-for-dwp-staff">Compensation for poor service: a guide for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff</a>.</p>

<p>Any systemic improvements identified as a result of the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> investigation, for example, the need for clearer wording in a standard letter or leaflet, will be raised with you after the investigation has been concluded.</p>

<p>19.17. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will gather Management Information from the complaints that <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> receives. This information will inform contract performance management.</p>

<h2>The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (<abbr title="The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman">PHSO</abbr>)</h2>

<p>19.18. Participants have no right of appeal against <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>’s decision. However, if your Participant is unhappy with the outcome of the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> investigation, they can ask their <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr> to take their case to the <abbr title="The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman">PHSO</abbr>. If the <abbr title="The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman">PHSO</abbr> accepts their case, they may recommend different or additional financial redress for your Participant, which you would also be liable to pay. For more information, please visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman">PHSO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex 1: Standard Wording for Your Final Response to Your Participant</h2>

<h3>Independent Case Examiner</h3>

<p>If you are not happy with this response, you can ask the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> to consider your complaint. You should contact them within 6 months from the date of this letter. The <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> service is provided by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (which includes Jobcentre Plus) and offers a free, impartial resolution service but does not consider matters of law or government policy.</p>

<p>You can contact the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ice@dwp.gov.uk">ice@dwp.gov.uk</a>, which is their preferred contact</li>
  <li>by telephone on 0800 414 8529 or</li>
  <li>in writing at PO Box 209, Bootle L20 7WA</li>
</ul>

<p>Website: Independent Case Examiner</p>

<h3>Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman</h3>

<p>You can also, at any time contact your <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr> who may be able to send your complaint to the <abbr title="The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman">PHSO</abbr>. The Ombudsman normally (but not always) expects you to have exhausted both the provider complaints process and the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> services before accepting a complaint for investigation.</p>

<p>The Ombudsman investigates complaints that government organisations have not acted properly or fairly or have provided a poor service. To find out more, please contact:</p>
