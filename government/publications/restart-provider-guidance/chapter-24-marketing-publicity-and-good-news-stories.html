</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>24.01. As part of the Restart Scheme offer you are required to supply marketing materials to ensure that the Jobcentre Plus work coach and Potential Participants are clearly informed about your support offer. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a guide to producing marketing materials and communications that promote the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>24.02. For the purpose of this chapter, ‘marketing materials’ are any form of branded material used by yourselves to promote the Restart Scheme. This includes printed materials such as: banners, information posters, flyers, brochures, leaflets and presentations. Marketing material can easily be adapted into digital forms and may include items such as social media posts, e-newsletters, blogs etc.</p>

<h2>Planning your marketing and communications activity</h2>

<p>24.03. As a contracted Provider of Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) we would encourage you to share your own planned marketing activity with Jobcentre Plus locally. This will ensure that both <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Providers are able to maximise the value of their communications.</p>

<p>24.04. As you are best placed to know the demographics of your local area, it is up to you to decide the best way to promote and describe your services in relation to the Restart Scheme. This includes deciding what types of products, activities and channels you want to use to market or communicate your services.</p>

<p>24.05. All the marketing products you produce must adhere to the standards, as written in your contract. These standards are in place in order to protect the integrity of the Restart Scheme and the reputation of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>; they apply to all information sharing, press activity and marketing products or activities that you undertake.</p>

<p>24.06. When promoting the Restart Scheme you can use your own branding on marketing materials, however ‘Restart Scheme´ (not shortened and used in full) should appear prominently within all public facing materials. The following sets out acceptable Restart Scheme naming conventions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ‘Restart Scheme’ name cannot be used merely as a page footer; it must be prominent.</li>
  <li>the ‘Restart’ Scheme name can appear along-side Provider branding within a logo, but it must be prominent.</li>
  <li>‘Restart Scheme’ must be written in full; and the correct <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> logo as set out in the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Communications Centre use</li>
</ul>

<p>Any material you produce specifically for marketing the Restart Scheme must include the Restart Scheme logo and clearly show that it is a government programme.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations</h2>

<p>24.07. Some key issues you must consider for the content of your marketing, communications and press activity are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reputational risk – materials you produce must not adversely affect the reputation of the service being provided by the government, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or Jobcentre Plus, for example risks that could lead to adverse media attention, or messages that could be misunderstood or misinterpreted</li>
  <li>Disability Equality Duty/Equality Act 2010 – you must ensure that all Participants can access your information by providing a variety of alternative formats ensuring that people can still access your information when their chosen alternative format is not available</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about delivering inclusive communications is available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-communication">Office for Disability Issues</a></p>

<h2>Communication Standards</h2>

<p>24.08. Information on how to apply the Restart Scheme and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> logos can be found in the Communication Standards for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Providers. Please visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://communicationcentre.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Communication Centre</a> to view the Brand Guidelines.</p>

<p>24.09. In producing your marketing material, you must be aware that there are propriety conventions that you will have to follow. Adhering to these conventions ensures that the Government Department, Ministers, Civil Servants and those delivering on their behalf act properly and are seen to be acting properly.</p>

<p>24.10. These basic conventions require that communications activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>should be relevant to the service you are providing</li>
  <li>should be factual, clear, objective and explanatory</li>
  <li>should not be, or be liable to misrepresentation as being, party political</li>
  <li>should be conducted in an economic and appropriate way, having regard to the need to be able to justify the costs as expenditure of public funds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Good News Stories</h2>

<p>24.11. As Participants begin to achieve positive outcomes from the support provided, and for some this may include securing employment, Providers may wish to utilise marketing materials to communicate the success of the Restart Scheme. While it is up to Providers to decide the types of products and channels you will use to do this, you may wish to consider the use of ‘good news stories’ to promote both your support offer and successes to date. You may also wish to consider sharing your ‘good news stories’ with your SPOCs and local contacts.</p>

<p>24.12. Providers are encouraged to submit their ‘good news stories’ to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> via the Restart Scheme Live Running Team using the email inbox found on the ‘Good News Story Template’ where they may be shared with key internal stakeholders. This should be done in conjunction with the additional guidance that can be found in Annex 1, ensuring that the relevant consent has been given. The ‘Good News Story Template’ can be found in Restart All Suppliers file share directory, within the Provider Guidance folder in Jaggaer.</p>

<h2>Marketing Materials Review and Approval Process</h2>

<p>24.13. Materials to be shared with Jobcentre Plus to be held on their <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> systems must be pre-approved by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and are subject to a Formal Review process where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will approve or give details of required or suggested amendments.</p>

<p>24.14. You are responsible for all other marketing material that describe the Restart Scheme and your offer, and is aimed at raising awareness for an internal or external audience (participants, work coaches, employers, local partners etc.). You are encouraged to submit these materials for an Informal Review; <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will offer comments on the accuracy of material, and correct use of Restart Scheme branding, however this does not constitute formal approval and the responsibility for the material remains with the Provider.
Submitting material for review</p>

<p>24.15. You should submit any marketing materials in connection with the Restart Scheme to the Restart Scheme Live Running Team via the dedicated email inbox listed on the marketing material request template along with a completed template; this document can be found in Restart All Suppliers file share directory, within the provider guidance folder in Jaggaer.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Important Note: Providers should submit a separate email and template for each item of material that is to be considered.</p>
</div>

<p>24.16. When submitting material for review, you should ensure it is clearly stated on the marketing material request template the purpose of the material and who the intended audience is.</p>

<p>24.17. Not all material using Restart Scheme branding is subject to review. Marketing material viewed as a ‘template’ does not need to be reviewed each time it is subsequently used. Provider’s own working documents not intended as marketing material are also not subject to review. In these instances, it remains the responsibility of the Provider to ensure the accuracy of material and correct use of Restart Scheme branding. If, however, you are unsure if a specific item should be reviewed or not, please contact the Restart Live Running Team via the dedicated email inbox listed on the marketing material request template, who will be able to clarify this for you.</p>

<p>24.18. While the Restart Live Running Policy Team will endeavour to return any marketing materials sent for review to you within 5 working days, please be aware that is not always possible.</p>

<h2>Social Media</h2>

<p>24.19. All social media should be in line with conventions, purpose and key considerations outlined in this chapter. Provider staff should also not engage in negative conversations as a result of social media messages that directly link back to the Restart Scheme. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-one">Annex 1 for further guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>National media handling</h2>

<p>24.20. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has a national press office that is responsible for dealing with the national media (newspapers, news agencies, internet news, television, radio and specialist publications and magazines), providing media advice to Ministers and co-ordinating all visits with media involvement across the department.</p>

<p>24.21. You may be required to liaise with national press office on major announcements.</p>

<p>You are expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>alert your Jobcentre Plus or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contact to all negative stories and provide sufficient information for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to prepare and provide a statement to be used in response to media enquiries</li>
  <li>inform your Jobcentre Plus or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contact of media activity being planned around <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision</li>
</ul>

<p>24.22. Ministers may want to be involved in publicity from time to time. You should in particular, share plans around significant milestones (for example 100th person helped into work) and participant case studies and liaise with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> national press office.
##Providers delivering more than one <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision</p>

<p>24.23. If you deliver additional services for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> other than the Restart Scheme it is your responsibility to ensure that any material you produce, covering the range of provisions you deliver, complies with the standards and guidelines for all the provisions covered.</p>

<h2>Use of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Data</h2>

<p>24.24. Official <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> and performance data are owned by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Providers should not use any such information that has not been published and is not yet in the public domain in their marketing and publicity material. If in any doubt, please contact the Restart Live Running Policy Team.</p>

<h2>Annex 1: Social Media Guidance</h2>

<p>As Providers you are working on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to deliver the Restart Scheme, it is therefore important that you are aware of your responsibilities when using social media and the risks and repercussions of inappropriate use. All the marketing products you produce including posting and publishing content on social media must adhere to the standards, as written in your contract. These standards are in place to protect the integrity of the Restart Scheme and the reputation of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should be aware that you are responsible for all content that you as Providers post on social media. This should be in line with the conventions, purpose and key considerations outlined in Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 24 - Marketing, Publicity and Good News stories.</p>

<h3>What is Social Media?</h3>

<p>Social media refers to all web-based tools which allow users to generate content and interact with each other online. For the purpose of this guidance the term “social media”, relates to all online platforms involving user generated content, not just the more recognised sites e.g. Facebook, Twitter etc. Social media content can include written comments, photos, unauthorised video, music and/ or call recordings.</p>

<h3>Social media platforms can be grouped as follows</h3>

<p>Social networks – like Facebook and LinkedIn allow you to connect via profiles &amp; groups with other people of similar interests and share content and media.</p>

<p>Microblogs – like Twitter allow you to provide short updates, with or without media, follow users that you are interested in and build up a network of followers.</p>

<p>Media sharing – allows you to upload, share and comment on various media such as pictures and video. Examples: Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.</p>

<p>Blogs and Forums – allow online conversations by posting messages and comments in response to short articles. Examples: WordPress and Tumblr.</p>

<h3>Key Considerations for Providers</h3>

<p>The principles outlined within this guidance should also be applied to Restart Scheme Provider material that is published on other digital channels such as websites.</p>

<p>It is important to be aware that everything posted online can exist forever. As Providers you are personally responsible for what you publish. Once something is posted online, it can be very difficult to delete, or control how widely the material is then shared. Providers should consider this before posting to social media platforms.</p>

<h3>Branding</h3>

<p>All content posted by Providers about or relating to the Restart Scheme should include as part of the post, the correct <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Restart Scheme branding and logos.</p>

<h3>Professionalism</h3>

<p>When posting or publishing content on social media it is important that Providers consider both the message to be communicated and the intended audience. As Providers are delivering the Restart Scheme on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> it is important that a professional tone is maintained and that posts are both respectful and courteous. Any materials produced by Providers to be posted on social media platforms must not adversely affect the reputation of the service being provided by the government, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or Jobcentre Plus, for example risks that could lead to adverse media attention, or messages that could be misunderstood or misinterpreted. Provider staff should not engage in negative conversations as a result of social media messages that directly link back to the Restart Scheme.</p>

<h3>Accuracy</h3>

<p>Before posting or publishing content on social media it is important that Providers ensure that any information to be posted is accurate and factually correct. Providers should check accuracy before sharing content and if in any doubt, should not post. Official <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> and performance data that is owned by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> that has not been published, and is not yet in the public domain, should not be used as part of social media posts and activity.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding and Consent</h3>

<p>Providers should be aware that they should not publish photographs or videos of employees, Participants or other parties without their full awareness of how it will be used and their formal consent. Providers have a duty of care for their employees and Participants and should not publish content that could compromise the safety or security of employees, Participants or other parties.</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>In creating social media content Providers must consider the Disability Equality Duty/Equality Act 2010 – and ensure that like other content, social media posts can be accessed and understood by the widest possible audience – regardless of whether people have a visual, hearing, speech, motor, cognitive or other combination of impairments.</p>

<h3>Reproducing Content</h3>

<p>Providers should ensure that that they have the formal permission from the copyright holder before reproducing any images, photographs, music, or videos as part of a social media post. 
Providers should also be aware that it is their responsibility to check the terms and conditions of any social media platform they are going to use. Different social media platforms may use uploaded material in different ways.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If Providers are in any doubt about posting content to a social media platform or website, please contact the Restart Live Running Policy Team.</p>

<h2>Annex 2:  Additional Information – Good News Stories</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please read the following guidance carefully before submitting a ‘good news story’.</p>
</div>

<p>Good news stories help to tell positive and engaging stories with a human perspective.</p>

<p>The key to an effective ‘good news story’ is accuracy of information and official consent from the person(s) involved. This guide also explains the steps that need to be taken to manage that information.</p>

<h3>Informed consent</h3>

<p>In addition to capturing information on the ‘good news story’ template, you will need the consent from the person(s) involved in the story, and their photograph, if this is to be used.</p>

<p>Please ensure that the consent part of the ‘good news story’ template is correctly completed. This provides the comprehensive consent required for all purposes for which the story may be used, including the media. A copy of the ‘good news story’ template with the completed consent should be retained for your own records.</p>

<p>It is important to be open and honest with the subject(s) of the story and the following should be explained to them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Their story will help to show how <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the Restart Scheme helps people</li>
  <li>Someone other than yourself may contact them at a later date, to discuss the story in order to use it</li>
  <li>Nothing further may happen with regard to the ‘good news story’ that they are the subject(s) of</li>
  <li>The subject(s) will have the opportunity to see any written story involving them prior to publication. This will include agreement in terms of how they will be identified</li>
  <li>If a ‘good news story’ which they are the subject(s) of is published, other journalists may wish to contact them to find out more about their story</li>
  <li>‘Good news stories’ may be used for up to a year, but some may be archived on websites and seen for longer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expanding the story</h3>

<p>When writing a ‘good news story’ encourage the person(s) who it is about to tell the story in their own words and where possible avoid prompting or ‘putting words in their mouth’. 
When writing up the story, always use the third person for setting the scene and aim for a good mix of third and first person reportage, based on your discussions.</p>

<h3>Identification</h3>

<p>When creating a ‘good news story’ it is important to be sensitive to the situation of the person(s) you are writing about and aware of the risks arising from personal identification of the person(s) involved. These risks include, but is not limited to, identifying people who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have experienced domestic violence</li>
  <li>been recently bereaved</li>
  <li>have mental health considerations</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also agree with them whether to use their first or full name, location and other identifying details. While it is important to validate the ‘good news story’ /case study as truthful, it must be recognised that in a world of social media <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has a duty of care for those whom are featured in ‘good news stories’/ case studies.</p>

<h3>Good news stories and photos</h3>

<p>You should agree beforehand with the subject(s) of the case study for photos to be taken and consent must be given.</p>

<p>In some instances, if required a ‘stock’ (generic) photo can be used to illustrate the general context of the ‘good news story’ (because the subject was unwilling or unavailable). In this case, the photo used must not be of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one person - they could be mistaken for the person in the ‘good news story’</li>
  <li>a small group - that could imply the real person is among them</li>
  <li>instead, use a mid-distance shot of a generic workplace or jobcentre which avoids a focus on particular individuals</li>
</ul>
