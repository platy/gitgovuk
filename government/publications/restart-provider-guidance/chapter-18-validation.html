<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>18.01. This chapter covers the steps that we will take to ensure that payments and associated fees made to you are justified and that the definitions and conditions for a payment have been met in full.</p>

<h2>Overview of Payment Validation</h2>

<p>18.02. The validation approach to payments will be determined by type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delivery Fee</li>
  <li>Employed job outcome</li>
  <li>Self-employed job outcome</li>
</ul>

<p>18.03. The monthly delivery fee payments in year 1 of the contract are made to you based on achievement of your predicted <abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr> staff in post levels and achievement of agreed Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>). For the remainder of the contract, full payment of monthly delivery fees will continue to be dependent on achievement of <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>.</p>

<p>18.04. Each monthly delivery fee payment will be subjected to pre and/or post-payment validation to verify payments to be made/which have been made are accurate and justified.</p>

<p>18.05. The employed outcome payment process is fully automated. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> validate achievement of the outcome criteria using <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Pay as You Earn (<abbr title="Pay as you Earn">PAYE</abbr>) online earnings data. The determination of outcomes will be solely based on this data and any outcome payments due will be made to you automatically.</p>

<p>18.06. We will carry out manual pre-payment validation checks on all self-employed outcome claims submitted. If volumes make undertaking validation checks on every claim unviable, we may move to either a mix of a pre-payment and post-payment sampling, or a wholly post-payment and extrapolation approach. We may also vary how the checks are carried out.</p>

<p>18.07. All payments made in respect of the Restart Scheme will be made via Provider Referral and Payments (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) directly into your agreed UK bank account. Further information regarding <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> can be found in Provider Referrals and Payments (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) System Guidance for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>18.08. The very last outcome payment will be made to you no later than 667 days after the last start on the Restart Scheme.</p>

<h2>Payment Validation Process</h2>

<h3>Delivery Fee Assurance</h3>

<p>18.09. As referenced in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-17-funding-model-and-claim-process">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17</a> – Funding Model and Claim Process, full payment of your monthly Delivery Fees is subject to you both meeting your forecasted Full-Time Equivalent (<abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr>) staffing levels and achieving Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>). See Delivery Fee Payments in the Contract Specification for Delivery Fee deferral and forfeit implications.</p>

<h3>Customer Service Standards Measures</h3>

<p>18.10. Throughout the life of the contract Performance Managers and Performance Compliance Officers (<abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCOs</abbr>) will monitor your performance against the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>. If your performance falls below the agreed standards your monthly Delivery Fee payment may be deferred or forfeited. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-14-performance-management">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 14</a> – Performance Management contains more information about these measures and associated financial penalties.</p>

<h3>Delivery Fee Standards Measures</h3>

<p>18.11. In Year 1 of the contract, full payment of monthly Delivery Fees is also dependant on you meeting the Delivery Fee Standards measure by achieving the monthly <abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr> staffing levels you detailed in your contract.</p>

<p>18.12. You will be required to submit HR/Payroll information at regular intervals using the Monthly Performance Return (<abbr title="Monthly Performance Return">MPR</abbr>) as set out in Schedule 8.8 of your contract and described in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-14-performance-management">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 14</a> – Performance Management.</p>

<p>18.13. We will carry out pre-payment checks on the information you provide, to confirm the total <abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr> you and your supply chain employ, in management and direct delivery roles, on the Restart Scheme contract meets the forecasted levels detailed in your contract.</p>

<p>18.14. If your reported <abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr> levels are the same as or with 95% of those detailed in your contract the maximum payment (applicable to that month) will be released, subject to <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> also being met.</p>

<p>18.15. If your total <abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr> employed on the Restart Scheme contract is below 95%, of your forecast a proportionate amount of the monthly delivery fee will be forfeited. For example, if your reported <abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr> is 93% of the level detailed in the contract 2% of your delivery fee for that month will be forfeited.</p>

<p>18.16. In addition, we may, at our discretion, carry out post payment checks on a sample-basis or via a full census to assure ourselves that individuals included in your <abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr> return are employed by you and your supply chain partner on the Restart Scheme contract.</p>

<p>18.17. If during either pre or post-payment checking of Delivery Fee Standards your <abbr title="Full Time Equivalent">FTE</abbr> levels are found to be below 75% of the level detailed in your contract this could be treated as a termination event.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Note: Any information shared with DWP by the Provider will be used solely for the purpose of validating Delivery Fee Standards and for no other purpose. Providers may wish to ensure that staff understand that you, as the Data Controller, may have to share your employees’ data with DWP.</p>
</div>

<h3>Employed Job Outcome Validation</h3>

<p>18.18. The employed outcome validation and payment process is fully automated. Participants moving into employed work and meeting the qualifying conditions for an employed outcome payment will be identified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> using <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Pay as you Earn">PAYE</abbr> online earnings data.</p>

<p>18.19. Participant earnings will be monitored and tracked for a maximum period of 547 calendar days from the Participant’s start date on the Restart Scheme. During this time reports will be available on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> iSupplier portal for you to be able to view:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a Participant’s earnings are first declared to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, following a confirmed start on the Restart Scheme (multiple notifications possible with two or more jobs)</li>
  <li>when a Participant has achieved income milestones of £1,000 and £2,000 during their employment</li>
  <li>when <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is notified that the Participant’s employment has ended (multiple end notifications possible with two or more jobs)</li>
  <li>when an automatic outcome payment has been triggered once the earnings threshold is reached (final notification)</li>
</ul>

<p>18.20. You will not have a right to appeal or request reconsideration on decisions made relating to employed outcomes. Only earnings received within the 547-day qualifying period will count towards an outcome</p>

<p>18.21. Once achievement of an outcome has been identified and paid, or 547 days have elapsed from the Participant’s start date on the Restart Scheme, tracking of earnings will cease and the payment line will be automatically closed. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-13-restart-scheme-completers-and-early-exits">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance, Chapter 13</a> – Restart Scheme Completers and Early Exits for more information about completers.</p>

<p>18.22. To ensure system effectiveness, we may undertake tests of the automated payment system to confirm it is delivering the requirements. Should underpayments or overpayments be identified through these checks, or other avenues, remedial action will be undertaken where appropriate.</p>

<h3>Self-Employed Job Outcome Validation</h3>

<p>18.23. When you submit a self-employed outcome claim on the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> system, the payment will automatically be put on hold pending manual validation. An automated check within <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> will also confirm that the claim submission date is within 90 days of Date 2 on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>. Any claims that are outside this period will be flagged up to <abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> via a ‘Claim Limit’ hold and may fail validation.</p>

<p>18.24. The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Provider Payments Validation team (<abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>) will have 30 calendar days from the date your claim was submitted to conclude validation activity and determine whether your outcome claim can be paid.</p>

<p>18.25. To validate each claim submitted, <abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> will use information that is independent of yourself and your supply chain to verify the Participant has been in business on a self-employed basis for a cumulative period which covers 6 individual <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> assessment periods within their 547-calendar day qualifying period. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restart-provider-guidance/chapter-17-funding-model-and-claim-process">Restart Scheme Provider Guidance Chapter 17</a> – Funding Model and Claim Process for qualifying period description).</p>

<p>18.26. During manual validation <abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> will in the first instance review information relating to work and earnings held on the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> system to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within the outcome claim period (between Date 1 and Date 2 input to <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>), the Participant had attended an interview with their Jobcentre Plus work coach to discuss their self-employment status and the Jobcentre Plus work coach has deemed the Participant’s self-employment status as being gainfully self-employed for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes, and</li>
  <li>self-employed earnings have been declared in 6 separate <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> assessment periods, and</li>
  <li>at least one of the assessment periods when earnings have been declared is within the period of the outcome claim (between Date 1 and Date 2 input to <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>), and</li>
  <li>all 6 instances of self-declared self-employment are within the 547-day qualifying period</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>NOTE:  Should the Participant’s earnings exceed their UC entitlement resulting in their claim being closed the validation team will contact the Participant directly to confirm the dates and duration of self-employment.</p>
</div>

<p>18.27. If all four of these conditions are met the outcome claim will pass validation and be released for payment.</p>

<p>18.28. Where the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> system checks described above do not result in the claim passing validation, <abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> will go on to examine wider evidence, which could include, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Verify Self-Employment ‘to do’ responses</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Claimant Commitment Statements regarding self-employment</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Journal Notes regarding self-employment</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Self-reported earnings to confirm duration</li>
  <li>Confirmation direct with the Participant themselves</li>
  <li>Consideration of the Participants <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Conditionality Regime throughout the claim period (Light Touch / Working Enough etc.)</li>
  <li>Any additional supporting evidence from the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> system or direct from the Participant that can confirm their employment status</li>
</ul>

<p>18.29. See Annex 1 for further supporting information to help you determine self-employment. This list is not definitive.</p>

<p>18.30. <abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>’s ability to contact Participants is reliant on you recording in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> accurate and up to date contact information, including details of any special contact arrangements required. If <abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> have trouble contacting a Participant, they will email you for further information. You will have 5 working days to reply with further details or risk the claim failing validation.</p>

<p>18.31. On completion of manual validation checks there are 3 possible self-employed outcome validation results:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please Note: UC Assessment Periods Definition: Universal Credit Assessment Periods (AP) run for a complete calendar month and start on the same date every month, starting from the date that the Participant made their claim.</p>

<p>For example, for a new claim made on 6th September, the first assessment period runs from 6th September to 5th October, with a new assessment period starting on 6th October.</p>

<p>The UC AP can vary between January &amp; March if the AP starts on either 30th or 31st of the month (due to only 28/29 days in Feb). E.g. if the AP starts on 30th, the periods may be: 30/1 to 28/2; 1/3 to 29/3.</p>
</div>

<h3>Self-Employed End of Cohort Unable to Validate (<abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr>) Apportionment</h3>

<p>18.32. Self-employed outcome claims that are still categorised as <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> at the end of the additional 60-day checking period will be added to the cohort population for apportionment and reconciliation calculations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A cohort population is made up of all outcome claims submitted in a single calendar month</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The apportionment activity is carried out when the 547-day qualifying period for each Participant within the cohort population has been reached (this is the cohort period)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>18.33. We will establish a fail rate for each cohort which will be applied to any remaining UTVs once the cohort period has ended. The process and calculations used to establish the fail rate and determine the <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> apportionment value are shown in the example below.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>1) 1000 self-employed outcome claims have been submitted in a month/cohort. After 30-day validation period the results are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>865 passes</li>
  <li>105 UTVs</li>
  <li>30 fails</li>
</ul>

<p>This results in an error rate following pre-payment validation of 3 % ((number of fails (30) / cohort population (1000)) * 100 = 3% (rounded))</p>

<p>2) Checks continue on the 105 UTVs for a further 60 days and <abbr title="real time earnings information">RTI</abbr> interest remains open for 547 days in an attempt to capture further Passes or Fails.</p>

<p>3) After the cohort period has ended there are 95 <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> cases remaining. 5 claims have passed validation and 5 have failed, making the new cohort outcome totals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>870 passes</li>
  <li>95 UTVs</li>
  <li>35 fails</li>
</ul>

<p>4) The error rate is recalculated resulting a revised rate of 4% (rounded). ((number of fails (35) / (cohort population) 1000)) *100 = 3.5% = 4% (rounded)</p>

<p>5) The final cohort error rate of 4% is applied to remaining 95 cases. Therefore 4% of the value of the 95 <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> claims are apportioned as fails the value of which is recovered from the provider. The value of the recovery may include adjustments in respect of the accelerator model.</p>

<p>18.34. The apportionment results will be shared with you and a financial recovery total will be made as and when required.</p>

<h2>Self-Employment Post-Payment Validation Regime</h2>

<p>18.35. We intend to use a pre-payment validation approach for Restart Scheme self-employed outcome claims. If, however, the volume of self-employed outcome claims makes this process unviable, we will review arrangements and may decide to move to either a mix of pre and post payment validation, or a wholly post-payment validation regime. In this event, you would be given prior notification of when the change would happen, and guidance would be updated to reflect the new processes.</p>

<p>18.37. In addition to the validation principles set out above, we may also conduct management checks to further verify the validity and robustness of self-employed outcomes claimed or paid.</p>

<p>18.38. These checks will support the exploration of controls around self-employed outcome payments. Although these management checks will not form part of the standard validation process, they will aid <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in identifying potential patterns or fraudulent activities.</p>

<p>18.39. Where we identify a substantial number of self-employed claim errors such as high volumes of Participant contact details being incorrect, insufficient information provided leading to high <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> outcomes or self-employed start/end dates are unaligned, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may review your internal assurance processes.</p>

<h2>Annex 1: Additional Supporting Information</h2>

<p>A Participant is considered to be in gainful self-employment where all of the following apply:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>the Participant is carrying on a <a class="govuk-link" href="#tra-de">trade, profession or vocation</a> as their <a class="govuk-link" href="#ma-in">main employment</a>, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their earnings from that trade, profession or vocation are <a class="govuk-link" href="#se-lf">self-employed earnings</a>, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the trade, profession or vocation is <a class="govuk-link" href="#or-gan">organised, developed, regular and carried out in expectation of profit</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If any of these conditions are not satisfied, the Participant is not considered gainfully self-employed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Is the Participant carrying out a trade, profession or vocation where they are not employed by someone else?</h3>

<p>The following illustrate what is meant by, carrying out a trade, profession or vocation.</p>

<h3>Trade</h3>

<p>For example, a self-employed plasterer or market stallholder. A Participant is likely to be trading if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sell regularly to make a profit</li>
  <li>make items to sell for profit</li>
  <li>sell online, at car boot sales or through classified adverts on a regular basis</li>
  <li>earn commission from selling goods for other people</li>
  <li>are paid for a service they provide</li>
</ul>

<p>A Participant is probably not trading if they sell some unwanted items occasionally or they don’t plan to make a profit.</p>

<h3>Profession</h3>

<p>For example, a self-employed accountant or consultant.</p>

<h3>Vocation</h3>

<p>For example, a self-employed musician or actor.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Deciding if earnings are self-employed earnings</h3>

<p>To assess if a Participant’s earnings are self-employed earnings for the purposes of Universal Credit and the outcome definition, there are a number of important indicators that should be considered. The following table lists some of these indicators.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Indicators that a Participant’s earnings are from self-employment</th>
      <th scope="col">Additional information</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Pay their own tax and National Insurance.</td>
      <td>Where tax is deducted at source, this may suggest that the employment is not self-employment, however, special arrangements can apply for building sub-contractors.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Are registered as self-employed with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) for self-assessment and Class 2 National Insurance contributions and have a unique tax reference number.</td>
      <td>A unique tax reference number is issued by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> when a person registers for self-assessment and may be an indicator of self-employment.<br>However, having a unique tax reference number is not sufficient in itself to demonstrate whether a person is self-employed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Can fix the price and/or duration of their work and have control over their costs.</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Have the power to appoint or dismiss and can employ a substitute, for example to cover holidays or sickness</td>
      <td>A power to appoint a substitute may suggest self-employment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Length of work contracts.</td>
      <td>Short contracts may suggest self-employment. Longer contracts with the same company may suggest employment or possibly sub-contracting.</td>

      <td>Provide their own equipment.</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Work from home, a workshop, or an office they own or rent.</td>
      <td>Working from home is also increasingly common for some employees.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The person who engages the claimant for work has no obligation to provide further work.</td>
      <td>If there is an ongoing obligation, then this may point towards employment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Can decide the hours they work.</td>
      <td>The greater the discretion the claimant has, the more likely it is that the work is self-employment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Can choose which work they accept and/or work for a range of different employers.</td>
      <td>The more choice / discretion a claimant has, the more likely it is that the work is self-employment.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>No single indicator is likely to be conclusive. Instead, these indicators should be used together to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>build a general picture of the claimant’s work</li>
  <li>give an idea of how the Participant, their employer (in the case of sub-contractors) and <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> view their employment</li>
  <li>help reach a decision on whether their earnings should be classed as employed or self-employed</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Deciding if the self-employed activity is the main employment</h3>

<p>As part of the gainful self-employment test, a decision is needed on whether the Participant’s self-employment is their main employment. This is important, especially for Participants who are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>undertaking self-employed activities but for only a few hours or on a low paid basis</li>
  <li>both self-employed and also working as an employed earner</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are indicators that the self-employed activity is likely to be a Participant’s main employment if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spend more than half of their available work hours on self-employment</li>
  <li>spend more time on, or earns more from, their self-employment than other activities, for example they work more hours in self-employment than as an employed earner</li>
  <li>are starting a new business and business-related activities take up most of their expected number of hours per week</li>
  <li>consider their self-employment as their main job goal</li>
  <li>have significant self-employed earnings, even where self-employed hours are low</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a complete list.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Deciding if the self-employment is organised, developed, regular and carried out in expectation of profit</h3>

<p>The following are possible indicators that the self-employment is organised, developed, regular or carried out in expectation of profit and must be taken in to account when making a decision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the activity is undertaken for financial gain, the claimant does not need to have made a profit yet for the activity to be considered in expectation of profit</li>
  <li>the number of hours spent each week working and the regularity of the work</li>
  <li>any business plan or steps taken to increase income from the activity</li>
  <li>how Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) regard the activity</li>
  <li>how much work is in the pipeline</li>
  <li>whether the claimant is actively marketing or advertising for work</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a complete list.</p>

<h3>Sub-contractors</h3>

<p>People who are contractors or sub-contractors may be treated as self-employed for Restart Scheme self-employed outcome purposes.</p>

<p>To help determine whether a contractor or sub-contractor is self-employed or employed consider the Participant’s activities against <a class="govuk-link" href="#se-lf">the self-employment indicators</a> and the information below.</p>

<p>A contractor who has a contract to provide goods or services to a client may sub-contract some of the work to other people known as sub-contractors.</p>

<p>A sub-contractor is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not an employee of the contractor</li>
  <li>a self-employed person who enters into a contract with another contractor to do a particular job or provide a service as part of a larger project</li>
  <li>normally paid a fixed fee for the job or services they provide</li>
  <li>has control over how they do the work</li>
  <li>often found in the construction industry</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, a building sub-contractor will have a proportion of their earnings deducted at source to pay tax under Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) Construction Industry Scheme (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>) arrangements. This will either be 20% or 30%. It will only be 30% in a small proportion of cases where the sub-contractor does not provide a unique tax reference number.</p>

<p>Despite tax being deducted at source, the sub-contractor could still be considered as self-employed and will not be subject to the pay as you earn system. A sub-contractor will not have National Insurance deducted at source.</p>

<p>Consideration must also be given to whether the <a class="govuk-link" href="#ma-in">self-employment activity is the claimant’s main employment</a> in the same way as for other claimants, for example where a sub-contractor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>alternates between spells of self-employment with work as an employee</li>
  <li>tops up their self-employed earnings with employed earnings, depending on the work or terms of work available to them</li>
</ul>

<h3>Companies and directors</h3>

<p>Participants trading through a company are treated in the same way as someone who has chosen not to organise their self-employment in this way. Therefore, it does not matter if a claimant chooses to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register their business as a company</li>
  <li>make themselves a director</li>
  <li>pay themselves as an employee of the company, through shares and dividends, or by other means</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the claimant has structured their business as detailed above or have declared they are a company director, to be treated as self-employed you must determine whether they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are in a similar position to a sole owner or partner in a company which is carrying on a trade</li>
  <li>have few shareholders, significant influence over the company and a significant say on the day to day running of the business</li>
  <li>are gainfully self-employed or not</li>
</ul>
