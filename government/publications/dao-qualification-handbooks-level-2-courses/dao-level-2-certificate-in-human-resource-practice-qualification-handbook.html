<h2>Centre Requirements</h2>

<h3>Centres offering this qualification must have approval from the DAO</h3>

<p>The assessment centre must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that there are sufficient people trained or qualified to assess the number of learners they anticipate registering and qualifying</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide quality assured training for those people identified as being responsible for the assessment of learners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have quality assurance systems and Internal Quality Assurers in place to ensure that all assessments are Valid, Authentic, Current, Sufficient and Reliable (VACSR)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide quality assured assessment that meets the requirements of the DAO for those people identified as being responsible for internal quality assurance (IQA)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that there is a system of standardisation in place to ensure that all assessments are consistent and fair</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that those undertaking the roles of quality assurance and assessment maintain their skills, knowledge, and occupational competence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>comply with the requirements of the DAO and the qualifications regulators</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>centres offering this qualification must provide IQA to ensure assessment meets all the DAO requirements and is standardised across individual assessors, assessment locations and learners</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ensure as far as reasonably practicable that access to this qualification is open to all learners irrespective of age, gender, religion, creed, or special needs.  The Centre Head must ensure that no learners are subjected to any unfair discrimination in relation to access or fairness to assessment.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<h3>Assessors</h3>

<p>All assessors must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be occupationally competent. This means that each assessor must, according to current sector practice, be competent in the functions covered by the units they are assessing.  They will have gained their occupational competence working within the Defence sector or within an appropriate occupational sector.  They are not required to occupy a position in the organisation more senior than that of the Learner they are assessing.  However, Centres must be alert to the risks that all such arrangements could present and ensure that sufficient quality controls are in place through the IQA process to minimise the possibility of collusion between learners and assessors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be able to demonstrate a consistent application of the skills and the current supporting knowledge and understanding in the context of a recent role directly related to the qualification units they are assessing, as a practitioner, trainer, or manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be familiar with the qualification units; and must be able to interpret and make judgements on current working practices and technologies within the area of work/assessment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintain their occupational competence by actively engaging in continuous professional development activities to keep up to date with developments relating to the changes taking place in the Defence sector and occupational sector of the assessment.  These activities may include those offered by the DAO or other relevant providers in the sector.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assessors must be appropriately qualified or be able to prove equivalent competence as specified in the relevant Sector Skills Standard Assessment Strategy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approved Centres will be required to provide the DAO with current evidence of how each assessor meets these requirements, for example, certificates of achievement, testimonials, references, or any other relevant records.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Internal Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>All internal quality assurers must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be occupationally knowledgeable, competent, and where necessary qualified; across the range of units for which they are responsible, prior to commencing the role.  Due to the risk-critical nature of the work and the legal implications of the assessment process, they must understand the nature and context of the Assessors’ work and that of their Learners.  This means that they must have worked closely with staff that carry out the functions covered by the qualifications, possibly by training or supervising them, and have sufficient knowledge of these functions to be able to offer credible advice on the interpretation of the units.  Those conducting IQA must also sample the assessment process and resolve differences and conflicts on assessment decisions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understand the content, structure, and assessment requirements for the qualification they are quality assuring.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintain their occupational competence by actively engaging in continuous professional development activities to keep up to date with developments relating to the changes taking place in the Defence sector and occupational sector.  These activities may include those offered by the DAO or other relevant providers in the sector.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be appropriately qualified or be able to prove equivalent competence as specified in the relevant Sector Skills Standard Assessment Strategy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Occupy a position in the organisation that gives them the authority and resources to co-ordinate the work of assessors, provide authoritative advice, call meetings as appropriate, visit and observe assessment practice, and carry out all the other important roles of IQA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have an appropriate induction to the qualifications that they are quality assuring, provided to them by the Centre, and have access to ongoing training and updates on current issues relevant to these qualifications.  Information on the induction and continuing professional development of carrying out IQA must be made available to the DAO through its External Quality Assurance (EQA) process.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Workplace Assessment</h3>

<p>The DAO believes that direct observation by a competent assessor (as outlined above) or testimony from an Expert Witness is always preferable.</p>

<p>Expert Witness testimony has parity with assessor observation unless otherwise stated in unit evidence requirements.  The assessor is responsible for making the final judgement in terms of the Learner meeting the evidence requirements for the unit.</p>

<p>The DAO recognise that there are alternative evidence sources which may be used where direct observation is not possible or practical, eg, work products, records, reflective accounts, professional discussion and so on.</p>

<p>To ensure that the evidence used to assess Learners is valid, all Centres must demonstrate that Learners have access to the types of resources commonly in use in the sector and that the pressures and constraints of the workplace are reflected.</p>

<p>It is accepted that the assessment of some knowledge and understanding may take place in a different environment, for example in a training and development centre or another environment, which is not the immediate workplace.  However, the assessment of this knowledge and understanding should be linked directly to workplace performance and should include performance evidence.</p>

<h3>The Expert Witnesses</h3>

<p>When using Expert Witnesses as a source of evidence, Expert Witnesses must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be occupationally competent.  This means that each Expert Witness must, according to current sector practice, be competent in the functions covered by the units to which they are contributing.  They will have gained their occupational competence working within the Defence sector or within an appropriate occupational sector.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be able to demonstrate consistent application of the skills and the current supporting knowledge and understanding in the context of a recent role directly related to the qualification unit that they are witnessing as a practitioner, trainer, or manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be familiar with the qualification unit; and must be able to interpret current working practices and technologies within the area of work/assessment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Use of languages</h3>

<p>The DAO conducts its business activities in English and the qualification handbook for these qualifications is provided in English.</p>

<h3>Simulations</h3>

<p>Assessment in a simulated environment should only be used in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>where evidence in the workplace will not be demonstrated within an acceptable time frame</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where the nature of the work activity presents high risk or danger to the Learner and others, for example, personal safety</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>simulations must be agreed between the DAO and the Centre contact from the Assessment Centre prior to use.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All simulations should follow these basic principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A Centre’s overall strategy for simulation must be agreed and approved by the DAO.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of the contingency and the physical environment for the simulation must be realistic and Learners should be given no indication as to exactly what contingencies they may come across.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where simulations are used, they must reflect the requirements of the qualification units.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The location and environment of a simulation must be agreed between the DAO and the Centre contact prior to it taking place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All simulations must be planned, developed, and documented by the Centre in a way that ensures the simulation correctly reflects what the specific qualification unit seeks to assess, and all simulations should follow these documented plans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a range of simulations to cover the same aspect of a unit so that the risk of Learners successfully colluding is reduced.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>DAO Approved Assessment Methods</h3>

<p>The following methods of assessment can be used when assessing the units shown in
Section 5 of this handbook:</p>

<ul>
  <li>examination</li>
  <li>project</li>
  <li>written assignment/narrative</li>
  <li>practical assessment</li>
  <li>observation – single event (for example, presentation)</li>
  <li>observation – continual (for example, complying with health and safety requirements)</li>
  <li>Viva Voce</li>
  <li>recorded professional discussion</li>
  <li>blended assessments</li>
  <li>holistic assessment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny</h3>

<p>The Regulator requires AOs to implement a risk-based approach to determine the most effective controls for ensuring the standards of centre assessment judgements for their qualifications. This will ensure that assessments remain fit for purpose and that the criteria against which learners’ performance is differentiated are applied accurately and consistently across different centres.</p>

<p>Basis for a Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny (CASS) Strategy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>risk-based periodic scrutiny of the marking of assessments undertaken by a centre to ensure that it has not deviated from the required standards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consideration of the need for correction of the centre determined mark or attainment and where applicable the action to correct the mark attained</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the action taken in the event of any corrections in centre marking and the steps taken to prevent such deviations from reoccurring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whilst Moderation is required for some listed qualifications, for qualifications not identified within the regulatory list, the awarding organisation may choose to apply Moderation to some or all its qualifications, assessments, or centres</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In determining the most appropriate form of CASS strategy for the qualification there are several factors to be considered.  These might include the throughput of a centre; a centre with a large number of learners or a Roll-on Roll-off approach may be subject to a higher number of visits or other activities, conversely, a low-risk centre is likely to be subject to a lower number of scrutiny activities.</p>

<p>Other factors might also be the experience of the centre staff within the provision of regulated qualifications, the experience of the centre teams administering the regulated qualifications as well as findings from on-going monitoring of the centre within its implementation of the awarding process, as well as the qualifications being supported, and the methods adopted to assess these.  They may change over time as staff change.</p>

<p>In addition to these factors, the DAO will determine the appropriateness of the centre to implement the requirements and periodic interactions will support and monitor all aspects of the provision of qualifications within the centre, including Management Systems, Resources, Learner Support, Assessment and IQA as well as Records of the assessment process.</p>

<p>Within the guidance provided by the Regulator, the term ‘mark’ or ‘marking’ in relation to the formulation of a CASS Strategy includes both numerical marks and other judgements about Learner attainment, such as pass/fail or other graded results.</p>

<p>Whilst the regulator will not prescribe a minimum number of visits that an AO will undertake each year, it will require an AO to ensure that the assessment remains fit for purpose, that it undertakes annual activities in respect of each centre; and, these annual activities should enable the AO to scrutinise marking undertaken by the centre and observe assessments and marking taking place where practicable.</p>

<p>Whilst there is no minimum number of visits identified, the DAO will determine the most effective controls for the qualifications it supports and the centres which deliver them.</p>

<p>As the Regulator is not to prescribe a minimum number of visits to be undertaken each year, it will expect there be face-to-face meetings with centres each year and for some of the activities to be undertaken at short notice and where possible, unannounced.</p>

<p>Periodic Activities in respect to each centre:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consideration of marking undertaken by the Centre since the last such scrutiny</li>
  <li>where appropriate, observation of one or more assessments being undertaken</li>
  <li>where applicable, observation of the marking by a Centre</li>
</ul>

<p>The term ‘Periodic’ replaces typical visit frequency terms, annual, quarterly, and so on.</p>

<h3>Assessment of Vocational Based Qualifications in the RQF</h3>

<p>Where assessment judgements, or ‘marking’, are made by a Centre, it is important that DAO can be sure that the standards being applied are as accurate and consistent as reasonably possible and therefore uphold the 5 statutory objectives which include the need to secure qualifications standards, to promote public confidence in regulated qualifications and to ensure that regulated qualifications are delivered efficiently.</p>

<p>The current range of qualifications provided under the regulatory provision are all Direct Assessment, in that the DAO do not stipulate the manner of which the achievement of the qualification is to be facilitated, though it is recognised that in some cases there are external National and Industry accepted assessment standards, for example the Construction qualifications will fall within the additional Sector Skills Standard Consolidated Assessment Strategy and the First Aid at Work awards will be considered under the Resuscitation Councils’ guidance.  Other qualifications within the AO will be determined locally.</p>

<p>The DAO supports the use of non-bureaucratic assessment methods, ie learners should not be expected to generate portfolios containing substantial amounts of unnecessary work/evidence. However, the assessor needs to view evidence that is VACSR.  Wherever practicable, the emphasis should be on naturally occurring evidence and referring to that evidence in support of their claim for competence. The assessor may wish to support this evidence by using techniques such as a professional discussion recorded electronically or witness testimony from line managers etc.</p>

<h3>External Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>The monitoring and standardisation of assessment decisions will be achieved by robust and strong Centre monitoring and quality assurance according to the DAO requirements. The mechanisms required to achieve these requirements are outlined in Ofqual’s ‘Regulatory arrangements.’  In addition to the Regulator’s requirements, the DAO will evaluate all EQA reports and other data relating to the Centre and any risks relating to quality control will be identified and addressed.</p>

<p>External quality assurers will be appointed by the DAO to approve centres and to monitor the assessment and IQA carried out by centres.  EQA is carried out to ensure that there is validity, reliability, and good practice in centres.  To carry out their quality assurance role, quality assurance staff must have appropriate occupational and verifying knowledge and expertise.  The DAO quality assurance staff will provide training and development designed to keep them up to date with AO requirements, to facilitate standardisation between staff and share good practice.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong> - Generating and collecting evidence of an individual’s/learner’s attainment of knowledge, understanding and skills and judging that evidence against defined standards.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment Criteria (AC)</strong> – The measurable standard which demonstrates that a Learning Outcome has been met.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Outcomes (LO)</strong> - Learning Outcomes are any measurable skills, abilities, knowledge, or values that the student demonstrates because of completing a given course or class. Effective learning outcomes can be articulated at several levels, including lesson, course, program, degree, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Learner</strong> - A learner is any individual who is learning about a particular subject or how to do something.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence</strong> - Assessment of learning occurs when instructors use evidence of student learning to make judgements on student achievement against goals and standards (summative assessment).</p>

<p><strong>Total Qualification Time (TQT)</strong> - The total TQT dictates the size of the qualification.</p>

<p><strong>Guided Learning Hours (GLH)</strong> - A course/qualification is broken into Guided Learning Hours (GLH) and Total Qualification Time (TQT). Examples of GLH are classroom based guided/directed lessons/sessions, workbooks, or online structured study, supervised and structured assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Rule of Combination</strong> - Rules of combination are used to define the structure of qualifications. Rules of combination set out the credit value of the qualification, credits from mandatory units and credits from optional units, credits from equivalent units and exemptions along with time limits on the process of credit accumulation or exemptions.</p>

<p><strong>Moderation</strong> - Moderation is a process separate from the marking of assessments, which ensures that an assessment outcome (eg mark and / or grade) is fair, valid and reliable, that assessment criteria have been applied consistently, and that any differences in academic judgement between individual markers can be acknowledged and addressed.</p>

<p><strong>Inference</strong> – a conclusion reached based on evidence and reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>Infer</strong> – To deduce or conclude (something) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements.</p>

<p><strong>Synoptic</strong> - To study a topic synoptically is to ‘afford a comprehensive mental view’, ie to consider all perspectives and factors contributing to the complexity of reality. Synoptic assessment, therefore, is ‘a form of assessment which tests candidates’ understanding of connections between different elements of a subject’.</p>

<p><strong>Quality</strong> - The standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind; the degree of excellence of something.</p>

<p><strong>Quality Assurance</strong> - Quality assurance must identify and act on performance that requires development and always ensure that that the integrity of any qualification delivery is maintained.</p>
