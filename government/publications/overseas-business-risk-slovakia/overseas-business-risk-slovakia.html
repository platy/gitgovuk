<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Political and economic situation</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Political overview</h3>

<p>Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia became an independent state in 1993, joining the EU in 2004 and Eurozone in 2009. Slovakia is a parliamentary democracy. The government acts as the central body of executive power and the unicameral 150 - member National Council (Parliament), elected by universal adult suffrage for a four-year term, acts as the sole body of legislative power.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister is designated by the Constitution as the Head of the Government. The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the strongest party. The Prime Minister’s executive power is shared with the President who is the Head of State and whose role is largely ceremonial but retains a legislative veto in certain circumstances. The President is directly elected for a five-year term, restricted to two consecutive terms of office.</p>

<p>The current government took office in March 2020 and is a 4-way coalition, originally led by Igor Matovič, now by Prime Minister Eduard Heger of the OĽaNO (Ordinary People and Independent Personalities) movement. His coalition partners are the centre-right Sme Rodina (We are Family) party, economic liberals SaS (Freedom and Solidarity) and the centrist Za ľudí (For the People) party.</p>

<p>Since taking office the government has pursued a consistent pro-western/EU position on foreign policy issues, has made progress in tackling corruption and promoting more transparency in government. However, management of the pandemic has eclipsed most other issues, and has led to a number of high profile disagreements within the coalition, in particular frequent clashes between former PM Matovič (now Finance Minister) and Economy Minister Richard Sulík (SaS) over the handling of the crisis. The coalition crisis escalated in March 2021 and led to a reshuffle. OĽaNO leader and then PM Matovič stepped down and swapped places with his Finance Minister (also OĽaNO) Heger known for his conciliatory character.</p>

<p>Criticism of the previous government snowballed after the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée in February 2018. The largest demonstrations in Slovakia since the Velvet Revolution in 1989 forced then PM Robert Fico and Interior Minister Kaliňák (both from the social-democrat Smer party) to resign. Their party colleague Peter Pellegrini was appointed PM, although Robert Fico remained the chairman of Smer which had been constantly challenging Pellegrini’s independence.</p>

<p>Since losing the 2020 election, Smer has split with Pellegrini forming a new centre-left party Hlas. After initial drop in Smer’s preferences, currently both Smer and Hlas show strong support in recent polls. The other main opposition in parliament is the far-right extremist ĽSNS party, also known as the Kotleba party after its chairman Marian Kotleba, who is currently facing a potential four-year jail term after the Specialised Criminal court has found him guilty of using Nazi symbolism. Kotleba has appealed, the decision of the Supreme Court is expected imminently. Some regions of Slovakia have a sizable Hungarian minority population (c7%), but the ethnic Hungarian parties failed to reach the threshold for parliamentary representation (5%) in the 2020 election, for the first time in history.</p>

<p>In 2019, Slovaks elected their first female President Zuzana Čaputová. A relative newcomer to politics, Čaputová made her name as a lawyer and civic activist. For 10 years she was the face of a campaign against a waste site in the city of Pezinok near capital Bratislava. In 2016 she received the Goldman Environmental Prize for her involvement in the case, which ended in the protestors’ favour. She replaced Andrej Kiska in the office who has formed a new centrist party ‘Za ľudí’ (For the People) but withdrew from politics after last election due to health reasons.</p>

<p>President, who is the also commander-in-chief of the Slovak armed forces, attended the NATO summit in London in 2019 and COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, when she met The Prince of Wales. She has shown particular leadership on judicial reform, fighting corruption and on climate action, prompting a more forward-leaning Slovak position on emissions reductions. She led by example on mask-wearing from the very beginning of the pandemic, and has intervened several times with the Prime Minister to encourage a more considered public communication approach.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Economic overview</h2>

<p>Slovakia has been one of the most stable and prosperous markets in Central and Eastern Europe and remains an attractive market for UK companies. The country is 45th in the World Bank’s Doing Business 2020 rankings and 42nd in the WEF Global Competitiveness Report 2019. Slovakia boasts a strategic geographical location in the centre of Europe, the Euro currency, cost-effective, skilled, loyal labour force with excellent multilingual skills and the highest labour productivity rate in CEE.</p>

<p>Slovakia is experiencing an ongoing economic expansion, driven by continually increasing domestic demand, as well as booming investments, both domestic and foreign. Generally, since 2010 Slovak economy has been growing faster than EU average. After a V-shaped recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, albeit slower than expected due to semiconductor shortages in automotive, the economy grew by 3.1% in 2021, driven by private and public consumption. However, it is still below its pre-pandemic maximum. In the light of the Russian invasion to Ukraine and its consequences (such as further supply chain tensions and limited trade flows), it is expected Slovakia’s economic growth will slow down to 2% in 2022.</p>

<p>Similarly to the rest of Europe, the Slovak inflation rate has been on the rise since 2021, driven by food, fuel, and construction material prices, and higher excise tax on tobacco. In January 2022, the inflation rate jumped due to new regulated energy prices for households and continuing pressure from commodities. The war in Ukraine has put further pressure on commodity prices, especially energy and food, Analysts predict inflation will reach 9.5% in 2022 with deceleration to 5% in 2023.</p>

<p>Moreover, the new situation, linked to higher humanitarian and defence spending, is likely to lead to a fiscal deficit of 6% in 2022, delaying the necessary fiscal consolidation after the pandemic crisis. Finance Minister Igor Matovič announced that accommodation for refugees, provision of healthcare, and material benefits would create additional cost of 1 to 2 billion euros.</p>

<p>The government would like to increase Slovakia’s competitiveness and attract R&amp;D investments through incentives for companies which would bring added value through R&amp;D activities. The pro-business government would also like to improve the business environment through cutting red tape. They have introduced a one-in, two-out principle for government regulations based on UK example. The sustainability and predictability of the business environment and lack of discussion with stakeholders when introducing or amending legislation, however, remain an issue for companies in Slovakia.</p>

<p>Analysts report that the country needs structural reforms, particularly in education, and improving the digital infrastructure and female participation in the labour market to underpin long-term growth. If the money from the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility is used efficiently, it can also stimulate short term demand and boost Slovakia’s growth potential.</p>

<p>As an open, export-oriented economy, Slovakia wants to maintain close trade relations with the UK. The UK is one of Slovakia’s largest export markets, with its third-highest trade surplus. The automotive sector is the bedrock of the economy and contributes almost 50% of Slovakia’s exports to the UK. The UK accounts for every seventh car rolling off the production line. It is expected this number will continue growing, particularly with JLR’s Defender being exported mainly to the UK market.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of UK companies already operating in Slovakia. Tesco and JLR are some of the largest employers in the country. Other major UK investors include G4S, Shell, CP Holdings, Compass Group, DS Smith, Tate and Lyle, GlaxoSmithKline and Allen and Overy.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Business and human rights</h2>

<p>As a member of the European Union, the level of respect for human rights in Slovakia is generally very high. Slovakia has ratified 76 ILO conventions and improving workers’ rights has been also a priority for the current government.</p>

<p>The main issue in relation to workers’ rights is the effective exclusion of large parts of the Roma community from the workforce. However, the government continues with implementing a program to increase the motivation of the long-term unemployed Roma to find jobs.</p>

<p>Employees’ representatives in Slovakia are trade unions, works council and employee trustee (in relation to health and safety also an employee representative for health and safety at work). Unions have a real influence particularly where the employer is a large organisation or if the employer employs a large workforce (particularly industrial firms).</p>

<p>Minimum wage, hours of work, and occupational safety and health standards are appropriate for the main industries and effectively enforced. The law establishes health and safety standards that the Office for Labour Safety generally enforces. Workers can generally remove themselves from situations that endangers health or safety without jeopardy to their employment, and authorities effectively protects employees in this situation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anywhere in the world. In addition, a commercial organization carrying on a business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Bribery and corruption still remain an issue in Slovakia. In 2020, Slovakia was ranked 60 out of 180 countries and is among the five countries with the highest corruption perception in the EU according to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020" rel="external">Transparency International’s corruption perception index</a>. This presents a worsening score since 2019 despite the fight against corruption being identified as a priority for the current government which incorporated the Rule of Law initiative into their manifesto.</p>

<p>The first year of PM Matovic and his government’s fight against corruption can be perceived as successful despite some flaws. A number of corruption-related charges have been pressed against several high ranking officials (including former ministers, senior police officers, prosecutors and judges) as well as other people who have been previously seen as untouchable (including controversial businessmen).</p>

<p>The government has introduced justice system reforms aiming at reducing corruption and unethical conduct. They have also made the selection of staff to key positions more transparent (including the selections of the general and special prosecutors). However, the government has also been criticized for proposals to speed up public procurement through measures that may decrease the transparency of deals made between the government and private contractors.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Terrorism, protective security and organised crime</h2>

<p>Please read the information provided on the FCDO´s Travel Advice page. This includes our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad">terrorism threat page</a> as well as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/slovakia/safety-and-security">advice on safety and security</a>.</p>

<p>There are some elements of organized crime in Slovakia as in many European countries. These often involve people trafficking (forced labor), drug and cigarette smuggling. However, the majority of businesses will be unaffected. Any crime related incidents should be reported to the Slovak authorities for investigation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Cybersecurity</h2>

<p>The National Security Authority (NBU) is the central state administration body responsible for Cyber Security in Slovakia. It holds the status of a national unit of Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). NBU cooperates with other governmental institutions with responsibility for cybersecurity in their own areas of expertise such as the Ministry of Investments, Regional Development and Informatization.</p>

<p>The NBU has established the National Unit Slovak Computer Emergency Response Team (SK-CERT). This team provides strategic activities in the field of cybersecurity management, threat analysis and also tackles security incidents. Incidents can be reported to SK-CERT using an online form accessible in English from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sk-cert.sk/en/tips-and-tricks/report-an-incident/index.html" rel="external">SK-CERT website</a>. SK-CERT also publishes regular security updates and advice on their website, although the Slovak language pages may be more up to date than those in English.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Intellectual property</h2>

<p>Intellectual Property (IP) rights are territorial, that is they only give protection in the countries where they are granted or registered. If you are thinking about trading internationally, then you should consider registering your IP rights in your export markets.</p>

<p>For information on registering your trademark or obtaining a patent in Slovakia, you should contact The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.indprop.gov.sk/?introduction" rel="external">Industrial Property Office of the Slovak Republic</a>. It is a central state administration body operating in the field of industrial property protection.</p>

<p>More information on intellectual property rights in Slovakia is available at the website of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html" rel="external">World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)</a>.</p>
