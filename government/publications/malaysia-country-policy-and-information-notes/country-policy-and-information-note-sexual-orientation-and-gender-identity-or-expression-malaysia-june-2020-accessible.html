<h2>Preface</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This note provides country of origin information (COI) and analysis of COI for use by Home Office decision makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims (as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a> section). It is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of a particular subject or theme.</p>

<p>It is split into two main sections: (1) analysis and assessment of COI and other evidence; and (2) COI. These are explained in more detail below.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>This section analyses the evidence relevant to this note â i.e. the COI section; refugee/human rights laws and policies; and applicable caselaw â by describing this and its inter-relationships, and provides an assessment of, in general, whether one or more of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A person is reasonably likely to face a real risk of persecution or serious harm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general humanitarian situation is so severe as to breach Article 15(b) of European Council Directive 2004/83/EC (the Qualification Directive) / Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights as transposed in paragraph 339C and 339CA(iii) of the Immigration Rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The security situation presents a real risk to a civilianâs life or person such that it would breach Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive as transposed in paragraph 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person is able to obtain protection from the state (or quasi state bodies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person is reasonably able to relocate within a country or territory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A claim is likely to justify granting asylum, humanitarian protection or other form of leave, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a claim is refused, it is likely or unlikely to be certifiable as âclearly unfoundedâ under section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Decision makers must, however, still consider all claims on an individual basis, taking into account each caseâs specific facts.</p>

<h3>Country of origin information</h3>

<p>The country information in this note has been carefully selected in accordance with the general principles of COI research as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/48493f7f2.html" rel="external">Common EU [European Union] Guidelines for Processing Country of Origin Information (COI)</a>, dated April 2008, and the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentationâs (ACCORD), <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.coi-training.net/researching-coi/" rel="external">Researching Country Origin Information â Training Manual, 2013</a>. Namely, taking into account the COIâs relevance, reliability, accuracy, balance, currency, transparency and traceability.</p>

<p>The structure and content of the country information section follows a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Terms_of_Reference">terms of reference</a> which sets out the general and specific topics relevant to this note.</p>

<p>All information included in the note was published or made publicly available on or before the âcut-offâ date(s) in the country information section. Any event taking place or report/article published after these date(s) is not included.</p>

<p>All information is publicly accessible or can be made publicly available, and is from generally reliable sources. Sources and the information they provide are carefully considered before inclusion. Factors relevant to the assessment of the reliability of sources and information include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the motivation, purpose, knowledge and experience of the source</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the information was obtained, including specific methodologies used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the currency and detail of information, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the COI is consistent with and/or corroborated by other sources.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple sourcing is used to ensure that the information is accurate, balanced and corroborated, so that a comprehensive and up-to-date picture at the time of publication is provided of the issues relevant to this note.</p>

<p>Information is compared and contrasted, whenever possible, to provide a range of views and opinions. The inclusion of a source, however, is not an endorsement of it or any view(s) expressed.</p>

<p>Each piece of information is referenced in a brief footnote; full details of all sources cited and consulted in compiling the note are listed alphabetically in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Bibliography">bibliography</a>.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>                 Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>             Basis of claim</h3>

<p>1.1.1         Fear of persecution and/or serious harm by state or non-state actors because of the personâs actual or perceived sexual orientation and/or gender identity or expression.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>             Points to note</h3>

<p>1.2.1         This note provides an assessment of the general situation of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, trans and intersex persons as well as those perceived as such. They are referred hereafter collectively as âLGBTI personsâ, though the treatment and experiences of each group may differ.</p>

<p>1.2.2         Decision makers must also refer to the Asylum Instructions on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim">Sexual identity issues in the asylum claim</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dealing-with-gender-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim-process">Gender identity issues in the asylum claim.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>                 Consideration of issues</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>             Credibility</h3>

<p>2.1.1         For information on assessing credibility, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<p>2.1.2         Decision makers must also check if there has been a previous application for a UK visa or another form of leave. Asylum applications matched to visas should be investigated prior to the asylum interview (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-matches-handling-asylum-claims-from-uk-visa-applicants-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Visa Matches, Asylum Claims from UK Visa Applicants</a>).</p>

<p>2.1.3         Decision makers should also consider the need to conduct language analysis testing (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/language-analysis-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Language Analysis</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>             Exclusion</h3>

<p>2.2.1         Decision makers must consider whether one (or more) of the exclusion clauses applies. If the person is excluded from the Refugee Convention, they will also be excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection. Each case must be considered on its individual facts and merits.</p>

<p>2.2.2         For further guidance on the exclusion clauses and restricted leave, see the Asylum Instructions on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asylum-instruction-exclusion-article-1f-of-the-refugee-convention">Exclusion under Articles 1F and 33(2) of the Refugee Convention</a>, Humanitarian Protection and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricted-leave-asylum-casework-instruction">Restricted Leave</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>             Convention reason(s)</h3>

<p>2.3.1         A personâs actual or imputed membership of a particular social group (PSG).</p>

<p>2.3.2         LGBTI persons in Malaysia form a particular social group (PSG) within the meaning of the Refugee Convention because they share an innate characteristic or a common background that cannot be changed, or share a characteristic or belief that is so fundamental to their identity or conscience that they should not be forced to renounce it, and have a distinct identity which is perceived as being different by the surrounding society.</p>

<p>2.3.3         Although LGBTI persons in Malaysia form a PSG, establishing such membership is not sufficient to be recognised as a refugee. The question to be addressed is whether the particular person will face a real risk of persecution on account of their membership of such a group.</p>

<p>2.3.4         For further guidance on Convention reasons see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>             Risk</h3>

<h4>a.          General points</h4>

<p>2.4.1         Paragraphs 35 and 82 of the determination of the Supreme Courtâs ruling in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/31.html" rel="external">HJ (Iran) and HT (Cameroon) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] UKSC 31</a>, heard 10,11,12 May and promulgated 7 July 2010, have set out the approach to take and established the test that should be applied when assessing such a claim based on a personâs sexual orientation and / or gender identity / expression.</p>

<p>2.4.2         For further guidance, see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim">Sexual identity issues in the asylum claim</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/699703/gender-issues-in-the-asylum-claim-v3.pdf" rel="external">Gender identity issues in the asylum claim</a>.</p>

<h4>b.          State treatment of LGB persons</h4>

<p>2.4.3         The Penal Code does not specifically refer to homosexuality but addresses âcarnal intercourse against the order of natureâ. This interpretation includes sex between men and between women and is punishable with a term of imprisonment of up to 20 years and is also punished with whipping (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Legal_context">Legal context</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.4         Laws relating to LGB issues are frequently devolved to Sharia law which applies to Muslims across all 13 states and 3 federal territories. All of them criminalise same sex sexual acts with fines or up to three yearsâ imprisonment and whipping (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark17">Sharia and customary laws</a>). In general, Sharia law does not apply to non-Muslims although they can be affected by the decisions made in a sharia court, for example in custody and religious conversion cases. Generally non-Muslims are not at risk from prosecution or affected by the imposition of Sharia law (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark17">Sharia and customary laws</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.5         The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) stated in November 2019 that prosecutions in relation to same sex activities have not been common and when they have occurred in recent years, they have been in relation to state-based Sharia legislation rather than federal law. Sharia law has been used to punish both male and female same-sex activity (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark17">Sharia and customary laws</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark19">State attitudes and treatment</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.6         The constitution does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. There is no provision in law for same sex marriage or civil partnership (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Legal_context">Legal context</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark30">Societal norms</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.7         LGB clubs have been able to operate and were, until recently, left alone by the authorities. In August 2018 Malaysiaâs oldest gay bar in Kuala Lumpur, the Blue Boy nightclub, which had operated without incident for 30 years, was raided and 20 men were detained and ordered to have counselling for âillicit behaviourâ by the Federal Territory Islamic Religious Department of Malaysia. There have been no further reported raids on the blue boy and it remains open to this date (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark19">State attitudes and treatment</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark27">Rehabilitation</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.8         Government rhetoric towards the LGB community is mixed. A number of those within the government have issued negative messages on LGB rights with ministers stating that the government does not recognise LGB practices as lawful and some stating there are âno gay people in Malaysiaâ. One minister criticised LGB rightsâ campaigners for attending a womenâs march in 2019. However, although some ministers have spoken out against the discrimination of the LGB community, with the minister of Islamic affairs condemning discrimination in the workplace and the Prime Minister describing the Sharia court caning of 2 lesbian women as âcruelâ, reports suggest that the new government that came into power in 2018 continues its predecessorâs anti-LGB rhetoric and policies (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark25">Official views on sexual orientation and gender identity</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.9         State and federal authorities have promoted ârehabilitationâ and âre- educationâ centres aimed at changing a personâs sexual orientation or gender identity. The government has also published an e-book intended to steer LGB persons to âthe right pathâ. It has been reported that LGB persons are encouraged to attend âre-educationâ centres particularly if they are seeking treatment for HIV and in 2018, the Federal Islamic Development Department and the Federal Territory Islamic Affairs Department claimed to have returned 3,000 LGB persons to cisgender, heterosexual norms (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark27">Rehabilitation</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.10     LGB persons may be encouraged to attend ârehabilitation centresâ for âgay conversion therapyâ. Two news reports about a high-profile raid on a gay club in Kuala Lumpur stated that men were âsentâ or âorderedâ to attend counselling for illicit behaviour. The sources differ on the number of people involved, though, one suggesting 2 and the other 20 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark27">âRehabilitationâ</a>.</p>

<p>2.4.11     It is unlikely someone could show that encouragement to attend âconversion therapyâ would amount to persecutory treatment. However, if a person can show that they would be forced to attend ârehabilitationâ and âre-educationâ centres then they are likely to be at risk of persecution/serious harm.</p>

<p>2.4.12     Section 37(e) of the Communications and Multimedia Act prohibits content which is deemed to be not in line with public policy. This has included depictions of LGB people and LGB issues. Authorities have censored and banned homosexual, bisexual and transsexual individuals from appearing on state media and have also censored films and songs which promote the acceptance of same-sex relations (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark28">Censorship/monitoring of online material</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.13     The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) was established in 1999 and can inquire into allegations of infringements of human rights. SHUKAM has undertaken several pieces of work on LGB issues since 2010 in order to promote awareness of human rights (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark29">Ombudsman/complaints mechanisms</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.14     In general, LGB persons are unlikely to be of particular interest to the authorities and unlikely to be prosecuted under the Penal Code, although if it was applied it would be disproportionate and discriminatory. Muslim LGB people are likely to be liable to prosecution under Sharia law which would by its nature be persecutory.</p>

<p>2.4.15     If a person does not openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity, consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not. Each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return.</p>

<h4>c.           State treatment of transgender persons</h4>

<p>2.4.18     Article 8 of the Constitution states that all persons are equal under the law and there should be no discrimination against citizens on the grounds of gender, although there is insufficient clarity on how transgender issues are interpreted in the context of gender equality. The Malaysian Court of Appeal had stated in November 2014 that Sharia law discriminating on the grounds of gender means that harassment of transgender persons is unconstitutional. However, in October 2015, the Federal Court of Malaysia ruled that the state Sharia law was not unconstitutional (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark16">Constitution and statutory laws</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.19     Sharia law applies to Muslims across 13 states and all of the Muslim states have laws which prohibit posing as someone of a different sex, resulting in transgender persons being subject to arrest. Although Sharia law applies to Muslims only, non-Muslims have also been arrested for cross-dressing Authorities often charged transgender persons with âindecent behaviourâ and âimportuning for immoral purposesâ in public, which is punishable with a fine and up to three months in prison (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark17">Sharia and customary laws</a>, [Arrests <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">and detention of transgender individuals</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Legal_context">Legal context</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.20     According to a number of sources Muslim and non-Muslim transgender persons face âsystemicâ human rights violations and are subject to arrests, harassment and violence from state authorities, including physical and sexual assault during raids and arrests and subsequent placement in re- education centres (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">Arrests and detention of transgender individuals</a>) .</p>

<p>2.4.21     Sharia law applies to Muslims across 13 states and almost all of the Muslim states have laws which prohibit posing as someone of a different sex, resulting in transgender individuals being subject to arrest. Although Sharia law applies to Muslims only, non-Muslims have also been arrested for cross-dressing (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark17">Sharia and customary laws</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">Arrests and detention of transgender individuals</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.22     Transgender persons are generally unable to change their name and sex marker on their identity card (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark24">Official discrimination</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.23     Owing to their increased visibility, transgender persons are often charged with âindecent behaviourâ and âimportuning for immoral purposesâ in public. They are fined and can be imprisoned for up to three months. Cross dressing is technically not illegal under civil law, but state police have arrested transgender women for public indecency and immorality or under Sharia law for impersonating a women. Transgender persons are particularly vulnerable to being subjected to raids by religious authorities and encouraged into âre-educationâ centres. As with other members of the LGB community, it is generally reported that attendance is âencouragedâ, which in itself is unlikely to amount to persecutory treatment, however if a person can show that they would be forced to attend then it is likely that a grant of asylum would be appropriate (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">Arrests and detention of transgender individuals</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark27">Rehabilitation</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.24     Transgender persons are often held in detention facilities designated for men leading to both verbal and sexual abuse by other prisoners and staff. State religious officials and police officers have also physically, and sexually assaulted transgender women arrested during raids (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">Arrests and detention of transgender individuals</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.25     Several transgender women have reported that abusive arrests have diminished since the court cases and have said that advocacy and awareness raising has restrained some officials, but state officials continue to propagate discriminatory beliefs and fail to denounce violence when it takes place (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark22">Arrests and detention of transgender individuals</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.26     Government views and attitudes towards the transgender community are varied with, for example the minister in charge of Islamic affairs suggesting on the one hand that Islamic authorities should âabandon their preoccupation with trans peopleâs attireâ, whilst on the other hand expressing concern about the âworrying spreadâ of the LGBT lifestyle. Reports suggest that the new government that came into power in 2018 continues its predecessorâs anti- LGBT rhetoric and policies (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark25">Official views on sexual orientation and gender identity</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.27     The risk of arrest for transgender individuals is generally higher than the rest of the LGB community owing to their increased visibility. In general, a transsexual person who is open about their gender identity is more likely to be at risk of treatment which by its nature and repetition amounts to persecution.</p>

<p>2.4.28     If a person does not openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity, consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not. Each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return.</p>

<p>2.4.29     For further guidance on assessing risk, see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a></p>

<p>2.4.30     Decision makers must also refer to the Asylum Instructions on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim">Sexual identity issues in the asylum claim</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dealing-with-gender-identity-issues-in-the-asylum-claim-process">Gender identity issues in the asylum claim</a>.</p>

<h4>d.          Societal treatment of LGB persons</h4>

<p>2.4.31     Malaysia is a culturally and religiously conservative country and in general there is a negative view of same-sex relations. There is a strong social taboo against LGB issues among Muslims (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark30">Societal norms</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.32     LGB person have faced threats, stigma, violence- including sexual violence, and discrimination from society. Some members of the LGB community hide their identity to avoid discrimination and ostracism by their family, who are often the perpetrators of violence against them. Some families have opted to send their children, who identify as LGB, to official or private âre-educationâ centres (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark30">Societal norms</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark35">Societal treatment, violence and discrimination</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark27">Rehabilitation</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.33     According to sources online LGB hate speech has increased since the 2018 elections (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark25">Official views on sexual orientation and gender identity</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.34     Sources report that there are some organisations operating in Malaysia providing various forms of assistance and support to LGB persons, but that they are finding it difficult to work towards meaningful change. Whilst some human rights groups have publicly condemned discriminatory statements made by government officials some have also faced multiple forms of reprisals themselves as activists. There have also been some prominent Malaysian Muslim activists who have spoken out against the persecution of the LGBT community (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark46">LGBT groups, civil society and human rights [NGOs]</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.35     There are a number of gay bars and LGB friendly venues in Malaysia although evidence suggests that these are predominantly in Kuala Lumpur and geared towards foreign tourists. An interview with an openly gay musician acknowledged that the situation for everyday gay Malaysians was regressing but described his experience of being gay in Kuala Lumpur as a positive one and that the âqueer sceneâ is thriving (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark49">Gay âsceneâ or âcommunityâ</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.36     The level and frequency of discrimination and violence faced by members of the LGB community differs according to their socio-economic status, religion, geographic location and degree of openness. LGB persons who come from poorer rural areas are more likely to have to hide their sexuality within their social groups than those from urban areas who are well educated and of a high socio-economic status. In general, society is more tolerant to LGB people in Kuala Lumpur than in areas along the east coast peninsular or Sarawak and Sabah (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark30">Societal norms</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.37     Although LGB persons may face some societal discrimination in employment opportunities and negative media coverage, there are few reports of societal violence against them and it is unlikely that they would face a real risk of serious harm or persecution sufficient to qualify for protection. If a person does not openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity, consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not. Each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return.</p>

<p>2.4.38     For further guidance on assessing risk, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<h4>e.          Societal treatment of transgender persons</h4>

<p>2.4.40     Transgender persons face violence, blackmail, verbal and physical abuse, discrimination from their families and members of society, particularly those from a Muslim background where there is a strong social taboo against LGBT issues. Violence against transgender persons is under reported and often dismissed in reported cases although there have been a few cases covered by the media and two thirds of transgender women are said to have faced some form of physical or emotional abuse (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark39">Discrimination and violence against transgender individuals</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.41     Transgender persons face a negative representation in the media and even though they are employed in a range of professions transgender individuals are widely perceived and portrayed as sex workers, which carries a stigma in Malaysia. They are sometimes required by employers to use toilets based on the gender assigned at their birth (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark39">Discrimination and violence against transgender individuals</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark30">Societal norms</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark42">Access to services</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.42     Transgender persons also face discrimination and derogatory language when accessing healthcare, especially when it is linked to HIV/AIDS treatment, which is prevalent in the trans community. In 2019 a transgender activist was selected by the Ministry of Health to represent the trans community on a board that sets policy for the strategy to reduce HIV in Malaysia. This appointment sparked backlash from the general community who were reassured by the Minister of Health that the appointment didnât mean the government recognised LGBT culture or lifestyle but that efforts needed to be made to make healthcare inclusive and accessible to those in need. Transgender individuals have also reported discrimination and stigma when accessing employment and educational facilities (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark42">Access to services</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.43     The level and frequency of discrimination and violence faced by transgender persons may differ according to their socio-economic status, religion, geographic location and degree of openness. Transgender persons who come from poorer rural areas may be more likely to hide their gender identity than those living in more urban areas who are well educated and of a higher socio-economic status (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark30">Societal norms</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.44     In general, transgender people in Malaysia face a risk of societal discrimination and violence and those who are open about gender identity may be at risk of treatment which by its nature and repetition amounts to persecution. However, this may differ depending on an individualâs socio- economic status, religion and geographic location.</p>

<p>2.4.45     If a person does not openly express their sexual orientation or gender identity, consideration must be given to the reasons why they do not. Each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate that they would be at real risk on return.</p>

<p>2.4.46     For further guidance on assessing risk, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>             Protection</h3>

<p>2.5.1         Where the person has a well-founded fear of persecution from state actors, they will not be able to avail themselves of the protection of the authorities.</p>

<p>2.5.2         Where the person has a well-founded fear of persecution from non-state actors â including ârogueâ state actors â decision makers must assess whether the state can provide effective protection.</p>

<p>2.5.3         State authorities have been responsible for arrests, violence, detentions, harassment and discrimination towards LGBTI persons with reports of the police physically and sexually assaulting them. However, there is evidence of the authorities prosecuting some of the perpetrators of violence and murders against the LGBTI community, although in many instances the police ruled out hate crime as a motive.</p>

<p>2.5.4         It would be unreasonable to expect a person identifying as LGBTI to seek protection from the authorities. LGBTI persons are not arrested due to their sexuality but are arrested due to same sex sexual activity although as stated above the law is rarely enforced.</p>

<p>2.5.5         In general, the state appears able but unwilling to offer effective protection and the person will not be able to avail themselves of the protection of the authorities. However, each case will need to be considered on its facts.</p>

<p>2.5.6         For further guidance on assessing the availability of state protection, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>             Internal relocation</h3>

<p>2.6.1         Where the person has a well-founded fear of persecution from state actors, they are unlikely to be able to relocate to escape that risk.</p>

<p>2.6.2         Where the person has a well-founded fear of persecution from non-state actors, decision makers must determine whether the person could relocate internally to a place where they would not face a real risk of persecution or serious harm and where they can reasonably be expected to stay. Each case must be considered on its individual merits.</p>

<p>2.6.3         The law allows for freedom of movement which is generally respected. Certain areas are more likely to face restrictions such as in the eastern Sabah and Sarawak States, where more traditional values persist. However, sources indicate that people are able to internally relocate and do so, usually to larger urban areas. This has included transsexual persons who have been able to move and gain employment in Kuala Lumpur.</p>

<p>2.6.4         An LGBTI person may be able to relocate to urban areas such as Kuala Lumpur (the capital) which has a population of 7.78 million and where sources suggest there is possibly more of a tolerance of LGBTI persons. Each case must be considered on its facts with the onus on the person to demonstrate why they are unable to relocate to another area.</p>

<p>2.6.5         Internal relocation is not viable if it depends on the person concealing their sexual orientation and / or gender identity/expression in the area of relocation for fear of persecution.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>             Constitution and statutory laws</h3>

<p>3.1.1         Article 8 of the Constitution states that all persons are equal under the law and there should be no discrimination against citizens based only on the ground of religion, race, descent, place of birth or gender in any law<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. However, the Asia Pacific Transgender network report of 2017 noted that:</p>

<p>âThe addition of âgenderâ in Article 8 occurred via an amendment, which came into force on 28 September 2001, and was precipitated by Malaysiaâs signing and ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1995. In Malaysia, the second highest court (the Court of Appeal) has deemed that Article 8âs prohibition of discrimination on the ground of gender means harassment of trans people is unconstitutional. However, given that discourse on this matter is limited, there is insufficient clarity on how trans issues are interpreted in the context of gender equality.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.2         In their 2018 Global Workplace Briefing on Malaysia, Stonewall state that âThere are no laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity [â¦] Article 8 of the Constitution protects the right to equality before the law for all citizens regardless of religion, race, descent, place of birth, or gender. Sexual orientation and gender identity are not included in this list.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.3         Article 10 of the Constitution allows for the right to freedom of speech and expression by every citizen<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.1.4         In their 2018 Global Workplace Briefing on Malaysia, Stonewall state that âArticle 10 of the Federal Constitution protects the rights to freedom of speech, expression and peaceful assembly of citizens. These rights can be restricted but there are no LGBT-specific restrictions.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.5         The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Association (ILGA) report, âState-sponsored Homophobiaâ, 13th Edition, 2019 (The ILGA report), stated: âIn November 2014, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/5475fb1a4.pdf" rel="external">Court of Appeal</a> found section 66 of the Syariah [Sharia] Criminal Enactment of Negeri Sembilan State criminalising cross-dressing unconstitutional. The court observed that the existence of a law that punishes gender expression is degrading and deprives those affected of their dignity and value in society.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.6         However, in October 2015, the Federal Court of Malaysia ruled that the state Sharia law was not unconstitutional<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.1.7         The Malaysia Penal Code does not specifically refer to homosexuality but deals with actions that go against the âorder of natureâ. Article 337A of the Penal Code, states: âAny person who has sexual connection with another person by the introduction of the penis into the anus or mouth of the other person is said to commit carnal intercourse against the order of nature.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.8         Article 377B of the Penal Code, states: âWhoever voluntarily commits carnal intercourse against the order of nature shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to twenty years and shall also be punished with whipping.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.9         Section 377D provides for punishments for acts of indecency: âAny person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the Commission of, or procures or attempt to procure the commission by any person of, any act of gross indecency with another person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.10     The Human Dignity Trust report âBreaking the silenceâ, dated May 2016, noted that ââ¦consensual sexual conduct between women is criminalised through the statutory penal codes â¦ [in Malaysia] by using gender neutral language applicable to both male and female same-sex conductâ¦</p>

<p>âSome States [including Malaysia] initially had male-only gross indecency provisionsâ¦[Malaysia] amended their penal codes to apply equally to lesbians and bisexual womenâ¦in 1998â.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.11     Freedom Houseâs report âFreedom in the World 2020â stated that in Malaysia âSame-sex sexual relations are punishable by up to 20 years in prison under the penal code, though this is generally not enforced.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.2.1         The Human Dignity Trust report âBreaking the silenceâ, published in 2016 noted that âMalaysia devolves its penal law to Malay states which may choose to implement Sharia law.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.2.2         The same report also noted that âFemale same-sex sexual conduct is also criminalised in most jurisdictions where Sharia law is applied in addition to or in the absence of a statutory criminal provision. according to the international lesbian and gay association, this includes â¦Malaysiaâ.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.2.3         The Asia Pacific Transgender network report of 2017 noted that:</p>

<p>âMalaysia has 13 states and 3 federal territories. all have state-enacted Islamic laws that criminalise trans women based on their gender identity and gender expression, while some criminalise trans men.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.2.10     The same report also noted: âSharia courts have jurisdiction over Muslims in matters of family law and religious observances. Non-Muslims have no standing in sharia proceedings, leading to some cases where sharia court rulings have affected non-Muslims who have no ability to defend their position or appeal the courtâs decisionâ¦The relationship between sharia and civil law remains largely unresolved in the legal system.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.2         Several sources noted that in August 2018 the countryâs oldest gay bar, the Blue Boy club, had been raided. Twenty men were detained and ordered into counselling for illicit behaviour.

<p>4.3.1                     The Asia Pacific Transgender network report of 2017 noted that:</p>

<p>âTrans people in Malaysia face systemic and widespread stigma and human rights violations. Muslim trans people are subject to arrests, harassment and assault from federal, state, and local Islamic religious authorities, and often avoid reporting these incidents for fear that the police will not protect them.

<p>4.3.2                     In their 2018 Global Workplace Briefing on Malaysia, Stonewall reported that âIslamic laws banning cross-dressing are used against Muslim trans people. Under these laws, trans people are often arrested and trans women have their hair shaved off, which can be very traumatic. There has also been an unprecedented number of raids conducted by the religious authorities at trans events since some groups challenged the cross-dressing laws in court.

<p>âSeveral Malaysian trans women have reported abusive arrests have diminished since an appeals court struck down as unconstitutional a state âcross-dressingâ law in 2014.

<p>4.3.4                     The 2019 SUHAKAM report on transgender persons noted âWhereas Syariah laws apply only to Muslims, non â Muslims have also been subjected to âmoral policingâ. They are subjected to arrests during police raid in entertainment outlet and by municipal council for roaming around on the street as cross dressers which may be accused of disorderly behaviour in public places.

<p>4.3.5                     The SUHAKAM 2019 report on transgender persons, which involved 100 transgender respondents between the age of 18-70 years, noted that:</p>

<p>âAuthorities often charged transgender persons with âindecent behaviourâ and âimportuning for immoral purposesâ in public. Those convicted of a first offense faced a maximum fine of RM25 ($6.25) and a maximum sentence of 14 days in jail. The sentences for subsequent convictions are fines of up to RM100 ($25) and up to three months in jail.

<p>4.3.7                     The 2019 DFAT report which is based on a range of sources including in- country reporting, stated:</p>

<p>âWhile cross-dressing is not technically illegal under civil law, state-level police have arrested transgender women under the Minor Offenses Act (1955) for public indecency and immorality, or (where applicable) under Syariah-based law for impersonating women.â¦</p>

<p>âIn-country sources report that their increased visibility makes transgender individuals particularly vulnerable to being subjected to raids by religious authorities and subsequently placed in re-education centres.

<p>âHe has suggested that the Islamic authorities should abandon their preoccupation with trans peopleâs attire, an obsession that in recent years has prompted dozens if not hundreds of arrests of trans women under state Syariah [sharia] laws, which criminalise âa male person posing as a female.â (Trans women are not âmale persons,â but since Malaysia will not allow them to change their gender markers on their official documents, they are considered male under the law.)</p>

<p>âOn the other hand, on July 23 [2018], he asserted before Parliament that the government is concerned with the âworryingâ âspread of the LGBT lifestyleâ and told his critics not to âstand on the Friday pulpit and accuse the Harapan government of being friendly to LGBT.â And on July 29 [2018], according to media reports, he said the government would organise âcampsâ and âseminarsâ for LGBT people, reportedly adding that, âParents need to be aware that this can be stopped from the beginning.

<p>4.8.2            Religious Affairsâ Minister, Mujahid Yusof Rawa, announced in October 2018 that the government had published an e-book called Panduan Hijrah Diri (Guide for Rehabilitation) for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) people that would steer them back to the right path. âThe book Hadith Sahih Mengenai Perlakuan LGBT and leaflets on âUnderstanding LGBT from the perspective of a Muslimâ can also be downloaded,â and reiterated that the LGBT lifestyle would not be accepted in Malaysia<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:88" rel="footnote">[footnote 88]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>4.8.3            According to an article by Malay Mail, the 146-page book consisted of ânine chapters, forming a step-by-step guide that includes topics of âStart of the Journeyâ, âRealisationâ, âUnderstanding the Challenges and Testsâ, and âControlling Your Lustââ.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:89" rel="footnote">[footnote 89]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.8.4            In 2016 the government launched a five-year action plan called Pelan Tindakan Menangani Gejala Sosial Perlakuan LGBT 2017 â 2021, working alongside 22 partners, including the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Women, Development and Community, state Islamic departments and other state agencies to address social skills and curb LGBT behaviour<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:90" rel="footnote">[footnote 90]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>4.8.5            The types of rehabilitation programmes were described by Malaysia Kimi, an online news portal, in April 2019:</p>

<p>âThe Mukhayyam programme - a three-day camp introduced in 2011, designed as a strategy to reduce HIV transmission among key affected populations, namely Muslim transwomen. The programme, listed in the National Strategic Plan to End Aids 2016-2030, has a few goals: create awareness about HIV, Islam and being a good Muslim; offer job placement and financial assistance for startups; and encourage participants to abandon immoral behaviour, including oneâs sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>

<p>The government on multiple occasions has promoted the Mukhayyam programme as a rehabilitation camp. This was further reinforced by the director of Jakim, who was quoted in an article in July 2017 saying that the programme aims to guide and provide spiritual awareness for the LGBT community through a religious approach to return the participants âto the right pathâ. He noted that participants had changed their appearance, managed their romantic attractions and abandoned their homosexual behaviour. There are also Mukhayyam camps for gay men and lesbian women. The Malaysian Aids Council has also issued a statement denouncing the harmful effects of the Mukhayyam programme.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:91" rel="footnote">[footnote 91]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.8.6            Further adding:</p>

<p>âVarious seminars and programs have been conducted targeting students, school counsellors, parents, volunteers, health staff and representatives of Muslim NGOs, that encourage people to avoid committing âLGBT actsâ, and encourage others to identify and curb âLGBT behavioursâ within their families, social circles, and workplacesâ¦ Jakim claimed they had reached out to over 2,000 LGBT people between 2006 and 2014 to return them âto the right pathâ through its volunteer and outreach programmes.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:92" rel="footnote">[footnote 92]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.8.7            The 2019 DFAT report stated:</p>

<p>âAuthorities at federal and state level have promoted so-called rehabilitation or re-education programs aimed at changing sexual orientation or gender identity, also known as conversion therapy. The Minister for Religious Affairs claimed in October 2018 that 1,450 people had âvoluntarilyâ taken part in outreach programs organised by JAKIM since 2011. The Ministerâs comments came while launching a JAKIM e-book guide called âSelf- Transitioning from Homosexualityâ, which remains available for download in the Google Play Store application. In-country sources report that the JAKIM rehabilitation programs are located in residential locations within neighbourhoods, with participants segregated by sex and subject to curfews. The programs reportedly teach participants how to pray, give them spiritual coaching, and âre-educateâ them about their sexual identity. The federal government also reportedly runs seminars for non-LGBTI students, parents, and volunteers to equip them with knowledge on the psychosocial, psychological, and psycho-spiritual needs and health of the LGBTI community.</p>

<p>âA number of state governments also run re-education programs for LGBTI individuals. The Terengganu government has reportedly run a âre-education boot campâ or âbehaviour corrective programâ in Besut for effeminate teenage males since 2010, to which boys selected for effeminate behaviour were sent for physical training and religious and motivational classes; while the Negeri Sembilan Religious Affairs Department reportedly held a two-day camp as part of the stateâs âAction Plan Against Social Ills of LGBT 2017- 2021â. The Selangor State Government also reportedly offers inducement payments to members of the LGBTI community to undergo treatment by any institution, Muslim NGO or group that can âliberate, manage, protect, treat, and rehab [the] communityâ.</p>

<p>âIn addition to the programs run by official bodies, a number of private centres also reportedly offer âtreatmentâ to LGBTI individuals through religious counselling. In country sources report that some parents elect to send their children to official or private re-education centres for reasons other than identifying as LGBTI, including in cases involving sex before marriage or drug abuse.â <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:93" rel="footnote">[footnote 93]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.8.8            The UN Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children reported in her report dated January 2019 that she was âalso concerned at reports of an increasingly hostile climate and State-supported or -tolerated physical and sexual violence, confinement, isolation, and corrective or rehabilitative practices directed against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex childrenâ.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:94" rel="footnote">[footnote 94]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.8.9            The USSD report 2019 noted that âState religious authorities reportedly forced LGBTI persons to participate in âtreatmentâ or ârehabilitationâ programs to âcureâ them of their sexuality. In February [2019] the federal minister for religious affairs said the government would implement an outreach program for LGBTI individuals that, âapart from providing assistance such as food,â would also include âreligious education and counselling services so that they can return to leading normal lives.ââ<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:95" rel="footnote">[footnote 95]</a></sup></p>

<p>âThe function of inquiring into complaints about human rights infringements is subject to the conditions imposed by section 12 of the Act.

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>             Overview</h3>

<p>5.1.1         The Pew research centre global attitudes survey from 2014 stated that 88% of respondents in Malaysia believed that homosexuality was morally unacceptable, 4% believed it morally acceptable and 6% as not a moral issue<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:106" rel="footnote">[footnote 106]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>5.1.2         An online news report by Reuters in August 2018, stated: âActivists say intolerance of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has grown in Malaysia in recent years. In February [2018], a newspaper article detailing how to identify lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals sparked outrage on social media.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:107" rel="footnote">[footnote 107]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.3         The UNHRC âCompilation on Malaysiaâ dated 3 September 2018 noted:</p>

<p>âThe Special Rapporteur on health stated that discriminatory societal attitudes towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons prevailed in Malaysia and had been exacerbated over the past few decades by the use of a stigmatizing rhetoric by politicians, public officials and religious leaders. The criminalization of same-sex conduct and of different forms of gender identity and expression had reinforced negative societal attitudes and led to serious human rights violations of the rights of that group of the population.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:108" rel="footnote">[footnote 108]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.4         In its 2019 report on transgender persons, SUHAKAM noted:</p>

<p>âIn Malaysia, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is often regarded as a taboo. In Malaysia, strict conformity to the binary classification of gender, i.e. male or female, resulted in discrimination against LGBT community that led to many violations of their human rights. This traditional classification is deeply rooted in laws, policies, culture and spiritual beliefs.</p>

<p>â[â¦] LGBT community calls for equal rights are often demonise in mainstream media, whom have contributed to the negative portrayal of the community. Media reports often perpetuated stereotypes, stigmatise the community, and exposed them to security risks. The existence of the LGBT community itself has been sensationalised and are regarded as a âthreatâ to society, further alienating the group. Therefore, it could be argued that the LGBT community face lack of acceptance in mainstream Malaysia. Indeed, their life in Malaysia has become a challenge and hence it would be appropriate to classify them as a marginalised group.</p>

<p>âThe most common terms for transgender person in Malaysia is, but not limited to, trans woman, trans man, mak nyah, transsexual and thirunagai. However, there are also derogatory and humiliating terms used in Malaysia by state and non-state actors describing transgender individual such as âbapokâ, âpondanâ, âsotongâ (âsquidâ), âtomboyâ and others.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:109" rel="footnote">[footnote 109]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.5         The 2019 DFAT report noted âThere is a strong social taboo against LGBTI issues, particularly among Muslims, and online abuse is common.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:110" rel="footnote">[footnote 110]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">5.2 </span>             Societal norms â gender and sexual identity</h3>

<p>5.2.1         In February 2018 The Guardian reported that a Malaysian newspaper had published a list of attributes for identifying gay and lesbian people, the Guardian noted that:</p>

<p>âThe article in Sinar Harian featured bullet points of supposedly distinctive qualities that revealed LGBT people. They stated that gay men were easy to identify because of their love of beards, going to the gym â not for exercise but to check out other men â and branded clothing. Their eyes light up when they see handsome men, the article said. The stand-out attributes for lesbians were that they tend to hug each other, hold hands and belittle men, according to the newspaper.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:111" rel="footnote">[footnote 111]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.2         The DFAT report which is based on a range of sources including in-country reporting, also stated:</p>

<p>âThe level and frequency of discrimination faced by members of the LGBTI community differs according to their socio-economic status, religion, geographic location and degree of openness. Well-educated urban LGBTI individuals of high socio-economic status are less likely to have to hide their sexuality within their family and social circles than are poorer individuals in rural areas. Sources report society is generally more permissive of people who identify as LGBTI in Kuala Lumpur than they are in East Coast peninsular Malaysia or Sarawak and Sabah.</p>

<p>âDFAT assesses that LGBTI individuals face a moderate risk ofâ¦ societal discrimination, which may include being subjected to exclusion fromâ¦employment opportunities, and/or familial or societal violence.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:112" rel="footnote">[footnote 112]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.1         According to the OECD SIGI index âBoth civil and Syariah laws reinforce stereotypical roles of men and women in the household. Under both legal systems, a husband is legally bound to maintain his wife, while there is no such obligation for a married woman who possesses means of her own. On the other hand, the law expects women to be the primary carers in the household, and does not provide for the role of men in child-raising, entitling only women to parental leave for example.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:113" rel="footnote">[footnote 113]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.2         The same source noted âWomen are often expected to play a disproportionate role within the household.

As noted in Media, authorities have undertaken efforts to restrict LGBTI activities online. Many members of the LGBTI community reportedly hide their identity to avoid harassment, familial ostracism, and/or violence. Reports of violence by family members towards LGBTI individuals are common, and society will generally place the blame for such violence on the individual for provoking it through identifying as LGBTI.

<p>7.1.1         The Coalition for SOGIESC (SOGIE and sex characteristics) Human Rights in Malaysia in their Stakeholder Report for the HRCâS Universal Periodic Review in 2018, stated: âLGBT persons face multiple forms of barriers in terms of accessibility, availability and affordability of friendly and specific healthcare services in the national healthcare system.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:151" rel="footnote">[footnote 151]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.1.2         Adding that:</p>

<p>âIn 2016, the MOH released a health guideline, âHealth guideline on dealing with gender health issues in health clinicsâ.

And they are widely perceived to participate in sex work, which is stigmatized in Malaysia, regardless of whether sex workers are transgender or cisgender, female or male. Leela, a transgender HIV outreach worker, told Human Rights Watch, âIn the media, transgenders are always portrayed as sex workers, even though we have transgender doctors and lawyers.â In fact, while a large number of transgender women do participate in sex work, others work in a wide range of professions: Human Rights Watch interviewed transgender doctors, social workers, HIV outreach workers, hairdressers, makeup artists, cleaners, receptionists, and marketing representatives, among others.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:158" rel="footnote">[footnote 158]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>             Government recognition of LGBT NGO</h3>

<p>8.1.1         The 2019 DFAT report stated that:</p>

<p>âMany civil society organisations register under the Malaysian Companies Act (1973), rather than the Societies Act (1966), to avoid delays and restrictions on their activities. The Registrar of Societies has previously prevented registration of organisations that it deems unfriendly to the government.

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>             The situation and treatment of civil society and NGOs</h3>

<p>8.2.1         The Stonewall Global Workplace Briefings 2018, Malaysia, stated: âItâs difficult for organisations and individuals to work towards positive change. The concern is mostly one of security. People fear they will be arrested or fired from their jobs and often have to cancel awareness-raising events. However, the different parts of the social movement in Malaysia are very collaborative.</p>

<p>âOften LGBT rights advocates are able to exercise influence through other human rights groups focusing on multi-layered issues, such as health and education. LGBT artists have also used art as a tool of expression to work towards change for LGBT people.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:166" rel="footnote">[footnote 166]</a></sup></p>

<p>8.2.2         The Coalition for SOGIESC [Sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression] Human Rights in Malaysia, Stakeholder Report on the Status of Human Rights of LGBTI Persons in Malaysia (2018), stated:</p>

<p>âLGBT human rights defenders and persons or groups that defend the human rights of LGBT persons face multiple forms of reprisals, discrimination and violence from various actors including loss of job promotions or termination; lost program funding or donations; verbally attacked due to their visible support.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:167" rel="footnote">[footnote 167]</a></sup></p>

<p>8.2.3         In March 2019 Pink News reported that Asian human rights leaders had voiced their concern over âan âinsidiousâ government crackdown on LGBT+ people in Malaysiaâ. The article reported:</p>

<p>âExperts voiced concern over a reported police probe into an International Womenâs Day protest that included LGBT+ rights protesters. Government minister Dr Mujahid Yusof Rawa had called for âfirm actionâ against the March 9 protest, adding that âLGBT practice will not be accepted at all in this country.â His comments were condemned by Malaysian human rights groups Pusat Komas and Suara Rakyat Malaysia, as well as the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development and the pro-LGBT ASEAN SOGIE Caucus.</p>

<p>âIn a joint statement, the groups said: âThe recent Womenâs March was a peaceful rally, during which one of the main demands were to end all forms of violence and discrimination [for all]. âThe march itself and all the demands made during the gathering fall fully within the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, as guaranteed for all Malaysian citizens. However, the response to the march has not done so.â The groups accused the government of attempting to âfurther polarise public views on LGBTIQ rights by leaning on conservative sentiments,â adding: âIt is an insidious attempt to weaken the existing solidarity between LGBTIQ activists and the feminist movement.ââ<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:168" rel="footnote">[footnote 168]</a></sup></p>

<p>8.2.4         Further adding: âThe statement also [â¦] linked a rise in anti-LGBT sentiment to a surge in anti-LGBT hate crimes. The statement adds: âWe call on the Government of Malaysia to put a halt to the persecution of the LGBTIQ community, and to take immediate steps to improve the human rights protection of all people in the country.ââ</p>

<p>8.2.5         In April 2019 a prominent Malaysian LGBT activist accused the authorities of intimidation following a statement he read to the UN Human Rights Council, which later led to him being questioned by police. Malaysia Kini, reporting on the story, noted:</p>

<p>âThe 27-year-old was questioned by police for an hour in Kuala Lumpur last Friday [26 April 2019], after an online backlash against statements given at the Council, which reviews the human rights record of each United Nations member state every five years. âIt was typical by the police,â he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. âThey tend to intimidate human rights defenders - weâve seen that with organisers of other causes too. âThis is a pattern by authoritiesâ¦ it is their tactics,â said Numan, president of the Pelangi Campaign group, which seeks to raise awareness and advocate for LGBT rights in Malaysia. âI will keep speaking out because this is about our lives in this country - we need to speak out against discrimination.ââ<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:169" rel="footnote">[footnote 169]</a></sup></p>

<p>8.2.6         The article further added:</p>

<p>âIn the statement he read to the UN, Numan [â¦] complimented the Malaysian government for backing recommendations on combating bullying in schools, a move LGBT campaigners believe could help protect the community. But he expressed concern that it had not backed other anti- sexual discrimination recommendations that emerged from the review. He also criticised government rhetoric over LGBT peopleâs involvement in a march to celebrate International Womenâs Day. Malaysiaâs minister in charge of religious affairs decried the presence of LGBT groups at the march, calling it âan abuse of democracyâ.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:170" rel="footnote">[footnote 170]</a></sup></p>

<p>8.2.7         Nikkei Asian Review, November 2019 noted that:</p>

<p>âProminent Malaysian Muslim activists have also spoken out against the persecution of the LGBT community, including Marina Mahathir, the prime ministerâs daughter.</p>

<p>âMajidah Hashim of the womenâs rights group Sisters in Islam, itself branded âdeviantâ in a fatwa, said plainly: âIslam is a religion of peace, compassion, kindness and justice. Islam tells us that every person has been created with dignity and should be treated as such. Thus is our position on people who identify as LGBT.ââ<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:171" rel="footnote">[footnote 171]</a></sup></p>

<p>8.2.8         The Kuala Lumpur based âPelangi Campaign for Equality and Human Rights Initiativeâ envision a Malaysia where âLGBTIQ people are ensured equality at home, at work and in every community.â Their twitter page noted that âSince [founded in 2016] â¦we have helped dozens of homeless LGBTQ youth, organised advocacy campaigns, trained community leaders and provided support for legal challenges.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:172" rel="footnote">[footnote 172]</a></sup></p>

<p>8.2.9         The 2019 DFAT report stated âMalaysia does not have a national organisation committed to progressing LGBTI rights, but a loose coalition of NGOs and individuals reportedly works to advocate such rights within the framework of broader human rights advocacy. Longstanding official opposition towards the promotion of LGBTI issues in public spaces, which has continued under the new government, has hampered the effectiveness of such advocacy.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:173" rel="footnote">[footnote 173]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">8.3 </span>             Gay âsceneâ or âcommunityâ</h3>

<p>8.3.1         According to travel website Travel Gay Asia, aimed at gay travellers:</p>

<p>âThere has been an increasing number of gay venues in KL [Kuala Lumpur] as a result of the cityâs internationalisation. The scene is discreet, and venues changes quite often because homosexuality is still illegal.</p>

<p>âIn addition to a handful of gay businesses, there are some âstraightâ Bars &amp; Clubs that host âgay-friendly nightsâ. These venues would not identify themselves as being âgayâ but offer nights (usually Friday or Saturday) that attract a large number of gay customers.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:174" rel="footnote">[footnote 174]</a></sup></p>

<p>8.3.2         Gay Star News interviewed young gay Malaysian pop star Alextbh in October 2018. He was asked about the his experience of being gay in Malaysia he said:</p>

<p>ââItâs great! Weâre a tight-knitted community, we pretty much go to the same events and shows, simply because there arenât many to begin with. So itâs very easy to warm up to the scene. Iâm just really thankful that the queer scene in KL is thriving, knowing that I wouldnât have the opportunity to experience this back in my hometown in Sarawak (a state in East Malaysia). It was pretty different back then, I always felt like I was an outcast and I have to be (I really hate this word but thereâs no other way to describe it) straight- acting to fit in. It wasnât until I started performing on stage that I started becoming more comfortable of my sexuality, all thanks to the people that go to my shows. Queer music scene over here is thriving as well, and they just so happen to be my friends. Viktoria makes great deep house/electronic beat and Darren Luke makes trap-infused pop music, to name a couple.ââ<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:175" rel="footnote">[footnote 175]</a></sup></p>

<p>8.3.3         In the same article when asked what the current situation is like for everyday LGBTI Malaysians Alextbh stated that:</p>

<p>âItâs regressing, which is a shame because a lot of queer people voted the new government in. Iâm just appalled that politicians that I thought will back us up â ended up favouring the masses for their own political gains. But as with any kind of oppression and tyranny â the more the government subjects that on us, the angrier people will become. Weâre a pressure cooker. Weâre anticipating a revolution.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:176" rel="footnote">[footnote 176]</a></sup></p>
