<p>The Equal Rights Coalition (<abbr title="Equal Rights Coalition">ERC</abbr>) warmly welcomes the UN Human Rights Council decision to renew the mandate of the Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (‘<abbr title="Independent expert on sexual orientation and gender identity">IE SOGI</abbr>’).</p>

<p>In 2016, when the Council adopted the resolution creating the first ever SOGI mandate in the UN human rights system, it sent the clear message to the world that all persons, with no exception, should be able to live a life free of violence and discrimination. This was a moment of empowerment and pride.</p>

<p>This year’s renewal of the mandate was not a given. The Equal Rights Coalition´s members, both governments and civil society partners, worked tirelessly to defend the integrity and success of the resolution. Together, all 42 member states joined their voices in a statement calling for the renewal of the mandate during the Interactive Dialogue with the <abbr title="Independent expert on sexual orientation and gender identity">IE SOGI</abbr> in the first week of the 50th Session of the Council.</p>

<p>The Equal Rights Coalition sincerely appreciates and congratulates the UN Independent Expert for the progress that has been achieved in the last years and his steadfast commitment and inclusive approach within the mandate. We are pleased and encouraged by the fact that this important work will continue.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Equal Rights Coalition">ERC</abbr> reiterates its commitment to work diligently to ensure human rights are respected for LGBTQI+ persons around the world. We will not stop until everyone, everywhere, can be open about who they are, love who they love, and participate fully in society, without fear of violence or discrimination.</p>

<p>This renewal is an achievement we can all be proud of. Embracing diversity and inclusion makes our societies more resilient, healthy and prosperous.</p>
