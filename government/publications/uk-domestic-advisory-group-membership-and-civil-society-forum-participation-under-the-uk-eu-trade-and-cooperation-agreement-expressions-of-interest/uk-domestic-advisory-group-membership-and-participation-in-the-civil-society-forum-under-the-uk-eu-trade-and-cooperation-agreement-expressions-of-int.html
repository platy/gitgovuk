<h2>The Domestic Advisory Group and Civil Society Forum</h2>

<p>The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (<abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr>/the Agreement) provides for the involvement of civil society through the creation of a Domestic Advisory Group (<abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr>) and Civil Society Forum (<abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr>) in advising on the implementation of the Agreement.</p>

<p>Last year we ran an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/expressions-of-interest-eoi-for-membership-of-the-uk-domestic-advisory-group-and-civil-society-forum-under-the-trade-and-cooperation-agreement">expression of interest for the <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> and <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr></a>. We are reopening the expression of interest for additional members of the <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> and participants in the <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr>. This is in direct response to existing <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> members’ comments about increasing Northern Ireland representation and addressing any sectoral gaps in the UK <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> membership list, which we also want to reflect in the <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr> participation selection process. The Government is giving suitably qualified and independent civil society organisations, who have not yet had the chance to apply an opportunity to do so. The deadline for sending applications is 5pm on 16 September 2022.</p>

<p>If you applied for participation in the <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr> last year, there is no need to reapply. All applicants will be considered at the same time and will be notified after the current expression of interest has closed. If you are a current <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> member there is also no need to reapply.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> has met this year and established its Executive Council. The Government sees the <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> as an important consultative body, which will enable the Government to hear directly from those most affected by the <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr>. For more information, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/uk-eu-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-domestic-advisory-group">UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement Domestic Advisory Group</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr> meeting will bring together civil society representatives of both Parties to facilitate an active dialogue between participants. At the Forum, participants will submit their views or recommendations on Part 2 of the agreement, which includes trade, transport, energy, fisheries and social security coordination.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr> will be on 4 October 2022, in Brussels and there will be an option to attend virtually. For more information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1073542/tca-decision-3.pdf" rel="external">operational guidelines for the conduct of the Civil Society Forum</a>.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>The Trade and Cooperation Agreement states that the Domestic Advisory Group will gather representatives of the civil society of the United Kingdom, namely ‘non-governmental organisations, business and employers’ organisations, as well as trade unions, active in economic, sustainable development, social, human rights, environmental and other matters.’ The Civil Society Forum will gather representatives of the civil society of the UK and EU to facilitate a dialogue on matters relating to Part 2 of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.</p>

<p>The membership will be held by an organisation as a whole and different individuals can represent the organisation at different meetings. As a result, we do not seek expressions of interests from individuals.</p>

<p>Candidate organisations for membership of the Domestic Advisory Group must have specific professional expertise or competence with regard to the areas covered by the <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr>. The membership list will be kept under review and additional members will be considered in the future.</p>

<p>For the Civil Society Forum, candidate organisations must have specialised knowledge or expertise related to Part 2 of the Agreement, which includes trade, transport, energy, fisheries and social security coordination. This campaign will determine UK participants in the Civil Society Forum and applicants will be considered alongside applicants from the previous expression of interest. This list will be kept under review and alternative participants will be considered in the future.</p>

<p>To be considered for appointment under this campaign, the organisation must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a civil society or business organisation and not an individual business</li>
  <li>be not for profit</li>
  <li>represent the interest of UK businesses or citizens</li>
  <li>have specific professional competence or expertise relating to the <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that candidate organisations have a good understanding of how the <abbr title="Trade and Cooperation Agreement">TCA</abbr> impacts people across the UK and that involvement in the Domestic Advisory Group and Civil Society Forum is representative of the challenges faced by the UK’s businesses and citizens. When selecting the member organisations, geographical and regional representation will be considered.</p>

<p>Both the <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> and <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr> will have virtual participation options. This will allow organisations to be able to engage without the need to invest significant resources. The Government is currently unable to commit to financial support, but should this policy exclude some, especially smaller, organisations from being able to participate, then this will be reviewed.</p>

<h2>Diversity</h2>

<p>The Government embraces and values diversity in all forms. We welcome and pride ourselves on the positive impact diversity has on the work we do, and we promote equality of opportunity throughout the organisation. We therefore encourage applications from the widest range of qualified groups.</p>

<h2>Data protection</h2>

<p>During the application stage and if your organisation is selected to be a part of the Domestic Advisory Group or Civil Society Forum, we will need to process personal data belonging to the individual who represents your organisation. Any personal data processed will be done so in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018, for more information about how personal data is processed for this scheme, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/privacy-notice-for-expression-of-interest-for-membership-of-the-tca-domestic-advisory-group-and-civil-society-forum">view our privacy notice</a>. If you have any queries about the way your representative’s personal data will be processed, contact the FCDO’s Data Protection Officer: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Data.Protection@fcdo.gov.uk">Data.Protection@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Selection process</h2>

<p>Candidate organisations must submit a cover letter (1,000 words maximum) to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dagsecretariat@fcdo.gov.uk">dagsecretariat@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>In the cover letter, organisations should set out their reasons for applying for the Domestic Advisory Group or Civil Society Forum, or both, their suitability for membership and how they meet the requirements set out in Eligibility.</p>

<p>The expression of interest has been reopened for additional members of the <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> and participants in the <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The deadline for sending applications is 5pm on 16 September 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>Candidate organisations will be informed if they have been selected for either the <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> or <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr> or both.</p>

<p>Applications and any queries about this process should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dagsecretariat@fcdo.gov.uk">dagsecretariat@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>Following the expression of interest campaign, we will determine the updated <abbr title="Domestic Advisory Group">DAG</abbr> membership and <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr> participants list while ensuring that involvement in these groups is as balanced as it can be, including considering geographical and regional representation.</p>

<p>We will publish the outcome of the expression of interest campaign as soon as possible and before the first meeting of the <abbr title="Civil Society Forum">CSF</abbr>.</p>
