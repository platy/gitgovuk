<h2>About the scheme</h2>

<p>The Defence Employer Recognition Scheme (<abbr title="Employer Recognition Scheme">ERS</abbr>) encourages employers to support defence and inspire others to do the same. The scheme encompasses bronze, silver and gold awards for employer organisations that pledge, demonstrate or advocate support to defence and the armed forces community, and align their values with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.armedforcescovenant.gov.uk/" rel="external">Armed Forces Covenant</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Employer Recognition Scheme">ERS</abbr> is designed primarily to recognise private sector support although public sector organisations such as the emergency services, local authorities, NHS trusts and executive agencies are also eligible to be recognised.</p>

<h2>Nomination and award process</h2>

<p>Employers can sign up themselves for each award.</p>

<p>Nominations will be validated to determine the level of defence personnel employment within the nominated organisation and to check that the organisation has signed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.armedforcescovenant.gov.uk/" rel="external">Armed Forces Covenant</a>.</p>

<p>Once the nomination has been validated it will be considered by a selection board at national level for gold awards and regional level for silver awards. The selection boards will be a panel chaired by a senior military officer and they will consider each nomination against the award criteria. Organisations selected for gold and silver awards will be formally notified in writing and invited to the relevant award event.</p>
