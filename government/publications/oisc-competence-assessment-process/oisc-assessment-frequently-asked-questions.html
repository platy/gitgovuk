<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Can I have detailed feedback on my assessment?</h2>
<p>No, the OISC does not provide specific feedback to candidates as this simply is not feasible. You will receive your exam results via email with marks awarded and the percentage scored from the OISC’s Competence Assessment provider.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Can I have my paper re-marked?</h2>
<p>The OISC automatically moderates all papers that fall within an 8% (currently between 55-63%) bandwidth of Level 1 assessment pass mark and 8% (between 60%-68%) of the pass mark for Level 2 and 3 – these papers are re-assessed by a second independent marker. If your score falls outside that bandwidth whether it is a pass or fail, it is not subject to moderation and will not be re-marked</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Am I able to apply to sit the OISC Assessment without applying for registration?</h2>
<p>No, you must be applying on behalf of a new or existing regulated OISC organisation to be set up for an OISC Assessment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Who writes and marks OISC Assessments?</h2>
<p>The OISC employs a specialist Immigration Law Training organisation and their assessment team is comprised of highly skilled immigration law specialists including solicitors and immigration barristers. They are experts in their field and highly qualified in the field of immigration law.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>How do I know I my test paper has been marked fairly and objectively?</h2>
<p>OISC assessments are completely anonymised during the marking process and assessors award scores to exam scripts with no knowledge of whose answers they are marking. Level 1 multiple choice answers are automated and marked by the online system.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>What if need to postpone my assessment?</h2>
<p>All OISC applicants are expected to be ready for their assessment at the next available date upon submission of their application for registration. The Competence Statement completed by all candidates contains declarations in which you agree your readiness to the process. Postponements are only granted in unforeseen exceptional circumstances, such as for medical reasons, which must be evidenced. Unfortunately, reasons such as ‘I’m not ready and need more time to prepare’, ‘I am going on holiday/travelling abroad’, ‘I’m busy at work’ are not acceptable for postponing assessments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Can I leave my screen unattended during my online assessment?</h2>
<p>Short breaks will not automatically invalidate your assessment such as a short toilet break, but it goes without saying that you should take every measure you can to avoid taking breaks, so you have the most time available to score as highly as possible in your exam.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>I have a medical condition or special requirement that necessitates I have more time for my assessment - is this possible?</h2>
<p>Yes of course. Your OISC caseworker will request documentary evidence but we are happy to accommodate all such requests.</p>
