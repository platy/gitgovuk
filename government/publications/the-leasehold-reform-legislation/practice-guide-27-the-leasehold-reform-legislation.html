<span class="number">3. </span>Preliminaries</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Search of the index map</h3>

<p>A tenant interested in acquiring the freehold reversion of their property or extending their lease should discover at the outset whether the title to the reversionary interest or interests is registered.</p>

<p>Do this by applying for an official search of the index map. The procedure is described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/official-searches-of-the-index-map">practice guide 10: official searches of the index map</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not require indemnity provisions in respect of an index map search you could consider using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/mapsearch">MapSearch</a>. This service is available free of charge for Business e-services customers who have portal access and provides immediate search results.</p>

<p>It is inadvisable to apply for an official copy of the register without knowing the title number, as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspection-and-application-for-official-copies">practice guide 11: inspection and applications for official copies</a>, as this could result in an unwanted official copy being supplied.</p>

<p>The lessor’s title number, if shown on the register of the applicant’s title, is not always up to date. That title may of course be inspected – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-4-2">Inspection of register of superior registered titles</a> - but check the schedule of notices of leases carefully to ensure that it includes the applicant’s lease. It is not enough to check the property register description as that too may be out of date if land has been removed from the title.</p>

<p>HM Land Registry portal customers may be able to obtain all or some of the relevant title numbers by means of the property or postal description, but this is not a substitute for an official search of the index map.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Inspection of register of superior registered titles</h3>

<p>Anyone may apply for an official copy of the entries on the register, the title plan and any documents referred to in the register that are kept by the registrar. These facilities are described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspection-and-application-for-official-copies">practice guide 11: inspection and applications for official copies</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Retention of documents lodged with application forms</h3>

<p>Original documents are normally only required if your application is a first registration.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the Land Registration Rules 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> may, however, make an application for first registration on the basis of certified copy deeds and documents only. For information about this see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-registrations/practice-guide-1-first-registrations#acceptance-of-certified-copy-deeds">practice guide 1: first registrations – Applications lodged by conveyancers – acceptance of certified copy deeds</a>.</p>

<p>If your application is not a first registration then we will need only certified copies of deeds or documents you send to us with HM Land Registry applications. Once we have made a scanned copy of the documents you send to us, they will be destroyed. This applies to both originals and certified copies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Houses: enfranchisement and extension of leases under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Generally</h3>
<p>The Leasehold Reform Act 1967 confers on a tenant of a house for the last 2 years under a long tenancy at a low rent the right to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acquire, on enfranchisement, the freehold</li>
  <li>obtain an extended lease of the house and premises expiring 50 years after the date on which the existing term is due to expire – section 1AA of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 (as amended)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an additional right to enfranchisement in relation to tenancies that fail the low rent test. ‘House’ does not include flats in a horizontally divided building and ‘premises’ includes any garage, outhouse, garden, yard and appurtenances, let and occupied, and used for the purpose of the house (section 2(1) to (3) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967). ‘Long tenancy’ means any tenancy originally granted for a term exceeding 21 years whether or not it is determinable by notice or re-entry (section 3 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 (as amended)).</p>

<p>Business tenants of a house must meet a residency requirement and hold under a tenancy originally granted for 35 years or more.</p>

<p>The personal representatives of a deceased tenant now have limited rights of enfranchisement.</p>

<p>There are further conditions and exceptions that apply in particular circumstances.</p>

<p>Even if the original lease included the mines and minerals they will not be included in the enfranchisement if the landlord requires them to be excepted and provision is made for support of the property (section 2(6) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967). A note of any exception will be entered in the register.</p>

<p>There are a variety of statutory provisions that apply to enfranchisement under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. If the deed or the application does not contain a clear statement, such as that set out below, the registrar will be unable to recognise it. There are a large number of applications to register the purchase of reversions and new leases entirely unconnected with the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. If the applicant wishes to ensure that the application is completed quickly and accurately without requisitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the case of transfers, conveyances or other leases a statement along the following lines should appear prominently in the deed</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“This [transfer] [conveyance] [lease] is made under the provisions of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967”</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>in the case of a <abbr title="means any lease, granted on or after 19 June 2006, which is required by rule 58A of the Land Registration Rules 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A to the Land Registration Rules 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>, clause LR5.2 should refer to the Leasehold Reform Act 1967</li>
</ul>

<p>The low-rent test in respect of the right to enfranchise (but not the right to a lease extension) does not apply to long leases in England granted on or after 7 September 2009 unless arising from an agreement for lease made prior to 7 September 2009 (section 300 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 which came into force on 7 September 2009).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Protection of claims by notice</h3>

<p>When a tenant has given notice of their desire to have the freehold or to have an extended lease, that notice may be protected as if it were an estate contract. If the reversionary title(s) affected are registered, this may be done by application for the entry of a notice under section 34 of the Land Registration Act 2002. The tenant’s right cannot constitute an interest that overrides within Schedules 1 or 3 of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>An application for an agreed notice should be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreed-notice-registration-an1">form AN1</a> together with a certified copy of the notice (which will be filed at HM Land Registry). We will make the following entry in the charges register:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“Notice entered pursuant to section 5(5) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 that a notice dated <strong>__</strong>_ has been served under that Act by <strong>__</strong>_ of <strong>__</strong>_</p>

<p>NOTE: Copy filed.”</p>
</div>

<p>Alternatively, application may be made for a unilateral notice by applying in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-application-to-enter-un1">form UN1</a>.</p>

<p>If any of the reversionary titles affected are unregistered, the notice may be protected by a class C (iv) entry at the Land Charges Department.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Enfranchisement</h3>
<p>On completion of the acquisition of the freehold title application should be made in the usual way for registration of the transfer if the title is already registered, or for the first registration of the land if it is not.</p>

<p>If the tenant’s or any superior leasehold interest is to be merged in the freehold, a request for merger should be included in the application as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#merger">Merger of leases on acquisition of the freehold</a>.</p>

<p>Where a deed of substituted security transferring a legal charge on a merged lease to the freehold is lodged the charge will normally be registered against the freehold title. If the charge is only to be noted lodge <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreed-notice-registration-an1">form AN1</a>  or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-application-to-enter-un1">form UN1</a> , depending on whether the application is for an agreed or a unilateral notice.</p>

<p>Note: Where 2 or more charges are being registered their priorities must be clearly apparent. The following special provisions apply on the acquisition of the freehold of the house and will be reflected on the register.</p>

<h4>4.3.1	Rights and burdens passing under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967</h4>

<p>Section 10(2) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 provides that certain rights that affect the leasehold interest shall automatically continue on enfranchisement for and against the freehold but without prejudice to any rights that may be expressly granted or reserved.</p>

<p>The rights passing under section 10(2) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 that take effect “so far as the landlord is capable of granting them” are rights of support, rights of access of light and air and rights to the passage, use or maintenance of the usual common services, such as water, gas or other piped fuel, drainage, electricity, telephone and so on.</p>

<p>Entries will always be made in the register in respect of the land transferred, whether or not the lease is merged.</p>

<p>In the property register either:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The land <strong>__</strong>_ has the benefit of such easements and rights as the <strong>__ dated __</strong>_ referred to in the Charges Register has had the effect of granting by virtue of section 10(2)(i) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967<em>__</em>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Or:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The land <strong>___ has the benefit of such easements and rights as the __</strong>_ dated <strong>__ referred to above has had the effect of granting by virtue of section 10(2)(i) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967</strong>___.”</p>
</div>

<p>If the conveyance or transfer expressly excludes or restricts any of the appurtenant rights which would otherwise be deemed to pass by statutory implication, this will be reflected at the end of the above entry.</p>

<p>In the charges register either:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The land <strong>___ is subject to such easements and rights as by a __</strong> dated <strong>___ made between __</strong>_it was made subject to by virtue of section 10(2)(ii) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967.”</p>
</div>

<p>Or:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The land <strong>___ is subject to such easements and rights as by the __</strong> dated _____ referred to above it was made subject to by virtue of section 10(2)(ii) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967.”</p>
</div>

<p>No reference will normally be made to any deed (whether it be the lease or otherwise) that contains a grant or reservation of rights granted by virtue of section 10(2) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. If, however, specific application is made an entry will be made in either the property or charges register as follows:</p>

<p>In the property register:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“In relation to the effect of section 10(2)(i) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 a lease/transfer/deed dated <strong>__</strong> made between _____ granted/reserved the following rights [or rights of drainage, or as the case may be].”</p>
</div>

<p>In the charges register:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“In relation to the effect of section 10(2)(ii) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 a lease/transfer/deed dated <strong>__</strong> made between _____ granted/reserved the following rights [or rights of drainage, or as the case may be].”</p>
</div>

<p>If the conveyance or transfer expressly excludes or restricts any of the appurtenant rights which would otherwise be deemed to pass by statutory implication, an entry of this provision will be made in the property register.</p>

<p>If the conveyance or transfer contains new easements or restrictive covenants under section 10(3) and (4) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, entries relating to them will be made in the register in accordance with normal practice.</p>

<p>Applicants should ensure that either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an application is also made against the servient title if the reversion over which the easement is granted is registered in the name of the landlord but under a different title to that of the house</li>
  <li>good title is deduced where the land is unregistered</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a transfer of part of a registered title is made pursuant to the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, the rights created under section 10(2) will call for entries to be made on the transferor’s title as well.</p>

<p>Where the transferor’s title comprises no more than 3 properties specific entries on the lines of those referred to above will be made, but where it comprises more properties an entry in the following terms will be made in the property register:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“Such transfers of the parts edged and numbered in green on the title plan as were made under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 took effect with the benefit of and subject to easements and other rights as prescribed by section 10(2) of that Act”</p>
</div>

<h4>4.3.2	Discharge of charges on landlord’s estate (whether registered or unregistered)</h4>

<p>No difficulty will arise if any registered or noted charge or any mortgage against the landlord’s title can be discharged or released in the normal way when the tenant acquires the freehold. However, the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 provides additional mechanisms for the discharges of charges or mortgages where necessary, which may mean that the conventional evidence or receipt may be inappropriate. The following paragraphs describe what evidence will be accepted in these cases.</p>

<p>The purchasing tenant may have paid sufficient money to the landlord’s mortgagee direct in order to discharge the land from the mortgage (section 12 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967). If the mortgagee has accepted payment of the whole or a sufficient part of the purchase money in full discharge of the property from their mortgage, a copy of the receipt, so worded, must be lodged with the application.</p>

<p>If the money has been paid into court under section 13 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, the tenant must supply a copy of the affidavit which they will have made for that purpose, and also a copy of the court’s official receipt.</p>

<p>We may serve a notice after the application for registration has been lodged. The notice will be served on the registered mortgagee and any other party appearing by the register to have an interest in the mortgage, and will give details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the mortgage</li>
  <li>the applicants and the nature of the application</li>
  <li>the intended closure of the relevant part of the title if the transfer is of part</li>
  <li>how any objection to the application can be made</li>
</ul>

<p>If no reply to the notice is received within the time allowed, registration will be completed free from any reference to the charge. If the mortgagee shows prima facie grounds for objection in reply to the notice (for example, because an insufficient part of the purchase money has been paid into court), it may be agreed that the entry of the mortgage will remain on the register of the purchaser’s title until proper evidence of a full discharge is produced, or the matter is otherwise settled.</p>

<h4>4.3.3	Landlord’s estate subject to a rentcharge</h4>

<p>The transfer or conveyance will normally take effect subject to any pre-existing rentcharges affecting the title (sections 8(2) and (4)(b) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 (as amended by section 17(1) and Schedule 1, paragraph 4 of the Rentcharges Act 1977). However, where the rentcharge is more than the amount payable as rent under the lease, the tenant can require the landlord to discharge the house and premises from the rentcharge to the extent of the excess. Where difficulties arise in paying the redemption price, provision is made for payment into court (section 11(4) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967). The evidence we require for the discharge of the rentcharge will be similar to that mentioned in <a class="govuk-link" href="#discharge">Discharge of charges on landlord’s estate (whether registered or unregistered)</a>.</p>

<p>The landlord may procure a release of the rentcharge from the rentcharge owner. The normal conveyancing evidence will be required including the production of any relevant certificates.  Alternatively the landlord may require that the rentcharge shall be charged exclusively on other land so as to exonerate the land conveyed or else that it shall be apportioned, subject to the reasonable consent of the tenant (section 11(1) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 (as amended by the  section 17(1) and Schedule 1, paragraph 4(2) of the Rentcharges Act 1977)). The normal conveyancing evidence of formal or informal exoneration or apportionment must be produced.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Extended leases</h3>
<p>Because the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 allows individual leaseholders to acquire the freehold of their properties, few applications for registration of extended leases under that Act have been received. However, since the provisions are still available for use, and if used can create difficulties for us, applications for registration of such leases are dealt with in the following paragraphs.</p>

<h4>4.4.1	Registration of new lease – HM Land Registry requirements</h4>

<p>On completion of the acquisition of a new lease granted in substitution for an existing lease pursuant to section 14 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, make an application for registration of the lease. If necessary, also lodge an application to give effect on the register to the deemed surrender of the existing lease which will have taken place by operation of law.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2: applications for registration of extended leases</a> explains HM Land Registry’s requirements in connection with these applications.</p>

<h4>4.4.2	Entries in the register</h4>

<p>Where appropriate, the following entry will be made on the new title:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The land is subject to such rights as may be subsisting in favour of the persons interested under a Charge dated <strong>___ and made between __</strong>_of the leasehold interest under a Lease dated <strong>__</strong> in substitution of which, pursuant to the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, the registered lease was granted.”</p>
</div>

<p>If it is not possible to make the type of entry described above, for example because the original lease is unregistered and no evidence as to any mortgages affecting it has been produced, the following entry will be made:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The land is subject to such rights as may be subsisting in favour of the persons interested under any charge of the leasehold interest under a Lease dated _____ in substitution for which pursuant to the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, the registered lease was granted.”</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Sub-leases</h3>

<p>There are complicated provisions in Schedule 1 to the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 to determine which lessor is to act as reversioner on behalf of all the lessors where there are sub-leases.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the sub-lessee does not necessarily have to serve the notice under section 5 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 on all persons interested (see Schedule 3, paragraph 8 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Miscellaneous</h3>

<h4>4.6.1	Consent by Charity Commissioners not required</h4>

<p>Where the landlord’s title is held by a charity then the transfer or lease will not be affected by any restriction in the register in Form E to Schedule 4 to the Land Registration Rules 2003. However, any disposition of registered or unregistered land must contain the appropriate statement and where the lease is a <abbr title="means any lease, granted on or after 19 June 2006, which is required by rule 58A of the Land Registration Rules 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A to the Land Registration Rules 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>, the statement must be included in clause LR5.1.</p>

<h4>4.6.2	Rights of future development and pre-emption</h4>

<p>On enfranchisement or extension of a lease, certain landlords including local authorities and the Commission for the New Towns may require the tenant to enter into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>covenants to restrain the tenant from developing or clearing the land in case the lessor may need it for future development</li>
  <li>a covenant that they will not grant a tenancy of the property without the consent of the landlord and that they will not sell it without first offering it to the landlord</li>
</ul>

<p>We will make an appropriate entry in the register if a conveyance, transfer, or extended lease contains covenants of this nature (Schedule 4, paragraph 1(3) of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 as amended).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Flats: enfranchisement and extension of leases of flats under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Generally</h3>

<p>Part I of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 gives qualifying tenants of flats either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a collective right to buy the freehold of the block (collective enfranchisement) if the flats are contained in premises that satisfy certain conditions</li>
  <li>an individual right to a new lease expiring 90 years after the termination of an existing lease</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these rights can be exercised when the National Trust owns any interest or when the flat is within the precinct of a cathedral. A precinct is defined under the Care of Cathedrals Measure 1990 by reference to the plans kept by the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England. Where the Crown is not the immediate landlord but is a superior landlord, then, in some cases, there will be a right to a new lease (section 94 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Tenants’ right to collective enfranchisement</h3>

<h4>5.2.1	Generally</h4>

<p>This is the right of tenants to acquire the freehold of their block whether or not the landlord wishes to sell.</p>

<p>The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 lays down a framework within which negotiations take place with the aim of entering into a contract for sale in the normal way. The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 does not contain any provision for the grant of statutory easements, unlike the 1967 Act described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#houses">Houses: enfranchisement and extension of leases under the Leasehold Reform Act 1967</a>. Instead, the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 says that the parties must include in the conveyance or transfer any necessary easements such as rights of support, so the parties have to decide what is required in their particular situation.</p>

<p>In acquiring the freehold any intermediate lease between the tenants’ leases and the freehold is also acquired. This means that even if the tenants already have a flat management company holding an intermediate lease, that lease will be acquired under section 2(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. It would not appear that there is any way this can be avoided since section 2(1)(a) and (2) appear to be mandatory.</p>

<p>In these circumstances the tenants should perhaps consider not using the procedure in the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.</p>

<p>Where tenants acquire the premises outside the legislation by independent negotiation the provisions of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 do not apply.</p>

<p>It is therefore a requirement that the conveyance or transfer must contain a statement in the following terms where the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 procedure is used:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“This conveyance [or transfer] is executed for the purposes of Chapter I of Part I of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.” (section 34(10) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 and rule 196 of the Land Registration Rules 2003)</p>
</div>

<p>Chapter I of Part I of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 confers on qualifying tenants of flats the right to have the freehold of the premises in which the flats are contained acquired on their behalf by a person appointed by them for the purpose.</p>

<p>A person so appointed is known as the nominee purchaser (section 1 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993).</p>

<p>A person is a qualifying tenant if they are a tenant under a long lease for a term exceeding 21 years.</p>

<h4>5.2.2	Protection of tenants’ rights – notices</h4>

<p>The procedures whereby qualifying tenants assert their collective rights to have the freehold acquired are outside the scope of this guide except for the requirement for signing under section 99(5)(a) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6-4">Notices</a> for the procedure for protecting a notice of claim to exercise such rights.</p>

<h4>5.2.3	Completion of acquisition</h4>

<p>When all matters have been agreed between the parties, or otherwise resolved, a binding contract is entered into for the acquisition of the freehold and superior leasehold interests by the nominee purchaser with the reversioner (section 34(2) and Schedule 1, paragraph 6(1)(b)(ii) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). Precisely who is the reversioner may be complex, particularly where there are intermediate leasehold titles.</p>

<p>The acquisition is then completed by a conveyance or transfer of the freehold to the nominee purchaser, subject only to such incumbrances as may have been agreed or determined. The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 makes provision for the kind of matters that should be included in any sale without being prescriptive as to their exact content. Where the purchase involves the acquisition of a superior leasehold interest, title will need to be deduced if it is not registered to all interests acquired, as will title to land over which any party grants easements in favour of the land acquired by the nominee purchaser. Where the leasehold or freehold interests or any adjacent land over which easements are granted are registered, application against the respective titles is required.</p>

<p>If the freeholder is granting easements and the land over which they are being granted is held in lease by a leaseholder, part of whose interest is also being sold to the nominee purchaser, for the easements to be effective as against that leaseholder the leaseholder will have to be a party to the grant of the freehold easements so that they are binding on it during the term of the lease. This will involve an entry being made on the leaseholder’s title so that subsequent owners will have notice of the rights.</p>

<p>The conveyance or transfer is effective to overreach any incumbrances that are capable of being overreached (section 34(3) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993), which means most incumbrances that would be overreached on a sale at arm’s length. The main exception is some rentcharges that are covered below. Mortgages on the freehold or intermediate titles are also discussed later.</p>

<p>The person who executes the transfer or conveyance will normally be the freeholder, whom the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 designates as the reversioner. Where there are intermediate leasehold titles the reversioner will act on behalf of the other landlords in the transfer or conveyance and execute the deed on their behalf, although they should be described as being parties to the deed for the purpose of the sale and any concurrence to the grant of easements or other rights (Schedule 1, paragraph 6(1)(iii) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). However, the other landlords can opt out of this procedure and can transfer or convey the interest themselves, as indeed can the nominee purchaser (Schedule 1, paragraph 7 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993).</p>

<p>Where an intermediate leasehold title is unregistered it would be advisable for a note of any transfer of part or grant of an easement to be endorsed on the lease.</p>

<p>The registrar will assume where an intermediate landlord is described as party to the transfer that no opt out has taken place. However, if the transfer is silent a requisition will be raised requiring a separate transfer, conveyance or assignment of the intermediate interest.</p>

<p>Where the reversioner, being the person making the transfer to the nominee purchaser, is shown on the title as the registered proprietor of the freehold or is shown as having the legal estate in fee simple absolute in an unregistered title, no further evidence as to the power of the reversioner to convey the block will be needed. Where, however, the court has appointed any other person to be the reversioner a certified copy of the court order will be required. A person so appointed acts as if they were the freehold reversioner (Schedule 1, Part I of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993).</p>

<h4>5.2.4	Registration of nominee purchaser</h4>

<p>The nominee purchaser can be any person or persons (which includes a company) appointed by the participating tenants. Although the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 calls the purchaser a ‘nominee’ it may well be the case that they are not in fact a nominee at law. If a company or other body corporate is used as a vehicle to buy the land it seems likely that the company will be beneficially entitled with the qualifying tenants exercising their rights through their shareholding. Whether the nominee purchaser is a true nominee or perhaps some other type of trustee, an application for a suitable restriction should accompany the application for registration of the nominee purchaser.</p>

<p>Note: The registrar will not enter a restriction unless one is applied for appropriately or the Land Registration Act 2002 or the Land Registration Rules 2003 otherwise require it.</p>

<p>In almost all cases the existing tenants’ leases will be incumbrances to which the sale is subject. Counterparts of these leases - and any new lease back - must be produced with the application if they are not already noted as incumbrances in the charges register of the title affected by the sale.</p>

<p>Subject to the points mentioned in this section, the application should be made in the usual way in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a> depending on whether the reversioner’s title is registered or unregistered. Applications for merger of an intermediate lease with the freehold should be dealt with in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1: merger of leases of acquisition of the freehold</a>.</p>

<h4>5.2.5	Unpaid vendor’s lien</h4>

<p>A vendor’s lien is capable of arising on the transfer to the nominee purchaser, where an amount remains outstanding in any of the following categories (section 32(2) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993):</p>

<ul>
  <li>the price payable</li>
  <li>amounts due from tenants (not just those who are participating in the purchase) in respect of their leases or under or in respect of agreements collateral thereto</li>
  <li>any amount payable to the vendor by virtue of section 18(2) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (where the valuation has been reduced by a failure of the nominee purchaser to reveal the existence of a relevant agreement or shareholding)</li>
  <li>any costs payable by the nominee purchaser (section 33 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993)</li>
</ul>

<p>The lien is not capable of substantive registration, but can be the subject of an application for protection by way of notice in the register. However, since the lien does not arise automatically, but depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, we will take no action except on receipt of a specific application to note the lien.</p>

<h4>5.2.6	Discharge of mortgages on the landlord’s estate (and any leaseholder’s estate that is being acquired) on transfer to the nominee purchaser (whether registered or unregistered)</h4>

<p>It is preferable for any registered or noted charge or any mortgage against the landlord’s title or any intermediate lessee’s title to be discharged, cancelled or receipted in the normal way when the tenant acquires the freehold. This is because, despite the provisions of section 35 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 referred to below, it will never be clear that its provisions apply unless the money has been paid into court because of the severely limiting effect of Schedule 8, paragraph 2 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (duty of nominee purchaser to redeem mortgages).</p>

<p>Unless a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mortgage-cancellation-of-entries-for-lenders-ds1">form DS1</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mortgage-release-of-part-of-the-land-for-lenders-ds3">form DS3</a>, Electronic Discharge, application to cancel a notice, or evidence of payment into court is produced with the application, the registrar will either requisition for a statutory declaration or statement of truth serve notice where possible on the person having the benefit of the mortgage or charge.</p>

<p>The following describes what evidence will be satisfactory for our purposes and what action we will take.</p>

<p>The transfer or conveyance has the effect of discharging all the land acquired, including any intermediate leasehold interest, from any charge on it without the mortgagee or chargee having to execute the transfer or conveyance or becoming parties to the conveyance (section 35(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). The parties can, however, agree that the land will be subject to the mortgage. If the parties intend this to happen then the transfer or conveyance should make this absolutely clear, otherwise the charges may be cancelled.</p>

<p>The nominee purchaser may have paid sufficient money to the landlord’s chargee direct in order to discharge the land from the charge. If the chargee has accepted payment of the whole, or a sufficient part of the purchase money, in full discharge of the property from the charge, a copy of the receipt must be lodged with the application.</p>

<p>If the money has been paid into court under section 35 and Schedule 8 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, the purchaser must supply a copy of the affidavit or statement of truth, which they will have made to the court for that purpose, and also a copy of the court’s official receipt. We may serve notice of the application on the registered chargee and any other person appearing by the register to be interested in the charge.</p>

<p>It will give details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the charge</li>
  <li>the applicants and the nature of the application</li>
  <li>the intended closure of the relevant part of the title where it is a transfer of part</li>
  <li>how any objection to the application can be made</li>
</ul>

<p>If no reply to the notice is received within the time allowed, registration will be completed free from any reference to the charge.</p>

<p>If the chargee shows prima facie grounds for objection in reply to the notice, for example because an insufficient part of the purchase money has been paid into court, it may be agreed that the entry of the charge will remain on the register of the purchaser’s title until proper evidence of a full discharge is produced or the matter is otherwise settled.</p>

<h4>5.2.7	Landlord’s estate subject to a rentcharge</h4>

<p>The transfer or conveyance will normally take effect subject to any pre-existing rentcharge affecting the title (section 34(6) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). The landlord may procure a release of the rentcharge from the rentcharge owner. The normal conveyancing evidence will be required.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the landlord may require, subject to the reasonable consent of the tenant (section 34(8) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993), that the rentcharge shall be charged exclusively on other land so as to exonerate the land conveyed or else that it shall be apportioned. The normal conveyancing evidence of formal or informal exoneration or apportionment must be produced.</p>

<h4>5.2.8	Lease back to the former freeholder</h4>

<p>On acquiring the freehold in the whole of the building the nominee purchaser is required in certain circumstances to grant leases back to the former freeholder of those units or flats in the building not leased by the qualifying tenants and which they are not acquiring. Such leases will be for terms of 999 years at a peppercorn rent (section 36 and Schedule 9 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993).</p>

<p>The application for registration of such a lease must be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a> depending on whether the reversioner’s title is registered. Furthermore, the position with regard to the status of the lease will differ depending on whether or not the freehold is already registered.</p>

<h5>Registered freehold</h5>

<p>The new lease will be a disposition of registered land and will therefore take effect in equity only until registered. It would seem that the potential lessee is a purchaser within the meaning of rule 131 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 in order to be able to make a protecting search. Since the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 provides that the nominee purchaser must grant the lease back, the transaction is one where any contemporaneous mortgagee of the freehold will be subject to the right to a new lease. An official search will secure the priority to which the intended lessee is entitled.</p>

<p>The lessee should also make the nature of the transaction clear in a letter accompanying the application for registration.  This is because, since the lessee has no control over the timing of the application for registration of the freehold disposal, it is possible that the application for registration of the lease will be made before that of the freehold. It will then appear that the freeholder is attempting to grant a lease to themselves which is not possible, and we would reject the application. Where this ‘mistiming’ occurs we will hold the leasehold application, but when we receive the application for the freehold transfer it will be entered on the day list of pending applications and the leasehold application will then be re-entered on the day list after the transfer so that the priorities are correct.</p>

<h5>Unregistered land</h5>

<p>Where the freehold is unregistered it will be subject to first registration and the new lease will take effect as a legal estate whether or not the purchaser makes the application for registration before the new lease application is lodged. Again, it would be helpful if there could be an accompanying letter setting out the circumstances. When the freehold application is lodged the application should reveal the existence of the lease back and the counterpart should be lodged with the application.</p>

<p>The usual conveyancing evidence of the freehold title will be required including the appropriate Land Charges searches.</p>

<h4>5.2.9	Vesting orders</h4>

<p>Chapter I of Part I of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 gives power to the court to make vesting orders where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the terms of acquisition are in dispute</li>
  <li>there is a failure to enter into a contract (section 24 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993)</li>
  <li>the reversioner fails to give a counter-notice (section 25 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993) or cannot be found or identified (section 26 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993)</li>
</ul>

<p>As to the protection of such orders see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6-4-2">Vesting orders made under sections 26(1) or 50(1), 1993 Act (where the relevant landlord cannot be found or identified</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6-4-3">Orders made under sections 24, 25, 48 or 49, 1993 Act (where there is a dispute)</a>.</p>

<h4>5.2.10	Variation of flat leases</h4>

<p>Nothing in the collective enfranchisement procedure has any effect on the length of the tenants’ leases. Where the tenants wish to take advantage of their new found freedom to ‘extend’ their leases they may do so by agreement, or possibly by exercising rights under Chapter II, Part I of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. They should, however, be aware of the traps the law contains in this area and note HM Land Registry’s requirements in connection with the voluntary extension of leases as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extension-of-leases">practice guide 28: extension of leases</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Right of a tenant to acquire a new lease</h3>

<p>Chapter II, Part I of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 confers on a qualifying tenant of a flat for the last 2 years an individual right to acquire a new lease of the flat on payment of a premium determined in accordance with a statutory formula.  A person is a qualifying tenant if they are (subject to certain exceptions) a tenant under a long lease of a flat (section 39(3) of the the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). The right is suspended if the tenants collectively seek to buy the freehold.</p>

<p>As a result of the decision in Cadogan &amp; Ors v 26 Cadogan Square Ltd, Howard de Walden Estates Ltd v Aggio &amp; Ors [2008] UKHL 44, a head lessee is entitled under the the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 to an extended lease of an individual flat which comprises part of the land demised by the head lease. This guide should be read and interpreted accordingly.</p>

<p>If a qualifying tenant transfers their existing lease after serving notice of their claim to a new lease under the 1993 Act, they may also assign the benefit of that notice. Where this occurs, the transferee will be entitled to take the grant of the new lease in place of the qualifying tenant, if the benefit of the notice was assigned contemporaneously with the transfer of the existing lease, whether in the transfer or in a separate document.</p>

<h4>5.3.1	Procedure on tenant’s claim to new lease</h4>

<p>The procedures whereby a qualifying tenant asserts their claim to a new lease are beyond the scope of this guide except for the requirement for signing under section 99(5)(a) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. The procedure for protecting a notice of claim to exercise such a right is discussed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6-4">Notices</a>.</p>

<h4>5.3.2	Terms of the new lease</h4>

<p>The new lease, which takes effect in substitution for the existing lease, will be for a term expiring 90 years after the term date of the existing lease at the rent of a peppercorn (section 56(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). The new lease is to be on the same terms as the existing lease but with such modifications as may be required or appropriate (section 57 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993).</p>

<p>Although the right is a right to have a new lease of the land demised to the tenant, under the existing lease it is clear that variations in extent and in the rights granted are permitted (section 57(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). Very careful examination of the extents of any existing flats and of the terms of easements will therefore be required to ensure that the landlord has power to grant the new lease. It is quite likely that some new leases will not be of the same extent, since over a long period there are informal arrangements between tenants that ‘vary’ the terms of their leases in practice. This may cause problems on the grant of new leases, for example the switching of use of car parking spaces, dustbin areas and other common facilities. Landlords will need to ensure that the extent granted and the terms of the new lease (including any easements) are compatible with any other leases that exist.</p>

<h4>5.3.3	Statement to be contained in new lease</h4>

<p>The lease must contain a statement in the following terms:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“This lease is granted under section 56 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.” (section 57(11) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 and rule 196 of the Land Registration Rules 2003).</p>
</div>

<p>Where the lease is a <abbr title="means any lease, granted on or after 19 June 2006, which is required by rule 58A of the Land Registration Rules 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A to the Land Registration Rules 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>, this statement must be inserted in clause LR5.1 or reference made to the clause, paragraph or schedule in the lease that contains this statement in full.</p>

<p>If the lease does not contain such a statement the registrar will assume that it is not made pursuant to the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. Although there is no prescribed form of statement where the lease is granted under section 93(4) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (leases granted on terms approved by the court), it would be helpful if it did contain such a statement because of the consequences that flow from that section as mentioned in the following paragraphs. In those circumstances a certified copy of the court order under that section should also be produced.</p>

<h4>5.3.4	Reversionary titles</h4>

<p>If the qualifying tenant’s immediate landlord does not have a sufficient interest (that is, they are not the freeholder and do not have a leasehold interest of sufficient duration to enable them to grant a new lease), the new lease will be granted by the nearest landlord whose interest is sufficient, and they will be the ‘competent landlord’ for the purposes of section 40(1) and (2) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. The intermediate landlord’s title may be registered but the competent landlord’s title unregistered.</p>

<p>The early identification of the competent landlord is important in order to determine what evidence of their title to grant the lease is required (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2: applications for registration of extended leases</a>).</p>

<p>This raises certain problems in relation to an existing intermediate lease.</p>

<h5>The competent landlord’s title</h5>

<p>The new lease will be a disposition by the competent landlord. If the competent landlord’s title is registered, the following note will be made in the schedule of notice of leases:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“NOTE: The lease was made under the provisions of section 56 or 93(4) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.”</p>
</div>

<p>If a lease that includes the flat is noted on the competent landlord’s title then an additional entry will be made against it along the following lines:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The lease dated <strong>___ to __</strong>___ [referred to above] was deemed to have been surrendered and regranted following the grant of a lease or leases under section 56 or 93(4) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 with the effect provided for by paragraph 10 of Schedule 11 to that Act.”</p>
</div>

<p>Applicants and their advisers will need to consider what conveyancing evidence and memoranda, if any, should be endorsed on or placed with the deeds.</p>

<h5>Intermediate leasehold title(s)</h5>

<p>Section 40(3) and Schedule 11 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 make special provision for the situation where there are intermediate leases.</p>

<p>An intermediate lessor has a reversionary interest which does not have enough years left to grant a new lease. There may be more than one intermediate lessor. The right to grant the new lease is vested only in the competent landlord but the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 provides that any intermediate lease is deemed to have been surrendered and regranted. This is a device to ensure that the integrity of intermediate leases of the whole block and any service charge arrangements contained in them are preserved. The registrar has concluded that this provision does not have the effect of actually effecting a surrender and regrant that would require intermediate lessees to apply for the closure of their title and an application to register it again. The intermediate lessor is bound by the terms of the new lease as it is granted pursuant to a statutory power. Notice that the new lease has been registered should be served on any registered intermediate lessor.</p>

<p>An entry will be made in the property register along the following lines:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The registered lease is deemed to have been surrendered and regranted following the grant of a lease or leases under section 56 or 93(4) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 with the effect specified in paragraph 10 of Schedule 11 to that Act.”</p>
</div>

<p>Any lease granted under these provisions will be noted in the schedule of notice of leases and a note to the entry will be made along the following lines:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“NOTE: This lease was granted under the provisions of section 56 or 93(4) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 and the provisions of paragraph 10 of Schedule 11 to that Act apply.”</p>
</div>

<p>The only circumstance where these provisions in relation to intermediate leases do not apply is where an intermediate lease is owned by the tenant or is held on trust for them (Schedule 11, paragraph 10(3) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). Where this is the case the tenant’s application will need to make this clear and include an application to close (perhaps as to part) any registered title affected, since the effect of the grant of the new lease is to bring about the immediate surrender of the intermediate lease.</p>

<h4>5.3.5	Registration of new lease – HM Land Registry requirements</h4>

<p>When a new lease is acquired in substitution for an existing lease, pursuant to section 56 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, make an application for registration of the lease. If necessary also lodge an application to give effect to the deemed surrender of the existing lease, which will have taken place by operation of law. <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-2">Appendix 2: application for registration of extended leases</a> explains our requirements in connection with these applications.</p>

<h4>5.3.6	Entries in the register</h4>

<p>The following entry will be made in the property register immediately after the entry relating to the registered lease:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The registered lease was granted under the provisions of section 56 or 93(4) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.”</p>
</div>

<p>The reason for this entry is that under section 56 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, if the registered proprietor grants a new long lease out of the title the subtenant has no right to claim a new lease from the competent landlord under that act.</p>

<p>Where a charge is brought forward from the surrendered leasehold estate, its date of registration will be that of the application to register the new lease. The following entry will be made on the registration or re-registration of the charge.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“This charge, [which] takes effect against this title under the provisions of section 58(4) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, [was formerly registered against title number(s)_____ ]”</p>
</div>

<p>If the charge is merely being noted, there will be an entry on similar lines:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“This charge, [which] takes effect against this title under the provisions of section 58(4) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, [was formerly noted against title number(s)<strong>__</strong> ]”</p>
</div>

<p>Unless postponed, all charges and other entries brought forward will have the same priority as they had on the old title - see section 58A of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, inserted by the Housing Act 1996.</p>

<h4>5.3.7	Possession of lease and certificate where mortgagee held deeds of surrendered lease</h4>

<p>Where a new lease takes effect subject to a mortgage and the mortgagee is at that time entitled to possession of title documents relating to the surrendered lease, the mortgagee becomes similarly entitled to possession of the documents of title relating to the new lease. In such a case, the tenant is bound to deliver the new lease to the mortgagee within 1 month of the date on which it is received from HM Land Registry following its registration.</p>

<h4>5.3.8	Vesting orders</h4>

<p>Under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, the court has power to make vesting orders where the terms of acquisition are in dispute or there is failure to enter into a lease (section 48) or where the reversioner fails to give a counter-notice (section 49) or cannot be found or identified (section 50). As to the protection of such orders see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6-4-2">Vesting orders made under section 26(1) or 50(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6-4-3">Orders made under sections 24, 25, 48 or 49 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (where there is a dispute)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Notices</h3>

<h4>5.4.1	Notice of claim to exercise right of collective enfranchisement or right to a new lease</h4>

<p>The extended period over which negotiations will often take place under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 makes it very desirable that the rights of the parties are protected in the register. The general rule is that registration by the tenants or tenant will be against the title of the freeholder or, in the case of a tenant claiming a new lease, against the competent landlord who may or may not be the freeholder. However, it may also be desirable to register against other persons as well and this section considers when this might be done.</p>

<p>Under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, any right of a tenant arising from a notice given under section 13 (notice by qualifying tenants of flats of claim to exercise the right of collective enfranchisement) or section 42 (notice by qualifying tenant of a flat of claim to exercise the right to a new lease) - ‘the 1993 Act notice’ - is not an interest with overriding status within the meaning of the Land Registration Act 2002 but may be protected on the register by a notice as if it were an estate contract (section 97(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993).</p>

<p>If an application is made to enter an agreed notice under rule 81 of the Land Registration Rules 2003, the evidence in support should normally consist of a certified copy of the notice (which will be filed).</p>

<p>It is important that the signing requirements in section 99(5)(a) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, as amended by the Housing (Wales) Act 2014, are followed. The Leasehold Reform (Amendment) Act 2014 (repealed on 1 December 2014) applied different requirements between 13 May 2014 and 1 December 2014 for England and Wales.</p>

<p>Where the property is in England, a notice given before 13 May 2014 must be signed personally by each of the tenants or, as the case may be, by the tenant by whom it is given. On and after this date tenants are excluded from this requirement, and so someone else may sign the notice on their behalf.</p>

<p>Where the property is in Wales, a notice given before 1 December 2014 must always be signed personally by each of the tenants or, as the case may be, by the tenant by whom it is given. On and after this date tenants are excluded from this requirement, and so someone else may sign the notice on their behalf.</p>

<p>The entry in the charges register will be as follows:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“Notice entered pursuant to section 97(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 that a notice dated <strong>__</strong> has been served under section 13 [or 42] of that Act by <strong>__</strong>__ of <strong>__</strong>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Copy filed.”</p>
</div>

<p>If the application is for a unilateral notice the statement or <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the Land Registration Rules 2003)">conveyancer</abbr>’s certificate given in form UN1 will need to state that a notice was served by or on behalf of the beneficiary on the registered proprietor (who should be named) in accordance with sections 13 or 42 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 on a stated date.</p>

<h4>5.4.2	Vesting orders made under sections 26(1) or 50(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (where the relevant landlord cannot be found or identified)</h4>

<p>The Land Registration Act 2002 applies to such an order as it applies to an order affecting land that is made by the court to enforce a judgment (section 97(2)(a) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). You can, therefore, apply for such an order or application to the court for such an order to be protected by notice. A person who has applied for such an order who applies for a restriction in Form N to Schedule 4 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 and a person who has obtained an order who applies for a restriction in Form L or N is regarded as having sufficient interest to apply for the restriction (rules 93(q) and (o) of the Land Registration Rules 2003 respectively).</p>

<h4>5.4.3	Orders made under sections 24, 25, 48 or 49 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 (where there is a dispute)</h4>

<p>There are no express provisions in the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 relating to the protection of such an order or an application to the court for such an order. However, in view of its nature, such an order or application to the court for such an order can be protected by a notice.</p>

<h4>5.4.4	Protection against persons other than the freeholder or competent landlord</h4>

<h5>Collective enfranchisement</h5>

<p>The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 provides that, after any initial notice has been served and registered, the freeholder cannot “make any disposal severing his interest in the premises or” in any property specified in the notice nor may they grant certain leases. Similarly, any intermediate lessee cannot grant certain leases, although the leasehold interest itself can be sold or mortgaged (section 19(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). Any such grant or disposal that contravenes section 19(1) is void.</p>

<p>Where the registrar is uncertain whether or not a disposition is caught by these provisions, they will require a certificate to be given by the solicitors to the freeholder or intermediate lessee (as the case may be) that the transaction is not one to which the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 applies. This includes any disposition by a mortgagee under any power of sale. For these reasons, the registrar considers that the nominee purchaser should apply against all titles affected by the notice, not just that of the reversioner. Where any interest is not registered, a land charge should be registered.</p>

<h5>Individual new flat leases</h5>

<p>A tenant’s notice severely restricts the right of the landlord and competent landlord to terminate the tenant’s lease (Schedule 12 to the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). Since it would seem undesirable for a purchaser from an intermediate lessee to be unaware of the position of the tenant, such a tenant should consider protecting the notice on any intermediate landlord’s title, or at the Land Charges Department.</p>

<h5>Generally</h5>

<p>The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 makes considerable provision for the service of notices or counter notices. Most of these would not seem to be pending land actions. However, where there are specific applications to the court or to a tribunal it would seem that they very well may be, for example an application to the court to defeat a tenant’s claim on the grounds of redevelopment under section 47(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. In those cases reversioners, intermediate landlords and tenants should consider carefully against whom the registration should be made.</p>

<h4>5.4.5	Cancellation generally</h4>

<p>Application for cancellation should be made in either <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-cancellation-cn1">form CN1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-cancellation-un4">form UN4</a> and an application to remove a unilateral notice should be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-application-to-remove-un2">form UN2</a>. In accordance with normal HM Land Registry practice, there will be no automatic cancellation of notices where an application is received to register a transfer of the freehold or new lease. Where the notice under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 was protected by a caution, a withdrawal in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdraw-a-caution-application-wct">form WCT</a> should be lodged.</p>

<h4>5.4.6	Later application to register a disposition where a notice made under section 13 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 is protected in the register</h4>

<p>Any application to register a disposition must include a certificate that the disposition is not one involving a disposal or grant of a lease within section 19(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. (This requirement also applies to a transfer by a mortgagee in exercise of their power of sale.) It does not matter whether the disposition is dated before or after the notice in the register.</p>

<p>Once you have supplied this certificate we will then serve notice of your application on the beneficiary of the unilateral notice or the applicant for the agreed notice. If we receive no objection to the notice, we will complete the registration, but will not cancel the entry of the section 13 notice on the register.</p>

<h4>5.4.7	Later application for agreed or unilateral notice where a notice made under section 13 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 is protected in the register</h4>

<p>We will generally ignore a section 13 notice where the later application is one to enter a unilateral or agreed notice. The exception to this general rule is where we have had to satisfy ourselves as to the validity of the applicant’s claim under section 34(3)(c) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. In that case, where it appears that the application may be to register a notice protecting an interest arising under a disposition falling with section 19(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, we will require a certificate and serve notice as referred to in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6-4-6">Later application to register a disposition where a notice made under section 13 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 is protected in the register</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Flats: rights of tenants of flats under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Generally</h3>
<p>The Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 gives certain rights to tenants of flats as against their landlord that continue to exist alongside the more general provisions of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. In certain cases, as mentioned in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-7-2">Notices</a>, the rights may require an entry to be made in the register if the title to the lease or to the reversion is registered. As mentioned in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-7-4">Variation of leases</a>, the terms of the lease may also be varied.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Notices</h3>

<h4>6.2.1	Tenant’s right of first refusal to purchase the reversion</h4>

<p>A landlord of a building containing flats must not dispose or contract to dispose of an interest in those premises unless they have served a notice of their intention on the tenants giving them collectively a right of first refusal (sections 1(1), 4A and 5(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987).</p>

<p>There are detailed definitions of what is meant by the landlord, a disposal, the premises and a qualifying tenant, and there are prescribed procedures that must be followed from the serving of the initial notice to the stage where the landlord disposes of their interest to the tenants or becomes free to dispose of it elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is also clearly stated in connection with these procedures that any reference to an offer is a reference to an offer made subject to contract, and any reference to the acceptance of an offer is a reference to its acceptance subject to contract (section 20(2) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987). In those circumstances there is no interest capable of being protected on the register. However, once a contract has been entered into, the tenants can protect their interest by applying for the entry of a notice on the landlord’s title or an entry at the Land Charges Department in the usual way.</p>

<p>Where a landlord has disposed of an interest in the premises in contravention of the tenants’ right of first refusal, the tenants have additional rights including, where applicable, the right to take the benefit of the contract, the right to compel the purchaser to sell to them or, in the case of a surrender, the right to a new lease (sections 11, 11A, 12A-D, 13-14, 16-17 and Schedule 1, part I of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987). The notice by which the right is exercised does not itself give an interest that can be protected on the register but when a binding contract has been entered into in pursuance of a purchase notice, the tenants’ interest may be protected by a notice in the usual way.</p>

<h4>6.2.2	Appointment of managers (of the block of flats)</h4>

<p>A tenant of a building containing flats may apply to the court for the appointment of a manager if the landlord has failed to manage the premises in accordance with their obligations or the service charges are unreasonable (section 21 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987). The court may then, if it thinks fit, make an order appointing a manager to carry out functions in connection with management or functions of a receiver. Any such order will be registrable as an order appointing a receiver or sequestrator of land (section 24(8) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987; section 87(2)(a) of the Land Registration Act 2002). In the case of registered land this requires protection by the registration of a restriction. This jurisdiction has been transferred to leasehold valuation tribunals: section 86 of the Housing Act 1996. As to leasehold valuation tribunals see section 52A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987.</p>

<h4>6.2.3	Compulsory acquisition by tenants of their landlord’s interest</h4>

<p>Where a landlord of a building containing flats is in breach of their obligations to their tenants in regard to the maintenance or management of the premises the court may, on the application of the tenants, make an acquisition order (sections 25, 28 and 29 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987). If it decides to make an order the court will provide for a person nominated by the tenants to be entitled to acquire the landlord’s interest in the premises on such terms as may be agreed or, failing agreement, on such terms as the appropriate tribunal may determine (sections 30 and 31 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987).</p>

<p>An application for an acquisition order is registrable as a pending land action so that, in the case of registered land, it may be protected by a notice. When an acquisition order has been made it will be registrable as an order affecting land made by the court for the purpose of enforcing a judgment and, in the case of registered land, it may also be protected by the entry of a notice. A person who has applied for an acquisition order under section 28 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 who applies for a restriction in Form N to Schedule 4 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 and a person who has similarly obtained an acquisition order and applies for a restriction in Form L or N is regarded as having sufficient interest to apply for the restriction (rules 93(o) and (n) of the Land Registration Rules 2003 respectively).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Registration following an acquisition order</h3>

<p>This section deals with applications for first registration of unregistered land following an acquisition order made under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 and applications for registration of the tenants’ nominee where an acquisition order is made in respect of land that is already registered.</p>

<h4>6.3.1	First registration</h4>

<p>Make the application in the usual way on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a>. Where there has been no transfer the application should be accompanied by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an office copy of the court order, duly stamped</li>
  <li>confirmation of the payment into court</li>
  <li>any available evidence of the former landlord’s title</li>
</ul>

<p>If no documentary evidence of the title is available it is open to you to apply for a possessory title, supported by a statutory declaration or statement of truth (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statements-of-truth">practice guide 73: statements of truth</a>) by a person having the necessary knowledge of the facts – normally a director or the secretary or solicitor or licensed <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the Land Registration Rules 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> of the applicant company. Since they may not be aware of disputes between the former landlord and third parties, they may only be able to speak as to the period for which the applicant has held the land.</p>

<h4>6.3.2	Registration of nominee as proprietor</h4>

<p>Make the application in the usual way in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a>. Where there has been no transfer the application should be accompanied by an office copy of the court order, duly stamped, and confirmation of the payment into court.</p>

<p>Notice of the application will be served on the registered proprietor and any other persons appearing from the register to be interested in the title. If no objection is received the registration will be completed, if necessary under a new title number.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Variation of leases</h3>

<p>Any party to a long lease of a flat may apply to the court for an order varying the lease on the grounds that the lease fails to make satisfactory provision with respect to repair, maintenance, the provision of services, insurance, the recovery of expenses or the computation of service charges (section 35 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987). The court may then make an appropriate order that will be binding on the parties to the lease and any other persons concerned (sections 38 and 39 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987).</p>

<p>The entry of the variation order in the register of the titles affected will be dealt with in the same way as a deed of variation, except that you cannot apply for a unilateral notice to protect a court order under sections 38 and 39 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 (rule 80(d) of the Land Registration Rules 2003).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>The Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 and the right to manage</h2>

<p>Part 2, Chapter 1 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 came into force on 30 September 2003. It provides for the management functions of the landlord (and certain third parties) to be exercisable by a right to manage (<abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr>) company in place of the landlord. An <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> company is a special company limited by guarantee, the membership of which is restricted to qualifying tenants. A qualifying tenant is generally a tenant under a long lease.</p>

<p>The Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 contains detailed procedures that the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> company must comply with before it can acquire the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr>. The right becomes exercisable from the acquisition date as set out in section 90 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002.</p>

<p>Section 98 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 provides that the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> company (where it has acquired the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr>) takes over the landlord’s functions relating to approvals under the leases including a consent required under a restriction in the register. In the case of alienation, structural alterations and user, the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> company must give the landlord 30 days’ notice before it grants the approval. In all other cases it must give 14 days’ notice. During that notice period the landlord has the opportunity to object - see section 99 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. All tenant covenants other than those relating to re-entry or forfeiture are potentially exercisable by the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> company - see section 100 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002.</p>

<p>Section 104 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 amended the Land Registration Act 1925 to allow for notices to be entered and cautions to be lodged in respect of the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr>. As this suggests that the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> is not an adverse right affecting the landlord’s title to the estate, we take the view that applications to protect an <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> company by way of entry of an agreed notice or unilateral notice (in the case of a registered estate), or registration of a caution against first registration (in the case of an unregistered estate) in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreed-notice-registration-an1">form AN1</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-application-to-enter-un1">form UN1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-registration-caution-ct1">form CT1</a> under the Land Registration Act 2002 (which is not similarly amended by the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002), are not appropriate.</p>

<p>Rule 79A of the Land Registration Rules 2003 does, however, allow for application to be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> for an entry to be made in the proprietorship register to record the acquisition of the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> by an <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> company. Such an application must be accompanied by evidence to satisfy the registrar that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the applicant is an <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> company</li>
  <li>the right to manage is in relation to the premises comprised in the registered estate</li>
  <li>the registered proprietor of the registered estate is the landlord under a lease of the whole or part of the registered estate</li>
  <li>the right to manage the premises has been acquired, and remains exercisable, by the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> company</li>

<p>The entry does not guarantee that the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> has been acquired or that, if acquired, it remains exercisable, but it does highlight to those proposing to deal with the landlord that there is a <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> company which claims to have acquired the <abbr title="means right to manage.">RTM</abbr> in respect of the premises concerned.</p>

<p>A restriction on the title to a leasehold estate may require the consent of, or certificate by, a landlord or a management company.

<span class="number">8. </span>The Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Generally</h3>

<p>The Leasehold Reform (Ground Rent) Act 2022 (‘LR(GR)A 2022’) came into force on 30 June 2022 (except for leases of certain retirement properties, for which the LR(GR)A 2022 applies from April 2023).</p>

<p>It limits the ground rent chargeable on most new long residential leases to one peppercorn per year (after the previous lease would have expired in the case of replacement of a pre-commencement lease). The LR(GR)A 2022 also prohibits administration charges in relation to peppercorn rents.</p>

<p>The LR(GR)A 2022 also puts in place a statutory procedure, by which a tenant or landlord can apply to the First-tier Tribunal (in England) or the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal (in Wales) to make a declaration as to the effect of the LR(GR)A 2022 on the terms of a lease. The Tribunal may direct the landlord to make an application to HM Land Registry to enter the declaration in the registered title, and the tenant may make such an application in any event.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Leases regulated by the LR(GR)A 2022</h3>

<p>The LR(GR)A 2022 applies to ‘regulated leases’ (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/1/section/1/enacted" rel="external">section 1 of the LR(GR)A 2022</a>) which are leases that meet all of the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is either</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a lease granted for a term exceeding 21 years</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a perpetually renewable lease</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a lease taking effect under section 149(6) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (which relates to certain leases determinable on death or marriage/civil partnership)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>of a single dwelling (which can be a house or a flat)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is granted for a premium or by way of deemed (not express) surrender and re-grant of a previous lease</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is granted on or after the LR(GR)A 2022’s entry into force (unless granted pursuant to a prior contract), and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is not an excepted lease by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/1/section/2/enacted" rel="external">section 2 of the LR(GR)A 2022</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Registration of a lease containing a ground rent in breach of the LR(GR)A 2022</h3>

<p>A lease in breach of the LR(GR)A 2022 is not void and an application must still be made in the circumstances set out in section 27(2)(b) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>Entering a Tribunal’s declaration in the register</h3>

<p>Tenants and landlords can apply to the Tribunal for a declaration as to the effect of the LR(GR)A 2022 on the terms of a lease (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/1/section/15/enacted" rel="external">section 15 of the LR(GR)A 2022</a>). Such a declaration is not a variation of the lease, as the Tribunal merely declares what the lease is deemed by the LR(GR)A 2022 to have said all along.</p>

<p>An application for alteration of the register can be made to enter the declaration and must be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> supported by a certified copy of the declaration. We will usually file a copy of the declaration and make appropriate entries in the register to refer to it. We will not usually file a separate amended copy of the lease itself, nor make any changes to the existing filed copy.</p>

<p>A fixed fee is payable under Schedule 3, Part 1(13) of the current Land Registration Fee Order, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-registration-services-fees">HM Land Registry: Registration Services fees</a>.</p>

<span class="number">9. </span>Appendix 1: merger of leases on acquisition of the freehold</h2>

<p>To find out what happens to documents submitted with application forms, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#retention-documents">Retention of documents lodged with applications</a>.</p>

<p>When a person is entitled in the same capacity to the leasehold and any superior leasehold and the freehold titles to a property, the leasehold titles will be merged if the registered proprietor or their practitioner makes an application for merger and any entries on the inferior title(s) that would prevent merger are cancelled or removed.</p>

<p>The mechanics of the application depend on the circumstances of the case as explained below. If you cannot produce the lease for any reason, for example where the lease is not in the lessee’s possession because it also affects other land, a short letter stating the reason for its non-production should be lodged.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Merger of registered leases</h3>

<p>When the freehold title is already registered the request for closure of the leasehold title(s) may be made in panel 4 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a>, which should refer to the title numbers of the titles to be closed.</p>

<p>When the freehold title is the subject of an application for first registration the request for merger should be made in panel 5 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a>.  In addition form AP1 should be lodged for closure of the leasehold title(s). The lease should accompany the application. The registered leasehold title can only be closed when all entries on the register have been satisfactorily dealt with.</p>

<p>Any restriction on the register must normally be withdrawn by means of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdraw-a-restriction-registration-rx4">form RX4</a> signed by the restrictioner or their <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the Land Registration Rules 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> unless a corresponding restriction is to be entered against the freehold title.</p>

<p>A restriction in favour of a chargee will be cancelled automatically when the title is closed (and re-entered on the new title if the charge is to be registered against it).</p>

<p>A Form A restriction on dispositions by a sole proprietor will also be cancelled automatically on closure of the title.</p>

<p>An inhibition resulting from an injunction or restraint order may prevent the closure of the title, or a restriction may be entered on the freehold title, depending on the terms of the court order on which the entry is founded. It may be cancelled on production of an official copy of the court order that puts an end to the original order.</p>

<p>Application should be made for the cancellation or removal of any notice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-cancellation-cn1">form CN1</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-cancellation-un4">form UN4</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-application-to-remove-un2">form UN2</a> as appropriate.</p>

<p>Evidence to support certain applications is listed below.</p>

<p>When a registered charge appears on the title a discharge of the charge, or a deed of substituted security, must be produced.</p>

<p>Where a noted charge appears on the title it must be produced with a receipt endorsed or other evidence of discharge or a deed of substituted security.</p>

<p>A creditor’s notice on the leasehold title will normally be entered on the freehold title. If no longer required the notice may be cancelled on application accompanied by an office copy of the court order dismissing or withdrawing the petition in bankruptcy or rescinding or annulling the subsequent bankruptcy order.</p>

<p>A bankruptcy inhibition registered under the Land Registration Act 1925 or a restriction registered under section 86 of the Land Registration Act 2002 may be cancelled on production of an official copy of the court order under which the bankruptcy order was rescinded or annulled.</p>

<p>An inhibition resulting from an injunction or restraint order may prevent the closure of the title, or a restriction may be entered on the freehold title, depending on the terms of the court order on which the entry is founded. It may be cancelled on production of an official copy of the court order that puts an end to the original order.</p>

<p>A (matrimonial) homes rights notice that no longer affects the title may be withdrawn by means of an application in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cancel-home-rights-registration-hr4">form HR4</a>. If not withdrawn or cancelled the notice will be carried forward onto the freehold title.</p>

<p>A notice of an access order under the Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992 may be cancelled on production of the appropriate evidence and, if not cancelled, will likewise be carried forward onto the freehold title.</p>

<p>A caution may be withdrawn by means of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdraw-a-caution-application-wct">form WCT</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Merger of unregistered lease noted against a registered superior title</h3>

<p>Make the application in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-cancellation-cn1">form CN1</a>, supported by the lease and all deeds and documents relating to the leasehold title. The documents lodged should include an up-to-date land charges search.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span>Merger of unregistered lease not noted against a registered superior title</h3>

<p>If the superior title is being registered or is the subject of an application in form CN1 the lease should be referred to in the application.</p>

<p>If the superior title is already registered and the lease is not noted against it no application for merger is required. In either case the original lease and all deeds and documents relating to the title to it should be lodged. The documents lodged should include an up-to-date land charges search.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span>Registration of new lease</h3>

<p>The application for registration of the new lease should be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a> if the reversionary title is unregistered or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> if the reversionary title is registered.</p>

<p>The application should be accompanied by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a certified copy of the lease being registered</li>
  <li>surrendered lease, if the new lease is drawn by reference to the terms of the surrendered lease</li>
  <li>Stamp Duty Land Tax certificate or Land Transaction Tax certificate, if required</li>
  <li>evidence of the lessor’s title to grant the lease, if required</li>
  <li>consent of lessor’s mortgagee, if required</li>
  <li>any consent required by a restriction affecting the lessor’s title</li>
  <li>particulars of any leases intermediate between the lessor’s title and the new lease (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#reversionary">Reversionary titles</a>, Intermediate leasehold titles)</li>
  <li>application to give effect to the deemed surrender of the existing lease and any intermediate lease held by or in trust for the applicant</li>
  <li>application for any necessary restriction or notice on the title to the new lease</li>
  <li>fees</li>
</ul>

<p>The new lease may either be a complete, full length lease, or it may be drawn by reference to the terms of the lease being surrendered. Avoid using a deed of variation. The effect of the procedure may appear to be the variation of the length of the term of the original lease, but this is not the case. The new lease takes effect in substitution for the existing lease.</p>

<p>A new lease under section 56 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 cannot arise by way of a deemed surrender and re-grant arising out of a deed of variation purporting to extend the term of the existing lease, even if it contains a statement complying with rule 196(2) of the Land Registration Rules 2003.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span>Lessor’s title</h3>

<p>If the lessor’s title is unregistered, an examined abstract or epitome of the lessor’s title and a current search in Land Charges Department should be obtained and lodged with the application, with a view to the grant of an absolute leasehold title. Normally an absolute leasehold title can be granted only if the lessor’s title and any superior titles have previously been approved by HM Land Registry on an application for first registration or are lodged with the application.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span>Consent of lessor’s mortgagee</h3>

<p>The consent of the landlord’s chargee may be lodged with the application but it is not strictly required for the registration of the lease even where there is a restriction in the register to this effect.</p>

<p>Under section 58 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, a qualifying tenant is entitled to be granted a new lease despite the fact that the grant of the existing lease was subsequent to the creation of a charge on the landlord’s interest and not authorised by the chargee.</p>

<p>It is clear from section 58(1)(b) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 that the lease binds the chargee, subject to section 58(2). Section 58(2) says that a lease granted under section 56 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 shall not bind the chargee if it was granted after 1 November 1993 and “being granted subsequent to the creation of the mortgage, would not, apart from that subsection, be binding on the persons interested in the mortgage.” Section 58(1)(a) goes further in saying that the lease “shall be deemed to be authorised as against the persons interested in any mortgage on the landlord’s interest (however created or arising)”.</p>

<p>It is therefore HM Land Registry’s view that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in all cases the power of the lessor to grant the lease cannot be questioned on account of the existence of a mortgage on its title</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the mortgage itself contains a clause that no disposition is to be made by the landlord without the consent in writing of the chargee, that clause is deemed to be satisfied by virtue of section 58(1)(a) and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 generally</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the wording of section 58(1)(a) is sufficient to deem the written consent of the chargee, even for the purpose of a restriction in the register requiring the written consent of the chargee to a disposition by the landlord. The terms of the restriction are satisfied for the purposes of section 41(1) of the Land Registration Act 2002</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the qualification in section 58(2) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 means that if a lease was:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>granted on or after 1 November 1993</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>made subsequent to the date of the landlord’s charge, and</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>without the consent of the chargee</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>the new lease must be granted under section 56 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 ,and will be authorised as against the chargee under section 58(1)(a) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, but may not be binding on the chargee under section 58(1)(b) unless other events have caused it to be binding. HM Land Registry is not in a position to ascertain whether or not the lease is binding on the chargee, but this does not prevent us from registering the lease, subject to a protective entry. The chargee will retain any remedies available to it under the charge.</p>

<p>So, where the consent of the landlord’s chargee is not lodged and the existing lease appears to have been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>granted on or after 1 November 1993</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>made subsequent to the date of the landlord’s charge, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>without the consent of the charge</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>the following entry will be made in the property register of the new title:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The title to the lease is, during the subsistence of the charge dated ….. in favour of ….. affecting the landlord’s title (and to the extent permitted by law, any charge replacing or varying this charge or any further charge in respect of all or part of the sum secured by this charge), subject to any rights that may have arisen by reason of the absence of chargee’s consent, unless the lease is authorised by section 99 of the Law of Property Act 1925.”</p>
</div>

<p>This entry will not be made if a copy of the mortgage deed is lodged together with confirmation that the granting of the lease was permitted by the terms of the mortgage (by referring to the relevant clause in the deed) and that the mortgagee’s consent was not required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span>Application to give effect to the deemed surrender of the existing lease</h3>

<p>The form of this application will depend on whether the existing lease is registered, whether the surrendered lease is noted on any reversionary title, and whether the application is under the  Leasehold Reform Act 1967 or the  Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.</p>

<p>If the applicant’s existing leasehold title is registered application should be made to give effect to the surrender of the existing lease by closing that title. If the applicant’s leasehold title is not registered but notice of it is entered on any reversionary title you must make an application for the cancellation of the notice.</p>

<p>Even if the surrendered lease is neither registered nor noted on any reversionary title it is still necessary for the surrendered lease and the applicant’s title to it to be lodged, together with a current Land Charges Department search. Any mortgages affecting the lease should also be lodged.</p>

<p>Any mortgagees of the applicant’s existing lease should be contacted prior to completion of the new lease and the necessary arrangements made.</p>

<p>Any other interest affecting the existing lease should also be carefully considered.</p>

<p>If it is protected in the register of the existing lease but does not affect the new lease, lodge an application for the withdrawal of the restriction, or notice of deposit or intended deposit, or the cancellation of the notice. If it or a corresponding interest affects the new lease, an application to protect it by means of a suitable entry in the register should be included in, or accompany, the application to register the new lease.</p>

<h4>10.7.1 Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993</h4>

<p>Where the new lease is being granted under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 any charges on the surrendered lease will transfer automatically. The applicant should apply for registration of the charge in panels 4 and 10 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> or panels 5 and 10 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a>, the form used depending on whether the reversioner’s title is registered. It is only necessary to arrange for the charge to be lodged if the surrendered lease is unregistered. If the charge is to be protected by notice only and the reversioner’s title is registered you should complete either <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreed-notice-registration-an1">form AN1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-application-to-enter-un1">form UN1</a>, as appropriate. In the case of a lease granted under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, the mortgage may be registered or noted against the new title in the normal way.</p>

<h4>10.7.2 Leasehold Reform Act 1967</h4>

<p>Where, however, the new lease is being granted under the  Leasehold Reform Act 1967, a mortgage does not transfer automatically to the new lease and should therefore either be discharged and replaced or transferred to the new lease by deed. If the mortgage is discharged, the discharged mortgage and evidence of discharge and the new mortgage, if any, with a certified copy if the new mortgage is to be registered, should be lodged with the application. If a deed of substituted security is used the mortgage should be lodged together with the deed and, if the mortgage is to be registered against the new title, a certified copy.</p>

<p>If the mortgagee’s cooperation cannot be secured HM Land Registry will endeavour to serve a special notice on them and any other person appearing to be interested in the mortgage, giving details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the mortgage</li>
  <li>the applicants and the nature of the application</li>
  <li>the intended closure of the title to the existing lease (if registered)</li>
  <li>the intended cancellation of the notice of the existing lease on a superior title (if the existing lease is not registered but is noted on such a title)</li>
  <li>the effect of the application, if completed, on the mortgage</li>
  <li>how any objection to the application can be made; and requesting the lodging of the original mortgage</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is no response to the notice the application will be completed. In the case of a lease granted under the  Leasehold Reform Act 1967 a special entry will be made as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-5-4-2">Entries in the register</a>.</p>

<p>If, in response to the notice, the recipient lodges the original mortgage, it will either be registered or noted. If notice has to be served in respect of more than one subsisting mortgage, separate entries will be made in the register according to the respective priorities of the mortgages concerned.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.8 </span>Other entries on existing leasehold title</h3>

<p>A restriction in favour of a chargee will be cancelled automatically when the old title is closed (and re-entered on the new title if the charge is registered against it). A form A restriction against dispositions by a sole proprietor will also be cancelled on closure of the title. A voluntary restriction in the register of the old title must normally be withdrawn by means of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdraw-a-restriction-registration-rx4">form RX4</a> signed by the restrictioner or their <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the Land Registration Rules 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> unless a corresponding restriction is applied for against the new lease.</p>

<p>Application should be made for the cancellation or removal of any notices other than one protecting a monetary charge on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-cancellation-cn1">form CN1</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-cancellation-un4">form UN4</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-application-to-remove-un2">form UN2</a> as appropriate.</p>

<p>Evidence to support certain applications is set out below. A creditor’s notice will normally be entered on the new title. If no longer required application should be accompanied by an office copy of the court order dismissing or withdrawing the petition in bankruptcy or rescinding or annulling the subsequent bankruptcy order. A bankruptcy restriction may be cancelled on production of an official copy of the court order under which the bankruptcy order was rescinded or annulled.</p>

<p>A homes rights notice that no longer affects may be withdrawn by means of an application in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cancel-home-rights-registration-hr4">form HR4</a>. If not withdrawn or cancelled the notice will be carried forward onto the new title.</p>

<p>A notice of an access order under the Access to Neighbouring Land Act 1992 requires production of the appropriate evidence, and if not cancelled will be carried forward onto the new title.</p>

<p>A caution may be withdrawn by means of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdraw-a-caution-application-wct">form WCT</a>.</p>

<p>An inhibition resulting from an injunction or restraint order may prevent the closure of the title or a restriction may be entered on the freehold title, depending on the terms of the court order on which the entry is founded. It may be cancelled on production of an official copy of the court order that puts an end to the original order.</p>

<p>We will consider any entry affecting the old title that is not withdrawn or cancelled and is not carried forward onto, or replaced by a corresponding entry on, the new title on a case-by-case basis. In some cases it may be possible to deal with the matter by the service of notice.</p>
