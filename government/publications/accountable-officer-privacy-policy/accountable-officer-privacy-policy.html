<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> About us</h2>

<p><strong>1.1</strong> The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) helps employers make safer recruitment decisions and prevent unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups, including children.</p>

<p><strong>1.2</strong> For the purposes of basic DBS checks we search police records and then issue a basic DBS certificate to the applicant.</p>

<p><strong>1.3</strong> Occasionally depending on circumstances, and in order to produce a complete and accurate certificate, we must issue a manually produced certificate. Manual certificates follow the same checking processes as our system-generated certificates and are equally valid. It must be noted however, that applicants issued with a manual certificate cannot join the update service with that certificate.</p>

<p><strong>1.4</strong> DBS offer different types of check issued under the Police Act 1997:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a basic DBS check shows unspent convictions and conditional cautions under the terms of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974</li>
  <li>a standard DBS check shows spent and unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands and final warnings which are not subject to filtering</li>
  <li>an enhanced DBS check shows the same as a standard check plus any information held by local police that’s considered reasonably relevant and ought to be disclosed relating to the child or adult workforce. Where the application is for any other role, the police will consider the nature of the role in the release of information</li>
  <li>an enhanced with Barred List(s) DBS check with barred lists shows the same as an enhanced check plus whether the applicant is in the list of people barred from doing the role</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> What is it I need to know?</h2>

<p><strong>2.1</strong> This is our privacy policy for an Accountable Officer (AO) who is usually a senior figure within a Responsible Organisation (RO). An RO is an organisation registered with the DBS to submit basic DBS checks on behalf of individuals. The policy tells you how we will use and protect any information we hold about you as part of your registration as an AO.</p>

<p><strong>2.2</strong> The policy also explains what your rights are as an AO under the General Data Protection Regulations. It says why we need your personal data, what we will do with it and what you can expect from us. It also explains how to get a copy of any personal data we may hold about you. This is called a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-subject-access-request">Subject Access Request</a>.</p>

<p>There are further DBS privacy policies which cover other statutory functions undertaken by DBS. They can be accessed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-privacy-policies">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How will we use the personal information supplied to us?</h2>

<p><strong>3.1</strong> We at DBS collect your personal data in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>process request for DBS basic checks - this will include verifying your identity, searching police records, issuing a DBS certificate to you and in certain circumstances, obtaining fingerprints</li>
  <li>assess whether you are suitable to be an AO</li>
  <li>contact you regarding the consideration or changes to your DBS basic DBS check and/or registration status</li>
  <li>contact you in relation to further information that is required on any applications that your RO has submitted to either progress the application or as part of assessing compliance to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-check-guidance-and-policies">basic check processing standards</a>
</li>
  <li>contact you regarding any changes you need to be aware of relating to DBS services and products</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.2</strong> DBS must satisfy itself that you and your RO can comply with the requirements set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-check-guidance-and-policies">basic check terms and conditions</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-check-guidance-and-policies">basic check processing standards</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-check-guidance-and-policies">web services interchange agreement</a> and that the person to be appointed as the AO within the RO is suitable.</p>

<p><strong>3.3</strong> To assess suitability we require you to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/request-copy-criminal-record">basic check</a> via DBS as part of the RO registration process. Before you submit a basic check you will be asked to read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-dbs-check-privacy-policy">Basic Check Privacy Policy</a>. You must apply directly to DBS and not use any other organisation to submit your check. When you receive your basic disclosure certificate you will need to send this to DBS, which we will return. More details about this will be issued to you during the registration process.</p>

<p><strong>3.4</strong> The consequence of registration is that the DBS function within section 118 Police Act 1997, in respect of ensuring the application is supported by such evidence to verify the identity of the applicant, is delegated by the DBS to your organisation under paragraph 7 of Schedule 8 to the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.</p>

<p>For this reason we must be sure of your suitability to act as an AO and your organisation to register as a Responsible Organisation.</p>

<p><strong>3.5 Suitability assessment of the AO</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.6</strong> A suitability decision will be made using the information contained on the basic disclosure check you obtain and present to DBS. This will be done on a case-by-case basis following the DBS Accountable Officer risk assessment. Suitability will be assessed in relation to the functions carried out by the RO.</p>

<p><strong>3.7</strong> These functions include ensuring that any application that is made under section 112 Police Act, and submitted by the RO, is supported by such evidence required by DBS under section 118 Police Act 1997 to verify the identity of the applicant. Suitability will also be assessed for the role of the RO in processing personal sensitive information on behalf of individual applicants to DBS and, with the consent of the applicant, to proposed employers.</p>

<p><strong>3.8</strong> Generally, DBS considers that it is likely that offences of dishonesty and extortion, serious sexual and violent offences and non-minor drug offences could in principle impact upon a person’s suitability, depending on the circumstances of the relevant offence and how long ago it occurred. However, each case will be considered on its own merits. In considering each case the following factors, will be taken into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the nature of the offences and their relevance to the functions</li>
  <li>the seriousness of the offences</li>
  <li>the number of offences</li>
  <li>date of the offences</li>
  <li>the circumstances surrounding the offending</li>
  <li>the person’s attitude to the offending</li>
  <li>any change in circumstances since the offences occurred</li>
  <li>any other mitigating circumstances and/or other factors which are considered relevant to suitability</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.9 Financial credit check</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.10</strong> As payments for basic DBS checks will be made in arrears we will carry out a financial credit check of your organisation to assess the credit worthiness and this will inform the approval of your organisation payment account status as part of the registration process. If you are already registered with DBS as a Registered Body we will not carry out this check as we already have a financial relationship with you.</p>

<p><strong>3.11</strong> The information we collect about you depends on the reason for your business with us. DBS may use the information it obtains for any of the purposes listed in paragraph 3.1.</p>

<p><strong>3.12</strong> Your information may also be used for testing purposes. Testing is undertaken to ensure that our systems function as per specified requirements. If it is not practical to disguise your data or use dummy data then we will test our system using your data. This testing will only take place in environments that are secured to the same level as our live system.</p>

<p><strong>Please note - we may use previous applications you have submitted to assist in the checking process.</strong></p>

<p><strong>11.1</strong> We operate a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-data-retention-policy">Data Retention Policy</a> to ensure that data is not held for longer than necessary. However at present, there is a restriction on the destruction of information due to the ongoing Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. DBS are currently reassessing the retention requirements in light of this.</p>

<p><strong>11.2</strong> Any data that we identity that could be called on by the inquiry will be retained until completion of the inquiry. At this point the information will be securely destroyed as soon as is practicable.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> What are my rights? How will DBS protect them?</h2>

<p><strong>12.1</strong> We are committed to protecting your rights under the GDPR.</p>

<p><strong>12.1.1 Your right to be informed</strong></p>

<p>This document provides you with information in relation to how your data is processed as a DBS applicant.</p>

<p><strong>12.1.2 Your right to access to your personal data held by DBS - known as a Subject Access Request</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to request a copy of the information DBS hold about you.</p>

<p>On receipt of a valid application we will tell you whether we hold any data about you and provide you with a copy. Further information on how to apply can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-subject-access-request">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>12.1.3 Your right to request information held is accurate. Can I update it?</strong></p>

<p>If you think that the information held by us at the DBS is incorrect, you have the right to request it is corrected. If you challenge the accuracy of data that was provided to us by a third party we will send your request for correction to that party for their consideration.</p>

<p>If you believe you have submitted an error on your application that is still in progress you will need to contact us immediately on 03000 200 190.</p>

<p>If you wish to dispute information as contained on your completed certificate you can raise a dispute by contacting us on 03000 200 190.</p>

<p>Third parties can also dispute a DBS certificate if they have all the necessary certificate information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the applicant’s name</li>
  <li>the applicant’s date of birth</li>
  <li>the certificate number and issue date</li>
  <li>the applicant’s address</li>
</ul>

<p>Where this is the case you will be notified that a third party has raised a dispute.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-subject-access-request">GOV.UK</a> for more information about disputes.</p>

<p><strong>12.1.4 Your right to request erasure of your personal data</strong></p>

<p>In certain circumstances you have a right to have personal data held about you erased. As the DBS we will only do this if certain criteria are met. There are some circumstances where this cannot be done therefore we advise you to seek independent advice before submitting an application to DBS.</p>

<p>Any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deletion-of-data">requests for information to be destroyed</a> will be considered on a case-by-case basis. There are some specific circumstances where the right to erasure does not apply and we may refuse your request.</p>

<p><strong>12.1.5 Your right to prevent DBS from processing information which is likely to cause you damage/distress</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to request restriction of processing where it has been established that one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>during the period of rectification if accuracy of personal data is contested</li>
  <li>processing is unlawful</li>
  <li>an individual has requested it is retained to enable them to establish, exercise or defend legal claims</li>
  <li>pending verification of the outcome of the Right to object</li>
  <li>where processing has been restricted</li>
</ul>

<p>You can request restriction of processing for any of the above reasons until these are resolved. Any requests to stop processing will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Should you wish to restrict processing you will need to call the DBS helpline on 03000 200 190.</p>

<p><strong>12.1.6 Right to receive an electronic copy of any information you have consented to be supplied to us - known as data portability</strong></p>

<p>You have the right, where this is technically feasible to receive electronically any personal data you have provided to DBS to process on a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consent-privacy-policy">consent</a> basis.</p>

<p>Please note that basic, standard and enhanced certificates are processed under our legal obligation, under Part V of the Police Act 1997, and barring information is processed under the Safeguarding and Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. Therefore this information falls outside of the right to data portability.</p>

<p>All <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-portability">requests for portability</a> will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><strong>12.1.7 You have the right to object to processing of your information</strong></p>

<p>Should you wish us at DBS to stop processing your application you will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dbs-check-requests-guidance-for-employers#withdrawing-applications">withdraw the application</a>.</p>

<p><strong>12.1.8 You have rights relating to automated decisions being made about you</strong></p>

<p>Our Disclosure process is generally automated. You have the right to object to any automated decision-making. It should be noted that you would need to inform us of this on submission of your application by contacting us on 03000 200 190.</p>

<p>DBS do not currently undertake any profiling activities.</p>

<p><strong>12.1.9 You have the right to make a complaint to DBS and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</strong></p>

<p>If you wish to make a complaint to us regarding the way in which we have processed your personal data you can make a complaint to the Data Protection officer via the contact details in Section 6.1.
