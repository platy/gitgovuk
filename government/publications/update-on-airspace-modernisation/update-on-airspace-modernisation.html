<p>Airspace modernisation is vital to the future of aviation, to delivering net zero and, now, to supporting the aviation sector’s recovery from the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19 pandemic).</p>

<p>Both the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Civil Aviation Authority (<abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr>) are acutely aware of the effect that the pandemic is having on the sector and its ability to progress airspace changes to original plans, so the Airspace Change Organising Group’s (<abbr title="Airspace Change Organising Group">ACOG</abbr>’s) report is timely and welcome.</p>

<p>As co-sponsors of airspace modernisation, the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> would like to thank <abbr title="Airspace Change Organising Group">ACOG</abbr> and the organisations who contributed to the work that has gone into its <a href="https://www.ourfutureskies.uk/latest-news/2020/acog-remobilising-airspace-change-report/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Remobilising the Airspace Change Programme report</a> over the last few weeks.</p>

<p>The report is insightful, thorough, and raises important questions for us to consider around the future of airspace change, and the masterplan <abbr title="Airspace Change Organising Group">ACOG</abbr> has been working on. This masterplan will set out where airspace change could be taken forward to provide benefits, consider the potential conflicts, trade-offs and dependencies, and set out a preferred implementation plan.</p>

<p>Despite the current international crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the aviation industry and air traffic levels, the need to modernise the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s airspace design remains clear. Airspace modernisation is a critical infrastructure programme of national importance, and the potential benefits of designing the “motorways in the sky” are significant for all those who use and are affected by airspace.</p>

<p>Upgrading airspace is essential to open up airspace for all users, including general aviation flyers and new types of aircraft, such as drones, to provide the opportunity for reducing noise and to improve capacity for the aviation industry to reduce traffic delays when the demand returns.</p>

<p>Critically, the emissions savings modernisation can deliver are a key component of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s commitment to reach net zero by 2050. The aviation industry’s decarbonisation roadmap suggests that air traffic management and operational improvements are likely to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> aviation by around 4.6% by 2050 relative to 2016, with the potential for additional savings from future innovations. <abbr title="National Air Traffic Services">NATS</abbr>’ feasibility study into modernisation also estimates savings of up to 10-20% on fuel burn and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the south east of England, where the airspace is most congested.</p>

<p>In light of the pandemic, we recognise that the timescales in which airspace modernisation will take place will change. We also need to consider what changes may be required to how individual organisations progress their individual airspace changes and they will interact with <abbr title="National Air Traffic Services">NATS</abbr> and <abbr title="Airspace Change Organising Group">ACOG</abbr>.</p>

<p>With that in mind, the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> are pleased to immediately accept recommendations 1, 2 and 4 in <abbr title="Airspace Change Organising Group">ACOG</abbr>’s report, namely that we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask <abbr title="Airspace Change Organising Group">ACOG</abbr> to establish clear protocols for: the airports that are able to resume work on airspace change, engagement with those that remain paused, and the exit process for those that decide to opt out (subject to their criticality to the programme)</li>
  <li>ask <abbr title="NATS En-route Limited">NERL</abbr> and <abbr title="Airspace Change Organising Group">ACOG</abbr> to work together to re-evaluate <abbr title="NATS En-route Limited">NERL</abbr>’s 2018 feasibility report into airspace modernisation, specifically in order to identify the core set of airport led airspace changes that will be required in the post COVID-19 world</li>
  <li>in the short term, the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> will work with <abbr title="Airspace Change Organising Group">ACOG</abbr> to ensure that work on airspace change that can still progress does not conflict with or constrain the broader programme</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> will thoroughly consider the remaining recommendations in further detail given the range and scale of the options proposed. Some of the recommendations outlined in the report would require changes to existing regulation and policy and we would need to engage the sector so that we take into account sponsors’ objectives and constraints. We are conscious of the need to do this quickly given the significant amount of time and resource that sponsors have already put into their work on airspace change.</p>

<p>We will advise <abbr title="Airspace Change Organising Group">ACOG</abbr> and stakeholders of our preferred approach in early autumn, allowing work on the masterplan to restart in good time.</p>
