<h2>The purpose of this document</h2>

<p>HMRC is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. This privacy notice describes how we collect and use personal information about you in accordance with data protection law, including the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and the Data Protection Act (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr>) 2018.</p>

<p>We have a separate privacy notice which describes how we collect and use personal information about our staff in relation to their employment.</p>

<p>HMRC is a data controller. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal information about you. HMRC is also the data controller for the Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>), which includes Rent Officers as well as the Adjudicator’s Office.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, when HMRC delivers services in partnership with another public authority, HMRC will be a joint data controller with that public authority.</p>

<p>We are required under data protection legislation to notify you of the information contained in this privacy notice.</p>

<p>It is important that you read this notice, together with any other privacy notice that is provided on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you, so that you are aware of how and why we are using your information.</p>

<p>HMRC is a statutory body with statutory functions and a statutory duty of confidentiality which are set out in legislation in the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005. HMRC will only share your information with third parties where we are legally allowed to do so.</p>

<h2>Data protection principles</h2>

<p>We’ll comply with data protection law. This says that the personal information we hold about you must be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accurate and kept up to date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kept in a form that identifies you for only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kept securely.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19) and your personal information</h2>

<p>The government has put in place a range of extra support and measures to help individuals and businesses affected by coronavirus.</p>

<p>HMRC are responsible for implementing many of these measures which may involve changes to the way that your personal information is processed by HMRC or your employer. HMRC may also be required to share your personal information with other government departments in order to help the government provide targeted support to individuals and businesses.</p>

<p>While some of these measures were carried out quickly due to the evolving nature of the situation, HMRC will always take appropriate account of the requirement to meet its data protection obligations, as set out in this Privacy Notice.</p>

<p>The Information Commissioner’s Office has published advice for individuals about how and when organisations can use your data during the coronavirus pandemic and how to keep your data safe in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/global/data-protection-and-coronavirus-information-hub/" rel="external">Data protection and coronavirus information hub area of its website</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any concerns about how HMRC is handling your personal information, you can email HMRC’s Data Protection Officer at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:advice.dpa@hmrc.gov.uk">advice.dpa@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>The kind of information we hold about you</h2>

<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>

<h3>Transaction monitoring</h3>

<p>In order to protect your data and our services HMRC operates transaction monitoring capabilities. This records how you connect to our systems, and what you do whilst you are on them. Read more information in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transaction-monitoring-privacy-notice">Transaction Monitoring Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

<h3>If you fail to provide personal information</h3>

<p>If you fail to provide certain information when legally required to do so, you may be subject to penalties. We’ll tell you when you are legally obliged to provide information and the consequences of not doing so.</p>

<h3>Change of purpose</h3>

<p>When we obtain information for one of our functions under the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, we may use that information for our other functions.</p>

<p>We’ll therefore use your personal information for any of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Situations">purposes</a> set out and if we reasonably consider that we need to do so.</p>

<h2>How we use particularly sensitive personal information</h2>

<p>Special categories of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this type of personal information.</p>

<p>We will, if necessary, process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where we need to carry out our legal obligations and it is in line with our data protection policy</li>
  <li>where it is in line with our data protection policy, it is substantially in the public interest to do so and necessary for:
    <ul>
      <li>performing our functions as a government department</li>
      <li>the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences</li>
      <li>preventing or detecting unlawful acts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>where we have your explicit consent to do so - we do not require your explicit consent in some <a class="govuk-link" href="#circumstances">circumstances</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-appropriate-policy-document">HMRC appropriate policy document</a> to find out how HMRC processes particularly sensitive personal information.</p>

<h2>Information about criminal convictions</h2>

<p>We’ll only use information relating to criminal convictions or alleged criminal behaviour where the law allows us to do so. This can arise when it is necessary for us to carry out our official functions.</p>

<p>We’ll only collect information about criminal convictions or allegations of criminal behaviour where it is appropriate and where we are legally able to do so.</p>

<p>We’re allowed to use your personal information in this way where it is in line with our data protection policy.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-appropriate-policy-document">HMRC appropriate policy document</a> to find out how HMRC processes information about criminal convictions.</p>

<h2>Automated decision-making</h2>

<p>Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention. We are allowed to use automated decision-making in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where we have notified you of the decision and given you 30 days to request a reconsideration or a new decision not based solely on automated processing</li>
  <li>in limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent and where appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights</li>
</ul>

<p>If we make an automated decision on the basis of any particularly sensitive personal information, we must have either your explicit written consent or it must be justified in the public interest, and we must also put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights.</p>

<p>You’ll not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we notify you.</p>

<h2>Data sharing</h2>

<p>We will, in some circumstances and where the law allows, share your data with third parties, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>third-party service providers</li>
  <li>other government departments</li>
  <li>public authorities and law enforcement agencies both in the UK and overseas</li>

<h2>Data security</h2>

<p>We have put in place measures to protect the security of your information.</p>

<p>Our third-party service providers will only process your personal information on our instructions or with our agreement, and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially and to keep it secure.</p>

<p>We treat the security of your data very seriously. We have strict security standards, and all our staff and other people who process personal data on our behalf get regular training about how to keep information safe.</p>

<p>We have put in place appropriate technical, physical and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect about you.</p>

<p>In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those persons, or agents who have a business or legal need to do so.</p>

<p>We have taken measures to make sure an adequate level of security for personal information processed via our website.</p>

<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and the regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

<h2>Data retention</h2>

<h3>How long we’ll use your information</h3>

<p>We aim to retain your personal information for only as long as it is necessary for us to do so for the purposes for which we are using it and in line with our published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-records-management-and-retention-and-disposal-policy">records management and retention and disposal policy</a>.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we’ll anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we will use such information without further notice to you.</p>

<h2>Rights of access, correction, erasure, and restriction</h2>

<p>You have a number of <a class="govuk-link" href="#rights">rights</a> in relation to the processing of your personal information by HMRC.</p>

<h3>Your responsibility to inform us of changes</h3>

<p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. You need to keep us informed if your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/change-your-personal-details">personal contact information changes</a>.</p>

<h3>Your rights in connection with personal information</h3>

<p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>request access to your personal information (commonly known as a subject access request) - this enables you to know what personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. If you wish to do so you should follow HMRC’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hmrc-subject-access-request">subject access request guidance</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency/about/personal-information-charter"><abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>’s guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>request correction of the personal information that we hold about you - this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected</li>
  <li>request erasure of your personal information - this enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. This does not apply where we are legally obliged to process your personal information or where the processing is necessary for performing our functions. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing</li>
  <li>object to processing of your personal information where you have grounds to object which relate to your particular situation, in which case we will stop processing the personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override your interests, rights and freedoms</li>
  <li>request the restriction of processing of your personal information - this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not have to comply with your requests to the extent that they are likely to prejudice the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, or the assessment or collection of a tax or duty or an imposition of a similar nature.</p>

<p>We can also restrict those rights when we are conducting a criminal investigation and it is a necessary and proportionate measure to avoid obstructing an official or legal inquiry, investigation or procedure, or avoid prejudicing the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties.</p>

<h3>No fee usually required</h3>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we are allowed under the law to charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is manifestly unfounded or excessive.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</p>

<h3>What we need from you</h3>

<p>We sometimes need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and make sure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights).</p>

<p>This is another appropriate security measure to make sure that your personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>

<h3>When HMRC will respond to a request</h3>

<p>We’ll act upon the request without undue delay and at the latest within one month of receipt. We may extend the time to respond by a further 2 months if the request is complex or we have received a number of requests from the same person.</p>

<p>However, in those circumstances we will let you know without undue delay and within one month of receiving your request and explain why the extension is necessary.</p>

<p>These rights are in addition to how you can continue to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact">contact HMRC</a> to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/change-your-personal-details">change your address and personal details</a> or for other purposes relating to your specific concerns. You can also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-voa">contact <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If you wish to exercise your rights in connection with personal information, other than to make a subject access request, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-dpo">contact HMRC’s Data Protection Officer</a>.</p>

<h2>Right to withdraw consent</h2>

<p>We usually process personal data because we are required to do so by law, because it’s necessary for the purposes of our functions as a government department.</p>

<p>In the limited circumstances where you have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time.</p>

<p>We’ll have told you how to withdraw your consent when you provided it and you should follow that process. If not, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-dpo">contact HMRC’s Data Protection Officer</a> specifying how and when you provided your consent, and for what purpose.</p>

<p>Once we’ve received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we’ll no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legal basis for doing so in law.</p>
