</ul>

<h4>Secretariat: [redacted]</h4>

<p>Names of junior officials and the secretariat are redacted.</p>

<p>Participants who were observers and government officials were not consistently recorded therefore this may not be a complete list.</p>

<h2>Situation update</h2>

<p>1. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> provided an update on current declared cases, deaths and geographic spread.</p>

<p>2. China has recently revised case definitions. This makes comparisons difficult.</p>

<p>3. It was reported that diagnostic testing capability in Wuhan is overwhelmed.</p>

<p>4. There is considerable uncertainty around the data, with almost certainly many more cases than have been reported; a reasonable worst case cannot be made reliably under such circumstances.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="World Health Organisation">WHO</abbr> has received some environmental sampling from Wuhan: information on the zoonotic reservoir may be forthcoming shortly.</p>

<p>6. <strong>Following the meeting, authorities in Wuhan announced the suspension of public transport, including outbound trains and flights, from 2am <abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr> 23 January.</strong></p>

<h2>Current understanding of <abbr title="wuhan coronavirus">WN-CoV</abbr>
</h2>

<p>7. There is evidence of person-to-person transmission. It is unknown whether transmission is sustainable.</p>

<p>8. The incubation period is unclear – but appears to be within 5 to 10 days; 14 days after contact is a sensible outer limit to use.</p>

<p>9. It is highly probable that the reproductive number is currently above 1.</p>

<p>10. It is currently estimated that the mortality rate for <abbr title="wuhan coronavirus">WN-CoV</abbr> is lower than for <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome">SARS</abbr>, but it is too early to reliably quantify that rate.</p>

<p>11. There is insufficient information currently on the genetic strain to comment on <abbr title="wuhan coronavirus">WN-CoV</abbr>’s origin.</p>

<p>12. There is no evidence yet on whether individuals are infectious prior to showing symptoms.</p>

<p>13. There is no evidence that individuals are more infectious when symptoms are more severe, but that is likely.</p>

<p>14. There appears to be very little genetic diversity in <abbr title="wuhan coronavirus">WN-CoV</abbr> based on sequences available so far.</p>

<p>15. It is reasonable to argue – based on lessons from <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS</abbr> and <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome">SARS</abbr>, and consistent with exported cases of <abbr title="wuhan coronavirus">WN-CoV</abbr> – that individuals returning from Wuhan are no longer at risk if they show no symptoms after 14 days.</p>

<h2>Summary and review of <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr> conclusions</h2>

<p>16. <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr> does not advise port of entry screening, irrespective of the current limited understanding of the epidemiology.</p>

<p>17. <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr> does not advise use of screening questionnaires, pilot declarations or requiring confirmation of exit screening at Wuhan.</p>

<p>18. <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr> does support public health information efforts via leaflets, posters and broadcast messengers to passengers.</p>

<p>19. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> supports <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr>’s position both on the value of port screening and on monitoring measures.</p>

<p>20. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> would review its position on port screening only if a simple, specific and rapid test was available and was deployable at scale across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Temperature and other forms of screening are unlikely to be of value and have high false positive and false negative rates.</p>

<h2>Transport-related issues</h2>

<p>21. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (<abbr title="European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control">ECDC</abbr>) has just published ‘Risk assessment guidelines for infectious diseases transmitted on aircraft (<abbr title="Risk assessment guidelines for infectious diseases transmitted on aircraft">RAGIDA</abbr>) - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (<abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus">MERS-CoV</abbr>)’.</p>

<p>22. <abbr title="European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control">ECDC</abbr> advises use of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS</abbr> guidelines for the current outbreak, but acknowledges the limitations of its evidence base.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> health readiness and planning</h2>

<p>23. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> currently has good centralised diagnostic capacity for <abbr title="wuhan coronavirus">WN-CoV</abbr> – and is days away from a specific test, which is scalable across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> in weeks. The sensitivity of the test is currently unknown. There are conflicting reports of the sensitivity of diagnostic tests from upper respiratory tract sampling.</p>

<p>24. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is developing advice for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> healthcare workers on testing potentially infected individuals.</p>

<p>25. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> agreed that <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> criteria for testing potentially infected individuals were appropriate, those with symptoms or signs of <abbr title="wuhan coronavirus">WN-CoV</abbr>, and a history of travelling to or living in Wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset, including those who accessed Wuhan healthcare facilities. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> advised that <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> should be ready to revise those criteria as the situation evolves.</p>

<p>26. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> also preparing plans for isolating potentially infected individuals and the follow up of contacts.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>CMO to share the latest iteration of the PHE isolation plan for suspected cases and contacts with some of the SAGE participants, in particular behavioural scientists, to get their view of its proportionality and advice on how to communicate uncertainty, in order to improve subsequent versions</li>
  <li>CMO/DHSC and PHE to consider how NHS primary care facilities might respond to an increase of cases and potential cases</li>
  <li>CMO/DHSC and FCO to work together to ensure consistent messaging on travel advice to/from Wuhan</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>27. There are no practical preventative actions that <abbr title="Her Majesty's Government">HMG</abbr> might undertake ahead of Chinese New Year.</p>

<h2>Triggers for escalating <abbr title="Her Majesty's Government">HMG</abbr> response</h2>

<p>28. Of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s current triggers, there has been infection of healthcare workers and probably some sustained human-to-human transmission, but not geographical spread unconnected to Wuhan.</p>

<p>29. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> agreed that <abbr title="Her Majesty's Government">HMG</abbr> should review its response either in the case of onward spread of <abbr title="wuhan coronavirus">WN-CoV</abbr> person to person outside of China or a severe confirmed case in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>30. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> is unable to say at this stage whether it might be required to reconvene.</p>

<h2>Summary of actions</h2>
