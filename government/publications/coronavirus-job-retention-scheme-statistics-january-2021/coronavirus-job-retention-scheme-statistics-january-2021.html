<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This is the eighth release of Official Statistics on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>). This release provides analysis of claims for periods up to 31 December 2020. The data used includes claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 14 January 2021.</p>

<p>The data for December is incomplete as while claims relating to December should have been filed by 14 January 2021, employers could file claims later with the agreement of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> if they had a reasonable excuse. December claims could also be amended until 28 January. Together these factors are likely to have a small effect on the statistics: it is estimated that the number of claims reported for December could increase by around 1%. The December figures should therefore be considered as provisional and will be revised in a future release.</p>

<p>We will continue to publish statistics on the Job Retention Scheme and the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension in future months. These statistics are Experimental Statistics and are subject to revisions. Further information is provided later in this publication.</p>

<p>The government announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) on 20 March 2020. <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> supports employers in paying their employees. Employers have been able to claim <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> support for employees furloughed from 1 March 2020.</p>

<p>Up to 30 June 2020, <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> provided employers with financial support of up to 80% of their employees’ salaries. This support is capped at £2,500 per month per employee. Employers were also able to claim Employer National Insurance and minimum automatic enrolment pension contributions.</p>

<p>For the period 1 July 2020 to 31 October 2020, except in certain exceptional circumstances, staff who had not already been furloughed under the scheme could not be included in claims for support. Changes to the scheme from the start of August, September and October – as described later in this bulletin – gradually reduced the total level of support available for each furloughed employee up to the end of October.</p>

<p>The government has announced an extension to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> to support individuals and businesses who are impacted by disruption caused by coronavirus (COVID-19). The <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> will remain open until 30 April 2021.</p>

<p>The next release will be published on 25 February 2021.</p>

<h2>Main points</h2>

<p>The key points from this release covering the period to 31 December 2020 are below. Figures for December 2020 are provisional and subject to revision as additional claims for the period are received.</p>

<ul>
  <li>more jobs were furloughed and supported by the job retention scheme in November and December than October. Compared with 31 October, furloughing of staff was higher at 31 December in all sectors, except mining and quarrying</li>
  <li>furloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.9 million employments furloughed. This dropped to 356,400 employments furloughed at 31 October. The number of employments furloughed increased in November to 739,400 at 30 November. Provisional figures show that by the end of December this had decreased to 689,500 employments furloughed</li>
  <li>at 31 October, 737,000 employments were furloughed by large employers with 250 or more employees. This increased to 1.22 million employments furloughed at 30 November. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furloughed decreased to 1.12 million at 31 December</li>
  <li>across the UK, where it was possible to link the data, 1.92 million females were furloughed at 30 November compared with 1.79 million men. Provisional estimates show the number of females furloughed decreased to 1.88 million at 31 December while the number of males increased to 1.85 million</li>
  <li>37% of employers had staff furloughed at 30 November under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> and 13% of employments were furloughed. Provisional estimates show 36% of employers had staff furloughed at 31 December under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> and 13% of employments were furloughed</li>
  <li>compared to 30 November, the number of regions where more women than men were furloughed had dropped, with the North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, London and the West Midlands having more men than women furloughed at 31 December</li>
  <li>there was broad consistency in furlough rates across the nations and regions of the UK at the end of November. London had the highest take-up rate of 15% against the UK average of 13%</li>
  <li>at 30 November, the 25 to 34 age band continued to have the highest number of claimants for both females and males, 429,300 and 430,300 respectively. These figures dropped by 421,100 and 419,000 respectively at 31 December</li>
  <li>the under 18 age band had the highest take up rate for both females and males, 41% and 30% respectively at 31 November</li>
  <li>at 30 November, 1.37 million employments were on partial furlough, 35% of the total employments furloughed. This increased to 1.45 million employments furloughed at 31 December, 38% of the total employments furloughed</li>
  <li>across all countries and regions, at both 30 November and 31 December, the accommodation and food services sector had the highest number of employments furloughed. This was followed by the wholesale and retail sector</li>
</ul>

<h3>About the data in this release</h3>

<p>The data used in this release comprises the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims made up to 14 January 2021. Where possible, this data has been matched with other HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) data to enable additional analysis to be presented. As previously, this bulletin includes figures for the use of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of employments furloughed by day, also broken down by sector and employer size</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the number of employments furloughed by day, for July onwards broken down by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>country and region</li>
      <li>gender</li>
      <li>age</li>
      <li>type of furlough (fully furloughed or flexibly (or partially) furloughed)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Updated and new tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>figures for the use of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension as at 30 November 2020 and preliminary figures for the use of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> as at 31 December 2020, by the following categories:
    <ul>
      <li>employer size</li>
      <li>sector</li>
      <li>country and region, including a gender breakdown</li>
      <li>local authority, including a gender breakdown</li>
      <li>parliamentary constituency, including a gender breakdown</li>
      <li>age, including a gender breakdown</li>
      <li>region and sector</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These statistics have been produced using data from both the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) system. They have been developed taking into account user feedback and requests. We would welcome any further feedback from users. This should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk"><abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>. Responses will then be taken into consideration when developing future releases.</p>

<p>For these statistics, an ‘employer’ is defined as a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme, and ‘employments’ are defined according to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> criteria. Further details are within the <a href="#background" class="govuk-link">background</a> section.</p>

<p>As with previous releases, where we have been unable to match the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data, we have denoted this as ‘unknown’ in the tables within this release.</p>

<p>The release reports a <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> take-up rate for both employers and employments, where appropriate. The take-up rate has been calculated using <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> data, to estimate the eligible population of both employers and employments. An individual with employments with more than one employer is counted once for each employment furloughed.</p>

<p>Rounding has been applied to the figures in the tables accompanying this release, with counts rounded to the nearest 100 and amounts to the nearest million.
 </p>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time</h2>

<p>This section of the release presents the number of employments furloughed each day from the scheme’s start up to 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>The figures for December 2020 are based on claims received to the deadline of 14 January 2021. In some circumstances, late claims can be made with a reasonable excuse and in agreement with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Claims may also be amended until 28 January 2021. Therefore the data for December 2021 is incomplete and should be considered to be provisional. It is estimated that the overall total number of employments furloughed in December will be in the region of 1% higher once all claims are submitted and revisions applied.</p>

<p>While the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced on 20 March 2020, claims for furloughed staff could be made extending back to 1 March 2020 for jobs which had already been furloughed in the period 1 March to 19 March 2020. Therefore, the daily series included in this release starts before the scheme was announced.</p>

<p>The data presented in this section comes from combining detail about furlough periods from the job level data supplied with larger claims (claims with 100 or more furloughed jobs) and the total number of furloughed staff included in each claim.</p>

<p>More details on the methodology can be found <a href="#methodology" class="govuk-link">later in this bulletin</a>.</p>

<p>The data in this release shows the total number of employments furloughed each day from March to December 2020. In contrast, previously, the first three releases of these statistics, published in June to August 2020, reported estimates of the total number of jobs that had been furloughed at any time over the March to June period, based on the latest data available at the time of those releases.</p>

<p>With the introduction of flexible furlough on 1 July, no additional employments could be furloughed under the scheme and this statistical series began reporting estimates of the number of jobs furloughed each day, with additional breakdowns for the last day in each month.</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension was introduced on 1 November 2020, it again became possible to claim support for furloughing jobs that had not been previously furloughed. The next release will amend the figures given for the eligible population for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension to reflect the updated criteria for which jobs could be furloughed from November onwards. This change will have the effect of increasing the reported take-up slightly in those sectors where the number of payrolled employees has fallen during the pandemic.</p>

<p>The chart in figure 1 shows the number of jobs furloughed under claims for support to the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. Key points to note from figure 1 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>initially the number of employments furloughed increased quickly following the announcement of the scheme on 20 March, reaching 4.8 million on 23 March and 6.8 million by the end of March</li>
  <li>following further strong growth at the start of April, the number of employments furloughed increased gradually and peaked at 8.9 million on 8 May 2020. After the early May peak, the number of employments furloughed decreased slowly, before a fall of around 670,000 employments between the end of May and the start of June</li>
  <li>the number of employments that were furloughed then continued to reduce from until the end of October, falling from 6.8 million at 30 June to 2.4 million at 31 October</li>
  <li>latest figures show that the number of employments furloughed increased by 1.3 million at the start of November and increased further to a peak of 4.1 million on 11 November before falling back slightly to 3.9 million employments furloughed at 30 November.</li>
  <li>provisional estimates for December show that the number of employments furloughed reduced in early December before increasing back to 3.9 million on 25 December. The number of jobs furloughed under the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> then reduced slightly to 3.8 million on 31 December.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by industry</h2>

<p>This section breaks down the overall time series included above by the employer’s industrial sector. Figure 2 is a set of charts, one for each of 15 industrial sectors experiencing higher numbers of jobs furloughed. The underlying data for this figure and 6 other sector categories not shown in the chart can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956347/CJRS_Statistics_January_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-2" class="govuk-link">figure 2</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>following on from the last release which covered the period to 31 October, the data shows that furloughing of staff across all sectors, bar mining and quarrying, increased up to 31 December</li>
  <li>furloughing of staff in the wholesale and retail sector peaked on 24 April at 1.85 million employments furloughed. This dropped to 356,400 employments furloughed at 31 October. The number of employments furloughed increased in November to 739,400 at 30 November. Provisional figures show that at 31 December furloughing in this sector had decreased a little lower to 689,500 employments furloughed</li>
  <li>accommodation and food services peaked at 1.65 million employments furloughed on 10 April, this fell to 601,400 employments furloughed at 31 October. There was a net increase of 490,100 to 1.09 million employments furloughed at the start of November, this fell to 1.08 million employments furloughed at 30 November. Provisional figures show that the number of employments furloughed decreased to 1.04 million at 31 December</li>
  <li>the manufacturing sector had a peak of 911,000 employments furloughed on 17 April. This reduced to 188,200 at 31 October. At 30 November the number of employments furloughed increased to 219,400, and provisional estimates show that this figure had risen to 270,200 at 31 December</li>
  <li>in construction, furloughing peaked on 14 April with 723,600 employments furloughed, with this falling to 130,700 at 31 October. This figure increased to 169,700 at 30 November and provisional estimates show that at the end of December the number of employments furloughed had risen further to 193,400</li>
  <li>furloughing in arts and entertainment sector peaked later than other sectors on 15 May 2020 with 455,100 employments furloughed on that date. By 31 October this had dropped to 159,600 employments furloughed. At 30 November the number of employments furloughed had increased to 292,600. Provisional figures show that this figure decreased to 273,800 employments furloughed at 31 December</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by employer size</h2>

<p>In addition to the sectoral breakdown we also provide a breakdown of the number of employments furloughed per day by employer size. The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be furloughed. We assume a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme to be equivalent of an employer.</p>

<p>Presented in figure 3 is a set of charts, one for each employer size band. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956347/CJRS_Statistics_January_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a href="#fig-3" class="govuk-link">figure 3</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across all employer sizes, the number of employments furloughed increased between 31 October and 31 December</li>
  <li>at 31 October, 737,000 employments were furloughed by large employers with 250 or more employees. This increased to 1.22 million employments furloughed at 30 November. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furloughed decreased to 1.12 million at 31 December</li>
  <li>employers with 20 to 49 employments had 303,500 employments furloughed on 31 October. This figure increased to 519,100 employments furloughed at 30 November. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furloughed continued to increase to 550,800 at 31 December</li>
  <li>employers with one employment had 127,900 employments furloughed at 31 October. This increased by 46,900 to 174,800 employments furloughed at 30 November. Provisional figures show that this figure dropped to 173,900 at 31 December</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by Country and Region</h2>

<p>This section provides a geographic breakdown of the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July up to 31 December. This is based on the residential address information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds for employees. This does not directly translate to the employee’s usual place of work, or employer’s centre of operations which may be in a different region.</p>

<p>For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see methodology section for more information).</p>

<p>Presented in figure 4 is a set of charts, one for each region. The underlying data for these charts can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956347/CJRS_Statistics_January_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-4">figure 4</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across all English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the number of employments furloughed increased from 31 October to 31 December</li>
  <li>1.90 million employments were furloughed in England at 31 October. This figure increased through November to 3.21 million at 30 November. Provisional estimates show that the number of employments furlough decreased in December to 3.13 million at 31 December</li>
  <li>in London – the English region with the most furloughed staff from July to December, there were 431,200 employments furloughed at 31 October. This increased to 644,400 employments furloughed at 30 November. Provisional estimates show a decrease in December to 641,200 employments furloughed</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed in Scotland on 31 October was 195,200. This figure increased to 228,300 employments furloughed at 30 November. Provisional figures for December show an increase in the number of employments furloughed to 282,800 at 31 December</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed in Wales was 123,000 at 31 October. This increased to 125,000 employments furloughed at 30 November. Provisional estimates show the number of employments furloughed increased by 30,500 to 155,500 at 31 December</li>
  <li>on 31 October, the number of furloughed employments in Northern Ireland was 68,000. This increased to 79,300 employments furloughed at 30 November. Provisional figures show that the number of employments furloughed continue to increase through December to 94,800 at 31 December</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by gender</h2>

<p>This section provides new analysis showing the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July up to 31 December, broken down by the claimants’ gender. The underlying data for figure 5 can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956347/CJRS_Statistics_January_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>. At present these statistics are only available for 1 July onwards (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#methodology">methodology section</a> for more information).</p>

<p>The key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-5">figure 5</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>since 1 July, more employments have been furloughed with female job holders than where the employee was male</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was female, there were 1.19 million employments furloughed at 31 October. This increased to 1.92 million employments furloughed at 30 November. Preliminary figures show that this number decreased throughout December to 1.88 million at 31 December</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was male, there were 1.14 million at 31 October. At 30 November this had increased to 1.79 million employments furloughed. Preliminary data shows that this figure continued to increase through December to 1.85 million employments furloughed at 31 December</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by age</h2>

<p>This section provides analysis for the number of employments furloughed each day from 1 July up to 31 December, broken down by age band. The claimant’s age is calculated at 1 March 2020. Figure 6 is a set of charts, one for each age band.</p>

<p>The underlying data for figure 6 can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956347/CJRS_Statistics_January_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.

<p>The key points to note from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-6">figure 6</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>figures show that across all age bands the number of employments furloughed increased between 31 October and 31 December</li>
  <li>for employments where the employee was aged 25 to 34, the number of employments was 526,000 on 31 October, the highest across all age bands. This increased by 333,600 to 859,600 at 30 November. Preliminary figures show that this figure continue to rise to 862,700 at 31 December</li>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed with employees in the 18 to 24 age band was 325,300 on 31 October. This increased to 650,800 on 30 November. At 31 December, preliminary data shows that 643,600 employments were furloughed</li>
  <li>where the employee was 65 or over, the number of employments furloughed was 111,900 at 31 October. At 30 November, the number of employments furloughed had risen to 134,400. Preliminary estimates show that the number of employments decreased to 130,300 at 31 December</li>

<h2>Employments furloughed over time by furlough type</h2>

<p>This section provides a breakdown of the overall time series by employments furloughed fully and partially furloughed. On 1 July, the option was introduced for employers to furlough their employees for part of their usual hours, with the employee free to work the remainder. Therefore, the time series shown in figure 7 starts at 1 July.</p>

<p>The underlying data for figure 7 can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956347/CJRS_Statistics_January_2021_-_data_tables.xlsx" class="govuk-link">accompanying spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>The key points to note in <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-7">figure 7</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of employments furloughed on a full-time basis has decreased month on month from July to 31 October where it stood at 1.36 million. The number of employments fully furloughed then increased through November to 2.36 million at 30 November. Preliminary figures show that the number of employments fully furloughed fell in December to 2.29 million at 31 December</li>
  <li>the number of employments claimed for while the employee was working some of their usual hours has remained steady between when this was made possible on 1 July and October. At 31 October there were 977,200. This increased by 391,700 in November to 1.37 million at 30 November. Preliminary figures show that the number of employments furloughed continued to increase in December to 1.45 million at 31 December</li>

<h2>Furloughing by employer size at 30 November and provisional figures for 31 December</h2>

<p>Where it has been possible to match <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data to Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>), we have estimated the size of each employer in terms of number of employees potentially eligible for <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> support.</p>

<p>For this data, we have assumed that <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme is the equivalent to an employer. For some employers, this is not an exact one-to-one equivalent. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls for different groups of employees and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. However, in our view <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.</p>

<p>The employer size has been calculated based on an estimate of the number of employments eligible to be furloughed.</p>

<p>The key points to note from tables <a href="#tab-1a" class="govuk-link">1a</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#tab-1b">1b</a> are, as at 30 November:</p>

<ul>
  <li>37% of employers had staff furloughed at 30 November under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> and 13% of employments were furloughed</li>
  <li>as at 30 November, employers with 20-49 employees were most likely to have claimed under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> to support the furloughing of staff, with 51% of employers of this size having at least 1 employee furloughed</li>
  <li>employers with 250 or more employees had a total of 1.22 million employments furloughed at 30 November, the highest of all employer sizes. However, this represents just 7% of employments eligible across employers of this size</li>
  <li>the figures for the value of claims do not take account of voluntary repayments</li>

<h2>Furloughing by sector at 30 November and provisional figures for 31 December</h2>

<p>This section presents analysis of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims according to the primary economic sector of employers’ activity. The take-up rate is also reported in this table for both employments and employers. This is presented in tables <a href="#tab-2a" class="govuk-link">2a</a>, <a href="#tab-2b" class="govuk-link">2b</a>, <a href="#tab-2c" class="govuk-link">2c</a> and <a href="#tab-2d" class="govuk-link">2d</a>, below.</p>

<p>Key points from tables 2a and 2b, as at 30 November:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the sector with the highest proportion of its workforce eligible for furlough that were actually furloughed was the accommodation and food services sector at 49% followed by arts, entertainment and recreation at 44%. In all, 65% of employers in the accommodation and food services sector and 61% of employers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector were using the furlough scheme at the end of November</li>
  <li>the accommodation and food services sector were responsible for the greatest total value of claims up to the end of November at £812 million. Wholesale and retail, and administration and support services were the two sectors with the next highest values of claims to date by the end of November, with £595 million and £267 million claimed respectively since the start of the extension to <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> on 1 November</li>
</ul>

<h2>Furloughing by countries and regions at 30 November and provisional figures for 31 December, including gender breakdown</h2>

<p>We also provide a geographic breakdown of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims based on the residential address information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds for employees. This does not directly translate to the employee’s usual place of work, or employer’s centre of operations which may be in a different region. For example, an employee who lives in Wales and normally commutes daily to work in Bristol would be included within the count for Wales, rather than for South West England.</p>

<p>Figures 8 and 9 show the number of furloughed employments by each of the English regions, and the totals for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For some employments it has not been possible so far to link the employment to the employees’ area of residence and these are included in the unknown category.</p>

<p>The key points from <a class="govuk-link" href="#fig-8">figure 8</a> are, as at 30 November:</p>

<ul>
  <li>London and the South East accounted for 1.17 million of the furloughed employments</li>
  <li>the East Midlands and West Midlands had a total of 560,300 employments furloughed under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined had 432,600 employments claimed for under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>overall, where it was possible to link the data, across the UK, 1.92 million women were furloughed at the end of November compared with 1.79 million men</li>
  <li>for 154,700 employments it has not been possible to link the furloughed employments to other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data to determine the region of residence and gender of the furloughed employees</li>
  <li>in most countries and regions more women than men were furloughed at 30 November, the exception to this being the London where 311,200 women were furloughed and 333,100 men</li>
</ul>

<h2>Full and partial furlough use by sector at 30 November and provisional figures for 31 December</h2>

<p>The spreadsheet file accompanying this release presents analysis of the number of employments fully and partially furloughed by each employer’s industrial sector.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-20" class="govuk-link">Figure 20</a> shows the number of employments fully and partially furloughed at 30 November by sector. The key points to note, as at 30 November:</p>

<ul>
  <li>224,100 employers had at least one employment on partial furlough</li>
  <li>1.37 million employments were on partial furlough, 35% of the total employments furloughed</li>
  <li>2.36 million employments were fully furloughed, 61% of the total employments furloughed</li>
  <li>missing information on some furloughed employments – for example incomplete or not fully processed spreadsheet-type returns for employers furloughing 100 or more staff – means that whether an employee has been partially furloughed is not known in 4% of cases</li>
  <li>at 52%, manufacturing sector had the highest proportion of employments furloughed partially. The sector with the highest proportion of employments fully furloughed was energy production and supply at 79%</li>

  <li>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined had 131,300 employments furloughed in the accommodation and food services sector</li>
</ul>

<p>The key points to note are, at 31 December:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the accommodation and food services sector continued to have the highest number of employments furloughed across all countries and regions</li>
  <li>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined had 101,700 employments furloughed in the wholesale and retail sector</li>
  <li>45% of the employments furloughed in the North East and North West were in the accommodation and food service, and wholesale and retail sectors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The government introduced the Coronavirus Job Retentions Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) to support employers through the COVID-19 period, this has commonly been referred to as the furlough scheme. It works by providing grants to employers of up to a maximum 80% of salary to a maximum value of £2,500 per employee (until the end of August). Up to the end of July, the scheme also met some of the cost of employer pension contributions and the employer National Insurance Contributions.</p>

<p>The scheme is based around <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) system. For an employer to qualify for the scheme they need to have created a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme by 19 March 2020. In these statistics, an employer is defined as a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>The rules for an employment to qualify to be covered by the scheme are set out in guidance, and two of the key rules are that the furloughed employee must have been employed on 19 March 2020 and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employee by this date. Further information on the qualifying criteria is available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme">online</a>.</p>

<p>The scheme closed to new entrants from 30 June 2020. After this date, employers have only been able to furlough employees they furloughed for a full three-week period prior to 30 June 2020.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the closure of the scheme to additional employees and the minimum three-week furlough period that applied until the end of June, the final date that an employer could have furloughed an employee for the first time was 10 June 2020.</p>

<p>Employers had until 31 July 2020 to make any claims in respect of the period to 30 June 2020. A small number of claims have been made since this date. These claims relate to exceptions as set out in the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> guidance (for example, for employees being furloughed who have been absent from work and who had been paid Statutory Maternity Pay).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme was extended from 1 November 2020. The rules for an employment to qualify to be covered by the extended scheme are set out in guidance. The two key rules are that the furloughed employee must have been employed on 30 October 2020, and the employer must have submitted a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) submission to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the employee between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020, notifying a payment of earnings for that employee.</p>

<p>This may differ where you have made employees redundant, or they stopped working for you on or after 23 September 2020 and you have subsequently re-employed them.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 July</h3>

<p>From 1 July 2020, employers have the flexibility to bring furloughed employees back to work part time. Additionally, employers have the flexibility to decide the hours and shift patterns of their employees – with the government continuing to pay 80% of salaries for the hours they do not work.</p>

<p>From 1 September 2020, the scheme supported 70% of salaries for hours not worked, reducing to 60% from 1 October 2020.</p>

<p>When claiming the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> grant for furloughed hours, employers will need to report and claim for a minimum period of a week. Employers had until 30 November 2020 to submit claims for support from the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Changes to the scheme from 1 November</h3>

<p>The government has announced an extension to <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> to support individuals and businesses who are impacted by disruption caused by coronavirus (COVID-19). The <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> will remain open until 30 April 2021. For claim periods from 1 November 2020 to 30 April 2021, employers with a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme can claim 80% of an employee’s usual salary for hours not worked, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month. The £2,500 cap is proportional to the hours not worked.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link">guidance on applying for support from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and further details</a>.</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p>An employer is defined within this release as a Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Scheme. In some circumstances this does not map directly to what is commonly understood to be an employer. For example, some organisations operate multiple payrolls, and in other situations, a group of companies may pool their payrolls together under one <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> scheme. However, in our view <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes provides a reasonable proxy for employers for the purposes of this release.</p>

<p>An employment is defined within this release as anyone who meets the scheme criteria set out within the published guidance. We have applied this definition in order to keep the presentation simple and the difficulty in separating out Office Holders (such as directors) from what are generally considered employees. Further information on the eligibility criteria is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">background section</a> above.</p>

<h2>Measuring the data</h2>

<h3>Data source and collection</h3>

<p>The data for this release comes from HM Revenue and Customs’ <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims. It covers the whole population rather than a sample of people or companies, and it will allow for more detailed estimates of the population.</p>

<p>The release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. As a result, the series are subject to revisions. Information about what the term Experimental Statistics means is published by the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" class="govuk-link">Office for National Statistics</a>.</p>

<p>Additional data from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Real Time Information system has been matched with <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data in order to produce the statistics released here.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>This publication covers all <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claims made by employers from the start of the scheme up to 14 January 2020 for support for the wages of furloughed staff up to 31 December 2020. The data for December is incomplete as claims relating to December may still be filed; thus, the figures for December should therefore be considered preliminary results and will be revised in future releases.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>This section provides notes on the methodology and implications for interpreting the figures.</p>

<p>The statistics in this release count employments. Therefore (for example), an employee with jobs at two employers will be counted twice if both jobs are furloughed.</p>

<p>The numbers of jobs presented as ‘eligible employments’ and used to calculate take-up figures reflect the criteria for eligibility for the original <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme. They are based on a list of employees employed on 19 March 2020 and included in <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Information submissions for the 2019 to 2020 tax year. Only employments in <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> submissions received by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 19 March 2020 are counted.</p>

<p>Following the criteria for qualifying for the scheme, this is supplemented by a list of people who were employed on 28 February 2020 but who left their job before 19 March and who were later re-employed by the same employer.</p>

<p>The criteria for eligibility for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> were amended for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension. The figures for eligible employments in these statistics will be amended in a future release to reflect the changes.</p>

<p>The central qualifying criteria was that employees must have been employed on 30 October 2020 in order for employers to be able to claim support to furlough them. In addition, employees employed on 23 September under a fixed term contract that expired on or after 23 September could also be furloughed if re-employed.</p>

<p>When the eligible population figures are amended to reflect the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension criteria the take-up rates reported for the sectors most affected by the pandemic can be expected to increase slightly reflecting decreases in the number of people employed in those sectors.</p>

<p>Figures for the number of payrolled employees by sector can be found in the joint ONS/ <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> statistics on Earnings and employment from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information (see related links section).</p>

<p>In this release employers are described as eligible to claim the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> if they employed staff for which the criteria to be eligible for furlough were met. Employers are grouped into size bands in some tables according to the number of employees they had who were eligible to be furloughed under the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<p>In some circumstances <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds incomplete information about employments, for example where a leaving date had not been submitted by employer. In this situation, an estimate of the probability that an individual was employed on the qualifying dates has been used.</p>

<p>The assessment of whether a person was employed on the qualifying dates is based on the methodology used for the joint <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>/ONS statistics release, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/december2020" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Earnings and employment from Pay As You Earn Real Time Information</a>, last released in December 2020.</p>

<p>Employers making claims for 100 or more employees at a time are required to submit the details of the employees furloughed in a spreadsheet-type file. While these claims have been processed from a customer service perspective, the processing of this information for these statistics has been complex and the processing of data on some employments has not been completed.</p>

<p>This is a factor behind the unknown category in the tables. The completeness of this data has gradually improved since the first release, and we expect some further (smaller) improvements.</p>

<p>For this release a modest improvement has been made to the processing of data from the spreadsheet-type files submitted for claims relating to 100 or more employees. This makes fuller use of the data in identifying jobs to more effectively distinguish full and flexible furlough from November onwards. It results in a slight increase in the overall proportion of jobs reported as fully furloughed and mainly affects employers with 250 or more employees.</p>

<p>The geographic and flexible furlough breakdowns of employments include all employees that employers have furloughed where it has been possible to link claim data on furloughed employments to classifying information (such as the employee’s gender and address).</p>

<p>The linking has been performed using employees’ National Insurance numbers to data held within <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Pay As You Earn (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) system. When the employer-submitted National Insurance numbers are not of sufficient quality to be matched with other <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data, the employments have been categorised as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>The geographic breakdowns in the tables and maps use a postcode lookup file from Office for National Statistics (ONS) data to link UK postcodes to geographic areas.</p>

<p>Industrial sector information is based on the Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR) produced by the ONS. Where <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> schemes are absent from the IDBR, we have used sector information from Companies House, linking on employer name where possible.</p>

<p>This provides Standard Industrial Classification codes (<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007">UK SIC 2007</a>) for employers that have made a claim. Where we have unable to determine SIC codes, we have reported the sector as ‘unknown’.</p>

<p>The time series in this bulletin show figures for the number of employments furloughed each day, using all claims submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 14 January 2021.</p>

<p>In producing the time series statistics some challenges had to be tackled. These included dealing with data on amendments to claims and claims for overlapping periods. In addition, claims for 100 or more furloughed staff may include staff furloughed for varying periods.</p>

<p>These factors combined with some incomplete data (as mentioned above) make counting the number of employees furloughed over time complex. The method employed is designed to generally prevent overcounting employments and may in certain circumstances very slightly undercount.</p>

<p>Consequently, for the period to the end of June, the time series presented in this bulletin may typically slightly undercount the number of furloughed employments.</p>

<h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) grants pre-release access to <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/what-we-do/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Official Statistics</a> publications, and in accordance with the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> policy, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmrc-statistics-pre-release-access-list" class="govuk-link">pre-release access has been granted to a number of people</a> to enable the preparation of a ministerial briefing.</p>

<h3>Experimental Statistics status</h3>

<p>The release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.</p>

<p>Rather than waiting until the development work has been completed, the statistics are being published now to involve potential users in developing the statistics. We hope that this encourages users to provide us with their thoughts and suggestions of how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. Comments can be sent by email to <a href="mailto:CJRS.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.Statistics.Enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>More information about what it means for Official Statistics to be classified as Experimental Statistics is available from the <a href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/experimental-statistics-official-statistics-in-development" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Office for Statistics Regulation</a>.</p>

<h3>Office for Statistics regulation review</h3>

<p>These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events. The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several key aspects of the Code of Practice for Statistics and regards them as consistent with the Code’s pillars of Trustworthiness, Quality and Value.</p>

<h3>Strengths of the data</h3>

<p>The data used in this release includes all claims made by employers up until 14 January 2021 for support for the wages of furloughed staff up to 31 December. The data for December is incomplete as claims relating to December may still be filed; thus, the figures for December should therefore be considered preliminary results and will be revised in future releases.</p>

<p>We have linked <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> data to Pay As You Earn Real Time Information data (<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) to provide the additional information presented in this release.</p>

<h3>Revisions</h3>

<p>In future iterations of this statistics release there may be some further revisions reflecting improvements to the data processing and methodology.</p>

<p>The figures in this release incorporate data on claims received by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> up to 14 January 2021 and cover employments furloughed up to 31 December 2020. The data for December is incomplete as late claims for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension may still be filed with reasonable excuse and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> agreement. Amendments to December claims could also be made until 28 January.</p>

<p>Together it is expected that these factors will result in an increase in the level of furloughed jobs reported for December of about 1%. Thus, the figures for December should therefore be considered preliminary results and are likely to be revised slightly upwards in a future release.</p>
