<p>Sector-led improvement is about local authorities supporting each other to improve their children’s services.</p>

<p>The programme aims to improve the overall performance of children’s social care by using the strongest performing local authorities to provide peer support to authorities who are working to improve their services.</p>

<h2>Support available</h2>

<p>There are currently 19 sector-led improvement partners across England. Sector-led improvement partners are local authorities who are rated good or outstanding for children’s services by Ofsted and have been selected through a DfE procurement exercise to deliver this support.</p>

<p>Each sector-led improvement partner has its own approach and expertise in working with other local authorities, along with specific regions they are able to work in.</p>

<h2>Who can access support</h2>

<p>Sector-led improvement support can be accessed by any local authority rated as inadequate or requires improvement.</p>

<p>Support can also be accessed by local authorities rated as good, where there is significant evidence of a decline in performance.</p>

<h2>How to access support</h2>

<p>Use the list of children’s social care sector-led improvement partners to find a partner best placed to support your needs.</p>

<p>The list includes the regions the partners can work in and a summary of the support they can provide.</p>

<p>Once you’ve identified a partner you would like to work with, contact them directly to see if they are able to offer support. The partner will then work with their grant manager in DfE to develop a proposal for work to take place, subject to DfE approval.</p>
