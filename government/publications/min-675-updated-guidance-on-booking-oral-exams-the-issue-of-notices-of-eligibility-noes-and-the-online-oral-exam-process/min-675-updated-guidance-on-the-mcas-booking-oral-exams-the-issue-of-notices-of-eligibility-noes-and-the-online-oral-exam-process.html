<p><strong>Notice to all Shipowners, Owners, Masters, Officers, Cadets and those concerned with maritime training.</strong></p>

<p>This notice replaces MIN 620 (M) Amendment 1 and should be read with MIN 653, MIN 654, MSN 1856, MSN 1857, MSN 1858, MSN 1859 and MSN 1860.</p>

<p>This MIN expires 28 March 2022.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This MIN provides further information on the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s (MCA) process relating to the online oral examination including the new booking process. This MIN also provides information on the process for applying for a Notice of Eligibility (NOE). This MIN has been updated with the latest process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1 The way in which you can book your oral exam is changing. The MCA will be rolling out a new system from April 2022 where you will be able to book your oral exam using the Online Booking Service. The Oral exam is currently being delivered through an online platform.</p>

<p>1.2 This MIN provides an overview of the process of gaining an NOE, booking an online oral exam, undertaking an oral exam and what to do after an oral exam.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> The NOE Process</h2>

<p>2.1 Candidates can currently apply for an NOE by using the appropriate application form and referring to the process detailed in MIN 655 sections 3 &amp; 4 (or subsequent publications). If you are required to submit your Training Record Book (TRB), the full physical book should be sent to the Seafarer Services Branch (to the address provided in the ‘more information’ section of this Notice), but you must retain scanned copies of the overview signature pages from the TRB. These will be required for your oral exam as per section 3.1 of this Notice.</p>

<p>2.2 The application forms and associated Marine Notices:</p>

<p>2.3 If you meet the requirements, an NOE will be issued. Currently this is done through email and you will receive an electronic NOE . Only after you have received your NOE can you book an oral exam though the central team.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Online Oral Exam Booking Process</h2>

<p>3.1 You will need to send your electronic NOE (emailed to you by STC, not a photograph or scan of the NOE), scanned Government ID and, scanned Discharge Book (showing the qualifying seagoing service for the certificate you are applying for  or the past 12 months’ worth of seagoing service, inclusive of all required watchkeeping time, whichever is less. These scans must include the ship stamps and Master’s signature), via email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk">onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>3.2 For OOW, EOOW and ETO (cadet) candidates only, you will also need to send a scan of the following excerpts from your Training Record Book (TRB):</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the start of the TRB, and labeled as page “i” – Contact Details, with the stamp from MCA Seafarers Services Branch confirming they have reviewed your TRB;</li>
  <li>Section 2.2 – Sea Service record (page 11 of the 2018 4th edition); and</li>
  <li>Section 3.3 – Particulars of Ships (pages 23-25 of the 4th edition for the first ship and each subsequent vessel).</li>
</ul>

<p>3.3 Once received, the Online Oral Exams team will check the details and send you a link to the Online Booking Service which will enable you to book your oral. The email will include the Candidate Code of Conduct, instructions for the use of Microsoft Teams and (for Deck Officer candidates) a Radar Plotting Sheet. The Booking Service does not permit bookings within 14 days. For bookings within 14 days please advise the Online Oral Exams Team via email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk">onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>3.4 The Online Booking Service will state the exam type you are eligible for – please check this is correct before selecting a time slot, if your exam type is incorrect, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk">onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>3.5 The available dates and times will display, please select a suitable date and time. Unavailable dates will not be visible. Please complete the contact details section and ensure you provide the email address that you will be logging in from for the oral exam. You will receive an email confirmation containing the Teams link for the date and time you have chosen. Please use this link to join your oral exam.</p>

<p>3.6 If you need to amend / update the email address you will be joining from please email the new email address to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk">onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk</a>. The Online Oral Exams team will then need to send you a new appointment with an updated link. This request must be made at least 3 working days prior to your appointment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> What candidates need to know prior to an Oral Exam</h2>

<p>4.1 The MCA will use Microsoft Teams for the examination. Microsoft Teams will need to be downloaded prior to the start of the examination and you must log onto the meeting at least 10 minutes prior to the designated start time. If you are unable to attend without a valid reason this shall be considered as a fail.</p>

<p>4.2 You will need to ensure you have a suitable room available with the necessary amenities i.e. a clear desk, comfortable chair, water, low ambient noise and is adequately lit with no glare. The IT equipment provided must have a camera and access to a reliable high-speed internet connection (recommended minimum 10mbps), enough for Microsoft Teams to be successfully supported.  Candidates are not permitted to wear headphones during the oral examination.</p>

<p>4.3 If during the exam there are connectivity and/or reliability issues resulting in repeated interruption to IT equipment or connections, this will result in postponement of the exam and require a re-scheduling of the exam and potentially a referral to a face-to-face exam.</p>

<p>4.4 If you want to postpone this appointment, the MCA need at least 14 days email notice. More than 2 cancellations may result in forfeit of the examination fee. If you cancel within 14 days of your appointment, or fail to attend without a valid reason, you will fail the examination by default.</p>

<p>4.5 If you cancel your exam you will need to email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk">onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk</a> for a new link and resubmit your documents.</p>

<p>4.6 For guidance Annex A details the required evidence that must be submitted depending on the oral exam and educational route they have taken.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> After the Oral Exam</h2>

<p>5.1 Once you have completed your oral examination the MCA Examiner will record the result of your oral examination on your NOE. This will be forwarded to you from the Online Oral Exams Team. If you do not receive the NOE within 5 working days of your oral exam, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk">onlineoralexams@mcga.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>5.2 If you have passed your Oral examination, you should submit the completed NOE to the relevant team and supply any outstanding documents or evidence as required by the applicable MSN (noted in the table in section 2.2 of this Notice). Completed NOEs and scans of outstanding documents should be emailed to the relevant team <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:deck@mcga.gov.uk">deck@mcga.gov.uk</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:engineering@mcga.gov.uk">engineering@mcga.gov.uk</a> (as applicable).</p>

<p>5.3 If you fail your oral examination and would like to apply for a resit, you will need to submit your completed NOE along with any supporting documentation by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:deck@mcga.gov.uk">deck@mcga.gov.uk</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:engineering@mcga.gov.uk">engineering@mcga.gov.uk</a>, where you will be required to pay an additional fee via GOV.UK Pay before applying for a new NOE.
