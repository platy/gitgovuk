<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Initial Provisions and General Definitions</h2>

<p>This chapter includes initial provisions applicable to the whole agreement and establishes a free trade area between the UK and New Zealand. It also includes general definitions used, the territorial scope and a provision that considers the effects of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>National Treatment and Market Access for Goods</h2>

<p>This chapter will provide for the liberalisation of trade in originating goods between the UK and New Zealand. It will remove tariffs in accordance with each party’s attached tariff schedule.</p>

<p>The chapter will also help to facilitate trade in goods between the parties by reducing non-tariff barriers. In addition to increasing transparency and cooperation and supporting the World Trade Organization (<abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr>) rules-based system.</p>

<p>The UK and New Zealand have agreed to remove all tariffs on originating goods of the other party.</p>

<p>New Zealand will remove tariffs on all UK goods from the day of entry into force of the agreement.</p>

<p>The UK will in some cases stage the removal of tariffs on New Zealand goods, over a maximum of 15 years. During the transition period, limits will also be applied. Limits will apply to the amount of beef, sheepmeat, butter, cheese and apples which can enter the UK tariff-free from New Zealand.</p>

<p>This is in addition to the general bilateral safeguard mechanism. This will provide protections if industry faces serious injury from increased imports as a direct consequence of the free trade agreement (<abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr>). This applies to all products.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures</h2>

<p>This chapter and its annexes contain provisions related to the rules of origin for goods. These stipulate the criteria a good/product must meet to be considered originating in the UK and so to qualify for the agreed preferential tariff rates.</p>

<p>Rules of origin exist to ensure that only goods genuinely made in countries party to this agreement will qualify for preferential tariffs. This particularly relates to areas where there may be a risk of circumvention or illegitimate competition.</p>

<p>An exporter/importer generally must demonstrate that their product was either wholly obtained, or substantially transformed through processing, in either the UK or New Zealand. If they can demonstrate this, they can qualify for the reduced tariff rates agreed in this <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The rules agreed reflect modern production processes and global value chains. They minimise red tape for businesses ensuring administrative processes are clear, straightforward and low cost.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Customs Procedures and Trade Facilitation</h2>

<p>This chapter contains provisions relating to customs procedures and practices. It ensures that custom procedures in both countries are efficient, consistent and transparent and that the provisions reinforce both countries ability to maintain effective customs control.</p>

<p>This chapter will benefit UK exporters by providing traders with greater certainty about the customs clearance process and minimising the cost of trading.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures</h2>

<p>This chapter sets out how the UK and New Zealand will facilitate trade while protecting human, animal and plant life and health. The <abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary measures">SPS</abbr> chapter will function in parallel with the already established UK-New Zealand Sanitary Agreement, which covers and facilitates our trade in animal products. This chapter therefore focuses on plants, plant products, and processed plant-based foods. The UK and New Zealand have agreed to amend the Sanitary Agreement to cover composite products.</p>

<p>The chapter will allow businesses to benefit from increased transparency and cooperation on each other’s <abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary measures">SPS</abbr> requirements. Provisions on regionalisation will allow for trade to continue when pest outbreaks are safely managed. The chapter also establishes dialogue structures to resolve technical issues and provide routes to ease <abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary measures">SPS</abbr> related market access issues.</p>

<p>This agreement does not create any new permissions or authorisations for imports from New Zealand. Imports will still have to meet the same respective food safety and biosecurity standards in New Zealand and the UK.</p>

<p>The UK and New Zealand both recognise the global threat of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, the chapter also includes strong commitments to cooperate on this important issue, both bilaterally and in relevant international fora. This includes working together on addressing the unnecessary use of antibiotics in the rearing of animals for food production.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Animal Welfare</h2>

<p>This chapter commits the UK and New Zealand to work in close partnership on a range of animal welfare matters. This is the first time New Zealand has agreed an animal welfare chapter in an <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr>. The chapter contains a clear statement that animals are recognised as sentient beings. Provisions then include a commitment to increased bilateral cooperation, as well as working together in international fora to enhance animal welfare standards.</p>

<p>The chapter affirms the Parties’ right to regulate on animal welfare and to set their respective policies and priorities for the protection of animal welfare.</p>

<p>It also includes forward leaning non-regression and non-derogation clauses on animal welfare between the UK and New Zealand. This commits both countries to not lower their animal welfare standards or make exceptions for their producers in a manner which materially affects trade.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Technical Barriers To Trade</h2>

<p>New Zealand and the UK have committed to ensuring that any relevant regulations they introduce are non-discriminatory and do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade. These provisions will preserve each country’s ability to take measures to fulfil legitimate objectives, including for the protection of health, safety and the environment.</p>

<p>New Zealand and the UK will increase cooperation and strengthen our understanding of each other’s technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures. This can help to unblock barriers to trade and reduce the likelihood of future ones forming.</p>

<p>We have agreed cooperation provisions on cosmetics, medical devices and human and veterinary medicines, as well as an Annex on Wine and Distilled Spirits.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Trade Remedies</h2>

<p>Trade Remedies provide a safety net for domestic industry against unfair trading practices or unforeseen surges in imports of goods.</p>

<p>The chapter includes a general bilateral safeguard mechanism. This allows for temporary tariff increases or a suspension of further tariff liberalisation to protect industry from serious injury or threat thereof, as a result of increased imports through the <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr>. Bilateral safeguards can be applied by either party and to all categories of product.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Cross-Border Trade in Services</h2>

This provides long-term certainty and transparency for service suppliers exporting to and operating in the New Zealand market.</p>

<p>We have agreed a Professional Services and Recognition of Professional Qualifications annex. This will encourage regulators of all regulated professions to establish and operate routes to recognition. This will support UK professionals to have their qualifications recognised in New Zealand and vice versa. It also ensures UK lawyers can practice foreign (including UK) and international law in New Zealand using their existing qualifications.</p>

<p>We have agreed a sectoral annex on International Maritime Transport Services. This is unprecedented for New Zealand and will benefit UK shipping companies and ships flying the UK flag. We have also agreed an annex on Express Delivery Services that ensures UK suppliers operating in New Zealand can do so on a level playing field.
  
In the associated services schedules, New Zealand has locked in market access commitments. These provide greater transparency and legal certainty than New Zealand has provided in any of its previous <abbr title="free trade agreements">FTAs</abbr> (excluding its relationship with Australia).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Domestic Regulation</h2>

<p>The Treaty includes a chapter on Domestic Regulation which aims to reduce ‘behind the border’ barriers. It ensures that businesses have greater certainty around the authorisation procedure for obtaining or amending a licence to allow them to supply services in each other’s markets.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>State-Owned Enterprises and Designated Monopolies</h2>

<p>Organisations controlled by governments and engaged in commercial activities are often known as State-Owned Enterprises (<abbr title="state-owned enterprises">SOEs</abbr>). This chapter seeks to ensure that <abbr title="state-owned enterprises">SOEs</abbr> do not distort trade because of their relationship with government. It reassures businesses of each nation’s long-term commitment to guarantee that <abbr title="state-owned enterprises">SOEs</abbr> operate in accordance with commercial practices.</p>
