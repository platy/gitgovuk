<p>The bidding prospectus for Green Freeports in Scotland set out how ports can apply for Green Freeport status and further details on our proposals for the policy. With the publication of the bidding prospectus, the Scottish and UK governments launched the bidding process to select Green Freeports in Scotland.</p>

<p>In the bidding prospectus we invited stakeholders to submit via email any questions they had about the Green Freeports policy and bidding process. This document aims to cover the key questions and themes that we received. Any potential applicants will be able to contact greenfreeports@gov.scot to request clarification on any of the content of the bidding prospectus until 29 April 2022. A summary of answers will be published online no later than 20 May 2022.</p>

<p>Successful locations will subsequently be announced in the summer following a fair, open and transparent selection process.</p>

<p>The bidding period will close on 20 June 2022. We look forward to receiving bids from interested parties via the online portal by 12.00am on Monday 20 June 2022.</p>

<h2>Tax</h2>

<p><strong>1.</strong> The prospectus states that Employer NICS reliefs are available from April 2022. Can you confirm whether this is an error and should read 2023?</p>

<p>A: No, this is not an error.  The relief will legally be available from April 2022, and it will last until at least April 2026.  As paragraph 3.2.1 of the prospectus makes clear, however, the exact duration of all the tax reliefs will be set out in the Outline Business Case guidance, which will be published once successful bidders have been announced.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong>	Please could more detail be provided on the arrangements for the retention of incremental non-domestic rates? It would be helpful to understand the process that local authorities will need to follow to benefit from this measure. As this represents a potentially significant revenue stream for a Green Freeport, with implications for funding arrangements that need to be documented in the bid, we respectfully ask for a response to this question as soon as possible.</p>

<p>A: As set out in the Green Freeports bidding prospectus, the relevant local authorities will be able to retain all of the non-domestic rates growth within that area above an agreed baseline, for a guaranteed period of 25 years. Once the bidding process is concluded, the Scottish Government will establish a baseline of non-domestic rates income within the Green Freeport area using, amongst other information, the valuation data for the existing lands and heritages contained within the delineated tax site. The income that can be retained for reinvestment, meeting borrowing costs or targeted spending will be the growth in net non-domestic rates income above that established baseline (i.e. the increase in non-domestic rates income resulting from an increase in the tax base, less any reliefs). In parallel with this baselining exercise, the Scottish Government will also work with the winning bidders on the detailed process and arrangements for implementing the scheme, within the context of the successful applicants’ broader strategic approach.</p>

<h2>Planning</h2>

<p><strong>3.</strong>	The streamlined planning approach section makes no reference to Marine Scotland, yet they are the responsible authority for marine licensing, under which most port developments would be permitted. Is the Scottish Government planning to engage in activities that will streamline marine planning and replicate e.g. masterplan consent areas?</p>

<p>A: The streamlining foreseen specifically by the Planning (Scotland) Act 2019 relates to onshore planning: but there is also a streamlining project under way within Marine Scotland to assess and implement ways to maximise efficiencies within the context of the existing marine licensing regime.  This streamlining project will cover the marine elements of port and harbour development.</p>

<h2>Customs</h2>

<p><strong>4.</strong>	There appears to be some overlap between questions 1.10, 1.11 and 1.12. Please could you advise if question 1.12 relates to additional Customs Sites within the outer boundary, or only if there are any Customs Sites outside of the outer boundary? If the former, please could you clarify the difference between question 1.12 and 1.10?</p>

<p>A: Thank you for highlighting this potential overlap. To improve clarity, we have decided to reword questions 1.10 and 1.11 in the prospectus and application form, as shown below, and to delete question 1.12:</p>

<p>1.10       Please provide rationale for all proposed customs sites, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What you expect each customs site to be used for?</li>
  <li>What outputs/benefits do you expect each site to generate?</li>
  <li>How do they relate to each other and the wider Green Freeport?</li>
</ul>

<p>1.11       Does your Green Freeport propose any customs sites outside the Outer Boundary? If yes, please provide a written submission with clear and specific reasoning justifying such additional proposals and how it relates to the wider Green Freeport.</p>
