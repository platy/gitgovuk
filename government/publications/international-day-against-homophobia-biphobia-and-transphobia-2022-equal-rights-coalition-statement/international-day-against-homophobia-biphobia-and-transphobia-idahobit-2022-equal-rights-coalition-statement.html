<p>The Equal Rights Coalition (<abbr title="Equal Rights Coalition">ERC</abbr>) is pleased to join governments and civil society around the world to commemorate the International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexphobia and Transphobia (<abbr title="International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexphobia and Transphobia">IDAHOBIT</abbr>).</p>

<p>On this day, the Equal Rights Coalition reiterates its commitment to the full enjoyment of human rights for all, no matter people’s sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics. We will continue to step up our efforts in combatting homophobia, biphobia, intersexphobia, and transphobia, and in promoting the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and dignity of all human beings.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Equal Rights Coalition">ERC</abbr> will continue to work for decriminalization of consensual same-sex sexual conduct and gender identity and expression until everyone can be who they are, love who they love, and participate in society in a full, equal and safe manner.</p>

<p>This year´s <abbr title="International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexphobia and Transphobia">IDAHOBIT</abbr> theme ‘Our Bodies, Our Lives, Our Rights’ underlines what LGBTIQ+ communities worldwide are experiencing: that people with diverse sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics face violence, stigma and exclusion based on their bodies and their lives. The global anti-gender and anti-LGBTIQ+ pushback is exacerbating this trend. <abbr title="Equal Rights Coalition">ERC</abbr> states will continue to unite to combat this global pushback and defend human rights for all globally.</p>

<p>As we continue to consolidate our alliance, we want to take a moment to commemorate <abbr title="International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexphobia and Transphobia">IDAHOBIT</abbr> and draw the world’s attention to what needs to be done before we can all live in freedom and equality. And to celebrate proudly the power of diversity, which makes our societies more resilient, healthy and prosperous.</p>
