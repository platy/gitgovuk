<p>This strategy updates the version published in December 2016. This updated strategy acts as the formal response to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/universal-credit-experimental-statistics-future-developments">Universal Credit official statistics consultation</a>.</p>

<p>We will investigate the opportunities to release statistics and management information on Universal Credit as outlined in this release strategy. This is designed to ensure that statistics are placed into the public domain in a clear and controlled way.</p>

<h2>Consultation</h2>

<p>The Universal Credit official statistics consultation ran from 13 September to 24 October 2017. The response to this consultation helped identify and prioritise the future development of Universal Credit statistics set out in this release strategy, subject to the availability and quality assurance of the data.</p>

<p>The scope of the consultation covered several regular publications including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/universal-credit-statistics">Universal Credit experimental statistics</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/benefit-cap-statistics">Benefit cap statistics</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/employment-and-support-allowance-outcomes-of-work-capability-assessment">Outcomes of Work Capability Assessments</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/benefit-sanctions-statistics-2017">Benefit sanctions statistics</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/children-in-out-of-work-benefit-households--2">Children in out-of-work benefit households</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequency and formats</h2>

<p>Experimental Universal Credit official statistics are currently released each month, with the exception of the households on Universal Credit statistics which are released biannually. As roll-out of Universal Credit progresses, we will review the frequency of these publications. We publish on the same day as the wider Labour Market Statistics, produced by the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>).</p>

<p>The publications on ‘Benefit cap: number of households capped’, ‘Benefit Sanctions statistics’ and ‘<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>: outcomes of Work Capability Assessments including mandatory reconsiderations and appeals’ statistics are released quarterly.</p>

<p>The ‘Children in out-of-work households’ statistics are released annually.</p>

<p>These statistics are all released in the following formats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in a written report, containing key headline statistics and charts</li>
  <li>in a set of spreadsheet tables containing key statistics by broad geography</li>
</ul>

<p>With the exception of the ‘<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>: outcomes of Work Capability Assessments’, and ‘children in out of work benefit households’ publication these statistics are also available through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a>, which allows users to obtain their own bespoke detailed statistics.</p>

<p>Monthly experimental Universal Credit official statistics can be viewed on an interactive map. Quarterly benefit cap statistics and biannual statistics of households on Universal Credit are also available on an interactive dashboard of key statistics by region.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>The range of information released within the experimental official statistics has increased since December 2013.  This has followed quality assurance of data held within the systems which administer Universal Credit.</p>

<p>Since December 2016, the Universal Credit official statistics consist of 4 main measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of initial claims made to Universal Credit</li>
  <li>the number of people actually starting Universal Credit</li>
  <li>the number of people on Universal Credit on the second Thursday of each month (this ‘count date’ matching the count date used by the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> for the number of people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance)</li>
  <li>the number of households on Universal Credit</li>
</ul>

<p>The Universal Credit official statistics currently cover the Universal Credit system first introduced in Ashton-under-Lyne in April 2013.  They include the national expansion of Universal Credit which started in February 2015.</p>

<p>Some or all of the 4 Universal Credit official statistics measures are broken down by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>geography</li>
  <li>claimant characteristics – gender, age (both single year of age and age bands)</li>
  <li>whether in employment or not in employment</li>
  <li>duration on Universal Credit</li>
  <li>the conditionality regime a claimant is on at the count date</li>
</ul>

<p>From May 2016 Universal Credit full service began its roll out to other Jobcentre Plus offices and expanded across the country to include all claimant types. Figures on full service claimants were incorporated into the measures in the November 2016 publication.</p>

<p>We’ve designated these, following guidelines set out by the UK Statistics Authority, as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" rel="external">experimental official statistics</a>.</p>

<h2>Areas for future exploration</h2>

<p>We anticipate that additional breakdowns will be included within these regular official statistics publications as quality assurance of data from the Universal Credit systems is progressed.</p>

<p>It is not possible to provide a precise timescale or definitive list of additional breakdowns at this stage however we hope to investigate the following new data areas in the following releases:</p>

<p>1. Universal Credit experimental statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>household earnings</li>
  <li>flows between conditionality groups including flows on and off Universal Credit</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition we hope to investigate expanding the following areas with additional information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>breakdown of starts by different geographies</li>
  <li>durations on Universal Credit</li>
  <li>households with children</li>
  <li>claimants on the health journey</li>
  <li>Universal Credit full service sanctions (quarterly data)</li>
  <li>households on Universal Credit affected by the removal of the spare room subsidy</li>
  <li>alternative payment arrangements</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Children in out-of-work benefit households:</p>

<ul>
  <li>further breakdowns of conditionality groups of Universal Credit claims in payment</li>
  <li>age breakdowns for children</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Benefit cap statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>households capped on Universal Credit at latest point in time</li>
  <li>geography breakdowns</li>
  <li>family type</li>
  <li>amount of Universal Credit Capped</li>
  <li>households with children</li>
  <li>cumulative number of households ever capped on Universal Credit and off-flows from the Universal Credit cap</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Outcomes of Work Capability Assessments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Universal Credit claimants – number of referrals for Work Capability Assessments and outcome including reason for assignment to limited capability for work or limited capability for work and work-related activity</li>
</ul>

<p>The department will also consider the requirement for a regular statistical release series on entitlement to housing support for 18-21 year olds in Universal Credit.</p>

<p>The department is keen to continue to receive feedback from users on which breakdowns are a priority for them.  Please email your feedback to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:team.ucos@dwp.gov.uk">team.ucos@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Universal Credit and the claimant count</h2>

<p>Universal Credit affects the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> claimant count. The effects are set out in the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/outofworkbenefits/methodologies/jobseekersallowanceuniversalcreditandtheclaimantcountchangestothemeasurementoftheclaimantcount" rel="external">Jobseeker’s Allowance, Universal Credit and the Claimant Count: Changes to the Measurement of the Claimant Count</a>.</p>
