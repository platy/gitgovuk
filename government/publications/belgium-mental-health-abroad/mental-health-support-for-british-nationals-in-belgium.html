<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Visiting Belgium</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Before you travel</h3>

<p>Check out our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist">Foreign Travel Checklist</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-advice-for-people-with-mental-health-issues">Travel and Mental Health</a> advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development office to help you prepare for travel and staying safe abroad.</p>

<p>Make sure you have a valid European/Global Health Insurance Card (EHIC or GHIC).</p>

<p>If you are going to travel to Belgium, ensure you have a valid EHIC or GHIC depending on what applies to your situation.  You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/" rel="external">apply on the NHS website</a> or by phone:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Telephone: 0300 330 1350
<br>Outside UK: +44 191 283 3909
<br>
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm and on Saturday, 9am to 3pm (UK time)
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Get insurance</h3>

<p>Take out comprehensive travel insurance before you travel. An EHIC/GHIC does not cover all costs that you might incur and you may have to cover some of this yourself, which can be expensive.  Some insurance companies will exclude cover for a mental health condition, so it is worth shopping around.</p>

<p>If you need specialist insurance, organisations such as MIND have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/guides-to-support-and-services/insurance-cover-and-mental-health/getting-the-right-insurance/#.XPjcllxKiUk" rel="external">information on insurance cover</a> including a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/guides-to-support-and-services/insurance-cover-and-mental-health/specialist-insurers-for-pre-existing-conditions/#.XPjcslxKiUl" rel="external">specialist insurance providers</a>.</p>

<p>The FCDO information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">foreign travel insurance</a> also includes contacts for more information and help finding specialist insurance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Prescriptions</h3>

<p>If you are on holiday in Belgium or have moved to Belgium without yet obtaining health insurance (mutuelle/ziekenfonds) and you require a repeat/replacement prescription, you should approach a local pharmacy who will be able to provide advice.</p>

<p>Carrying a copy of your prescription can help to find the exact or similar medication.
You will have to pay for your prescription at the pharmacy.  Your EHIC/GHIC does not cover the costs for prescriptions and you will not be able to claim a refund.</p>

<p>Most pharmacies in Belgium operate on regular working hours with a telephone number operating 24 hours a day.  If a pharmacy is closed the nearest open pharmacy will be displayed on the door/window.  You can also use their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pharmacie.be/fr/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">online service</a> to search for pharmacies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Accessing help as a resident</h2>

<p>You can choose to see either your local GP (médecin généraliste/huisarts) for a referral or find a psychiatrist, psychotherapist or counsellor directly.  The advantages of seeing your GP in the first instance would be to avoid long waiting lists and to ensure your mutuelle/ziekenfonds will assist in costs.</p>

<p>If you wish to contact a psychiatrist, psychotherapist or counsellor directly, you can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://search.helena.care/en/" rel="external">helena</a> website, the website of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://en.bfp-fbp.be/" rel="external">Belgian Federation of Psychologists</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://abp-bvp.be/" rel="external">Belgian Association for Psychotherapists</a>.  You can filter by language.  Further English-speaking psychologists and therapists in Belgium can also be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.chsbelgium.org/en/index.php/contact-chs" rel="external">CHS Mental Health Services Centre</a>.</p>

<p>Many health insurance funds partially repay the costs of psychological or psychotherapeutic help but the conditions and amounts differ – you should check directly with your health care cover.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Compulsory hospitalisation in Belgium</h2>

<p>Similar to the UK, in Belgium people can be hospitalised without having given their consent, if they are deemed a danger to themselves or others.   Laws or practices on compulsory hospitalisation (mise sous protection/gedwongon opname) in Belgium are different to that in the UK, in both procedure and law.
Compulsory hospitalisation can happen if a doctor concludes that any of the three conditions or all of the three conditions are met:</p>

<ol>
  <li>you have been diagnosed with a mental illness</li>
  <li>you put your health and safety at serious risk or you pose a serious threat to people’s lives or integrity</li>
  <li>the treating doctor cannot see any possibility of any other appropriate treatment</li>
</ol>

<p>The process can happen in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>general procedure: Family members or a GP can submit a request to the justice of the peace (JP) (vrederechter/juge de paix) together with a medical report.  Within 24hrs of the submission, there will be notification of a hearing with the JP for the final decision to be made.  This normal procedure happens in only a minority of cases; the most forced hospitalisations are emergency procedures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>emergency procedure: In these cases, the police initiates proceedings by reporting to the public prosecutor’s office (parket/parquet) in the first instance.  Depending on the verdict of the public prosecutor’s office, the patient will then, await to have a hearing with the justice of the peace and a psychiatric assessment in hospital.  This must take place within 5 days of admission to hospital. It is possible that you might have been brought to another hospital for this assessment. Usually the hearing takes place in a room at the hospital, although sometimes it can be at the district court</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, there is a maximum observation period of 10 days before a hearing must take place in front of a justice of the peace.</p>

<p>Initially, the hospitalisation will be enforced for a period of 40 days. At least 15 days before the expiry of this 40-day period, a further medical assessment is made and sent to the justice of the peace to determine if there is a need for a further stay. The patient must again appear before a justice of the peace who will then decide if further hospitalisation is required.</p>

<p>For these hearings, you will have a Pro Bono (Pro Deo) lawyer assigned. You are free to change this pro-bono lawyer for a private one, or to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.barreaudebruxelles.info/index.php/en/individuals/legal-aid" rel="external">apply for another pro bono lawyer</a> through the Legal Aid Bureau.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?country=Belgium&amp;serviceType=lawyers" rel="external">Find an English speaking lawyer</a>.</p>

<p>Certain patient rights continue to apply.  Your lawyer can inform you about the following rights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visits and contact</li>
  <li>correspondence</li>
  <li>privacy</li>
  <li>legal representation</li>
  <li>freedom of movement</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from legal fees, there may also be other costs involved, such as administrative, hospital and court costs. If and how much you have to pay depends on your income and the judgment of the court. The major part of the costs for the hospitalisation will directly be paid by health insurance (mutuelle/ziekenfonds). The remaining costs will need to be covered by yourself/family.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Guardianship</h2>

<p>If you are living in Belgium and the Belgian health authorities decide you are unable care for yourself due to poor health, they may appoint a legal guardian (Bewindvoerder/Administrateur) to look after your interests. The justice of the peace (Vrederechter/Juge de Paix) will usually try to appoint someone close to you, a spouse or other family member. If this is not possible, they will appoint a qualified professional.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Returning to the UK</h2>

<p>If you are abroad and need help to return to the UK, the FCDO can try to assist in making plans for your return. This could involve contact with family or friends, social services, NHS teams and/or charities and NGOs.</p>

<p>If you have been away from the UK for an extended period, or if you have never lived in the UK, you may not be automatically entitled to state benefits, a pension, free NHS hospital treatment or assistance with higher education fees. To be eligible, a British national must meet certain residence requirements and/or make the appropriate national insurance contributions. This includes the habitual residence test.  You can find more information on gov.uk on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits">benefits</a> and services, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/working">employment</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/tax">tax</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/education">education</a>. You can get free, independent advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" rel="external">Citizens Advice Bureau</a>.</p>

<p>Hospital repatriation is possible in many cases and costs will normally be covered by travel Insurance or personal funds.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Your data protection and the FCDO</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-protection-act-2018">Data Protection Act 2018</a> and GDPR control how personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government.
