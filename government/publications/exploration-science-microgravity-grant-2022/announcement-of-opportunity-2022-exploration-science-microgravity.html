<h2>Announcement of Opportunity</h2>

<p>2022 Exploration Science AO Grant Call Guidance</p>

<p>Closing date for full proposals: 11th April 2022, 16:00.</p>

<h3>Scope of Call</h3>

<p>The UK Space Agency is making funding available to support the preparation of experiments that use microgravity and other space environment research platforms.</p>

<p>The purpose of this AO is to support UK based researchers who have already secured facility access to microgravity and space environments research platforms, primarily through the ESA SciSpacE Programme.</p>

<p>This scheme is open to academics from the UK or overseas, working at UK Research Organisations, who have already been selected by ESA or other bodies for access to microgravity or space environments facilities.</p>

<p>The UK Space Agency welcomes proposals for resources and related costs to support experiment preparation and implementation. This could take the form of (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for academics including promising early career researchers, Post Doctorate
Research Assistants and lead academics</li>
  <li>Support for PhD Students (please contact us for further details)</li>
  <li>Travel costs to facilitate data collection</li>
  <li>Equipment costs (to support experiment preparation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Exploitation of experiment data is no within the scope of this call and is generally within the remit of UKRI.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: This call is in preparation for financial year 2022/2023 – 2024/25. The UK Space Agency as yet, does not know how much it will be able to allocate to this activity.</p>

<h3>Aims and objectives</h3>

<p>This aim of the call is to continue to develop the UK’s microgravity community and their research outcomes, and maximise the return on the UK’s investment in Microgravity Facilities, through the ESA Exploration programmes.</p>

<p>This call will fund UK based academic researchers who have already secured facility access to microgravity and space environments research platforms, with priority awarded to those who have secure access through the ESA SciSpace Programme, of which the UK is a member state.</p>

<p>This call aims to provide UK national support to selected experiments in preparation and execution. Prioritisation will be given to experiments scheduled to be executed in 2022 - 2024 (with an understanding that delays can occur).</p>

<h3>Timetable</h3>

<p>AO Published expected to be 11 th February 2022</p>

<p>AO Closes no later than 16:00 – 11 th April 2022</p>

<p>AO Results announced Expected to be w/c 16 May 2022</p>

<p>Grants to start likely to be mid June 2022</p>

<h3>Award value</h3>

<p>This funding is from the UK Space Agency, though it is administered through STFC on behalf of the UK Space Agency. Awards will be made in line with standard STFC criteria, in accordance with their financial rules (including the standard FEC application and for the length of the grant – please make sure you and your institution are fully aware of these before application -
https://www.ukri.org/apply-for-funding/before-you-apply/your-responsibilities-if-you-get-
funding/meeting-ukri-terms-and-conditions-for-funding/#contents-list ).</p>

<p>Awards should be in line with studentship, PDRA/researcher salary costs or justified grant related costs.</p>

<p>Reasonable costs will be permitted, but it should be noted that all costs must be justified and of a reasonable length related to the experiment. The appropriateness and justification of sums requested will form part of the assessment criteria.</p>

<p>UKSA acknowledges the breadth and scope of microgravity research and wishes to use this allocated funding in the most effective way possible. Therefore reserves the right to negotiate changes to proposed funding requests on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: This call is in preparation for financial year 2022/2023. The UK Space Agency as yet, does not know how much it will be able to allocate to this activity.</p>

<h3>Award length</h3>

<p>The maximum award length is three years with an anticipated start date of no earlier than 1 st June 2022.</p>

<p>Applications are expected to justify the length of the grant against the experiment timeline and execution.</p>

  <li>The UK Space Agency also reserves the right to cancel or reduce the award in the event of the project being cancelled or descoped.</li>
  <li>The UK Space Agency reserves the right to terminate the grant within a 6 month notice period should it be deemed programmatically or strategically advisable to do so.</li>
  <li>The Grant holder agrees that as a condition of receiving any Funds they shall provide the UK Space Agency with all information, reports, statistics, study results and data reasonably requested by the UK Space Agency to track and assess progress and performance of the Project.</li>
  <li>In conjunction with the UK Space Agency, the Grant Recipient shall monitor the delivery and success of work packages it has allocated Funds to throughout the Grant Period to ensure that the aims and objectives of the work package are being met and that this agreement is being adhered to.</li>
  <li>The Grant Recipient shall not publish any material referring to the Funds or this agreement without the prior written agreement of the UK Space Agency.</li>
  <li>The Grant Recipient shall acknowledge the role of the UK Space Agency as grant funder in any materials that refer to the Project and in any written or spoken public presentations about the Project as it relates to this agreement. Such acknowledgements (where appropriate and with UK Space Agency’s written consent shall include the UK Space Agency’s name and logo (or any future name or logo adopted by the Grant Funder).
• In using the UK Space Agency’s name and logo, the Grant Recipient shall comply with all reasonable branding guidelines issued by the UK Space Agency from time to time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grant payment</h3>

<p>Payments will be made to the lead research organisation quarterly and the first payment will be made once the formal offer letter has been accepted by the research organisation.</p>

<p>The final payment will be made after the submission of the final reconciliation report at the end of the grant. These processes are administered by STFC, please note that UKSA remains the funder.

<p>The review panel will be made up of programmatic and technical representatives from the UK Space Agency and independent academic assessors across a broad range of science disciplines who will consider all proposals against the evaluation criteria outlined above. The panel will make a final assessment and ranking of proposals. The panel, in finalising the awards to be made, may take account of the distribution of awards in terms of subject, type of award and institution.</p>
