<p>17 December 2021</p>

<p>Dear Lorand,</p>

<h2>Trade and Agriculture Commission commissioning letter: request for advice on UK-Australia <abbr title="Free Trade Agreement">FTA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Thank you for accepting the role of Chair of the new, independent Trade and Agriculture Commission (<abbr title="Trade and Agriculture Commission">TAC</abbr>).  The <abbr title="Trade and Agriculture Commission">TAC</abbr> will play an important role in scrutiny of the UK’s new Free Trade Agreements and will be an invaluable source of expert information for the Government, Parliamentarians and the public.</p>

<p>I am writing to request the <abbr title="Trade and Agriculture Commission">TAC</abbr>’s advice on the UK-Australia Free Trade Agreement (<abbr title="Free Trade Agreement">FTA</abbr>), in line with the provisions of section 42 of the Agriculture Act 2020 (“S.42”). I am publishing this letter on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>In line with the <abbr title="Trade and Agriculture Commission">TAC</abbr> Terms of Reference, which can be found on gov.uk, I am writing to request your advice on whether, or to what extent, the measures in the UK-Australia <abbr title="Free Trade Agreement">FTA</abbr> – as signed on 16th December 2021 – that are applicable to trade in agricultural products are consistent with the maintenance of UK levels of statutory protection in relation to</p>

<p>a) animal or plant life or health,</p>

<p>b) animal welfare, and</p>

<p>c) environmental protections</p>

<p>I would like to request that this advice be produced on a chapter-by-chapter basis, though the <abbr title="Trade and Agriculture Commission">TAC</abbr> is welcome to include additional sections it sees fit.</p>

<p>In producing its report I would envisage that the <abbr title="Trade and Agriculture Commission">TAC</abbr> would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conduct an initial assessment of which chapters it considers to be in / out of scope (i.e., which contain measures relating to trade in agricultural products)</li>
  <li>Consider all relevant measures within in-scope chapters</li>
  <li>With regard to relevant measures within in-scope chapters, provide responses to the following questions:
    <ul>
      <li>Does the UK-Australia <abbr title="Free Trade Agreement">FTA</abbr> require a change to UK domestic statutory protections in relation to animal or plant life or health; animal welfare; and, the environment?</li>
      <li>Does the UK-Australia <abbr title="Free Trade Agreement">FTA</abbr> affect the UK Government’s ability to set statutory protections in these specified areas?</li>
      <li>Does the UK-Australia <abbr title="Free Trade Agreement">FTA</abbr> underline any existing UK domestic statutory protections – or in some instances go beyond them – in relation to: animal or plant life or health; animal welfare; and the environment?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Trade and Agriculture Commission">TAC</abbr> should also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider the landscape of statutory protections across the UK, reflecting on all parts of the UK.</li>
  <li>Consult those it considers may assist in the preparation of this advice and note in the advice – where relevant – those whom the <abbr title="Trade and Agriculture Commission">TAC</abbr> consulted.</li>
  <li>Given the Government’s trade agenda is of interest to many, consider how to make its advice accessible and readable to a non-technical audience.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is anticipated that advice received from the <abbr title="Trade and Agriculture Commission">TAC</abbr> will be laid before Parliament in its own right and reflected in the Government’s own section 42 report.</p>

<p>I would request that your advice be submitted electronically to the <abbr title="Trade and Agriculture Commission">TAC</abbr> Secretariat (TACSecretariat@trade.gov.uk) by no later than 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>The Rt Hon Anne-Marie Trevelyan</p>

<p>Secretary of State for International Trade
  &amp; President of the Board of Trade</p>
