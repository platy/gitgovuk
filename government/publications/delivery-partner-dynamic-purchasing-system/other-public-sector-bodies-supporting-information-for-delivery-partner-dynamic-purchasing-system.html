<h2>What the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> does</h2>

<h3>How housebuilders apply to join <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> is divided into categories. Housebuilders apply to join the large or small sites categories.  The large sites category is for sites that will deliver over 70 homes and the small sites category is for sites that will deliver under 70 homes.</p>

<p>As part of their application housebuilders are asked to identify the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/41a6085e281542a8b0e227c587f7e29c/" rel="external">geographic areas and the types of development they are interested in undertaking</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivery-partner-dynamic-purchasing-system/delivery-partner-dynamic-purchasing-system-supporting-information#procurement-process">Read more about how housebuilders are procured through the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Categories</h3>

<p>When housebuilders apply, they can tell us about the types of residential development they are (or are not) interested in.</p>

<p>Development types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>General residential-led development</li>
  <li>Sites including conversion, refurbishment and works to listed buildings</li>
  <li>Sites to be delivered via a construction and direct contracting approach</li>
  <li>Sites including Extra Care and other forms of supported living</li>
  <li>Sites providing 100% Affordable Housing</li>
</ul>

<p>As a first stage in the shortlisting process,  sites should be offered only to those who are interested in that specific type of site.</p>

<p>For example, a site of 60 homes in the North West which requires refurbishment of a listed building would only be offered to <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members who were selected as a member of the small sites category and had expressed interested in working in the North West on refurbishment and conversion projects.</p>

<p>Before issuing a call for competition, Homes England will generate for you the list of <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members who should tender for each site based on size of site, geographic area and development type.</p>

<h3>Lead and deputy contacts</h3>

<p>Each Panel Member has nominated a lead and deputy contract for their company.  This information is updated as and when required and is available to signed up users of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>. Please ensure that you are using the most up-to-date information.</p>

<h3>E-Tendering System</h3>

<p>All calls for competitions must go through the Homes England E-Tendering system, Pro Contract. Access to the E-Tendering system will be provided once you have signed the access agreement enabling you to use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>How to register</h2>

<p>We make the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> available to our public sector partners free of charge, although we will ask you to sign up to an Agreement with us prior to using it. Each <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member has signed a <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement. This agreement details the terms and conditions they must adhere to as a <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-to-use-the-delivery-partner-dynamic-purchasing-system-to-procure-housebuilders">Follow these steps to register to use the DPS</a></p>
</div>

<p>Homes England have prequalified all housebuilders appointed to the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> and we will maintain ongoing checks on their eligibility.</p>

<p>To appoint a housebuilder for a specific site you are required to run a call for competition to select your preferred partner. You must run all calls for competition through ProContract, our procurement portal.  You will be provided with access to this when you sign up with us to use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>. You should run the call for competition independently but we will make information and guidance available.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> can be used to procure a developer who will pay a land value for a site you wish to market and will take responsibility for all stages of the development process from design and construction to marketing and sales.  You can also use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> to procure a contractor to undertake the design and construction of homes that you wish to retain.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will run from 6 September 2021. We expect it will run for up to 10 years.</p>

<p>Applications to join the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> remain open and so active local developers who may be interested in tendering for a specific site can be invited to join at any time. Homes England will assess these applications in a maximum of 15 days.</p>

<h2>How the Call for Competition process works</h2>

<p>Further information on the call for competition process is in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/access-agreement-for-the-delivery-partner-dynamic-purchasing-system"><abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Access Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>The Call for Competition stage is used to select a <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members to deliver a specific site. You will be required to use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Portal (currently ProContract) to manage your call for competition. As part of the sign-up process to use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> you will be provided with access to the Homes England ProContract system.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> has a growing membership of housebuilders and Homes England will generate the initial tender list based on the size of the site, the location and the type of development required.</p>

<p>The call for competition process is divided into two stages, that is designed to identify no more than 6 companies who will submit a full tender.</p>

<h3>Stage 1 – Expression of interest</h3>

<p><abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members will be asked to respond on a yes / no basis to questions relevant to the project.  Questions can be tailored to the site or other requirements, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you able to meet project timescales?</li>
  <li>Are you able to meet specific project design, sustainability or Modern Methods of Construction criteria?</li>
</ul>

<p>All <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members who respond positively to this stage should then be issued with the full tender documents.</p>

<h3>Stage 2 – Tender</h3>

<p>Full tender documents must  be issued to all companies returning a positive Expression of Interest.</p>

<p>If more than 6 companies are interested in tendering for the site, the tender stage should be divided into two parts. If less than 6 companies are interested it can be undertaken as a single stage.</p>

<p>Where the tender is divided into two stages, stage 1 will consist of an initial tender response where the interested <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members should be asked to provide an initial tender response to cover certain key elements of the tender and enable selection of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members most suited to complete a full tender.</p>

<p>For example, housebuilders could be asked to  submit their initial draft of the following items as their stage 1 submission. Submission requirements for stage one should be varied to suit project requirements but may consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a constraints plan</li>
  <li>scheme composition in terms of house types, numbers and values</li>
  <li>identification of key project risks and how these would be mitigated</li>
  <li>details of any proposed Affiliated Entity to enter into the Project Agreement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initial tender submissions should  be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation methodology set out in the ITT.  Successful <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members will be selected to proceed to submit a full tender unsuccessful members should receive feedback.</p>

<p>Successful <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members who complete a Full Tender Submissions will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation methodology set out in the ITT. Any information submitted at stage 1 can be developed further for submission at stage 2.  Following evaluation unsuccessful <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members should receive feedback.</p>

<h3>Tender Financial Appraisal</h3>

<p>Financial assessment of <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members is undertaken by Homes England as they apply to join the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>, but financial requirements for specific project can vary and so during the Tender Stage financial appraisals should be carried out to assess whether Members have sufficient financial strength and capacity to undertake the relevant project.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members can be required to demonstrate a higher level of turnover and net assets than they  were asked to evidence in their application to join the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>. Other financial information can also be assessed on a project specific basis. You are responsible for undertaking  Project specific financial appraisal of your selected bidders.</p>

<p>Further information on the processes used by Homes England is available in the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivery-partner-dynamic-purchasing-system/delivery-partner-dynamic-purchasing-system-supporting-information#introduction">Draw down contracts for specific sites</a></p>

<h2>Evaluation criteria</h2>

<p>We expect that you will use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> to deliver homes in a range of ways and the evaluation criteria should be  varied to suit the nature of the individual projects procured through the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The exact weighting of the evaluation criteria and sub-criteria should  be detailed within the project specific ITT and should reflect the relative importance of the criteria to the success of the project.</p>

<p>The evaluation methodology to be used for each individual project must be made clear in the ITT for the relevant Call for Competition.</p>

<h3>Evaluation criteria and weightings for construction works</h3>

<p>The following are suggested as draft evaluation criteria for a construction or direct development project where the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member is providing a design and construction or construction service only and is being paid to do that.  This criteria should  be tailored on a project specific basis and specific weightings set for  sub criteria.</p>

<h3>Quality and price for construction works</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Employer’s Requirements</li>
  <li>Planning</li>

<p><strong>Total score:</strong> 100%</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Evaluation criteria and weightings for development works</h3>

<p>The following are suggested as headline evaluation criteria for a development project where the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member is providing a full end to end development process and is paying a land value for the site. This criteria should  be tailored on a project specific basis and specific weightings set for sub criteria.</p>

</ul>

<p>Weighting: 50% (plus or minus 30%)</p>

<p><strong>Total score:</strong> 100%</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Insurance</h3>

<p>Insurances held by <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members should also be checked on a project specific basis, for example, Contractors All Risks Insurance is not available on a general basis, it is linked to a specific project.  Insurances may also need to be raised in some cases. At the time of appointment to the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Members self-certified that already have, or can commit to obtain prior to the commencement of the contract, the following insurances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employers Liability – £10 million</li>
  <li>Public Liability – £10 million</li>
  <li>Contractors All Risks – £20 million large sites category and £10 million small sites category</li>
</ul>

<h3>Health and safety</h3>

<p>Panel Members have demonstrated through the tender process that they have the necessary skills, capacity, resources, experience, competence and organisational capability to deliver the type of projects covered by the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Each <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Member will have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>successfully met the assessment requirements of a construction-related scheme in registered membership of the Safety Schemes in Procurement (SSIP) forum – or an equivalent scheme</li>
  <li>demonstrated their health and safety procedures</li>
</ul>

<p>You will retain the legal responsibility as a construction Client under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 to carry out competency checks on all appointees to a project and ensure that the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member is suitable for the type of work to be undertaken.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Consortia and sub-contracting</h3>

<p>Appointed <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Members must lead all Call for Competition tenders for work procured through the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>  and will be responsible for the delivery of all works procured through the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>. However, <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Members will use sub-contractors to deliver projects.</p>

<p>A key role of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Member is to put together the most efficient and effective supply-chain to deliver each project procured through the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Affiliated Entities</h3>

<p><abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members can contract at project stage in the name of an approved Affiliated Entity, thereby allowing <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members to deliver individual developments through their subsidiaries where this is appropriate.</p>

<p>You must provide approval to any Affiliated Entity before they can sign the project specific draw down contract with you. The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement provides further information on this.</p>

<h3>Joint venture companies</h3>

<p>At call for competition stage, you may also use the affiliated entity option to request the bidders to form a joint venture between the successful bidder and you as the contracting authority.  In this case you would hold a share in any Approved Affiliated Entity. Details of any required joint venture should be stated in the call for competition documents.</p>

<p>The project draw down contract would then be entered into by the Joint Venture Company in which the shareholders are the winning bidder and the contracting authority.</p>

<h3>Soft market testing and early market engagement</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> remains open for housebuilders to join at any time.  Homes England will assess any new applications in 10 days if all information is available or 15 days, if verifications are required.</p>

<p>Because the application process remains open early market engagement is extremely important to alert housebuilders to forthcoming opportunities so they have time to apply to join the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> prior to your Call for Competition commencing.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to undertake early market engagement prior to launching any formal tender process.</p>

<p>If there are uncertainties about the viability of a site or the best way to bring a site forward, early market engagement can also be undertaken to gain advice on viability. This can be undertaken informally and can involve existing <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members and local active housebuilders who may be interested in joining the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> in order to bid for a specific site.</p>

<p>Any early market engagement should be undertaken as a separate process that occurs before the formal call for competition process commences.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members, initial contact should be made with the nominated contacts available to signed up users of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>A selected number of these can be contacted to ask if they are interested in providing early stage advice. In many cases it has been very useful to hold an informal briefing meeting to provide information about the site and to gain initial responses/reactions as to the best way to progress with the development.</p>

<p>A site visit can be linked to the meeting and this provides a valuable opportunity for other stakeholders, to be involved.</p>
