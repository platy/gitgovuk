<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document has been issued in connection with the opening of the application process to join our Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System (<abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>).  The application process consists of completion of a Selection Questionnaire (<abbr title="Selection Questionnaire">SQ</abbr>) available through our Pro Contract System. Full information on how to apply to the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> is available within Pro Contract.</p>

<p>Homes England means Homes England (the name adopted by the Homes and Communities Agency).</p>

<p><strong>About Homes England</strong></p>

<p>We are the government’s housing accelerator.  We have the appetite, influence, expertise and resources to drive positive market change. By releasing more land to developers who want to make a difference, we’re making possible the new homes England needs, helping to improve neighbourhoods and grow communities.  We welcome partners who share our ambition to challenge traditional norms and build better homes faster. Join us in breaking new ground to make this happen.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>&nbsp;Contract Background</h3>

<p>The Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will be a key tool to enable Homes England’s development activity, it will allow us to engage with a wider section of the development market than has previously been possible because suppliers will be able to join the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> as we bring sites forward for disposal. We expect that we will use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> to procure a developer for most of our residential led sites going forward.</p>

<p>We will use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> where we need to control the speed, quality or type of development through our Building Lease.  We may choose not to use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> for smaller sites or those where procurement compliant processes are not required, for these sites we will dispose of them via freehold disposal processes.</p>

<p>We do not expect our commercial or commercially led sites will be disposed of via the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Housebuilders and organisations who undertake Residential Development (suppliers) can apply to join the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.  Successful suppliers will become members of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> and will then be invited to tender to develop specific Homes England sites under the Homes England Building Lease or invited to tender to develop sites owned by other public sector bodies (<abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr>) who may choose to procure a housing developer through the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>We intend to appoint suppliers who can undertake all stages of the residential development process, can work under our Building Lease and pay a land value for the sites they develop.</p>

<p>The Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will be used to procure housing led development on land owned by public sector bodies.  Housing led development is development that is predominantly residential but may include subsidiary uses for example commercial, retail, educational or leisure.</p>

<p><strong>Homes England’s Residential Development activity</strong></p>

<p>Homes England’s Development Directorate is focussed on delivering developable sites into the market. We do this by acquiring, de-risking and disposing of land to developers and housebuilders who then build and market homes on that land.  Housebuilders and developers pay a land value for our sites and build out under our Building Lease.</p>

<p>Our portfolio of landholdings is over 8,800 hectares with (currently) 600 active projects, making us the largest master developer in the country.</p>

<p>Homes England only becomes involved where ‘Market failure’ exists, Market failure means a site would or could not be developed by private sector housebuilders alone.   This market failure can include coordination breakdown between multiple landowners on larger sites; high upfront costs and risks of undertaking enabling works or installing infrastructure; and viability challenges on complex or brownfield sites.</p>

<p>To resolve these market failures and create developable land that we can offer to the market, we acquire those sites, we invest in them by undertaking enabling works and creating planning certainly where necessary.  Once a site is  viable and deliverable, we will procure a Developer or Housebuilder through the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>, who will pay a land value and build out homes under Homes England’s Building Lease which mandates policy objectives such as design quality, use of Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) and pace or speed of delivery.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>The Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will build on the work already done through the Homes England’s Delivery Partner Panel (DPP3). The main aim of both is to make the procurement of a supplier (housebuilder or residential developer) as quick and efficient as possible through processes that work for private sector Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members as well as for Homes England and other public sector bodies (<abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr>) who will use the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>DPP3 reached the end of its contacted term on the 30 July 2021 and current members of DPP3 will need to apply for a place on the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> if they wish to continue to work with us and our Partners.</p>

<p>The Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will operate for up to 10 years and we expect that over that time it will be used to procure homes with a total Gross Development Value (GDV) of up to £20 billion. It is likely that many of the projects procured through the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will have long build out periods, for some large sites this could be up to 10 years.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>How to apply to join the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>We have evaluated applications from the initial application period (24 May to 25 June 2021). and successful suppliers will become members of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will operate from 6 September 2021 and we, and other public sector bodies, will then begin to offer sites for which Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> suppliers will be invited to tender.</p>

<p>From 6 September 2021 the application process will reopen, and additional new suppliers will be able to apply to join the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.  The application process will remain open and new suppliers will be able to apply at any time during the life of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>, which we expect to be 10 years.</p>

<p>Applications will be evaluated by Homes England within 10 working days, unless further information needs to be sought from the applicant, in this case a decision will be provided within 15 working days.</p>

<p>Suppliers are requested not to make speculative applications but to join only when a site of interest to them is coming forward for disposal. Homes England Sites planned for disposal can be found on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-homes-england-sells-land-for-housing-led-developments">Land Hub.</a></p>

<p>The selection questionnaire has been designed to identify capable and active house builders and developers with a track record of undertaking residential development and an active interest in working with Homes England and <abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr>’s to deliver homes. It is important that Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> suppliers actively bid for the opportunities offered.</p>

<p>We are keen to encourage smaller regional developers and Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (<abbr title="Small and Medium Sized Enterprises">SME</abbr>’s) and we have created the Small Sites Category to make it easier for smaller companies, who may  not have a previous track record of working with us to apply.</p>

<p><strong>What we expect from suppliers joining <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr></strong></p>

<p>Suppliers appointed to Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will be expected to cover all areas of activity required to develop housing, including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the raising of development finance</li>
  <li>obtaining planning permission</li>
  <li>supply chain management</li>
</ul>

<p>design and construction of houses, design and construction of buildings and infrastructure to support housing, sales and marketing of homes, aftercare and maintenance.</p>

<p>The full Scope of Works is available in this document at <a class="govuk-link" href="#scope-of-activities">Section 4.0</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>
<abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> categories of membership</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> is divided into two main categories to cover sites of different sizes.  There is a separate selection questionnaire for each size category.</p>

<p>Categories are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sites that will provide more than 70 homes – for suppliers who wish to deliver larger sites.</li>
  <li>sites that will provide up to and including 70 homes – suppliers who wish to deliver smaller sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not expect the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will be used commonly for sites of below around 20 homes.</p>

<p><strong>Large and small sites categories</strong></p>

<p>The application processes are similar but suppliers applying for the large sites category will need to demonstrate a track record of delivering sites of 70 plus homes and those applying for the small sites category will need to demonstrate a track record of delivering sites of 15 to 70 homes.</p>

<p>For the large sites category, we will fully check all the information provided at the point of application.  For the smaller sites category, the information should be self-certified by the supplier at application.  In the event the supplier is then shortlisted to deliver a specific site the information will all be fully checked at that point and if it is incorrect or out of date the supplier will lose the opportunity to deliver that specific site and may lose their place on the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> until the information is updated or corrected.</p>

<p>Financial checks for the two categories will also differ in terms of level of turnover or nett assets required.</p>

<p><strong>Geographic sub-categories</strong></p>

<p>The Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will cover all areas in England but suppliers will be offered the opportunity to express interest in 9 regional subcategories to show which areas of the country they work in. Once the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> is operational we will ensure suppliers are only invited to tender for sites within their geographic areas of operation.  Suppliers can change their geographic preferences at any point as their business grows and develops.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Development type sub-categories</strong></p>

<p>We expect that a wide range of development opportunities will be offered to Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> suppliers, we want to ensure <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members are only offered opportunities that are of interest to them.  We have established 4 categories of development types and suppliers are asked to self-certify to say which development types they are interested in undertaking.  The development type categories are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>general residential-led development</li>
  <li>sites including conversion, refurbishment and works to listed buildings</li>
  <li>sites to be delivered via a construction and direct contracting approach</li>
  <li>sites including Extra Care and other forms of supported living</li>
  <li>sites providing 100% Affordable Housing</li>
</ul>

<p>We plan to add additional categories over time and all <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members will be invited to express interest in any additional categories.  Suppliers can change their development type preferences at any point as their business grows and develops.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>&nbsp;Design Quality, Sustainability and use of Modern methods of Construction (MMC)</h3>

<p><strong>Delivering design quality</strong></p>

<p>Homes England is committed to raising the quality of design on our residential sites.</p>

<p>To this end, we have adopted <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.udg.org.uk/publications/othermanuals/building-healthy-life" rel="external">building for a healthy life (<abbr title="building for a healthy life">BHL</abbr>)</a> as a method for promoting and assessing design quality.  It is a place-based, industry-accepted tool that is easy to understand and provides an effective way to engage with our partners. It supports the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-design-guide">national design guide</a>, with 12 considerations that focus on sound, urban design principles  in a format that is simple to use and that provides a metric against which schemes can be assessed.</p>

<p>We will require all schemes developed on our land to be <abbr title="building for a healthy life">BHL</abbr> compliant and we will set the threshold score required within tender documentation at each call for competition.  <abbr title="building for a healthy life">BHL</abbr> encourages the use of Design Review and Suppliers should be aware that this will be required on our sites.</p>

<p>We expect <abbr title="building for a healthy life">BHL</abbr> to be used as a prompt for discussion, throughout the design process, from inception/ site acquisition through to delivery on site, and beyond, rather than as a checklist that a scheme is ‘marked’ against when the design is complete.  It allows the design team to ask the right questions at the right time in the design process; to formulate the layout design, from  strategic considerations such as Integrated Neighbourhoods through to the more detailed elements (Streets for All), in order to create better, more distinctive places everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Accelerating delivery through Modern Methods of Construction (MMC)</strong></p>

<p>Homes England is committed to working closely with a diverse range of development partners, who share our ambition to maximise the uptake of Modern Methods of Construction (MMC).  Our Partners will be required to help us meet our objectives as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/homes-england-strategic-plan-201819-to-202223">Homes England’s strategic plan</a> to increase productivity in the housing market through use of MMC.</p>

<p>Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Members will be expected to focus on making significant use of Modern Methods of Construction (MMC). This may include meeting specific Government or Agency targets promulgated from time to time throughout the duration of the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.  Specific requirements for each site will be detailed in site specific tender documentation at each call for competition.</p>

<p>Where homes are being produced using MMC, our Building Lease requires all development partners to work with Homes England’s appointed Compliance Inspectors to assign the MMC system to one (or more) of the seven category definitions of MMC.</p>

<p>Specifically, the seven categories are based on the framework developed by a specialist sub-group of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government’s MMC cross-industry working group. For more detail and the full report see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-methods-of-construction-working-group-developing-a-definition-framework">Modern Methods of Construction working group: developing a definition framework.</a></p>

<p><strong>Sustainability </strong></p>

<p>Homes England has a statutory objective of ‘contributing to the achievement of sustainability and good design in England’.</p>

<p>We recognise the commitments of an increasing number of housing developers and our delivery partners who are showing high levels of ambition toward achieving a net zero carbon future and building homes in a manner that protects or enhances the natural environment.  </p>

<p>The building of new homes and communities will be subject to compliance with building regulations and local planning authority requirements. If there are additional sustainability requirements, then these will be included in the call for competition for a specific site.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>How a <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member can tender for a specific site</h3>

<p>Once a supplier is accepted as a member of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> they will be invited to tender for specific development sites through a call for competition process.  We currently use Pro Contract to manage this process and Schedule 6 of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement (available in Pro Contract) details this, further information is provided below.</p>

<p>Opportunities to tender for Homes England sites or those brought forward by <abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr> will be offered to <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> suppliers via Pro Contract.</p>

<p><strong>The call for competition process</strong></p>

<p>The call for competition is a 2-stage process.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Suppliers in the relevant categories will be invited to Stage 1 which will offer them the opportunity to express interest in bidding for the site.  This will consist or a simple yes or no responses to specific questions to ensure the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member has fully understood the nature of the development opportunity.  These questions will form a capability statement.  At this stage <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members will also be asked to confirm their Selection Questionnaire information provided when they applied to join the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> is up to date and correct.</p>

<p>Tender documents will be issued to all interested suppliers but where there is a lot of interest in a specific site, we may ask for tender responses in 2 stages.  The first stage consisting of an initial response to certain sections of the tender, these sections will be assessed to select the companies who will then complete the full tender.</p>

<p>We hope this initial stage will be useful because it will provide early feedback to suppliers on their proposals and will ensure that only a reasonable number are invited to tender.  We would not generally expect more than 6 companies to be invited to complete a full tender.</p>

<p>We will fully check all Selection Questionnaire information at this stage and if any information is found to be incorrect or out of date the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member will lose the opportunity to tender.  A project specific financial check will also be completed at this stage to ensure the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member is able to fund the specific development opportunity.   Further information on this is provided in the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Draw down contracts for specific sites</strong></p>

<p>All development works procured though the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will be subject to a separate project specific contract.  We use the Homes England Building Lease to control development on our land. We also have a shorter simpler version of the Building Lease that we use on smaller and simpler sites or where we have less need to control delivery of policy requirements such as use of MMC, Quality standards or delivery at Pace.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> is also used by a wide range of Other Public Sector Bodies (<abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr>) to procure development and construction of homes. <abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr>’s tend to make use a of a wider range of draw down contracts and may use other forms of draw down contracts as well as the Building Lease. All draw down contracts are listed as Template Contracts in Schedule 4 of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement.</p>

<p>Please note these are standard documents that, although tailored to meet the needs of a specific project are not amended and applicants to the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> should review these prior to joining.  The documents are provided within our Pro Contract system.</p>

<p>There may also be some opportunities for <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> members to bid for schemes that require them to work to different contractual arrangements, for example, many local authorities and Registered Providers have used the Delivery Partner Panel (DPP3) to procure a residential contractor, for this reason DB 2016 Design and Build Contract 2011 and the NEC3 suite of contracts are also included.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span>How Other Public Sector Bodies can use the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>In addition to driving housing delivery on land our ownership, Homes England also plays a key role helping government departments and Other Public Sector bodies (<abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr>) unlock their surplus land for housebuilding.  We will make the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> available to <abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr> who wish to use it.  We expect local authorities and registered providers will make extensive use of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> as it will provide them with a sound procurement route to appoint a housebuilder or developer to build homes on the land that they own.</p>

<p>In order to use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> the <abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr> will sign up to an access agreement with Homes England, once this is done Homes England will share all necessary information with the <abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr> to enable them to use the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> independently.  <abbr title="Other Public Sector Bodies">OPSB</abbr>’s will use Pro Contract to manage call for competition processes to appoint a <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member for a specific site.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement will cover all partners in their use of the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>, but partners will be responsible for putting in place separate site-specific draw down contracts with any appointed <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> member.</p>

<p>Partners using the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will be responsible for all works they procure through the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>; Homes England will have no liability for works procured by partners.

<abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> agreement and administration</h2>

<p>The Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will operate for a period of 10 years and will be administered by the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Manager, who is a member of Homes England’s Development Directorate.</p>

<p>All suppliers will be required to sign up to the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement.  This is a standard document that governs the place of the supplier on the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>, it cannot be amended, and the supplier will be required to sign this electronically to submit their application.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> is provided in full within the Pro Contact Application system but for information key features of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement are:</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement sets out the rules and obligations that apply to you as a member of the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement is not a development or construction contract.  Development or construction contracts will be awarded further to competitions run under the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Details of how competitions will be run are set out in Schedule 4 of the Agreement (Call for Competition – procedure).  There is no guarantee that you will be awarded any work under the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.  Even if we run a competition, we are not obliged to subsequently award any contract.</p>

<p>Full details of any further competition are not included in the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement.  These will be set out in the invitation to tender for the specific project.</p>

<p>You may be asked as part of any further competition:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to provide evidence of any information you self-certified when you became a member; and/or</li>
  <li>to demonstrate your organisation meets a certain level of project specific financial and economic standing greater than the requirements to be met when you applied to the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Details of the type of development or construction contract that we (or another public body as relevant) may enter with you are set out in Schedule 3 of the Agreement (Template Contracts).</p>

<p>If requested to do so, you must provide a parent company guarantee in respect of any contract you are awarded under the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Affiliates can enter into any agreement you are awarded under the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> but there are conditions which must be fulfilled, and you will be responsible for that affiliate.</p>

<p>Details of how we will manage the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> are set out in Schedule 5 (<abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Management).</p>

<p>Members must always ensure that the information they provided when they joined the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> is kept up to date.  Failure to do so could result in a member being suspended or disqualified from the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>There will be an annual financial check on members’ financial position to ensure that members continue to meet the financial standards required for membership.</p>

<p>Your liability to us is limited to £1million.  However, liability under any development or construction agreement you may enter with us or another public body through the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will be greater and will reflect the specific project.</p>

<p>You will need to comply with provisions relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anti-bribery</li>
  <li>modern slavery</li>
  <li>freedom of information</li>
  <li>equality, diversity and inclusion</li>
</ul>

<p>We have the right to terminate your <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement in certain circumstances including (but not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are disqualified from the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> for any reason (such as failing an annual financial assessment, or you provided fraudulent information when you applied to become a member).</li>
  <li>you materially or persistently breach any of your obligations under the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement.</li>
  <li>you breach the obligations relating to confidentiality, data protection or freedom of information; or</li>
  <li>there is a conflict of interest.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement is terminated, this does not automatically terminate any contracts you have been awarded in any further competition under the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>.  Those contracts will be subject to their own termination provisions.</p>

<p>If you enter a development or construction contract with a public body (and not with us), under the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr>, that public body will be solely responsible for the contract.  We will have no liability for that contract.</p>

<p>Individual sites procured through the Delivery Partner <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> will be built out under our Building Lease, or other form of contract, and this will take precedence over the <abbr title="Delivery Partner Dynamic Purchasing System">DPS</abbr> Agreement once the supplier has entered into a Building Lease in relation to a specific site.</p>
