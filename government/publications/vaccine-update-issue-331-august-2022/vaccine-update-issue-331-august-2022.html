<h2>Polio vaccination campaign London area</h2>

<p>Following the detection of poliovirus type 2 (<abbr title="poliovirus type 2">PV2</abbr>) in London sewage the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has declared a national enhanced polio incident response and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) have advised that an urgent supplemental polio vaccination strategy is now required to respond to this public health emergency.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advise that, as well as the ongoing catch-up offer, a supplementary Inactivated Polio Vaccine (<abbr title="Inactivated Polio Vaccine">IPV</abbr>) campaign should be implemented for children aged 1 to 9 years in London, including those with a complete course of polio vaccination.</p>

<p>This means all children aged 1 to 9 years in London will now be offered a dose of <abbr title="Inactivated Polio Vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccine irrespective of vaccination status to prevent cases of paralysis due to poliovirus and to interrupt transmission of Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type 2 (<abbr title="Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type 2">VDPV2</abbr>) in the community.</p>

<p>To support uptake, a focused campaign will start now in the London boroughs where <abbr title="Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type 2">VDPV2</abbr> has been detected to date. This includes Barnet, Brent, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Islington and Waltham Forest as a priority, with a view to rapidly extending to all London boroughs.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/polio-vaccination-campaign-letter">polio vaccination campaign letter</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Checking for polio vaccination in your child’s personal child health record (<abbr title="personal child health record">PCHR</abbr>) or Red book</h3>

<p>Since 2004, all polio vaccines have been given as combined products, so you may not see the word polio in the record. The vaccinations can be labelled as any of the following:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Age</th>
      <th scope="col">Vaccine</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Babies</td>
      <td>Primary course of polio vaccine consists of 3 doses given at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age: <br> 6-in-1 <abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b/ hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr> (used since September 2017) <br> or <br> 5-in-1 <abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b">DTaP/IPV/Hib</abbr> (used prior to September 2017)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Toddlers</td>
      <td>Pre-school booster at 3 years and 4 months: <br> 4-in-1 <abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio">DTaP/IPV</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Teenagers</td>
      <td>Teenage booster given in school year 9 or 10, at around 14 years of age: <br> 3-in-1 <abbr title="tetanus, diphtheria/inactivated polio">Td/IPV</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you were vaccinated before 2004, you will have received the oral polio vaccine (<abbr title="oral polio vaccine">OPV</abbr>) which was given as drops in the mouth, rather than an injection.</p>

<h3>Guidance for health professionals delivering the extra dose polio campaign in London</h3>

<h4>Health professional guidance</h4>

<p>This <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inactivated-polio-vaccine-ipv-booster-information-for-healthcare-practitioners">guidance document</a> about the <abbr title="Inactivated Polio Vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign is intended for healthcare staff involved in delivering the programme and includes information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>background and rationale</li>
  <li>polio</li>
  <li>vaccine recommendations</li>
  <li>vaccine administration queries</li>
</ul>

<h4>Algorithm for healthcare professionals delivering the polio booster campaign</h4>
<p>This A4 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inactivated-polio-vaccine-ipv-booster-information-for-healthcare-practitioners">poster can be downloaded</a> and locally printed and is an aid to determining the age and schedule that each child should receive.</p>

<h3>Vaccine ordering for polio booster programme in London</h3>
<p>Vaccines for the polio booster programme in London are available to order alongside your usual orders for the routine programme. Please ensure you follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inactivated-polio-vaccine-ipv-booster-information-for-healthcare-practitioners">guidance</a> in relation to the vaccines appropriate for each age cohort within the booster programme. There are no restrictions on the volumes you can order (outside of usual controls) but please order responsibly and ensure you have sufficient storage space at 2 to 8°C before ordering.</p>

<p>Three different vaccines are available as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Age of eligible child</th>
      <th scope="col">Vaccine</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<h3>
<abbr title="Inactivated Polio Vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign and vaccine type to be offered</h3>
<p>All <abbr title="Inactivated Polio Vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccines have the same polio content (virus type and amount of antigen) and will provide an excellent boost across the whole age range. Based on existing approvals and to allow an immediate response to be implemented, 3 different products are recommended for the booster campaign as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children aged 1 year to less than 3 years 4 months are offered the hexavalent (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b/ hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>) vaccine (both Infanrix hexa and Vaxelis to be used)</li>
  <li>children aged 3 years 4 months up to and including 5 year olds are offered Boostrix-<abbr title="Inactivated Polio Vaccine">IPV</abbr> (dTaP/<abbr title="Inactivated Polio Vaccine">IPV</abbr>)</li>
  <li>children aged 6 to 9 years are offered Revaxis (<abbr title="tetanus, diphtheria/inactivated polio">Td/IPV</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Polio vaccine is part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-complete-routine-immunisation-schedule">NHS routine childhood vaccination schedule</a> given to babies and children when they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>8, 12 and 16 weeks old as part of the 6-in-1 vaccine (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b/ hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>3 years and 4 months old as part of the 4-in-1 pre-school booster (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio">DTaP/IPV</abbr>)</li>
  <li>14 years old as part of the 3-in-1 teenage booster (<abbr title="tetanus, diphtheria/inactivated polio">Td/IPV</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Individuals need to have all of these vaccinations to be fully vaccinated against polio.</p>

<p>If any of your patients have missed out for any reason, they can have polio vaccination for free on the NHS at any age.</p>

<p>Individuals should get vaccinated even if they’ve had polio before as the vaccine protects against different types of polio.</p>

<p>Every effort should be made to identify any individuals who are not fully vaccinated and to encourage them to come forward to be brought up to date with polio vaccinations as well as routine vaccinations for example the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (<abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella vaccine">MMR</abbr>).</p>

<p>For non-London residents the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaccination-of-individuals-with-uncertain-or-incomplete-immunisation-status">algorithm for uncertain or incomplete immunisation status</a> should be used to bring any infant, child or adult up to date with their routine immunisations.</p>

<h2>Expansion of the enhanced surveillance of childhood cases of hepatitis B and C in England</h2>

<p>To monitor the impact of the universal vaccination programme introduced in 2017 for hepatitis B, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has been monitoring cases of hepatitis B in children through laboratory notifications and <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> surveys. This system is being expanded as part of a collaboration with specialist clinicians in the Hepatitis Infection Paediatric Surveillance Network (<abbr title="Hepatitis Infection Paediatric Surveillance Network">HIPSNet</abbr>).</p>

<p>The expansion involves increasing the age of case identification from 10 to 16, adding an annual questionnaire to be completed by specialist clinicians until the child turns 18, and the inclusion of paediatric cases of hepatitis C. This expansion is to ensure children diagnosed with hepatitis B and C are referred to specialist care, to monitor and review outcomes of treatment and care, establish quality-of-care indicators, and to feedback to clinicians to inform best practice and improve care pathways.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> are asking clinicians to notify them of any paediatric hepatitis B and C cases in their care across England using this form. Upon notification paediatricians and clinics will then be asked to complete a baseline survey and subsequently a short follow up form annually until the child turns 18. More information of this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enhanced-surveillance-of-childhood-cases-of-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-england">surveillance</a> is available.</p>

<h2>Keeping students safe</h2>

<p>All university and other further education students should make sure they are up to date with all their vaccines, including meningococcal A, C, W and Y (<abbr title="Meningococcal A, C, W and Y">MenACWY</abbr>) vaccine (that protects against 4 types of invasive meningococcal disease (<abbr title="invasive meningococcal disease">IMD</abbr>) that cause meningitis and septicaemia), 2 doses of <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella vaccine">MMR</abbr> (protecting against measles, mumps, rubella), <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine (protecting against cervical and other cancers caused by the human papilloma virus (<abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>) together with genital warts) alongside their recommended coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines.</p>

<p>Students or parents who are unsure may wish to check with their <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> practice that they are up to date before starting at their university or college. Ideally, students should have any vaccines they need before leaving for university or college. If that’s not possible, they should arrange to have any missed vaccines as soon as possible with their new <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> practice once they arrive at university or college.</p>

<p><abbr title="Meningococcal A, C, W and Y">MenACWY</abbr> vaccine gives high protection against 4 common types of <abbr title="invasive meningococcal disease">IMD</abbr> (<abbr title="Meningococcal A">MenA</abbr>, <abbr title="Meningococcal C">MenC</abbr>, <abbr title="Meningococcal W">MenW</abbr> and <abbr title="Meningococcal Y">MenY</abbr>) but won’t protect against others, like meningococcal B (<abbr title="Meningococcal B">MenB</abbr>). Measures introduced to control the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 led to an historically low level of <abbr title="invasive meningococcal disease">IMD</abbr> in the 2020 to 2021 academic year.</p>

<p>With the easing of social restrictions from July 2021, <abbr title="invasive meningococcal disease">IMD</abbr> cases rose in the 2021 to 2022 academic year but remained at low levels, with <abbr title="Meningococcal B">MenB</abbr> cases accounting for most (88%) disease. This increase was particularly notable in young people of university age (19 to 22 years). So, it is important that young people know the signs and symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia, how to get medical help if they need it and how to look out for their own health and the health of others. Therefore, we are highlighting these messages and providing resources to raise awareness in universities and other Higher Education Institutions and amongst new students and their parents by working with leading meningitis charities and university and student organisations.</p>

<h2>Prioritisation of varicella vaccine during supply shortage (August 2022)</h2>

<p>In the UK varicella vaccination is not routinely offered as part of the UK childhood schedule and is therefore not available through ImmForm but is recommended for specific groups as a selective pre-exposure vaccination strategy. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>close susceptible contacts of immunocompromised individuals</li>
  <li>non-immune healthcare workers who have regular patient contact and susceptible laboratory workers in virology laboratories at risk of exposure to varicella virus</li>
</ul>

<p>Since varicella infection is so common in childhood, 90% of adults raised in the UK are immune. Varicella is seasonal with annual incidence peaking in spring months between March to May. Specific groups are at higher risk of complications from varicella. This includes immunocompromised individuals, neonates and pregnant women. The current UK selective programme aims to protect those at highest risk of severe disease from exposure. In addition to the recommended uses above, vaccination has also been used in outbreak settings and offered through the private market for susceptible individuals including children.</p>

<p>In light of the current supply shortages of varicella vaccines, the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> recommends prioritising available stock for those at greatest risk from severe disease. In the current situation, varicella vaccine should be restricted to the following groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>susceptible child household contacts of immunocompromised individuals</li>
  <li>susceptible adult household contacts of immunocompromised individuals</li>
  <li>non-immune healthcare workers working with severely immunosuppressed patients (as defined in the Green book)</li>
</ul>

<p>Susceptibility to varicella in adults should be confirmed by quantitative antibody testing as defined in the Green Book (&lt;100 mIU/ml).</p>

<p>During the current shortage, vaccination of other healthcare workers and laboratory workers should be deferred.</p>

<h2>Information for healthcare practitioner documents</h2>

<p>When a new vaccine is introduced or a change is made to an existing vaccine programme, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> produces an ‘Information for Healthcare Practitioner’ document to answer the questions around scheduling, administration, inadvertent errors and so on that may arise for vaccinators. These can be found under the ‘Vaccine programmes’ section on the GOV.UK immunisation page.</p>

<p>Recently updated examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hpv-universal-vaccination-guidance-for-health-professionals"><abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination guidance for healthcare practitioners</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shingles-vaccination-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals">Shingles vaccination guidance for healthcare practitioners</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hexavalent-combination-vaccine-programme-guidance">Hexavalent combination vaccine: information for healthcare practitioners</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So next time you have a question about a vaccine, if it’s not covered in the Green Book chapter, we recommend you look in the ‘Information for Healthcare Practitioner’ document (if there is one for that vaccine) and see whether your question has been answered there.</p>

<h2>Shingrix and flu vaccine administration</h2>

<p>The Shingrix special edition of Vaccine Update published in May 2022 stated that Shingrix can be given concomitantly with inactivated influenza vaccine. This is correct for all inactivated flu vaccines other than the adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (<abbr title="adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine">aQIV</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine">aQIV</abbr> is offered to people aged from 65 years (or becoming 65 by end of March each flu season) as part of the annual flu vaccination programme. Because of the absence of data on co-administration of Shingrix vaccine with adjuvanted influenza vaccine, it should not be routine to offer appointments to give this vaccine at the same time as the adjuvanted influenza vaccine.</p>

<p>Based on current information, scheduling should ideally be separated by an interval of at least 7 days to avoid incorrect attribution of potential adverse events. Where individuals attend requiring both vaccines however, and require rapid protection or are considered likely to be lost to follow up, co-administration may still be considered. This does not apply to the Zostavax vaccine which can be given at the same time as any of the inactivated flu vaccines.</p>

<h4>Editing Fluenz® Tetra (<abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr>) orders</h4>
<p>Due to the anticipated large volume of orders for Fluenz® Tetra in the first few weeks of ordering, orders for this product will be assembled as soon as they are placed and will not be editable. If you need to make an adjustment to your order after it has been placed, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk">helpdesk@immform.org.uk</a> for assistance.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr> ordering information for general practice</h4>
<p>As in previous years, ordering controls will be in place for general practices, to enable <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to balance incoming supply with demand. These controls work by allocating an amount of <abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr> based on the number of registered eligible patients and are tailored to each practice.</p>

<p>The following availability is expected, however at this time, this information remains subject to change:</p>

<ul>
  <li>each <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> practice will initially be allocated sufficient <abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr> to vaccinate up to 45% of their eligible patients (all 2 and 3 year olds, plus children in clinical risk groups from age 4 to less than 18 years) when ordering commences</li>
  <li>amendments to the allocations will be made in response to vaccine availability and demand. The most up to date information will be available on the ImmForm news page, so please check regularly for updates</li>
  <li>requests for extra vaccine will be considered on a case-by-case basis throughout the erdering period. Requests should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk">helpdesk@immform.org.uk</a> and in good time before your order cut-off. Out of schedule deliveries will be by exception only</li>
</ul>

<h4>Multi-Branch practices and <abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr> allocations</h4>
<p>Please note that <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> practices or groups that operate over multiple sites but are part of the same organisation will have a joint allocation (as in previous years), even where each site has a unique ImmForm account. This means that it is possible for one site to potentially order all of the available vaccine for the group, unless there is local agreement on how the allocated volume is shared.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> recommend that this agreement is in place before ordering opens. The allocation information above allows practices to estimate the amount of vaccine they will initially have access to, and how it should be split between all sites.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr> ordering information for school-age providers</h4>
<p>A default weekly ordering cap of 400 packs (4,000 doses) per week will be in place for school provider accounts.</p>

<p>Where this cap is insufficient and a provider needs a larger weekly volume of vaccine to deliver the programme (for example where a provider covers a large area using a single account), a higher weekly cap should be requested via the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Flu Vaccine Operations team by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:childfluvaccine@ukhsa.gov.uk">childfluvaccine@ukhsa.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>For one-off larger orders during the ordering period, requests should be made via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk">helpdesk@immform.org.uk</a></p>

<h4>Inactivated flu vaccine ordering</h4>

<p>Two inactivated vaccines will also be available for children for the 2022 to 2023 season:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (split virion, inactivated) (<abbr title="Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (split virion, inactivated)">QIVe</abbr>) which should only be ordered for children in clinical risk groups aged from 6 months to less than 2 years old, with an initial order cap of 2 doses per week (supplied in a single dose pack)</li>
  <li>
    <p>Cell Based Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (Surface Antigen, Inactivated) (<abbr title="Cell Based Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (Surface Antigen, Inactivated)">QIVc</abbr>), which will be available for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>children aged 2 to less than 18 years old in clinical risk groups for whom <abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr> is clinically contraindicated or otherwise unsuitable; and</li>
      <li>
        <p>healthy children from 2 years of age to those in school year 9, for whom <abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr> is unsuitable (for example, due to objection to <abbr title="Live attenuated influenza vaccine">LAIV</abbr> on the grounds of its porcine gelatine content). This vaccine will be available in a single dose pack to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<abbr title="general practitioners">GPs</abbr>, with an initial order cap of 8 doses per week</li>
          <li>school-age providers, with an order cap of 400 doses per week</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For one-off larger orders of inactivated vaccines, requests should be made via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk">helpdesk@immform.org.uk</a> in good time before your order cut-off.</p>

<h2>Changes to the infant Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (<abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr>) vaccine programme</h2>
<p><abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccination of eligible babies has moved from vaccination soon after birth, to when the child reaches 28 days of age, or earlier than 28 days provided that a Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (<abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>) result is available. This change applies to babies that were born on or after 1 September 2021. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bcg-immunisation-programme-changes-from-september-2021-letter"><abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> immunisation programme: changes from September 2021 letter</a> for further information.</p>

<p><abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine will continue to be available to order via ImmForm. However, please consider the schedule change when placing orders for <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine, and do not order more than 2 weeks’ worth of stock to minimise wastage due to fridge failures.</p>

<p>Each pack of <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine (from AJ Vaccines) is sufficient for 200 infant (or 100 adult) doses and contains 10 glass vials of powder for reconstitution. Each pack is accompanied by a pack of 10 vials of diluent. One vial of reconstituted vaccine contains 1 ml, corresponding to 20 doses (of 0.05 ml) for infants under 12 months of age, or 10 doses (0.1 ml) for adults and children aged 12 months or over.</p>

<p>While vaccination of eligible children is the priority, please ensure you have effective cold chain and administrative protocols that minimise vaccine wastage and reflect national protocols. The offer of vaccine should not be delayed in order to prevent wastage, but aim to plan ahead to minimise wastage where this is possible.</p>

<h2>Changes to the <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination programme</h2>

<h3>Changes to the <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination schedule</h3>

<p>From 1 April 2022, the <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccination schedule for adolescents and adults who start the vaccination course on or after their 15th birthday has changed for most eligible individuals from a 3-dose to a 2-dose course; please see the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and NHS England and NHS Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) bipartite <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hpv-immunisation-programme-changes-from-april-2022-letter">letter</a> for details.</p>

<p><abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine will continue to be available to order through ImmForm. However, please consider the schedule change when placing orders for <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine, and do not order more than 2 weeks’ worth of stock to minimise wastage due to fridge failures.</p>

<h3>Gardasil®9 has replaced Gardasil® for the national <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> programmes since July 2022</h3>

<p>Since mid July 2022, Gardasil®9 has been the <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> vaccine supplied for both the national <abbr title="Human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> adolescent programme and the men who have sex with men (<abbr title="men who have sex with men">MSM</abbr>) programme. To minimise wastage, please use all of your locally held stocks of Gardasil® to vaccinate eligible individuals, before switching to Gardasil®9.</p>

<p>As the programmes transition to Gardasil®9, some individuals will receive a mixed schedule. The 2 vaccines are interchangeable and vaccination should not be delayed due to preference for either vaccine.</p>

<h3>Movianto UK drivers delivering centrally supplied products are not able to phone delivery points</h3>
<p>Please note that Movianto UK drivers delivering centrally supplied products are not able to phone a delivery point upon arrival at the delivery location. Customers are expected to make arrangements ahead of the scheduled delivery day to receive their deliveries.</p>

<h3>ImmForm customers should report long-term changes to opening hours for deliveries</h3>
<p>Customers should report long-term changes to the days when they can accept deliveries, such as routine training days and closures, by contacting Movianto UK Customer Care (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MoviantoUK.NHSCC@movianto.com">MoviantoUK.NHSCC@movianto.com</a>; 01234 587207). This should not be used to report short-term changes due to absence or holidays.</p>

<p>Customers are reminded to be prepared for any break in deliveries due to absences or holidays and to order accordingly. Please make sure you have sufficient room in your fridge for any additional vaccine you wish to stock. Deferred orders can also be placed in advance. Out of schedule deliveries cannot be arranged for failure to place orders in good time.</p>

<h2>Availability of Vaxelis® vaccine as an alternative to Infanrix hexa®</h2>
<p>Since 31 January 2022, as part of the current vaccination programme, Vaxelis® has been available to order via ImmForm. Vaxelis® is an alternative hexavalent vaccine to Infanrix hexa® (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b/ hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>) for routine infant primary immunisations scheduled at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age. Vaxelis protects against the same 6 diseases as Infanrix hexa® and has been licensed in Europe for more than 5 years. Infanrix hexa® will also continue to be available via ImmForm.</p>

<p>Vaxelis® and Infanrix hexa® vaccines are interchangeable, but where possible and if local stock allows, it is preferable that the same <abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b/ hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>-containing vaccine be used for all 3 doses of the primary course. However, vaccination should never be delayed because the vaccine used for previous doses is not known or unavailable.</p>

<p>The hexavalent vaccine <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hexavalent-vaccine-dtapipvhibhepb-infanrix-hexa-pgd-template"><abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b/ hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr> <abbr title="Patient Group Direction">PGD</abbr> national template</a> includes use of both Infanrix hexa® and Vaxelis®.</p>

<p>Ordering controls for Vaxelis® will be in place to balance incoming supply with demand. Customers in England and Wales may order up to 10 packs of Vaxelis® per ImmForm account per week. Orders for Infanrix hexa® remain unrestricted. Customers in Scotland should refer to their local ordering restrictions. Providers should not order more than 2 weeks’ worth of stock to minimise wastage due to fridge failures.</p>

<p>Further information, including the contact details for Sanofi Pasteur, can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/12264/smpc" rel="external">Vaxelis® suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe – Summary of Product Characteristics (<abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SmPC</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h2>Supply of vaccines with reduced shelf life</h2>
<p>Vaccines supplied via ImmForm for the routine immunisation programme will usually have at least 3 months of shelf-life remaining at the time of delivery. To help reduce wastage, vaccines with reduced shelf life will occasionally be supplied. ImmForm customers will be informed of vaccines which have reduced shelf life via ImmForm news articles, updates on the particular ImmForm product page, or a click-thru pop-up message at the time of ordering.</p>

<p>ImmForm customers should order no more than 2 weeks’ worth of stock to minimise wastage due to fridge failures or failure to use stock before expiry. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/storage-distribution-and-disposal-of-vaccines-the-green-book-chapter-3">chapter 3 of the ‘Green Book’ (Immunisation against infectious disease)</a> for further details on the storage and supply of vaccines.</p>

<h2>Update to Bexsero Patient Information Leaflet</h2>
<p>Every pack of Bexsero (Meningitis B vaccine; 10 doses) is supplied with a pad of 10 Patient Information Leaflets (<abbr title="Patient Information Leaflets">PILs</abbr>), as well as there being a single <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> inside each Bexsero pack. Since September 2020, an updated version of the <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> pad has been distributed with Bexsero orders. Please dispose of the single <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> from inside the pack, as it will be out-of-date.</p>

<p>We will advise further when the <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> supplied in the pack is in line with the <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> pad.</p>

<h2>The EU Falsified Medicines Directive (<abbr title="Falsified Medicines Directive">FMD</abbr>) and Delegated Regulation as applicable to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>-supplied vaccines for the national immunisation programme</h2>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2016-11/dir_2011_62_en_0.pdf" rel="external">EU Falsified Medicines Directive 2011/62/EU (<abbr title="Falsified Medicines Directive">FMD</abbr>)</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2016-11/reg_2016_161_en_0.pdf" rel="external">Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2016/161)</a> impose legal obligations on the EU medicines supply chain to prevent entry of falsified medicinal products into the supply chain. The Delegated Regulation was implemented in all EU Member States on 9 February 2019.</p>

<p>Following the UK’s departure from the EU, the Delegated Regulation ceased to apply in Great Britain from 31 December 2020, but continues to apply in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h4>Information for customers in Northern Ireland</h4>
<p><abbr title="Falsified Medicines Directive">FMD</abbr>-barcoded packs of routine immunisation programme vaccines that are centrally supplied by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> continue to be supplied with active <abbr title="Falsified Medicines Directive">FMD</abbr> serialisation, and should be decommissioned by end users in Northern Ireland. Customers in Northern Ireland who access centrally supplied vaccines are encouraged to review local guidance on implementation of the EU Falsified Medicines Directive.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella vaccine">MMR</abbr> vaccine ordering</h2>
<p>To rebalance central supplies of both <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella vaccine">MMR</abbr> vaccines please consider ordering M-M-RvaxPRO® as your first choice, which is available without restriction.</p>

<p>Customers in England and Wales who require Priorix®, for example because you serve communities that do not accept vaccines containing porcine gelatine, may order up to 6 packs of Priorix® per ImmForm account per week.</p>

<p>For assistance please contact the ImmForm Helpdesk at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk">helpdesk@immform.org.uk</a>. Customers in Scotland should refer to their local ordering restrictions.</p>
