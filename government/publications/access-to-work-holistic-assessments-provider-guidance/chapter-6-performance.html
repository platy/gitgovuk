<h2>Market Share Shift (<abbr title="Market Share Shift">MSS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>6.12. Shifts are cumulative and therefore revised market shares will remain in effect until or unless further revised (up or down) by a subsequent shift.</p>

<p>6.13. Before being considered for an increase in market share, if a Merlin Standard Accreditation has been completed, the provider must have achieved a rating of “excellent”, “good” or “satisfactory in the most recent assessment.</p>

<p>6.14. Until the first implementation of <abbr title="Market Share Shift">MSS</abbr> <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> shall endeavour to refer customers to the prime contract and a competing prime provider in equal numbers. At the end of the 6 month <abbr title="Market Share Shift">MSS</abbr> assessment period (starting from service commencement) and each six-month assessment period thereafter, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> shall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess the provider’s performance against <abbr title="Key Performance Indicator">KPI</abbr> 3 over the <abbr title="Market Share Shift">MSS</abbr> assessment period</li>
  <li>not consider <abbr title="Market Share Shift">MSS</abbr> if both the providers are ‘green’ on <abbr title="Key Performance Indicator">KPI</abbr> 3</li>
  <li>determine <abbr title="Market Share Shift">MSS</abbr> on the Market Shift review date which will be 2 months following the end of the <abbr title="Market Share Shift">MSS</abbr> assessment period</li>
  <li>shall (at its sole discretion) if one or more provider is rated amber or red against <abbr title="Key Performance Indicator">KPI</abbr> 3 allocate ten (10) percentage points less market share to the lower performing provider against KPI3 and the provider whose performance is higher will be allocated ten (10) percentage more market share; and</li>
  <li>ensure that the maximum market share that one provider can achieve is eighty (80) %</li>
</ul>

<p>6.15. If the competing provider with the lowest performance against <abbr title="Key Performance Indicator">KPI</abbr> 3 (for a <abbr title="Market Share Shift">MSS</abbr> assessment period) has a compliance risk rating for that <abbr title="Key Performance Indicator">KPI</abbr> of amber or red, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may, at its sole discretion, reduce the future market share of that provider by ten (10) percentage points and increase the market share of the competing provider with the higher <abbr title="Key Performance Indicator">KPI</abbr> 3 score (for the same period) by a corresponding ten (10) percentage points.</p>
