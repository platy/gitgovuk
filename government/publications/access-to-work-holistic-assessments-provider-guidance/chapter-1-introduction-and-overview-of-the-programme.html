<h2>Background</h2>

<p>1.01. The Access to Work programme is a Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) grant scheme which assists disabled people who are in paid employment, self-employed or participating in an agreed Job/Work Trial which may have already started, or is due to start, by providing practical support to overcome work related obstacles resulting from their disability. Support is also available for young disabled people to enable them to take up an offer of a Work Experience placement or Supported Internship.</p>

<p>1.02. Access to Work does not fund normal business running costs or general costs that every employer and employee has, but it may contribute to additional employment costs resulting from disability over and above those costs considered to be reasonable adjustments required by the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a>.</p>

<p>1.03. Access to Work cannot pay for the costs of setting up a business such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standard items of equipment</li>
  <li>support for fact-finding; and</li>
  <li>attending courses, seminars or similar events</li>
</ul>

<p>1.04. The vast majority of “reasonable adjustments” required under the Equality Act 2010 are able to be delivered at low or no cost and the bulk of working disabled people are able to continue their employment on that basis. However, for the minority of customers with disability related workplace needs beyond reasonable, Access to Work can provide funds to meet those costs in order to increase the opportunities for recruitment and retention of those people with the highest needs. In some cases, (for example, larger employers) <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the employer will share these extra costs.</p>

<h2>Eligibility conditions for Access to Work</h2>

<p>1.05. Access to Work is available to people who have a disability, health or mental health condition.</p>

<p>1.06. To receive Access to Work help, the following eligibility conditions must be satisfied. Customers must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disabled, or have a health condition that has lasted for or is likely to last for more than 12 months and that impacts their ability to work</li>
  <li>aged 16 or over (there is no upper age limit for support as long as the employment is likely to continue)</li>
  <li>in employment (employed or self-employed) or serving an apprenticeship, but not in voluntary work and earning at least the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage rate for each hour that they work (there is no minimum number of hours to be worked and the total amount of any wage is immaterial to eligibility)
    <ul>
      <li>National Living Wage is applicable to those aged 25 or over (but not in the first year of an apprenticeship)</li>
      <li>National Minimum Wage is applicable to those aged under 25; and</li>
      <li>National Minimum Wage rates do not apply to people on apprenticeships</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>about to start employment</li>
  <li>about to start a Job/Work Trial (Jobcentre Plus (<abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>)) organised or individually established where there is a reasonable prospect of employment after the trial)</li>
  <li>in need of help at a job interview with an employer. It is normally used by deaf/hearing loss customers requiring British Sign Language interpreters or lip-speakers. It is available to anyone who has a disability which affects their ability to communicate (for example, mental health needs or people with learning disabilities needing a job coach to support them whilst undertaking a “working interview” to demonstrate their ability to do the job). It is available for all job interviews, including internal promotion:
    <ul>
      <li>Communication Support at an interview cannot be used for:</li>
      <li>communication within a job such as job induction and job reviews, when you should consider a Support Worker</li>
      <li>customers attending interviews with a Disability Employment Adviser, Jobcentre Plus Specialist Adviser or other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff; and</li>
      <li>attending other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> programmes such as the Work &amp; Health Programme</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>not receiving Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) and/or NI credits only as part of an <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> claim, (or will cease to claim whilst in work) unless the customer is about to start a <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> agreed Work Trial; on Permitted Work Higher Level; Permitted Work (PCA exempt) or Supported Permitted Work; and</li>
  <li>resident in Great Britain, excluding Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, with a job based in Great Britain, help can, however, be used to cover customer’s visits overseas for work purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>1.07. Support is also available for opportunities that will help disabled people get ready for employment such as Traineeships, Sector-based Work Academies and Supported Internships.</p>

<h2>Types of support</h2>

<p>1.08. Access to Work provides practical advice and support to disabled people and their employers to help overcome work related obstacles resulting from disability. It can also provide a grant towards additional support relating to their disability that the person would need to do their job.</p>

<p>1.09. The Access to Work Assessment contracts offer individuals Holistic Assessments, delivered face to face or virtually, to suit the needs and wishes of the customer.  The Assessment will explore all relevant factors that impact on their work place barriers to employment. The purpose of the assessment is to make recommendations on how to overcome these barriers and to provide a Needs Assessment Report to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> National Access to Work Team which contains recommendations for the provision/purchase of specialist equipment and adaptations or a workplace support worker as appropriate.</p>

<p>1.10. Help is available in a number of ways. For example, it can help pay for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special aids or equipment to enable a disabled person to do their job</li>
  <li>adaptations to equipment to make it accessible</li>
  <li>adaptations to buildings to make them accessible over and above what is required by law</li>
  <li>the additional costs of travel to work for people who are unable to use public transport because of their disability or health condition</li>
  <li>a support worker in the workplace, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>a reader for a visually impaired person (increasingly replaced by screen-reader software); and/or</li>
      <li>an interpreter for someone with hearing difficulties</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>1.11. As at April 2021, the upper limit of grants for Access to Work customers is currently set at £62,900 per customer. This limit is reviewed annually in line with UK average earnings. The cost of contracted provision provided through Access to Work such as workplace assessments or the Mental Health Support Service does not count against this limit. Detailed background and further information is available on request from your Performance Manager.</p>
