<h2>Using the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> system</h2>

</ul>

<p>5.14. On receipt of the Needs Assessment Referral Form from the Access to Work Adviser, providers may commence engagement activities, i.e. booking appointments.  However, if you have not received the associated <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> referral the following working day, you must e-mail the Access to Work Adviser immediately, sending a copy of this e-mail to the Access to Work Contract Liaison Point at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ATWPROVIDER.CONTRACTCORRESPONDENCE@DWP.GOV.UK">ATWPROVIDER.CONTRACTCORRESPONDENCE@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>

<h2>Provider acknowledges a referral</h2>

<p>5.20. Upon receipt of a referral from an Access to Work Advisor, you should access the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> system within 1 working day and acknowledge the referral. (Further information regarding the use of the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> system can be found in Chapter 2 of this guidance and within the on-line <abbr title="User Productivity Kit">UPK</abbr> guidance).</p>

<h2>Start provision</h2>

<p>5.21. The assessment must be arranged within 2 working days of your receipt of the referral (not including weekends or public holidays), to meet your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and the start date must be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>5.22. The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> start has three options. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a start when a suitable appointment with the customer has been made</li>
  <li>did not attend (<abbr title="did not attend">DNA</abbr>) when you cannot contact a customer</li>
  <li>did not start (<abbr title="did not start">DNS</abbr>) when you cancel the meeting with the customer</li>
</ul>

<p>5.23. You are required to input dates into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> to confirm the start.  These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a unique reference - this is something to easily identify this Advance Shipping Notice (ASN) to you. It could be a reference which relates directly to your own system, or something to help you identify this customer. This must not contain a NINO</li>
  <li>date 1: the date you contacted the customer</li>
  <li>date 2: the date of your <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> input</li>
</ul>

<p>5.24	The following lines are available to be claimed for either a Face to Face or Virtual Holistic Assessment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ATW001 â ATW Start</li>
  <li>ATW002 â ATW Holistic Assessment payment</li>
  <li>ATW003 â Referral End</li>
  <li>ATW004 â ATW Re-work MI Only line</li>
</ul>

<h2>Customer on incorrect opportunity type</h2>

<h3>Referral has not been acknowledged in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>5.25. If you identify that the customer is on the wrong opportunity type and you havenât acknowledged the referral, you must reject the entire order and record a reason.</p>

<p>5.26. Select the âReject Entire Orderâ button and select the rejection reason âInappropriate Referralâ.</p>

<p>5.27. When you have selected a rejection reason this will close the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> and Find and Refer or LMS will be updated with the reason. You should contact the Access to Work Adviser to request a new referral to the correct opportunity type.</p>

<h3>Referral has been acknowledged, line 1 (Start) has not been claimed</h3>

<p>5.28. If you discover that the customer is on the wrong opportunity type and have acknowledged the referral (but havenât yet claimed a Start (line 1)) you should select the âRequest Cancellationâ button, then select the rejection reason âNo Contactâ.</p>

<p>5.29. When you have selected a cancellation reason this will close the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> and Find and Refer or LMS will be updated with the reason. You should contact the Access to Work Adviser to request a new referral to the correct opportunity.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgment and start have been recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>5.30. If you discover that the customer is on the incorrect opportunity type after you have acknowledged the referral and claimed a Start (line 1) you must claim an end of Provision line (Line 3) and record the appropriate leaver reason - code 42- Referred to Other Suitable Provision. You should contact the Access to Work Adviser to request a new referral to the correct opportunity.</p>

<h2>Use of Form <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> 14</h2>

<p>5.31. The <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> 14 form is used to request the removal of incorrect data from <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>. Guidance notes for completion are held on the form.</p>

<p>5.32. The <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> 14 form can be used when you have claimed a line incorrectly, for example, if you have recorded the dates on the start line incorrectly. If you have made a claim to any of the lines and you have made a mistake, you must complete the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> 14 form and email a copy to the <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Policy inbox <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:atwproviderguidance.policy@dwp.gov.uk">atwproviderguidance.policy@dwp.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>5.33. The <abbr title="Access to Work">AtW</abbr> Policy team will then consider your request and you will be notified of the outcome.  We may need to gather further information to enable your request to be processed.  If the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> 14 request is agreed, it will be sent to the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:prap.support@dwp.gov.uk">prap.support@dwp.gov.uk</a>. The <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> team will then take action to remove the incorrect date(s) enabling you to input the correct ones, if required.</p>

<p>5.34. You must not use the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> 14 process if the customer has been placed on the wrong Access to Work opportunity type.  If a customer has been placed on the wrong opportunity you must follow the steps at paragraphs 5.25 to 5.29 of this guidance and contact the Access to Work Adviser to request a new referral to the correct opportunity.</p>

<h2>Assessment outcome payment</h2>

<p>5.35. Once the Holistic Assessment has been completed to the specified standard the Assessment Outcome Payment can be claimed in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>5.36. Prior to claiming the Assessment Outcome Payment line, you must compete the Job Details screen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employment type, job title, job start date and working pattern fields must be completed. Other fields do not require populating and should be completed with âN/Aâ</li>
  <li>for âemployment typeâ select âemployedâ. If an assessment has been delivered and the assessment outcome has been claimed the End Date must be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>for âJob Titleâ insert the Primary Health Condition</li>
  <li>for âWorking Patternâ insert the Primary Health Condition Code</li>
  <li>for âJob Start Dateâ enter the date the Holistic Assessment was returned</li>
  <li>for âJob End Dateâ enter the same date as the Job Start date</li>
</ul>

<p>5.37. You must ensure that the correct opportunity type was selected at the referral stage before you make an outcome claim - either face to face â âFace to Face ATW Holistic Assessmentâ or virtual â âVirtual ATW Holistic Assessmentâ as appropriate.</p>

<p>5.38. You will be required to input dates into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> to confirm an Assessment Outcome has been delivered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a unique reference - this is something to easily identify this Advance Shipping Notice (ASN) to you. It could be a reference which relates directly to your own system, or something to help you identify this customer. This must not contain a NINO</li>
  <li>date 1: the date you returned the Assessment</li>
  <li>date 2: the same date as Date 1</li>
</ul>

<p>5.39. You must ensure that you only submit claims for payment to which you are entitled. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will, to the extent it deems necessary, undertake payment checks on claims to establish their validity. Any erroneous payments made will be recovered.</p>

<h2>Referral end date</h2>

<p>5.40. The End Date must always be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> even if the Assessment has not been delivered. For example, when a customer arranges an appointment and subsequently cancels it.</p>

<p>5.41	The following End Date information needs to be entered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a unique reference: this is something to easily identify this Advance Shipping Notice (ASN) to you. It could be a reference which relates directly to your own system, or something to help you identify this customer. This must not contain an NINO</li>
  <li>date 1: the date the end has been entered into the system</li>
  <li>date 2: the date the end has been entered into the system</li>
  <li>
    <p>end reason: the reason the provision has ended</p>

<h2>Special Customer Records</h2>

<p>5.48. The majority of claims for payment must be submitted via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>. However, where you have a claim for a customer who is granted Special Customer Records (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) status (as determined by HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) Special Section D) you are required to submit the claim following the <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> clerical claim process. Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> identifies that <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status is not granted the claim will be rejected.</p>

<p>5.49. If a Special Customer Records Customer is identified, please liaise with the Access to Work Business Support Management Team, by e-mail, at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ATWPROVIDER.CONTRACTCORRESPONDENCE@DWP.GOV.UK">ATWPROVIDER.CONTRACTCORRESPONDENCE@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a> to determine appropriate action.</p>

<p>5.50. The Access to Work Business Support Management Team will then process a clerical payment that mirrors the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> automated process. All clerical documents carrying personal information should be retained securely.</p>
