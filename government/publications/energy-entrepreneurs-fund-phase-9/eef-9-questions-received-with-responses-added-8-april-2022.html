<h2>Technology Scope and TRL</h2>

<p><strong>Our company is currently on the TRL6 and falls a little behind with the Manufacturing readiness level- MRL. We would like to explore possibilities to bring our MRL higher within this project by building the pilot plant. My question, therefore is, are falls into the scope of this call?</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for the fund your innovation must be at TRL 3 or above, as you have stated. We do not place a minimum requirement on MRL for eligibility to the fund as it is not something we currently measure or assess.</p>

<p>You are welcome to progress through MRLs in your project, however we would also expect an innovation to progress through the TRLs as part of the EEF project. Most likely the progression through MRL and TRL go hand in hand, but it is important to note that our assessors will be looking at TRL progression, rather than MRL progression, detailed in the application.</p>

<p><strong>Would the purchase &amp; installation cost of solar panels be eligible under this grant? What % of the funding would be received? E.g. would 50% be paid by the company and the remaining by grant?</strong></p>

<p>The EEF 9 competition is an innovation competition, therefore you would not be able to use the funds to purchase and install commercially available solar panels because there is no innovation to be shown in the installation - the solar panels are a proven technology. In the application you will be asked to detail your innovation and the TRL progression you expect to make during the project, commercially available technologies would not be eligible for funding because they are at TRL 9. Details of the TRLs can be found in Appendix 1 of the Guidance Document.</p>

<p>The amount of grant funding that you can receive depends on the Subsidy Category that you apply under, this is detailed in Section 4 of the Guidance Document.</p>

<p><strong>We have a UK business where say at least 80% of our company costs are in the UK. However, our main market is Africa, India etc… the global South. We trust technologies for export markets are fine for this application?</strong></p>

<p>EEF is for the development and demonstration of technology and the technology has to demonstrate an impact of carbon savings or security of supply in its potential market – this is not UK specific.</p>

<p><strong>Will industrial Hemp be within scope of the funding call?</strong></p>

<p>Projects must demonstrate their impact on the 2050 carbon targets and security of energy supply. Provided the project involved these elements and was at TRL 3 – 8, it would be eligible.</p>

<p><strong>What considerations will be given to projects focusing on enabling offshore wind farms?</strong></p>

<p>The fund is technology agnostic and we do not favour any particular technology. Successful applicants will be those with the highest scoring applications, regardless of technology area.</p>

<p><strong>What is the preferable scale of project size (e.g. 10MW)?</strong></p>

<p>There is no preferable project size. Your application should support the development and demonstration of your technology. Therefore, you would need to justify in your application why a specific scale up has been suggested, and how this is relevant to the development and demonstration of your technology.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a specific market EEF is looking to address?</strong></p>

<p>EEF is for the development and demonstration of technology not for the sale of products arising from the technology. The development and demonstration of the technology has to demonstrate an impact of carbon savings or security of supply in its potential market – this is not UK specific.</p>

<p><strong>Please confirm if carbon removal technologies fall under the definition of “reducing greenhouse gas emissions”? This involves removal of atmospheric CO2 rather than capturing CO2 from emissions and deals specifically with reducing the levels of CO2 that have been historically emitted.</strong></p>

<p>Projects must demonstrate their impact on the 2050 carbon targets and security of energy supply. Carbon removal technologies could contribute to meeting 2050 net zero targets. Provided the project involved these elements and was at TRL 3 – 8, it would be eligible.</p>

<p><strong>Will energy efficient technologies for drying compressed air qualify for funding under the technology scope of EEF 9?</strong></p>

<p>Projects must demonstrate their impact on the 2050 carbon targets and security of energy supply.  Provided the project involved these elements and was at TRL 3 – 8, it would be eligible.</p>

<p><strong>Do Analytic and Visualisation tools for clean tech count at technology eligible for the EEF 9 funding?</strong></p>

<p>Projects must demonstrate their impact on the 2050 carbon targets and security of energy supply.  Provided the project involved these elements and was at TRL 3 – 8, it would be eligible.</p>

<p><strong>What level of TRL is the program gear towards, does it have to be above TRL3?</strong></p>

<p>Innovations must be at TRL 3 or above (up and including TRL 8) to be eligible for the fund.</p>

<p><strong>Most of our projects are TRL 3 and still far from a commercializing stage. One of our ventures is creating a prototype for a part of an equipment we would need. It would not be for sale as we need it to further advance our studies into an energy route. Would this be suitable?</strong></p>

<p>Projects at TRL 3 are eligible for EEF funding. Projects must demonstrate their impact on the 2050 carbon targets and security of energy supply. In the application, you will be asked to articulate the impact of your innovation on climate change mitigation and/or UK security of energy supply. If you can explain how the proposed equipment prototype contributes to these goals, then it may be suitable.</p>

<p><strong>We are on the path of clean energy, but still away from a net zero and carbon sequestering. Will this affect our opportunities?</strong></p>

<p>The fund is technology agnostic and there is no requirement for carbon sequestering to be a part of your innovation.</p>

<h2>Subsidy Category and Match Funding</h2>

<p><strong>What is the level of funding and size of company are allowed to apply?</strong></p>

<p>Companies of any size are allowed to apply, although we particularly encourage applications from SMEs. Companies can apply for up to £1m of funding, and the maximum overall project size is £2.5m. The specific funding subsidy levels will depend on the company size, project type, and whether you apply as a sole applicant or part of a consortium.</p>

<p><strong>Details of funding levels and rules partnering with other companies and universities.</strong></p>

<p>Please see Section 6 of the EEF 9 Guidance Document for details on funding categories and partnering with companies and universities.</p>

<p><strong>On pages 17/18 of your guidance notes, you specify that a company must have existed for less than 5 years. Does this allow application from a dormant (never traded) company that has ‘existed’ for longer, or not?</strong></p>

<p>If your company has existed for longer than 5 years in any state (including dormant), you can still apply for EEF, but this application must be under the Aid for Research and Development category, not under the Aid for Start-ups category. One could create a new company for the sole purpose of applying for the grant and qualifying for the Aid for Start-ups category.</p>

<p><strong>Does the SME need to have been registered with Companies House for LESS than 5 years to be eligible for grant funding under EEF9, or can the SME have been in existence for more than five years?</strong></p>

<p>If you apply under Aid for Start Ups your company has to be in existence for less than five years. You must apply under Aid for Research and Development Projects if you company has been in existence for more than five years.</p>

<p><strong>In your guidance notes (and in the application form) reference is made to the last three years. You ask “if you’re a start-up with no turnover yet, you must have this validated by an independent party” how is this to be accomplished, please - how do we answer similar t/o and expenditure questions on the application form?</strong></p>

<p>If your start up is less than one year old with no annual turnover, you can answer the application questions with £0 or N/A. If your application is successful, you will be asked to provide the validation from an independent party as part of the due diligence checks. The turnover should be checked by a certified auditor, which would be a registered Auditor or a Chartered Accountant in Practice.</p>

<p><strong>Start-ups collaborating with Universities, is this classified as a consortium (max 80% intervention rate for the start-up)? Could the University be regarded as a sub-contractor (max 90% intervention rate for the start-up)?</strong></p>

<p>A collaboration between a start-up and a university is a consortium. You would need to state and justify in the application the amount of sub-contract funding (if any) and expected to explain the necessity for this spend as opposed to the addition of a collaboration partner.</p>

<p><strong>What is the classification if it is less than 250 employees and less than 2m turnover? Would that make us a micro or a medium size company?</strong></p>

<p>If your company has between 50 and 250 employees and turnover of less than £2m, that is a medium sized company. A micro sized company would have fewer than 10 employees and a turnover of less than £2m.</p>

<p><strong>Double checking that the project type does NOT apply for “Aid for start-ups”?</strong></p>

<p>The Aid for start-ups category has the same levels of funding for all project types.</p>

<p><strong>If an organisation has received an Innovation Loan (not a grant) from the Innovation Funding Service, does that equate to ‘public money’ that cannot be used as match funding for the project?</strong></p>

<p>Match funding may come from a company’s own resources or external private sector investors but may not include funding attributable to any public authority.</p>

<p><strong>Does the company need to be formed prior to applying or can it be formed once awarded like other funding calls?</strong></p>

<p>To be the lead applicant in a project you must be a UK registered company when you apply to the competition.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a maximum percentage limit the funding for academic partners (e.g., in Smart it is 30%)?</strong></p>

<p>As with other government funding bodies funding higher education institutions, we will not pay more than 80% of the Full Economic Costs (FEC) calculated using the Transparent Approach to Costing (TRAC) methodology. Any applications requesting items that would ordinarily be found in a department, for example non-specialist computers, should include justification.</p>

<p><strong>We believe that we qualify under Aid for Start Ups. This requires us to show that we have “spent more than 10% of operating expenses on R&amp;D in one of the last 3 years.”  So that we can prepare for this, can you confirm how you define “operating expenses” and also what would count as “R&amp;D”?</strong></p>

<p>Operating expenses are the total outgoings of an organisation excluding items such as depreciation of capital purchases. EEF uses the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidelines-on-the-meaning-of-research-and-development-for-tax-purposes">same definition of R&amp;D as the Government uses for tax purposes</a>. In the example given, only the 30% contribution will count towards R&amp;D expenditure of the company.</p>

<h2>Application &amp; Eligibility</h2>

<p><strong>Is there a maximum grant per company?</strong></p>

<p>You may apply for a grant up to £1m.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to use an application previously submitted to a Innovate UK competition to form the basis of an application to EEF Round 9?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you may use the basis of a previous application for an application to EEF 9. Please do remember that EEF 9 will not have the same assessment criteria as Innovate UK competitions and should therefore be adapted accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Can project outputs be delivered in a non-UK country?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the outputs of the project may be delivered in a non-UK country, so long as over 50% of the project’s activities must be conducted in the UK. The fraction of the project activities that take place in the UK is measured as the proportion of the total eligible project costs that are spent in the UK, as opposed to spent outside the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Does the company need to be formed prior to applying or can it be formed once awarded like other funding calls?</strong></p>

<p>To be the lead applicant in a project you must be a UK registered company when you apply to the competition.</p>

<p><strong>Can an application have a single applicant? or the consortium is preferred?</strong></p>

<p>We do not have any preference for sole applications vs consortia. However, you will be expected to state and justify in your project application the amount of sub-contract funding (if any) within the expected spend of the project. You will be expected to explain the necessity for this spend as opposed to the addition of collaboration partners within the project proposal.</p>

<p><strong>How many partners are required?</strong></p>

<p>You can make a sole or collaborative application depending on the requirements of your project. If you make a collaborative application, there is no minimum or maximum requirement on the amount of project partners.</p>

<p><strong>Please can you provide further information around collaborative applications?  We collaborate with SME businesses and would like to understand the eligibility and process of submitting joint applications some more.</strong></p>

<p>If you are applying in a consortium you must apply under Aid for Research and Development Projects. There are no limits on number of partners in a consortium, or the combination of companies and institutions that make up the consortium. We have had successful applications from a very wide range of consortium combinations. You will be expected to justify the role and expertise of each partner within your consortium and why they are relevant to your project. There is only ever one lead partner on an application and the lead partner is responsible for paying the consortium partners when a milestone claim is made - BEIS only ever have pay the lead partner on a project. The lead partner must meet the eligibility requirements detailed in the EEF 9 Guidance Document e.g., they must be a UK registered company.</p>

<p><strong>Is this grant for Cornwall based businesses only?</strong></p>

<p>The competition is open to applicants in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, not just Cornwall based applicants. Applicants must all meet the Eligibility Criteria listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-entrepreneurs-fund-phase-9">Section 2 of the Guidance Document</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Do projects have to take place in Cornwall?</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for the fund over 50% of the project’s activities must be conducted in the UK. To be eligible for the preferential funding for Cornwall, at least 75% of the project’s activities must take place in Cornwall. The fraction of the project activities that take place in Cornwall is measured as the proportion of the total eligible project costs that are spent in Cornwall, as opposed to spent outside of Cornwall.</p>

<p><strong>You have specified the allocation of fund for Cornwall based projects to be 1M. Is there any number of projects that you are ideally planning to fund?</strong></p>

<p>The funding for Cornwall based projects will be allocated starting with the highest scoring project that meets the minimum funding criteria. We will fund as many projects as we have funding for, allocating the funding in order of their assessed scores, until either the funding has been allocated or no more projects meet the minimum funding criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Will UK entrepreneurs based overseas be eligible for this funding for example if they apply through UK based SME entity?</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for the fund over 50% of the project’s activities must be conducted in the UK. The fraction of the project activities that take place in the UK is measured as the proportion of the total eligible project costs that are spent in the UK, as opposed to spent outside the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Should the Gantt template should show projects starting on 1 Oct 22?</strong></p>

<p>The Project plans and Gantt charts templates can start on or after 1 October 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Are resubmissions allowed?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, if you have been previously unsuccessful in any of the EEF 1 - 8 competitions but may resubmit your application. You should consider any feedback given to you in those competition rounds. You may also apply for EEF 9 is you have been successful in previous EEF rounds; this work must extend the scope of the previous work to new applications or processes. There will be no advantage for existing EEF projects applying for further funding in the application process, as all applications will be treated on an equal basis in accordance with the competition criteria. You will be asked to declare any previous EEF applications during the application process. Failure to declare previous applications to the Fund will result in the failure of the Eligibility Criteria requirements to proceed to assessment.</p>

<p><strong>I have funded all development and Patent registration personally for many years and struggled to get assistance even by way of R &amp; D tax credits for all the money that I have spent so I would like to know please how financial help to continue with the further enhancement, development and commercialisation of the product is realised please.</strong></p>

<p>If you meet the eligibility criteria detailed in Section 4.1 of the EEF 9 Guidance Document you are welcome to make an application for a EEF 9 grant for the development and demonstration of your technology. Details of the application questions and the relevant assessment criteria is detailed in Section 9 of the EEF Guidance Document - this guidance should give you the best possible chance of making a successful application.</p>

<p><strong>Can an EEF grant submission be made for projects that will have already started before the grant decision is made, for instance, we are engaging in R&amp;D for our company and can accelerate the R&amp;D work with a grant under EEF9, but we do not want to wait for the EEF9 decision to proceed with early activities?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS is unable to fund retrospective work on projects.  The value of retrospective work may, however, be considered in the assessment process. Your application can only include work that will carried out once your Grant Offer Letter is signed.</p>

<p><strong>Can LLPs be a lead or partner in an application?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, they can be a lead or a partner in an application.</p>

<p><strong>Can projects include a Work Package devoted to process development?</strong></p>

<p>Work packages proposed in your application should support the development and demonstration of your technology. Therefore, you would need to justify in your application why a Work Package devoted to process Development is relevant to the development and demonstration of your technology.</p>

<p><strong>Can you also please confirm if there is a section/question to input background information on the company to set the project in context e.g., who we are, what we do, the story so far etc?</strong></p>

<p>There is no specific section/question for background information on the company. The application will be assessed on the 10 questions detailed in Section 9 of the EEF 9 Guidance Document.</p>

<p><strong>Can you please confirm if the attachments for the Gantt chart and the Risk Register must be completed using the templates provided or if we can use our own version? I appreciate the Cost and Performance pathway attachment and Project cost forms must be completed in the standard format.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the attachments for the Gannt Chart and Risk Register uploads must be completed using the BEIS templates that are provided.</p>

<p><strong>Based on the objectives of our proposed project for EEF 9 competition, I was wondering if there are any limits on CAPEX level and if majority of our project costs could be allocated to CAPEX (ie. above 70%).</strong></p>

<p>We do not place any limits on project costs in any particular category e.g. materials, labour. You will be expected to fill out the Project Cost Breakdown Form in your application which should clearly list all eligible costs associated with the project. Details of all eligible and non-eligible costs are detailed in the Section 7.4 of the EEF 9 Guidance Document.</p>

<p>Assessors will consider the following points when assessing the costs associated with the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the budget realistic for the scale and complexity of the project?</li>
  <li>Is the budget breakdown realistic?</li>
  <li>Do the work packages align with the predicted spend profile shown on the project cost breakdown form?</li>
</ul>

<p>You should take all these points into consideration when detailing the project proposal and its associated costs.</p>

<p><strong>What type of investment can be considered for the 20% of the project costs (e.g., time from partners or consultants etc.)? Can we have a consultant from outside UK?</strong></p>

<p>The details of eligible costs for the project can be found in Section 7.4 of the EEF 9 Guidance Document. The costs that are not covered by the grant should be eligible costs, but they do not need to fall within a specific category. Yes, costs for a consultant outside of the UK are eligible so long as over 50% of the project’s activities are conducted in the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Do the grants cover purely capital purchases or does it cover the costs of the project including Labour and materials?</strong></p>

<p>The grant covers the eligible costs for the project, not just capital items. Details of eligible costs can be found in Section 7.4 of the EEF 9 Guidance Document.</p>

<p><strong>How should facility costs be claimed for non-HEI RTO’s? And is it possible to claim direct costs related to facilities (such as electricity usage of the facility) within the EEF 9?</strong></p>

<p>EEF will only pay facility costs for non-HEI RTOs where the facility in question can be identified as being directly required for the work; that is, we will not pay indirect costs, which are part of the overheads (which we would normally expect to be 20% of labour costs unless a good and compelling case can be made for an alternate figure). In this case, the facilities should be described fully in the costing sheet in the ‘other costs’ category. Therefore, electricity costs will only be reimbursed if they are a significant part of the work and are separately metered.  Note that assessors of the proposal will be asked to determine in their professional opinion, whether this work forms value for money as one of the criteria and that excessive costs will be penalised by in the assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Is EEF eligible for projects in South Africa?</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for the fund over 50% of the project’s activities must be conducted in the UK. The fraction of the project activities that take place in the UK is measured as the proportion of the total eligible project costs that are spent in the UK, as opposed to spent outside the UK. Additionally, if you are applying as the lead applicant for the project you must be a UK registered company.</p>

<p><strong>Can a university be a sole applicant, lead partner or joint partner in an application?</strong></p>

<p>It is expected that research organisations, including universities, will apply as part of collaborative applications.</p>

<p><strong>Do partner companies have to be registered in the UK and be predominantly British-owned OR can they have a subsidiary/representative in the UK.</strong></p>

<p>Over 50% of the project’s activities must be conducted in the UK for projects to be eligible - the remaining costs may be spent out of the UK and therefore partner companies may be non UK registered companies or subsidiaries.  The fraction of the project activities that take place in the UK is measured as the proportion of the total eligible project costs that are spent in the UK, as opposed to spent outside the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Is UK subsidiary of overseas headquartered SME eligible for the funding?</strong></p>

<p>The UK subsidiary must have a UK registered company number if they are the lead applicant in the application. A UK subsidiary would also be eligible for funding as a partner in a project. In both cases over 50% of the project’s activities must be conducted in the UK for projects to be eligible.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p><strong>Could you provide details on the criteria that will be used for the commercial review?</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the commercial review is to assess the commercial integrity of technology being proposed within an application.</p>

<p><strong>Does the grant submission stay confidential so as not to affect IPR submissions?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, all applications remain confidential. If you are successful the public summary that you provide for the project will be published, but the application and project specifics remain confidential.</p>

<p><strong>Declaration date of successful applications?</strong></p>

<h2>After Award</h2>

<p><strong>What happens if we are awarded a both Smart grant and EEF 9 for the same project?  Smart grant results are announced a month or two earlier on 24th June. can we accept both Smart and EEF grants for different but overlapping projects?</strong></p>

<p>You cannot be funded twice for the same project. However, you can accept both grants IF the projects being completed are distinctly different in their objectives but happen run in parallel to each other.</p>

<p><strong>Would it be possible to share the T&amp;C’s documentation?</strong></p>

<p>Please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:entrepreneur@beis.gov.uk">entrepreneur@beis.gov.uk</a> if you would like a draft copy of the Grant Offer Letter and Grant Funding Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>How is the grant claimed? Retrospectively on a quarterly basis?</strong></p>

<p>Claims are paid in accordance with your milestone schedule which is detailed within your Grant Offer Letter. These have to be costs incurred and evidence of work completed against the milestone deliverables will be required.  We do not stipulate a set interval at which a milestone should be completed and claimed against. Instead, you will complete your milestone schedule based on project timescales – you can therefore claim on a monthly, quarterly and six monthly basis (and any combination of these) depending on when your specific project deliverables will be achieved.</p>

<p><strong>Can staff costs (with the agreed day rates) only be claimed in conjunction with meeting agreed milestones, or can regular monthly staff costs be claimed monthly?</strong></p>

<p>All costs are only claimed when deliverables are achieved, and milestone claims are made.</p>

<p><strong>Did we hear correctly that time sheets and payslips are not required for claiming against staff costs, only a signed Director’s Declaration? And presumably if total staff costs for a claim period come to more than £10,000, a bank statement to prove the spend?</strong></p>

<p>Timesheets and payslips are not required as evidence when you come to claim labour costs at a milestone claim. However, we do expect you to keep timesheets and your monitoring officer may request to see them when they complete a site visit. If total staff costs for a milestone claim are more than £10,000 you do not need a bank statement to prove spend.  All labour costs should be consistent with the day rates stated in the Project Cost Breakdown Form in the application, and should remain consistent over the duration of the project. A signed Directors Declaration is required as evidence for every milestone claim below £100,000.</p>

<p><strong>Single claims over £100,000 need an Independent Accountants Report - does this mean the claim for a single item, or the total amount for a single claim period? For example, if a quarterly claim comes to more than £100,000 but it is made up of multiple smaller claims aggregated together, does that trigger this point?</strong></p>

<p>An Independent Accountants Report is required when any single milestone claim made to BEIS is more than £100,000 i.e., the invoice you are submitting to BEIS for the claim is £100,000 or more ex VAT. Milestone claims can be made up of a single cost or multiple costs – in both instances we are concerned with the overall milestone claim cost being made to BEIS. In the example you provide you would be required to complete an Independent Accountants report even though the claim is made up of a series of smaller costs.</p>
