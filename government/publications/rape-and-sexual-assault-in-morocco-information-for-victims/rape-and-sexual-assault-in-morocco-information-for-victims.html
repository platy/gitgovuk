<p>If you’ve been sexually assaulted it’s important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make informed decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention</li>
  <li>report to local police</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see [Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk).</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the emergency police number in Morocco on 190</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-rabat">contact the British Embassy in Morocco, or your nearest consulate</a> on +21 2537633333</li>
</ul>

<p>Embassy staff will be empathetic, and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Morocco</h2>

<p>You can approach the police directly either by the emergency phone number 190 or in person at the nearest police station. The police told us that it is important to inform them as soon as possible. It is important that they either go to the hospital with you, or they get informed while you are at the hospital. Otherwise, the report from the hospital will not be of much help afterwards.</p>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you are in an area where there is a British embassy or consulate, they will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7.</p>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the nearest British embassy or consulate on (+212537633333) and they can offer you consular support.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>

<p>Although, police reports are not usually handed to the victim directly, the police should give you a reference number to follow up on the case at court. Reports in Morocco are normally made in Arabic.</p>

<p>You can ask the police if you wish to speak to a female officer. Although this may not always be possible, it is worth asking for this option.</p>

<p>If the officers do not speak English, they will try to have an interpreter available, but you may have to wait for one to arrive. You may want to consult our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/morocco-translators-and-interpreters">List of translators and interpreters</a>.</p>

<p>You will have to make a statement about the incident including a description of the attacker.</p>

<p>The police may keep any clothes or electronic equipment which may be evidence of your attack to present to a forensic examiner.</p>

<p>The police may send you, or accompany you to the nearest local hospital or clinic for a forensic examination. There are usually hospitals and clinics in every block in major cities, and there are local hospitals in remote villages.</p>

<p>Will local police in the country where the assault took place inform UK police.</p>

<p>You do not have to surrender your passport; however, the police may want to take copies.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Morocco</h2>

<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime, but if you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated if there is a lack of forensic evidence.</p>

<p>The British Embassy will be able to help you. This includes helping you make arrangements to contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK (although we are not able to pay for flights) and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK. We can provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators.</p>

<p>If you wish to speak to a female, we can have one of our consular officers available to speak to you.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with one, you can report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>The support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence.</p>

<p>If you file a report in the UK, Moroccan police inform us that it is far more difficult for them to investigate and take action. They are less likely to have any forensic evidence or to be able to carry out a detailed investigation as evidence such as CCTV is normally only kept for a few weeks. We are also aware that the transfer of a crime report from the UK to Morocco can take a considerable length of time, which again can affect the Moroccan police and the Moroccan court’s ability to take action. If you file a report in the UK, by the time the report reaches Morocco, the evidence may have been lost.</p>

<p>If you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>, or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London.</p>

<p>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police.</p>

<p>The UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened.  However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</p>

<p>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.</p>

<h2>The medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<p>We strongly suggest you see a doctor. Victims of rape and sexual assault are usually seen by gynaecologists. They can determine if you have been injured in any way and give you advice about pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<p>If you wish, you may ask for a female member of the medical staff be present.</p>

<p>If you want to report the incident to the police, contact the nearest police station so that they can accompany you to the nearest medical facility, or ask the doctors to call the police if you are already at the hospital. This is important for your case afterwards. (check section 2 above).</p>

<p>If you do not want to report it to the police, tell the doctors upon arrival at the hospital. They will respect your wish since staff are NOT obliged to automatically inform the police. However, they are obliged to inform the administration of the hospital.</p>

<p>Minor victims (under 16) have to be accompanied by a supervisor. If the victim is not accompanied, the case will be immediately reported to the General Prosecutor, and a social worker will be assigned to assist the minor throughout the procedure. The prosecutor will build a case on their behalf to prosecute any assailant. Unlike adults, minors are seen by paediatricians.</p>

<p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</p>

<p>Emergency contraceptive pills are available in almost all the pharmacies and are available as over-the-counter medicines (does not require a medical prescription).</p>

<p>Foreigners are provided services in all government hospitals. They may be required to pay a fee which is often nominal.</p>

<p>In private hospitals, payment can be made with credit cards or insurance. However, public hospitals and some private hospital may not have the option to pay with credit card, in this case you need to have cash with you. If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h2>Police investigations in Morocco: what to expect</h2>

<p>The police may go with you to the scene of the crime, or where you think the attacker is located to try to identify and arrest the person?</p>

<p>If the police make an arrest, they will take the suspect before the public prosecutor who will press charges given the evidence available.</p>

<p>The police will automatically forward the case to the court for legal action against any assailant.</p>

<p>You may attend the court hearing to make a statement in person. Otherwise, your lawyer can do it on your behalf if you wish to leave the country after the case is filed</p>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>The Court will not automatically update the British Embassy on the case’s progress. If you do not have a lawyer, the British Embassy can make enquiries and seek updates from the court on your behalf, but the court is under no obligation to provide the embassy with information.</p>

<p>A lawyer will be best placed to obtain updates and share them with you. You would need to give your consent for your lawyer to communicate/update the British Embassy. You may want to consult our <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/morocco-list-of-lawyers/list-of-english-speaking-lawyers-in-morocco">list of lawyers in Morocco</a>.</p>

<p>Lawyers tend to charge a fee for their services before they represent you at the court.</p>

<p>The court may be able to appoint a pro bono lawyer if you do not have funds. However this is not always an available option.</p>

<p>The trial will take place in the local language (Moroccan Darija). If you wish to attend the court hearing, it is up to the local authorities to provide an interpreter. If you wish not to attend, the prosecutor will go ahead with the case any way, given the evidence available.</p>

<p>There is no fixed timescale for the court process. The length of time court proceedings can take depends on a wide range of factors including: case complexity; or if the assailant pleads guilty or not guilty.</p>

<p>If the perpetrator is found guilty the court usually hands down prison sentences.</p>

<p>Your lawyer should be able to take care of all procures on your behalf if you have returned to the UK. If you are required to testify, your lawyer may ask the court to allow you to testify from the UK.</p>

<p>If, for any reason, you are required to return to Morocco, no assistance for travel and accommodation will be given by the Moroccan authorities.</p>

<p>Currently there are no Morocco or UK government compensation schemes applicable to survivors of rape and sexual assault. However, the court is empowered to order the offender to pay compensation for any injuries or losses.</p>

<h2>When you return home to the UK</h2>

<p>You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice where you live.</p>
