<h2>Technical information about Ofqual’s website accessibility</h2>

<p>Ofqual is committed to making our website accessible and achieving at least the requirements of the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

<h2>Compliance status</h2>

<p>Most of our website and associated digital services meet level AA of the Website Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. We are aware of the following non-compliance.</p>

<h2>Non-accessible content</h2>

<h3>Experts Gateway</h3>

<p>Pages on The Experts Gateway do not have a proper heading order. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships).</p>

<p>Some form controls on The Experts Gateway do not have labels for some input elements. This fails WCAG 2.1 criterion 3.3.2 (labels or instructions).</p>

<p>We will address these issues when we update the Experts Gateway during 2022.</p>

<h3>Essential documents</h3>

<p>Some web pages and documents which are essential to our operation, such as regulations and guidance which need to be followed by organisations we regulate, are currently contained in non-accessible PDF documents. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>

<p>We will make key documents available in accessible HTML formats where feasible to do so by July 2023. This is a challenging timeframe because we need to be certain that in presenting regulatory information in another way, we do not unintentionally change the meaning.</p>

<h3>The Ofqual Portal</h3>

<p>We recognise that our awarding organisation (AO) extranet ‘the Portal’ is not fully accessible. In September 2020 we said that it would be a disproportionate burden to make the Portal accessible but have since revised this view. The Ofqual Portal contains a large variety of content and interaction types. We have and will continue to address accessibility failures as we continually develop the Portal and will address highest priority issues by the end of 2022.</p>

<h3>Live video</h3>

<p>Our meeting and webinar software, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-live-captions-in-a-teams-meeting-4be2d304-f675-4b57-8347-cbd000a21260" rel="external">Microsoft Teams, allows for automated live captions to be enabled</a> by the user, and this should be available for most meetings and webinars arranged by Ofqual. It may not always be the case that live captions are available for all our events depending on the technology used.</p>

<h2>Disproportionate burden</h2>

<h3>Interactive analytics</h3>

<p>Content within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://analytics.ofqual.gov.uk/" rel="external">our interactive analytics</a> is not navigable by keyboard, does not make non-text content available to assistive technologies and is not adaptable. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criteria 1.1.1 (non-text content), 1.3.1 (info and relationships), 1.3.2 (meaningful sequence) and 1.3.3 (sensory characteristics).</p>

<p>We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so would be a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made" rel="external">disproportionate burden</a> within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. The data which supports these tools is available in more accessible formats such as downloadable spreadsheets. We will continue to explore how we might make our interactive data tools accessible in the future.</p>

<h3>Board papers</h3>

<p>Board papers and minutes that detail the discussions and actions of the Ofqual Board are contained within PDF documents that are sometimes redacted and not accessible to assistive technologies. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criteria 1.1.1 (non-text content), 1.3.1 (info and relationships) and 1.3.2 (meaningful sequence).</p>

<p>We will not be making accessible existing documents relating to the Board as we believe doing so would be too burdensome. We will publish our Board papers in accessible format from no later than July 2023.</p>

<h3>National statistics and official statistics</h3>

<p>Some of our statistical bulletins produced after 23 September 2018 are not compliant with WCAG 2.1. We are not planning to produce accessible versions of these documents as this would be too burdensome.</p>

<p>We do now publish statistical bulletins in an HTML or other accessible formats.</p>

<h3>The Register of Regulated Qualifications</h3>

<p>Pages on The Register of Regulated Qualifications do not have a proper heading order. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships).</p>

<p>The advanced search page on The Register of Regulated Qualifications does not have labels for some input elements. This fails WCAG 2.1 criterion 3.3.2 (labels or instructions).</p>

<p>A new programme of work is starting in May 2022 to review the existing Register functionality. Any changes and updates to the Register of Qualifications will conform to the accessibility Regs.</p>

<p>It would be a disproportionate burden to make any changes to the current Register, considering the immediate to long-term plans in place to improve this functionality.</p>

<h2>Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>

<h3>PDFs and other documents attached to pages</h3>

<p>Many of our older PDFs, and other documents attached to web pages, do not meet accessibility standards. For example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1.1.1 (non-text content)</li>
  <li>1.3.1 (info and relationships)</li>
  <li>1.3.2 (meaningful sequence)</li>
  <li>1.4.10 (reflow)</li>
  <li>2.4.3 (focus order)</li>
  <li>4.1.2 (name, role, value)</li>
</ul>

<p>The accessibility regulations <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made" rel="external">do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018</a> if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we do not plan to fix our archive of research documents or our National and Official Statistics publications.</p>

<p>Any new PDFs or attached documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.</p>

<h3>How we tested this website</h3>

<p>This website was last tested in December 2021. The test was carried out by Ofqual staff.</p>

<p>We tested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our main website, www.gov.uk/ofqual</li>
  <li>our publicly available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://register.ofqual.gov.uk/" rel="external">Register of Regulated Qualifications</a>
</li>
  <li>our extranet for regulated awarding organisations</li>
  <li>our extranet for external subject experts</li>
  <li>our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://analytics.ofqual.gov.uk/" rel="external">interactive data analytics site</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For our main website we used the following approach to decide on a sample of pages to test. For each type of content, we have published on our website, a random selection of 2 items were chosen to test. Both the web page and the attachments on it were tested against the success criteria for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.</p>

<p>The other websites are generated programmatically; for these we ran an automated test tool to indicate our level of compliance.</p>

<h2>What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

<p>At Ofqual making our information and services accessible to our whole audience is a team effort. We do this by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>considering accessibility at the start of our projects, and throughout</li>
  <li>making accessibility the whole team’s responsibility</li>
  <li>researching with users</li>
  <li>using a library of Government accessible components and patterns</li>
  <li>designing and building to level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1).</li>
</ul>

<p>We are making sure that accessibility issues highlighted in this statement are being prioritised and fixed. Measures include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a principle to move away from new content being produced in PDF</li>
  <li>educating colleagues on the importance of accessible publications</li>
  <li>plans to remove or replace older PDFs with more accessible content</li>
  <li>ongoing improvements to Ofqual’s digital services with a focus on accessibility</li>
  <li>prioritising accessibility remedial work in all new development and improvement projects</li>
  <li>working with suppliers to improve the accessibility of their products</li>
  <li>we will make key documents available in accessible HTML formats where feasible to do so by July 2023</li>
  <li>we will address WCAG 2.1 level AA failings when we update the Experts Gateway during 2022</li>
  <li>we will continue to address accessibility failures in the Portal as we continually develop functions and will address highest priority issues, as we identify them, by the end of 2022</li>
  <li>the Register of Qualifications functionality will be reviewed in 2022 and a programme of development put in place – all new development work will conform to WCAG 2.1 level AA</li>
  <li>we will publish our Board papers in accessible format from no later than July 2023</li>
</ul>
