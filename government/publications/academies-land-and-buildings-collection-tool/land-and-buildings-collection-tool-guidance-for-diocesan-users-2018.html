<h2>What is the land and buildings collection tool?</h2>

<p>The Land and buildings collection tool (LBCT) is an online form that collects information about all of the land and buildings used by academy trusts and their academies.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Due to exceptional circumstances, the land and buildings collection tool (LBCT) will not go live on 4 October. We are working to communicate the revised launch date as soon as we can, though we expect it to be delayed by several weeks.</p>
</div>

<h2>Your role</h2>

<p>You will need to review the LBCT return for all academies with church owned land where you have been assigned the diocesan user role. This involves checking that the information the trust has entered is accurate and complete.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>You will only be able to see information and supporting documents relating to church owned land</p>
</div>

<h2>Getting set up on the system</h2>

<h3>Existing users</h3>

<p>If you already have the diocesan user role and your email address has not changed, you will be able to access the online form when this becomes available. Your login details for last year’s form will still work.</p>

<h3>New users</h3>

<p>Please contact the education office of your church authority, as they approve all new diocesan user role requests. Once they’ve done this, we’ll set up your account within 5 working days and will email you with your login details.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you do not have an account, please contact your education office as soon as possible</p>
</div>

<h3>All users</h3>

<p>Log in to your account as soon as you can to confirm that your details are correct and that you can navigate around the form.</p>

<p>Contact your academy trusts early, to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check that they have the correct contact details for you</li>
  <li>agree timescales, deadlines, and roles and responsibilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the form</h2>

<ol>
  <li>the trust preparer or approver will send you the church owned land part of the return for you to review</li>
  <li>you log in to review the form and any documents they’ve linked to it</li>
  <li>if you want any amendments, you can reject it, along with your reasons for rejection. The approver will then make the changes</li>
  <li>once you’re happy with the form, you approve it</li>
  <li>you can then submit the return to the DfE, or ask the trust approver to do this</li>
  <li>once the form has been submitted, you and the trust will get an email from DfE confirming receipt</li>
</ol>

<h3>Your dashboard</h3>

<p>When you log in, you will be presented with a dashboard. This year, the dashboard includes a new ‘Submitted to DfE’ column.  This will show you if a trust has submitted its return to DfE or not.</p>

<p>This is an example of how the dashboard will look.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="The updated diocese dashboard" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/130194/Webp.net-resizeimage__23_.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>A diocese user example dashboard</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>If any trusts are missing from your dashboard, please speak to the trust concerned to check that they have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>added you as a user</li>
  <li>entered your email address correctly with no spaces or extra letters – this is the same email address you use to log into the LBCT</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reviewing the information</h3>

<p>When you click on the academy trust name you will be taken to their dashboard.  From there you can see the trust and its academies.  Click on any link with church owned land and you will be taken to the ‘review’ page. This shows:</p>

<p>• summary of the church owned land for that trust</p>

<p>• any related documentation, for example: a site map and church supplemental agreement or the Land registry register of title</p>

<p>You can also review the information via the ‘download return data’ link.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This year, trusts will provide details of any tangible non-land and building leases they have at 31 August 2022. As a diocese user, you will not need to sign off that element of the return, you will only see and review any ‘church-owned’ land data that the trust has entered.</p>
</div>

<p>You cannot edit the information: you can only accept it or reject it.</p>

<p>If you are not happy with the information in the form or any linked documents, select the ‘reject’ button and give your reasons for rejection.</p>

<p>The trust will get an email alert, but you should speak to them to discuss the changes you want, in order to avoid any delays with the form.</p>

<p>All academy users can now adjust the form for any church owned land rejection issues. However, the trust approver will still need to review the return before it is resubmitted back for diocesan review. When you are happy that all of the information entered in the form is accurate and complete, click the ‘accept’ button. The status will change to ‘Ready to submit to DfE‘.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>You need to repeat the review process for all academy trusts on your dashboard</p>
</div>

<h3>Submitting the return</h3>

<p>When the trust and all of its academies have a status of ‘ready to submit to DfE’ the dashboard will display a green ‘Submit to DfE’ button. This button can be pressed by either yourself or the academy trust approver, depending on who is the last user in the form. Please speak with your academy trust approver to agree who will submit the return to DfE. Once clicked, the status will change to ‘Submitted to DfE’ and the form will become read-only. You will not be able to make any changes after the form has been submitted. Both you and the trust users will receive an email to confirm that the return has been successfully submitted.</p>

<h2>Top tips</h2>

<p>• agree timelines and ‘roles &amp; responsibilities’ with your academy trusts as soon as possible</p>

<p>• make sure that the trusts have the correct email contact details for you – double check the email address they hold</p>

<p>• if you reject the form, contact the trust to ensure they understand the reasons for rejection</p>

<p>• check your emails every morning: we’ll send you a summary report every day where something has changed which needs your review or sign-off</p>
