<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is to help users understand what to do with any data adjustments we suggest in the LBCT return.</p>

<p>Each year the DfE reviews the content of the LBCT data to make sure it’s correctly recorded. There’ll be instances where we find inconsistencies in the data provided and we will ask you, through ‘data adjustments’, to review and, if you agree, correct these. This data adjustments guide is split into sections to show you how to make the changes in your form.</p>

<p>If you have any adjustments, you will access them via the ‘data adjustment’ section in your academy or trust index screen. In the example below, the adjustment is at trust level.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="The data adjustments shown on the academies dashboard" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/130181/capture-data-adjust-1.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>The data adjustments shown on the academies dashboard</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>You may wish to download the data adjustments page as a reference point when reviewing and updating your LBCT return.</p>

<p>If you can’t see the ‘data adjustments’ section at the top of either your trust or academy index page, you won’t have any.</p>

<p>We have used our fictitious academy trust, Coketown, to demonstrate how to correct your occupancies where we have asked you to add, amend or delete them. We have also covered what to do if you disagree with our suggested data adjustments.</p>

<p>The aerial map for Coketown looks like this.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="A sample site map for the LBCT" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/77501/site_map_latest_v.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>This is a sample site map to upload to the document store</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>According to this aerial map, Coketown has the following occupancies and assets:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Occupancy</th>
      <th scope="col">Route</th>
      <th scope="col">Asset</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Occupancy 1 - woodlands</td>
      <td>church owned land</td>
      <td>A11 - land</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Occupancy 2 - main site</td>
      <td>Freehold</td>
      <td>A21 - land and playing fields, A22 - main school block, A23 - sixth form block, A24 - basketball courts, A25 - arts and drama block, A26 - Y7 - 9 MUGA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Occupancy 3 - sixth form area</td>
      <td>Leasehold</td>
      <td>A 31 - land</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Need to add an occupancy</h2>

<h3>Scenario 1 - need to add an occupancy</h3>

<p>In this example, the trust hasn’t added the sixth form area as an occupancy within the form. The data adjustment section in the academy index page will look like this.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Occupancy description</th>
      <th scope="col">Field adjustment relates to</th>
      <th scope="col">Suggested entry on return</th>
      <th scope="col">Suggested action</th>
      <th scope="col">Reason for adjustment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Sixth form area</td>
      <td>Occupancy type</td>
      <td>Leasehold</td>
      <td>Add missing occupancy route as follows: occupancy description sixth form area and land registry title deed ‘ABC12345’</td>
      <td>Our review of the academy site has identified an additional occupancy that needs to be added to your LBCT return</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Action needed</h3>

<p>To do this, in the section entitled ‘Check your occupancies’ (as shown below), click on ‘Add a new occupancy’. Fill in the required fields based on the suggested action in the data adjustment table. You will also need to add any assets for the occupancy. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-land-and-buildings-collection-tool/land-and-buildings-collection-tool-summary-guidance-for-academies#assets">You can read more about assets</a> in our main guidance. In the case of Coketown, the only asset within the sixth form area (occupancy 3 on the map) is the land for the site.  On the ‘add assets’ page, click on ‘add new asset’ and complete the follow-up questions for a land asset.</p>

<figcaption><p>How to add a new occupancy</p></figcaption></figure>

<h2>Need to change an occupancy description or type</h2>

<p>We may ask you to change either an occupancy description, occupancy type or both.  In this example, we will look at both.</p>

<p>The data adjustments will look like this.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Occupancy description</th>
      <th scope="col">Field adjustment relates to</th>
      <th scope="col">Current entry</th>
      <th scope="col">Suggested entry on return</th>
      <th scope="col">Suggested action</th>
      <th scope="col">Reason for adjustment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Main school site and woodland area</td>
      <td>Occupancy description</td>
      <td>Main school site and woodland area</td>
      <td>Main site</td>
      <td>Rename occupancy</td>
      <td>Our review indicates that the name of the occupancy is incorrect</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Main school site and woodland area</td>
      <td>Occupancy type</td>
      <td>Leasehold</td>
      <td>Freehold</td>
      <td>Please change the occupancy type to freehold</td>
      <td>Our review indicates that the occupancy route is freehold</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Action needed</h3>

<p>To do both, navigate to the main school site and woodland area occupancy and amend the ‘Description of the site’ and ‘Occupancy type’ boxes – as shown below.  If you make a change to some important fields, we will ask you to tell us the reason why you are making it.  Select ‘suggested DfE adjustment’ from the dropdown of the question that asks for a reason for the change.  Remember to review the rest of the section of the form as there may be additional questions to complete.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="How to change the description of a site and the occupancy type" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/130183/Webp.net-resizeimage__20_.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>How to change the description of a site and the occupancy type</p></figcaption></figure>

<h2>Need to amend data within an occupancy</h2>

<p>As part of data adjustments to amend some important fields like ‘occupancy type’ as in example 2 above, we may also ask you to add or amend other information within your occupancies. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>landlord name</li>
  <li>land Registry deed of register number</li>
  <li>length of lease years</li>
  <li>monthly rental payment amount</li>
  <li>peppercorn</li>
</ul>

<p>The data adjustments will look like this.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Occupancy description</th>
      <th scope="col">Field adjustment relates to</th>
      <th scope="col">Current entry</th>
      <th scope="col">Suggested entry on return</th>
      <th scope="col">Suggested action</th>
      <th scope="col">Reason for adjustment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Main site</td>
      <td>Land registry deed number</td>
      <td>NN123456</td>
      <td>NN987654</td>
      <td>Update title deed number</td>
      <td>Our review indicates that the title deed number is incorrect</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sixth form area</td>
      <td>Landlord</td>
      <td>Mr Smith</td>
      <td>Coketown District Council</td>
      <td>Update landlord name</td>
      <td>Our review indicates that the landlord name is incorrect</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sixth form area</td>
      <td>Monthly payment amount</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>250</td>
      <td>Update the monthly payment amount</td>
      <td>Our review of the leasehold agreement shows a monthly payment amount</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Action needed</h3>

<p>To do this, simply go to the relevant field and make the requested changes as you work through the appropriate occupancy. Remember that for some important fields we ask for a reason for making the change.  All data adjustment requests from the DfE should provide the reason ‘Suggested DfE adjustment’.</p>

<h2>Need to delete an occupancy</h2>

<p>We may ask you to delete an occupancy if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s been entered in error (usually because it has or should be recorded as an asset)</li>
  <li>it’s a duplicate</li>
</ul>

<p>When an occupancy is deleted, all associated assets and documents will also be removed.  You should therefore ensure that you save any documents and information that might be needed for further completion of the form before you delete the occupancy.</p>

<h3>Worked example</h3>

<p>In this scenario, the trust has incorrectly reported the arts and drama block as an occupancy as well as an asset within another occupancy (the latter being correct).</p>

<p>The data adjustment page will look like this.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Occupancy description</th>
      <th scope="col">Field adjustment relates to</th>
      <th scope="col">Current entry</th>
      <th scope="col">Suggested entry on return</th>
      <th scope="col">Suggested action</th>
      <th scope="col">Reason for adjustment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Arts and drama block</td>
      <td>Occupancy type</td>
      <td>Freehold</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Delete this occupancy</td>
      <td>Our review indicates that this has been added as an occupancy when it should have been added as an asset instead. This is already included within another occupancy already added to the form</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Action needed</h3>

<p>Find the arts and drama block occupancy in the list of occupancies and select ‘remove occupancy’.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="How to remove an occupancy in the LBCT " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/130184/Webp.net-resizeimage__21_.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>How to remove an occupancy in the LBCT</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>From the drop-down list that appears, choose ‘removal of invalid occupancy’ followed by ‘delete occupancy’. Once done, this action cannot be reversed or undone.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="An image of how to delete an occupancy in the LBCT " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/130185/Webp.net-resizeimage__22_.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>How to delete an occupancy in the LBCT</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The page will update and the user should click ‘save and back to academy index’.</p>

<h2>What if I disagree with the suggested data adjustments?</h2>

<p>All users can see and make data adjustments but only the approver can sign off the declaration to accept or reject them.</p>

<p>The approver will be asked to confirm if they agree or disagree with the data adjustments via a declaration statement. If they disagree, they will need to explain why.</p>
