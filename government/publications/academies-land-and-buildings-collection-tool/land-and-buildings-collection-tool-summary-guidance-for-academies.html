<h2><strong>What is the land and buildings collection tool?</strong></h2>

<p>The land and buildings collection tool (LBCT) collects information about all of the land and buildings used by academy trusts and their academies. It’s a snapshot of your trust’s land and assets at 31 August each year.</p>

<p>You must complete the return if you had at least one open academy on 31 August each year.
Academies that transferred to your trust on or after 1 September will not be included in the return. Their previous trust will do this.</p>

<p>If you have church-owned land, your nominated diocesan user will need to review your return by the deadline as well. Please allow a reasonable amount of time for diocesan review.</p>

<h3><strong>Roles and responsibilities</strong></h3>

<p>There are two stages involved in submitting your return:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>preparer</strong> collects all the data required and enters it into the form; they cannot submit it to DfE</li>
  <li>the <strong>approver</strong> checks the form for accuracy and completeness before submitting it to DfE</li>
</ul>

<p>The approver can do everything, but from feedback from other trusts, we’ve found that it’s best to split the roles.</p>

<p>The approver must be the trust’s accounting officer or someone they’ve authorised to do this</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>What’s new for this collection?</strong></h3>

<p>You can now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manage your previously uploaded documents as you work through the form</li>
  <li>see diocesan user details entered in the form via the dashboard</li>
  <li>edit the form as a preparer, if rejected by the diocesan user</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, if you have any free schools in your trust, we will ask you to provide us with a copy of your asset management plan, if you have one. See section 8 for more details.</p>

<h2><strong>What you need to do</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>If your trust completed the LBCT last year</strong></h3>

<p>Before you start, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://logon.fasst.org.uk/Login/dialog/appl/sfa/wflow/auth" rel="external">log into your IDAMS account</a> to check that all roles are assigned to the correct people, and they have the same permissions. If you have any queries about this please use the ESFA academy questions to get assistance.</p>

<p>Your return will be populated with the data that was submitted last year. You will need to check this data and update it to reflect your occupancies and assets on 31 August 2021.</p>

<p>If you acquired any academies between 1 September 2020 and 31 August 2021, these will be flagged as ‘New’ on your dashboard. Their data will already be included if they completed the return last year. If not, you will need to complete a return for them.</p>

<h3><strong>If you are a new academy trust</strong></h3>

<p>If your trust opened its first academy after 31 August 2020, you will need to complete the return for all academies which were active on 31 August 2021.</p>

<p>Before you start, you will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-an-idams-account">register an account on the Identity and Access Management System (IDAMS).</a> This is where you manage your account and allocate user roles to complete the LBCT. <strong>If you have any church-owned land, speak to your local diocese as soon as possible to confirm who will review that part of your return by the deadline</strong>.</p>

<p>When you add an occupancy, you need to provide supporting documents and link them to the occupancy as you work through the form.</p>

<h3><strong>Top tips for this year’s return</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>you must complete the section for your trust as well as your academies</li>
  <li>each occupancy must be linked to at least two documents</li>
  <li>you must add land as an asset unless you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/royal-grants-letters-patent-charters-from-1199/" rel="external">have an exception</a>, for example, a Royal Charter</li>
  <li>don’t forget to add your playing fields, even if they’re at a different location to your main site or where they’re provided by another organisation such as a local authority</li>
  <li>once every academy has a status of ‘ready to submit to DfE’ press the green ‘Submit to DfE’ button on the dashboard for final submission to DfE</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Quick LBCT summary</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Enter contact details</strong></p>

<p>You must provide at least one contact for the trust.</p>

<p><strong>Confirm all centrally-held assets</strong></p>

<p>These are any assets that belong to your trust, and not to an individual academy.</p>

<p><strong>Review and update occupancy and asset information</strong></p>

<p>For each academy, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm that basic details such as name, address and contacts are correct</li>
  <li>for free schools only, tell us about your school’s asset management plan</li>
  <li>review and update details of each occupancy, with supporting documentation</li>
  <li>review and update details of all assets</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to return to the dashboard and move on to the next academy listed on your dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>If any of your occupancies are on church-owned land, send for diocesan review</strong></p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add or confirm diocese contact details</li>
  <li>ensure that the church-owned occupancies are reviewed by the diocese</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Submit data to DfE</strong></p>

<p>Once the dashboard shows ‘Ready to submit to DfE’ for the trust and academy links, click the green ‘Submit to DfE’ button.</p>

<h3><strong>Email notifications</strong></h3>

<p>If you are a single academy trust (SAT), the preparer or approver will get an email every time that the form moves from one status to another – for example, when it’s sent to an approver or to a diocese checker.</p>

<p>If you are a multi-academy trust (MAT) or diocesan user, you will receive one summary email report every day, but only if there has been a status change in any of your academies in the previous 24 hours. You will also get an email at the point at which your return is submitted to DfE.</p>

<p>Diocese checkers will get one summary email for each academy trust that they have the diocesan user role for.</p>

<h3><strong>Dashboard</strong></h3>

<p>The dashboard is your home page. It gives the status of all the returns you need to complete - for the trust and for each individual academy. You access your dashboard via the login page.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you are a SAT, you must still complete the trust section of the return, shown via the Companies House Number, as well as academy</p>
</div>

<p>As you progress through the return, it will pass through a number of status. You may not see all of these – some will only appear if the form has to be sent back to the preparer for more work, while others only appear if your trust needs to report on church-owned land.</p>

<h3><strong>Academy trust section</strong></h3>

<p>This is where you tell us about your centrally held assets – any land or buildings which are not part of an academy and which are used solely by the trust. You may own, lease or rent them, or they may have been donated to the trust.</p>

<p>You can see an <a class="govuk-link" href="#Centrally">example case study on centrally held assets</a> in the case studies section.</p>

<h3><strong>Academy listing section</strong></h3>

<p>This section includes all the academies within your trust.</p>

<p>Any academies which transferred into the trust on or after 1 September 2020 will be flagged as ‘New’.</p>

<p>Click on each academy link to review the academy information. You can amend existing information and add new occupancies, documents and assets.</p>

<h3><strong>Downloading trust report</strong></h3>

<p>You can also download your trust report as an Excel file. This file will always reflect the latest version of your return. This means that you can use it to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review the data from your 2020 return – providing you haven’t started to make any changes to the 2021 form</li>
  <li>review any data that has been saved in the online form at any stage leading up to completion</li>
  <li>keep a record of your 2021 return</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>We recommend that you download a copy of your return when you first log in to the return. If you are a MAT, this will include data on any academies which have transferred in.</p>
</div>

<h3><strong>Data adjustments</strong></h3>

<p>You’ll see a ‘Data adjustments’ link if we think that any of the data you entered in your 2020 return is incorrect or incomplete. Adjustments, which are all linked to <a class="govuk-link" href="#occupancies">occupancies</a>, fall into 3 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add occupancy type</li>
  <li>delete occupancy type</li>
  <li>change details of occupancy type</li>
</ul>

<p>We will explain the reason for the suggested adjustment and suggest how you should change the data. All users can see adjustments, but only the approver can accept or reject them: if you reject them, you will need to explain why.</p>

<p>You can download or print the suggested adjustments and refer to them as you review your return.</p>

<p>For step-by-step instructions showing how to action data adjustments, <a class="govuk-link" href="gov.uk/government/publications/academies-land-and-buildings-collection-tool/land-and-building-collection-tool-data-adjustments-guide-for-academies">see our dedicated ‘data adjustments’ guidance page</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Free schools</strong></h2>

<p>If your academy isn’t a free school or if you’re a MAT without any, please ignore this section.</p>

<p>If your trust contains at least one free school, studio school, city technology college (CTC) or university technical college (UTC), you will see a new short ‘Free School’ section in the form. This year we are collecting summary asset management plan information from free schools. A free school is a school that has opened with no previous involvement with a local authority – we will write to you to let you know.</p>

<p>You will need to provide details of your asset management plan arrangements. To find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools">what an asset management plan is please see this link</a>. You will be asked, if you are a SAT:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you have an asset management plan (Yes / No)</li>
  <li>if yes – please upload it</li>
  <li>if no:</li>
  <li>do you intend to create one (Yes / No)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are part of MAT the only difference is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if your free school is included within the overall Trust’s asset management plan (if part of a MAT) (Yes / No)</li>
  <li>if ‘No’:</li>
  <li>if you have an individual asset management plan (Yes / No)</li>
  <li>if yes – please upload it</li>
  <li>if no:</li>
  <li>do you intend to create one (Yes / No)</li>
</ul>

<p>If ‘Yes’ then the section for this free school is complete. We don’t require a copy of your MAT asset management plan.</p>

<h2><strong>Your occupancies</strong></h2>

<p>Occupancy means the way each academy occupies the sites it uses. If you have a main academy site and a separate playing field, this counts as 2 occupancies. For each of your occupancies, we need details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what it’s used for</li>
  <li>the occupancy type, for example freehold, leasehold or church-owned land</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Each piece of land will have its own Land Registry document, which will set out the occupancy type.</p>
</div>

<p>Your school site plan and your Land Registry documents will help you identify how many pieces of land you occupy and how you occupy them.</p>

<h3><strong>How to create a site map</strong></h3>

<p>A site map needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show your entire site</li>
  <li>show each occupancy, with boundaries clearly marked</li>
  <li>show (and provide a name and reference number for) each asset</li>
</ul>

<p>You can work from your academy’s site plan, or from an image generated by Google Maps.</p>

<p>If you use Google Maps, you need to use ‘Satellite view’, as this will show features such as buildings and sports fields more clearly.</p>

<p>There are two styles of site maps shown here as an example:</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="A sample site map for the LBCT" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/77501/site_map_latest_v.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>This is a sample site map to upload to the document store</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Overhead image of a sample annotated site map " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/106176/resized_sitemap.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>This shows an alternate site for an academy that has been taken using generic satellite mapping software</p></figcaption></figure>

<h3><strong>Occupancy types</strong></h3>

<p>For each piece of land, you need to select an occupancy type from the options below.</p>

<p><strong>Freehold</strong> : you own the land and are the landlord – the title deeds will state this.</p>

<p><strong>Leasehold</strong> (including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-land-and-buildings-collection-tool/land-and-buildings-collection-tool-summary-guidance-for-academies#private-finance-initiative">Private Finance Initiatives</a>): you have a lease with your landlord and pay them rent for the term of the lease, for example 125 years at £500 per month.</p>

<p><strong>Church-owned land</strong> You rent the land from church trustees and your lease has a church supplemental agreement in place. It will usually have clauses about how you may use the land. If there’s no supplemental agreement, select church lease.</p>

<p><strong>Church lease</strong> : a lease with the local diocese for use of church-owned land, which will also include a restrictive clause about the use of site.</p>

<p><strong>Licence</strong> : a legal agreement with the owner to use their land.</p>

<p><strong>Customary occupation</strong> : an informal standing arrangement which allows you to occupy the site.</p>

<p><strong>Tenancy at will</strong> : a short-term agreement that allows you to use the land before a formal contract has been drawn up.</p>

<p><strong>Development agreement:</strong> a contract between a property owner or developer, a local authority and potentially the Secretary of State. This is sometimes also referred to as a ‘Design and Build Contract Development Agreement’.</p>

<p><strong>Other</strong> : this covers any type of occupancy not covered above, for example Royal Warrants.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure about what occupancy type to select, please ask us either at the weekly MS Teams dial in call or raise an ESFA academy question.</p>

<p>For each occupancy, you will need to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when you first occupied the land</li>
  <li>the occupancy type</li>
  <li>whether you have disposed of an individual piece of land in the year</li>
  <li>any change to how you occupy the site</li>
</ul>

<p>To add a new occupancy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the add another occupancy type</li>
  <li>upload your supporting documents</li>
  <li>for some existing occupancies, we have added a small number of additional questions this year</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that we have removed a larger number of occupancy questions to make your journey through the form simpler.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Make sure you have the Land Registry title number to hand, as you’ll need to add this to each occupancy. You’ll find this at the top of the Title Deeds form, and it consists of 8 or 9 letters and numbers, for example, AA123456.</p>
</div>

<h2><strong>Uploading and linking documents</strong></h2>

<p>You will upload and manage any existing documents while you’re working through the occupancy part of the form. The form will show you documents previously uploaded, you will need to review these to ensure that they are still relevant.  Any documents that are no longer applicable can be removed. These will be archived within the DfE document store and you won’t see them in your LBCT return next year.</p>

<p>For each occupancy, you will need to link the supporting documents listed in the table below., make sure that they’re the latest versions.</p>

<p>A document can be linked to more than one occupancy: this will often be the case with a site map. An occupancy will always have at least 2 documents linked to it.</p>

<p>Each type of occupancy needs to be linked to the following documents. You can use PDF, JPEG, GIF and PNG formats. Please note the documents will need to be smaller than 23mb.</p>

<h2><strong>Church-owned land</strong></h2>

<p>If your trust has any church-owned land, this information (and any linked documents) will need to be reviewed by a diocesan user.</p>

<p>You’ll need to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you enter the correct details for diocesan users to give them access to the LBCT return</li>
  <li>they can login and see your trust</li>
  <li>you agree timescales and deadlines</li>
  <li>you’re in agreement about whether you or they will submit the return to DfE</li>
</ul>

<p>The diocesan user will only be able to access and view data and supporting documents about church-owned land.</p>

<p>If the diocesan user is not content with the church owned land entered in the form, they will reject it back to the academy trust with comments outlining what changes are needed. This year, the preparer will be able to edit the form without the approver rejecting it. The approver must approve the changes before resubmitting it to the diocesan user.</p>

<p>Your diocesan user can submit your return on your behalf, but only if all academies within the trust <strong>and the trust itself</strong> have the status ‘Ready to submit to DfE’ – not just those with church-owned land.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>The approver or diocesan user must submit the return by 8 November 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>If the diocesan user can’t log into the return, confirm that the email address you have for them is correct – check for spaces, special characters, extra letters or numbers. If this is the case, they’ll need to be set up as a new user. They must contact their church body to do this - this will be the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Catholic Education Service (CES)</li>
  <li>Church of England Education Office (CofEEO)</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Assets</strong></h2>

<p>After you have added all occupancy types for your academy and linked all documents, you will be asked to add the assets that sit on each occupancy. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>playing fields</li>
  <li>land for the site or sites</li>
  <li>land for buildings if no other land is recorded on that occupancy</li>
  <li>swimming pools, tennis courts etc</li>
  <li>buildings, such as classrooms, offices or a caretaker’s house</li>
</ul>

<p>How to record assets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the asset has had any capital improvements or is under construction please let us knows</li>
  <li>if the asset has been sublet please provide details</li>
  <li>if the asset has been disposed of please state when and how this was done</li>
  <li>state when any buildings were constructed</li>
  <li>if a single building has multiple uses such as offices and classrooms then select ‘mixed use’</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re unsure about how to record buildings please use the table below as a guide.</p>

<p>You must add each asset in turn, for each academy in your trust, as well as for the trust itself. Please name each asset on the sites you occupy using a brief description that is meaningful to you. You must account for all buildings on the site, even if they are not used for educational purposes. Include temporary assets such as portable temporary structures.</p>

<p>If you have not included any land as an asset on an occupancy, you will need to explain why.</p>

<p>You can see example case studies on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-land-and-buildings-collection-tool/land-and-buildings-collection-tool-summary-guidance-for-academies#temporary-assets">temporary assets</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-land-and-buildings-collection-tool/land-and-buildings-collection-tool-summary-guidance-for-academies#Sublets">how to enter a sublet</a> in the ‘case studies’ section.</p>

<h2><strong>Approvers: how to submit your LBCT return</strong></h2>

<p>Before the LBCT return can be submitted to the DfE, it must be approved – but only when every status on your dashboard is marked ‘Ready to submit to DfE’. This can be done by the academy trust approver or the diocesan user where there is church-owned land.</p>

<p>If you are the approver and all academies and the trust itself have the status ‘Sent to approver’, there are 2 ways you can approve the return:</p>

<ul>
  <li>link by link – review each academy and your trust, and accept or reject each one individually</li>
  <li>using the ‘Approve all’ button – use this only if you are satisfied that the preparer has input their data correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>You can then submit the return by pressing the ‘Submit to DfE’ button. You and the preparer will each get an email confirming that we’ve received the return, and that you don’t need to do anything else.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Diocesan users have specific guidance on how they should approve returns with church-owned land.</p>
</div>

<h3>Rejecting the return</h3>

<p>If you don’t think the information entered is correct or complete, you can amend this data or alternatively, click the ‘reject’ button, and add your reasons for rejection. The preparer will get an email but we recommend that you contact them to let them know. They will then have to go back into the form and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review the reasons you’ve given</li>
  <li>make any changes they agree with</li>
  <li>re-send the form for you to approve or send back for further changes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Downloading reports</h3>

<p>You can download last year’s report before you start working on this year’s return. In addition, you can also download a copy of this year’s trust’s data from the dashboard or from each academy’s review page.</p>

<h3><strong>Centrally-held assets</strong></h3>
<p>These are any land and buildings owned or occupied by the trust which are not part of an academy, for example a separate headquarters site for a MAT or an investment property.</p>

<p><strong>Example scenario</strong></p>

<p>Coketown MAT is made up of nine academies located across the UK. The trust has a designated team of staff who look after centralised services such as finance, estates and HR. These staff are based in a rented office space in Coventry. The trust leases this space and pays for it from a central pot of funds. This office is not linked to any of the academies within the trust. The trust also owns a freehold piece of land in Yorkshire where they have built a sports centre which is used by the local community.</p>

<p><strong>How to record on the LBCT</strong></p>

<p>On the trust link for Coketown Multi-academy trust, enter two occupancy types.</p>

<p>Occupancy 1:</p>

<h3><strong>Sublets</strong></h3>

<p>Subletting means letting out property (or part of it) to another tenant through a separate lease agreement known as a ‘sub-lease’.</p>
<p><strong>Example scenario</strong></p>

<p>Coketown Primary Academy has a 125-year long leasehold agreement with Coventry City Council. The school has a main school block and a separate building which they have sublet to a dance school for 1 year.</p>

<p><strong>How to record on the LBCT</strong></p>

<p>A sublet asset should only be entered on the LBCT where a formal agreement has been drawn up.</p>

<p>On the academy link for Coketown Primary, enter one occupancy type:</p>

<h3><strong>Caretaker’s House</strong></h3>

<p>This is any building which is solely occupied by the academy caretaker, either rent-free or at a nominal rent. This is usually below market rent.</p>

<p><strong>Example scenario</strong></p>

<p>Coketown Secondary Academy has a 125-year long leasehold agreement with Coventry City Council for the school’s site. There is a main school block building and a residential building which is occupied by the school caretaker as part of their terms of employment.</p>

<p><strong>How to record on the LBCT</strong></p>

<p>A caretaker’s house should always be entered as an asset. Where it is occupied by the school caretaker as part of their terms of employment and the rent is free or below market value, the asset should <strong>not</strong> be marked as a ‘sublet’ – you should only record it as a sublet if the caretaker’s rent is at or close to the market rate.</p>

<p>On the academy link for Coketown Secondary, enter one occupancy type:</p>

<p>Occupancy 1:</p>

<h3><strong>Capital improvement</strong></h3>

<p>This refers to any works that increase an asset’s value, prolong its useful life or adapt it to new uses. This excludes repairs or maintenance such as paint touch-ups, minor fixes or elevator maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Example scenario</strong></p>

<p>Coketown Secondary Academy has a 125-year long leasehold agreement with Coventry City Council. On this site, they have an admin office block and the main school block. The main school block is currently undergoing a major structural change.</p>

<p><strong>How to record on the LBCT</strong></p>

<p>All building assets should be entered on the LBCT. For the ‘Main School Block’ asset, answer ‘Yes’ for capital improvements in-year.</p>

<p>On the academy link for Coketown Secondary, enter one occupancy type:</p>

<p>Occupancy 1.</p>

<h3><strong>Private finance initiative (PFI)</strong></h3>

<p>In a PFI contract, a private consortium will undertake to finance, design, deliver and maintain a project such as a school. The Local Authority (LA) will then make regular payments to the consortium. The trust is not a signatory to the PFI arrangement: its relationship is solely with the LA. Any payments it makes to the LA are lease payments on the academy site.</p>

<p><strong>Example scenario</strong></p>

<p>Coketown Junior Academy joined the Coketown MAT in September last year. Prior to that, it was a LA maintained school: the LA entered into a contract with a private construction company to finance and build a new school block. When the academy joined Coketown MAT, it had already entered into a 125-year lease agreement with the LA for the occupancy of the academy site. The agreed monthly lease payments were £2,000.</p>

<p><strong>How to record on the LBCT</strong></p>

<p>The LBCT looks at the occupancy of the school site, not the PFI agreement. In many cases where a school was built with a PFI, the land is leased to the school on a 125-year sublease from the LA. The academy trust is not part of the PFI arrangement so payments are to the LA.</p>

<p>The lease length is whatever is recorded in the lease agreement with the LA – <strong>not</strong> the length of the PFI agreement.</p>

<p>On the academy link for Coketown Junior, enter one occupancy type:</p>

<h3><strong>Temporary assets</strong></h3>

<p>These are assets that are identified within an occupancy type which are not permanent in nature, such as lower quality portable temporary structures.</p>
<p><strong>Example scenario</strong></p>

<p>Coketown Secondary School owns two pieces of land a few miles down the road from the main school site. One of these is used as a playing field and the other has been unused since it was acquired. The only thing on it is an electricity substation that belongs to the National Grid.</p>

<p>On the main school site, they have one school block which has classrooms and the school hall. There is a swimming pool and two portable temporary structures that were hired by the school and used temporarily as changing rooms when the changing area in the swimming pool was being refurbished. The portable temporary structures were last used as changing rooms last December. The school has 4 more portable temporary structures that are used as classrooms, with no plans to replace them.</p>

<h3>Development agreements</h3>
<p><strong>Example scenario</strong></p>

<p>Coventry City Council commissions a firm to design and build a new school on 1 December 2020. The council sets up a development agreement with Coketown Academy Trust, which will open an academy on the new site on 1 September 2021. They will be granted a 125 year lease by the council, which starts once the design and build project is complete - usually close to the date that the academy opens. Until the lease is signed and the academy can start using the site, the relationship between the council and the trust is contained in the development agreement.</p>

<p><strong>How to record on the LBCT</strong></p>

<p>The lease will start only once the project is completed, so until this happens and the lease is signed, the occupancy should be recorded as a development agreement.</p>
