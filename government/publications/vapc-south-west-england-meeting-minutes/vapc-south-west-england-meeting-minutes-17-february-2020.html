  <li>David Wood</li>

<ul>
  <li>Arren Hymas (<abbr title="Defence Transition Service">DTS</abbr> Southern Area Lead)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Welcome and introductions</h2>

<p>Jeff Spencer Chaired the meeting due to Paul Cartwright’s absence due ill health.</p>

<p>6 new members were welcomed to the group.</p>

<p>A brief discussion suggested that advertising for new members with non-military and charity background could benefit from a wider targeting.</p>

<p>Paul Cartwright is invited to consider broaching this discussion at Chairs.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>David Wood agreed to raise ‘lack of’ VAPC awareness with AHQ J1 arena this week.</p>
</div>

<h2>Declaration of interest</h2>

<p>There were no declarations of conflicting interests.</p>

<h2>Minutes and actions of the last meeting</h2>

<h3>Help 4 Heroes recovery centres</h3>

<ul>
  <li>action with Ben Bennington.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pension issues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Stephen Roland-Jones suggested that this issue had yet to be answered satisfactorily. He agreed to investigate further and table a note for discussion at the next meeting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> and veteran id cards</h3>

<ul>
  <li>some members had received <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> ID cards. The question of their actual utility was raised</li>
  <li>serving personnel are now receiving a veteran card on release. Veterans can now apply for a card</li>
  <li>Jeff Spencer had identified that there is no clarity on the acceptance of such cards as proof of service, or even for ‘discount use’ on existing defence negotiated deals. He had asked for clarity from <abbr title="Office for Veteran Affairs">OfVA</abbr>, <abbr title="Confederation of British Service Charities">COBSEO</abbr>, RBL and Ministry of Defebce. <abbr title="Office for Veteran Affairs">OfVA</abbr> Deputy had replied and suggested that digitisation is a prime aim and is under cross Government discussion. The ID card is not part of that ambition</li>
  <li><strong>Jeff Spencer is responding with a note of key points to support that debate</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Paul Cartwright is requested to seek guidance from Vets UK on both cards and re-circulate the <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> Card application to new members.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Military injury claims</h3>

<ul>
  <li>this issue was deferred for next meeting. David Wood will seek further understanding at AHQ this week.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overseas veterans</h3>

<ul>
  <li>this issue was also deferred for the next meeting. David Wood agreed to seek data on the subject from Northumbria. Map of need project to add clarity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Confederation of British Service Charities">COBSEO</abbr> database</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Stephen Roland-Jones reported that <abbr title="Confederation of British Service Charities">COBSEO</abbr> have a new database, and are developing a new website. The group felt there was merit in knowing more about both</li>
  <li><strong>Stephen Roland-Jones offered to bring greater detail to the next meeting for further discussion</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Jeff Spencer agreed to consider adding the <abbr title="Confederation of British Service Charities">COBSEO</abbr> Site and database to the evolving VFR - <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> Site</strong></li>
  <li><strong>David Wood agreed to draft a note for PC re region piece linking Ian Caws Cobseo aspiration.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>SSAFA courses</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SSAFA courses for all were not considered valid for non-caseworkers and financial constraints may prove challenging</li>
  <li>Jeff Spencer suggested an agenda item on education for the next meeting</li>
  <li>
<strong>David Wood agreed to provide a link to some known education assets for greater understanding of availability, and re-use.</strong> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.armedforcescovenant.gov.uk/localauthorities/" rel="external">Find information about covenant on line training</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Casework tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>members advised to take care taking case workers responsibility without training. It was suggested that the <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> role was more to identify trends and issues that require replication or change</li>
  <li><strong>Paul Cartwright asked to obtain tips from CF</strong></li>
  <li>the ‘Turn to Us App’ was mentioned.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enhanced armed forces compensation scheme</h3>

<ul>
  <li>further information is required before this subject can be discussed</li>
  <li><strong>Paul Cartwright to consider if a brief at the next meeting would be appropriate.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>National activity</h2>

<h3>Veterans UK/OVA</h3>

<p>Jeff Spencer described the current state of <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> within <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, and the potential to move alongside <abbr title="Office for Veteran Affairs">OfVA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Discussions are on-going and there are a number of options for potential <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> utilisation.</p>

<h3>Communication update</h3>

<p>Jeff Spencer thanked most south west members for signing on to the Communications trial platform alongside 3 other regions. We now lead the way. Others are requested to sign up ASAP.</p>

<p>A brief description of the planned site was given, and it was emphasised that to provide both a public and private operating arena will require regional and national positions to be filled. The byword for the system is transparency across regions, shared ideas through forums, a file and reference area, an email and business productivity tool, and a public web site.</p>

<p>Within regions, the following are needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a secretary; file management, contacts, calendar, and reference area</li>
  <li>a content manager provision and coordination of reports from south west to the national site editor, and management of south west social media.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nationally, the following posts are required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the editor: coordinating regional input to the national public site. Social media control</li>
  <li>the Senior Information Officer: responsible for correct operating procedures across files, IM, passwords, and forums</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> private editor: coordination and management of the <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> log on area to inform members of trends and useful references.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Defence Transition Service">DTS</abbr> update</h3>

<p>Thanks to Arren Hymas, the Southern area lead for the new Defence Transition Service for an excellent brief which will be distributed to members.</p>

<p><strong>David Wood offered to add <abbr title="Defence Transition Service">DTS</abbr> Referral Protocol process onto Forces Connect south west website.</strong></p>

<h3>VWS update</h3>

<p>Apologies received from RS.</p>

<h3>Individual Personalised Care for veterans</h3>

<p>Following an inaugural seminar on the new ‘Individual Personalised Care’ across the south west, convened by Frances Tippett (south west lead) Jeff Spencer gave a brief description of how a national <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> initiative could be of great value to veterans, service personnel, and their families: Indeed, it will benefit all users.</p>

<p>It was suggested that the greatest opportunity to the veteran affairs area was that, to operate effectively in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> will need to provide clinicians with a mature and maintained digest of activities, organisations, and facilities. Head of VA and Helen Helliwell at <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> have both been apprised of the potential. Veterans Gateway and the Forces Connect App (SE) exists to support such issues using the Map of Need, but are not yet locally mature, nor fully maintained and verified. A <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> database could form the basis for many specialist areas; including veterans.</p>

<p><abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> members, using their local connections may be well placed to leverage such a data stream.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>All consider opportunities for garnering data from your local areas.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> centenary framework</h3>

<p>Jeff Spencer explained the concept of the centenary. More about publicity and re-birth than a celebration, though both are valid. The concept of launching a mature, well produced public <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> web site to coincide with this event is an obvious marketing opportunity.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>A south west representative is needed to provide input to the main VAPC organising region, London.</p>
</div>

<h2>South west activity</h2>

<h3>Cornwall covenant activity</h3>

<p>Jeff Spencer briefed on aspects of activity in Cornwall as an example for new members becoming  the glue that binds similar local/regional activities together.  The potential to spread such a system across south west functional areas to best effect was discussed. <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr>, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, Mil Engagement, south west Armed Forces Partnership Board (Local Authorities), <abbr title="Defence Transition Service">DTS</abbr>, Reserves etc: A focused voice to national agencies.</p>

<h3>Other covenant activity (county updates)</h3>

<p>David Wood updated on the south west project, Partnership Board and Outreach service. The next outing being Cornwall PENZANCE on 25 to 26 Feb and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forcesconnectsouthwest.org.uk/" rel="external">Forces Connect website</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.armedforcescovenant.gov.uk/localauthorities/" rel="external">Covenant online training</a> is linked and, though it states Local Authority, it has utility for any organisation / individual that requires covenant knowledge.</p>

<p>S Glos: FO-A briefed on a press release for the launch of a new Veterans Community Hub. The group congratulated him on his considerable involvement in establishing this asset.</p>

<h3>AOB</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/forces-connect/id1447381839" rel="external">Forces Connect app</a></p>

<p>David Wood briefed the Forces Connect app, which was first launched in the south east, but is now being populated across Wiltshire, but should eventually extend to the whole south west.</p>

<p>Vaughan Magor asked if templates were available for <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr>, Covenant, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. <strong>David Wood offered to provide examples</strong>, although it is hoped that a National-led branding might be forthcoming. When confirmed these will be made available on the private site.</p>

<p><strong>PC is requested to consider raising this ‘branding’ issue at Chairs in April.</strong></p>

<p>Jeff Spencer advised that a conference is currently being considered by Cornwall Council in late Jun. <strong>Paul Cartwright is asked to consider the potential for south west <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> to join such an existing event.</strong></p>

<p>The chair deferred the subject of the new strategy until next meeting.</p>

<p><strong>All: new and old <abbr title="Veterans Advisory &amp; Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> members are asked to consider putting forward options for the roles contained in the strategy provided by Paul Cartwright. (direct to Paul Cartwright)</strong></p>

<p>Jeff Spencer suggested that the next meeting be brought forward to resolve strategy and agreed aims. Post Chairs?</p>

<p>Next meeting: to be confirmed.</p>
