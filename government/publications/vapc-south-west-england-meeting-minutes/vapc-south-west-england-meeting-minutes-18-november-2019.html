    <p>Jeff Spencer to provide Cornwall Show with new <abbr title="Veterans Advisory and Pensions Committee South West">VAPC SW</abbr> leaflets. This was done. Members were given a small batch of the new leaflets for distribution.There was a brief discussion on the new <abbr title="Veterans Advisory and Pensions Committee South West">VAPC SW</abbr> email address, which led to an update on communications by Paul Cartwright following the Chair of Chairs meeting. <abbr title="South West of England">SW</abbr> <abbr title="Veterans Advisory Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> would volunteer to take part in a pilot study.

  </li>
</ul>

<p>There was discussion about ATOS, whose questions were focused on stopping people claiming benefits and hence why so many Veterans were appealing and using fee-charging companies.  It was noted that more charities were giving pensions advice as <abbr title="Royal British Legion">RBL</abbr> no longer ran a full pensions advice service.  Advice given by charities was not always good (<abbr title="Royal British Legion">RBL</abbr> were good) and they were passing on a lot of casework to Irwin Mitchell (solicitors).</p>

<p>Civilian doctors too easily assume that Veterans with problems have <abbr title="Post Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</abbr>. Chris Francis recommended a <abbr title="Royal British Legion">RBL</abbr> rep that could brief the Committee in more depth.  As an action Chris Francis is to provide Paul Cartwright with contact details of <abbr title="Royal British Legion">RBL</abbr> rep and PC to invite to a future meeting.</p>
