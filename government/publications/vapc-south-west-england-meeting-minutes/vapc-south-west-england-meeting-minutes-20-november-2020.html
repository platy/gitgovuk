<h2>Decisions</h2>

<h3>Welcome and Introductions by PC</h3>

<p>PC thanked DN for his 6 years of service on VAPC SW (noting that this was likely to be his last meeting).</p>

<h3>Declaration of Interest by All</h3>

<p>There were no declarations of conflicting interests.</p>

<h3>Minutes/Actions outstanding.</h3>

<p>There were no actions outstanding.</p>

<h3>Chair of Chairs update by PC</h3>

<p>The Committee were updated on the Chairs’ meeting with Min DPV a few days previously and the action to give him a written proposal on the way forward for VAPCs by Christmas. (After-note: this was subsequently achieved).  PC agreed to circulate the proposal once it went to Min DPV. <strong>Actioned by PC</strong>.</p>

<p>New members highlighted that their induction/training had been poor and that there had been little information on the ‘AF Covenant’ role.  AAN agreed to circulate some ideas on training/induction. <strong>Actioned by ANN</strong>.</p>

<p>A general discussion on other issues regarding a VAPC relaunch included the following generally agreed points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many (especially younger) Veterans didn’t like the term ‘Veteran’.</li>
  <li>VAPC should drop the ‘P’ from their title.</li>
  <li>Some support for having the word ‘Covenant’ in our title.</li>
</ul>

<h3>VAPC national communications/VFR Hub update by JS</h3>

<p>Although there were still some bugs on the VFR Hub (such as finding the right forum), members were encouraged to use the it – all who actively used it found it helpful.  The number of forums would be rejigged to reflect use or utility.</p>

<h3>DTS Update by AH</h3>

<p>DTS has been operational for a year.  It has had 295 referrals, 93 in the SW.  Covid had not had a significant impact other than fewer face to face meetings.  AH gave some examples of the type of casework being dealt with (a single mum lacking accommodation, a Foreign &amp; Commonwealth (<abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth">F&amp;C</abbr>) soldier with <abbr title="post-traumatic stress disorder">PTSD</abbr> not able to apply to remain in the country).</p>

<p>The latter was discussed, given the current media interest in the significant cost to <abbr title="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth">F&amp;C</abbr> soldiers of obtaining residency.  HE (Hamilton Elliot), noted he had an Army Families Federation contact.  It was agreed that we should be sharing useful contacts – PC would consider how best to do this.</p>

<h3>VWS Update  by EJ</h3>

<p>Business as usual (less face to face meetings). Some extra IT support (for example, iPhones for home working).  EJ gave an example of veteran who went to tribunal/not satisfied with the outcome and how this was handled.  Also highlighted staff shortages (1 due <abbr title="coronavirus 2019">COVID-19</abbr>) and that Vets UK were not using VWS much.</p>

<h3>Covenant Activity (County updates) by all</h3>

<p>Highlights were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RAF Morgan is open to liaison.</li>
  <li>Problems with finding the right charities.</li>
  <li>Cornwall AF Covenant Board is trying to be inclusive and encouraging charities to coordinate.</li>
  <li>SW Partnership Board may lapse (a pity, as this was set up using £300-thousand of AF Covenant funding).</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Project by JS</h3>

<p>Matt Boulter has not applied to become a member but will remain as a co-opted member.</p>

<h3>SW Plan update/recruiting by PC</h3>

<p>PC congratulated FO-A on his selection as S Glos AF Champion.</p>

<p>There had been more applications to be members than places available, which was very encouraging.  Interviews to take place on 1 and 2 December 2021.  Once new members had been selected, work would begin on adjusting the plan.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="any other business">AOB</abbr> by all</h3>

<p>NL noted that it was taking the Army Personnel Centre up to 5 months to confirm the service of those coming forward as veterans, whereas the RN and RAF only take 5 days to do this.  PC agreed to raise this at Chairs. <strong>Actioned by PC</strong>.</p>
