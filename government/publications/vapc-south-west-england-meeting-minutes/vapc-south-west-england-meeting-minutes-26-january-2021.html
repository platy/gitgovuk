<h3>Apologies</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ben Bennington and Duncan Tilley</li>
</ul>

<h2>Decisions</h2>

<h3>Welcome and Introductions by PC</h3>

<p>PC noted that it was good to see membership numbers almost doubled by the potential new members following recent interviews.  He hoped that Ministerial appointment would follow soon.  PC noted the diversity of age, professional background/skill sets, geographical spread and particular veterans’ interests.  The first half of the meeting would be a ‘meet and greet’ session.</p>

<h3>Declaration of Interest by All</h3>

<p>There were no declarations of conflicting interests.</p>

<h3>Introductions by All</h3>

<p>Current and potential members introduced themselves: where they lived, background, veteran interest.</p>

<h3>Minutes/Actions outstanding</h3>

<p><strong>PC agreed to circulate the written proposal on the way forward for VAPCs once it went to Min DPV</strong>.  This was part of the induction pack – action closed.</p>

<p><strong>AAN agreed to circulate some ideas on training/induction</strong>.  AAN’s ideas formed the basis of the induction pack – action closed.</p>

<p><strong>PC would consider how best to share useful contacts</strong>.  Not discussed.</p>

<p><strong>PC to raise how long (up to 5 months) it was taking the Army Personnel Centre to confirm veterans’ service compared to the 5 days taken by the RN and RAF</strong>.  On raising this with Chairs, PC was informed this issue had already been raised with Vets UK.</p>

<h3>Chair of Chairs update by PC</h3>

<p>Disappointingly, no acknowledgement let alone a response to the written proposal sent to Min DPV prior to Christmas.  Much engagement taking place with Vets UK and OVA. Johnny Lighten (Chair of Chairs) may join our monthly update in Feb to brief us further.</p>

<p>A town hall for all new members is being planned on 15 or 16 April.</p>

<p>A general discussion on other issues regarding a VAPC relaunch included the following generally agreed points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many (especially younger) Veterans didn’t like the term ‘Veteran’.</li>
  <li>VAPC should drop the ‘P’ from their title.</li>
  <li>Some support for having the word ‘Covenant’ in our title.</li>
  <li>Some commented that the establishment of the new Veterans Advisory Board under the OVA might cause confusion if our roles overlapped.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the VFR Hub by JS</h3>

<p>JS highlighted how the Hub can be used for discussions in the forums and document storage to allow ready access to information.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Project by JS</h3>

<p>JS updated all on the concept of the SW <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Project and how best practice was being spread across other regions through a variety of mechanisms; including NHSE and RCGPs.  The first example of a national VAPC themed area has been established on health. Two meetings have been held and representatives from 8 of England’s VAPCs attended (JS represented SW).  The concept appears to be a sound model for future themes.</p>

<h3>SW Plan update/way forward by PC</h3>

<p>Potential members were requested to submit their preferences for role(s)/local authority coverage.  A draft role, sub-committee and regional coverage plan would then be produced for discussion at the Feb update.  Sub-committee areas would take account of advantages of alignment with likely national VAPC topics/Veterans Strategy themes.</p>

<p>A general discussion agreed that getting a handle on Veteran’s data in the SW would be an important step in ensuring we can be effective ‘eyes and ears’.</p>

<p><strong>To be actioned by potential members</strong></p>

<h3>
<abbr title="any other business">AOB</abbr> by all</h3>

<p>Potential Members to be added to WhatsApp group once their appointments confirmed and 2021 meeting schedule to be recirculated (it’s on the WhatsApp). <strong>To be actioned by PC</strong></p>
