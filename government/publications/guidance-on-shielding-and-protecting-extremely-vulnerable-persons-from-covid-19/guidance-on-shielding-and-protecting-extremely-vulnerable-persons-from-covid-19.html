<p>The shielding programme <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/shielding-programme-ends-for-most-vulnerable">ended in England</a> on 15 September 2021. This means that people who were previously considered clinically extremely vulnerable (<abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>) will not be advised to shield in the future or follow specific guidance.</p>

<p>This is because we know a lot more about the virus and what makes someone more or less vulnerable to COVID-19, the vaccine continues to be successfully rolled out, and treatments are becoming available. If your immune system means you are at higher risk from COVID-19, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk">there is specific guidance</a> for you (including a definition of what this means).</p>

<p>If you have not yet received the COVID-19 vaccine, you should <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/">get vaccinated</a>. Evidence indicates that 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine provide very effective protection against hospitalisation. It usually takes around 2 to 3 weeks for your body to develop its protective response.</p>

<p>To maintain this high level of protection through the coming winter, you should also get a booster vaccine for COVID-19 when offered.  The booster programme is open to every adult who has had a second dose of the vaccine at least 3 months ago.</p>

<p>You should continue to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">follow the same guidance&nbsp;as the general public</a> on staying safe and preventing the spread of COVID-19. However, as someone with a health condition, you may want to consider, alongside any advice from your clinician, if additional precautions are right for you. These could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>considering whether you and those you are meeting have been vaccinated – you might want to wait until 14 days after everyone’s most recent dose of a COVID-19 vaccine before being in close contact with others</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>considering continuing to practice social distancing if that feels right for you and your friends</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asking friends and family to take a rapid lateral flow antigen test before visiting you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asking home visitors to wear face coverings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>avoiding enclosed crowded spaces</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There is different guidance available for people living in <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-highest-risk/" class="govuk-link">Scotland</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/shielding-extremely-vulnerable-people" class="govuk-link">Wales</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-and-vulnerable-people" class="govuk-link">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
