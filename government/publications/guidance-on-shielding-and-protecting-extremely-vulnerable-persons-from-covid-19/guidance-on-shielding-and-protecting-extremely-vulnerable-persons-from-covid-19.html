<p>The shielding programme has now <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/shielding-programme-ends-for-most-vulnerable">ended in England</a>. This means that people who were previously considered clinically extremely vulnerable (<abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>) will not be advised to shield in the future or follow specific national guidance.</p>

<p>If this applies to you, you will receive a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1018931/Letter_to_patients_-_end_of_the_shielding_programme.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">letter informing you of these changes</a> in more detail and providing further information on available support. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The situation is now very different to when shielding was first introduced at the start of the pandemic. We know a lot more about the virus and what makes someone more or less vulnerable to COVID-19, the vaccine continues to be successfully rolled out, and other treatments and interventions are becoming available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The government will continue to assess the situation and the risks posed by COVID-19 and, based on clinical advice, will respond accordingly to keep the most vulnerable safe.</p>

<p>As a minimum, you should continue to follow the same <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">guidance</a>&nbsp; on staying safe and preventing the spread of COVID-19. You should consider advice from your health professional on whether additional precautions are right for you. However, as someone with a health condition, you may want to consider, alongside any advice from your clinician, if additional precautions are right for you. These could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>considering whether you and those you are meeting have been vaccinated – you might want to wait until 14 days after everyone’s second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine before being in close contact with others</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>considering continuing to practice social distancing if that feels right for you and your friends</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asking friends and family to take a rapid lateral flow antigen test before visiting you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asking home visitors to wear face coverings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>avoiding crowded spaces</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There is different guidance available for people living in <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-highest-risk/" class="govuk-link">Scotland</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/shielding-extremely-vulnerable-people" class="govuk-link">Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-and-vulnerable-people" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
