<p>Given the successful rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine programme, the shielding programme has now ended. If you were previously identified as clinically extremely vulnerable, you are advised to continue to follow the guidance contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">Coronavirus: how to stay safe and help prevent the spread</a>. This guidance page will be updated shortly.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for everyone in England who has been identified as clinically extremely vulnerable from coronavirus (COVID-19). This includes those people who have been identified by the NHS as being clinically extremely vulnerable and those identified through the COVID-19 population risk assessment. All of those identified have been added to the Shielded Patient List, and more information on the criteria used is available below. If you have been identified as being clinically extremely vulnerable, you will previously have received a letter from the NHS or from your GP telling you this. You may also have been advised to shield in the past.</p>

<p>There is different guidance for clinically extremely vulnerable people living in <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-highest-risk/">Scotland</a>, living in <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/shielding-extremely-vulnerable-people">Wales</a> and living in <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-and-vulnerable-people">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>Recent clinical studies have shown that children and young people are at very low risk of serious illness if they catch COVID-19. As a result, children and young people under the age of 18 are no longer considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable and should continue to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">same guidance as everyone else</a>.</p>

<p>A very small number of children and young people will have been advised to isolate or reduce their social contact for short periods of time by their specialist, due to their general risk of infection rather than because of the COVID-19 pandemic. If this is the case for your child, they should continue to follow the advice of their specialist.</p>

<h2>Adults</h2>

<p>As restrictions have been eased following the move to Step 4 of the roadmap, we are advising clinically extremely vulnerable people, as a minimum, to follow the same guidance as everyone else. It is important that everyone adheres to this guidance.</p>

<p>However, as someone who is at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if you were to catch COVID-19, you may wish to think particularly carefully about additional precautions you might wish to continue to take. Individuals may choose to limit the close contact they have with those they do not usually meet with in order to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19, particularly if they are clinically extremely vulnerable and if COVID-19 disease levels in the general community are high. It is important to respect and be considerate of those who may wish to take a more cautious approach now that many restrictions have been lifted.</p>

<p>We understand you may have concerns and wish to know how you can continue to take precautions to keep yourself safe. There are things that you can do to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread" class="govuk-link">lower your risk of infection and prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>, and some examples are outlined in the sections below.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about what it means to be clinically extremely vulnerable and how COVID-19 may impact your health condition, have a look at the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/advice-for-people-at-high-risk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS website</a>.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about your general physical and mental wellbeing or if you are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed and have any concerns about what this means for you, then please contact your GP practice or specialist who can provide you with support and guidance on any further measures you can take to further reduce your risk of infection.</p>

<h2>Vaccination</h2>

<p>The vaccines used in the COVID-19 vaccination programme are highly effective for the vast majority of the population, including the clinically extremely vulnerable, but as with any other vaccine there remains some risk of catching the virus and becoming seriously unwell. There is also emerging evidence that suggests that some immunocompromised and immunosuppressed individuals may not respond as well to COVID-19 vaccines as others. However, all COVID-19 vaccines should offer some degree of protection. Therefore, it is really important that you have both your first and second dose of the vaccine.</p>

<p>A recent study from Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>), which looked at more than 1 million people in at-risk groups, found that people who are immunosuppressed are significantly better protected from symptomatic infection following the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>We are continuing to work to better understand who is less well protected by the COVID-19 vaccines, and there are various studies underway that are looking at this.</p>

<p>Everyone on the Shielded Patient List should already have been offered a COVID-19 vaccine. If you have not yet received your first dose, please contact your GP, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">book your vaccination appointment online</a> or call 119. It is important you also have your second dose as having 2 doses should further increase your level of protection, and ensure it lasts longer. For some with immunosuppression it may only be with your second dose that a significant immune response is triggered.</p>

<p>Vaccination is now available for all 16 to 17 year olds. Some 12 to 15 year olds are also eligible for vaccination because of the very specific risks they face and the particular benefits they will receive from the vaccine.  However, being eligible for vaccination does not mean that children and young people are considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable.</p>

<p>If your child is eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine they will be contacted by the NHS in due course. More information on COVID-19 vaccination can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/">NHS website</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-interim-advice-on-a-potential-coronavirus-covid-19-booster-vaccine-programme-for-winter-2021-to-2022/jcvi-interim-advice-potential-covid-19-booster-vaccine-programme-winter-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link">The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) interim advice</a>, based on existing evidence, is to offer COVID-19 booster vaccines to the most vulnerable, starting from September 2021. The booster programme will aim to provide additional resilience against variants, and maximise protection in those who are the most vulnerable to serious disease from COVID-19 ahead of the winter months, when there is increased pressure on the NHS as non-COVID-19 emergency demand is at its highest.</p>

<p>A booster dose would be offered to groups in 2 stages and, if possible, delivered alongside the annual influenza vaccination. In the first stage, a booster would be offered to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>adults aged 16 years and over who are immunosuppressed</li>
  <li>those living in residential care homes for older adults</li>
  <li>all adults aged 70 years or over</li>
  <li>adults aged 16 years and over who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable</li>
  <li>frontline health and social care workers</li>
</ul>

<p>As soon as practicable after the first stage, the second stage would see a booster offered to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all adults aged 50 years and over</li>
  <li>adults aged 16 to 49 years who are in an influenza or COVID-19 at-risk group</li>
  <li>adult household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals</li>
</ul>

<p>Further details of any booster campaign, including when it will take place, who is eligible and which vaccine(s) will be used, will become available once the <abbr title="The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has considered further evidence and made its final recommendations.</p>

<p>No vaccine is 100% effective and therefore even if you have had both doses, there is still no absolute guarantee that you will not become ill from COVID-19. As such, you should continue to follow the guidance that is in place for everyone.</p>

<h2>Socialising inside and outside the home</h2>

<p>We recognise that restrictions on socialising with friends and family have been difficult for everyone, especially for clinically extremely vulnerable people during periods of shielding. Guidance on socialising inside and outside of the home with your friends and family has been updated for everyone. There are no longer any limits on the number of people or households that you can meet with. In addition, the advice to socially distance from others has ended, other than in a few exceptions.</p>

<p>Social distancing guidelines (2 metres or 1 metre with additional mitigations) have been lifted. The current guidance remains that      you should continue to consider the risks of close contact with others, particularly if you are clinically extremely vulnerable or not yet fully vaccinated and limit close contact with others you do not usually live with. The risk of catching or passing on COVID-19 is generally higher:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in crowded spaces, where there are more people who might be infectious</li>
  <li>in enclosed indoor spaces where there is limited fresh air</li>
  <li>when COVID-19 disease levels are high in the general community</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone will only be required to socially distance in limited circumstances, such as maintaining infection control in health and care settings.</p>

<p>Because clinically extremely vulnerable people are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, you may wish to think particularly carefully about taking precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet with in order to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. For example, you could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet outside if possible – the particles containing the virus that causes COVID-19 are quickly blown away which makes it less likely that they will be breathed in by another person</li>
  <li>make sure the space is well ventilated if you meet inside; open windows and doors or take other action to let in plenty of fresh air – please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ventilation-of-indoor-spaces-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">the COVID-19: ventilation of indoor spaces guidance for more information</a>
</li>
  <li>consider whether you and those you are meeting have been vaccinated – you might want to wait until 14 days after everyone’s second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine before being in close contact with others</li>
  <li>wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face</li>
  <li>consider continuing to practice social distancing if that feels right for you and your friends</li>
  <li>ask friends and family to take a lateral flow test before visiting you</li>
  <li>ask home visitors to wear face coverings</li>
</ul>

<p>You are encouraged to go outside for exercise and can do so freely now. You can find tips and advice on staying active and eating healthily at <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/">NHS Better Health</a>.  You can find more information online about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">how to stop the spread of coronavirus</a>.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>Social distancing measures have now ended in the workplace and it is no longer necessary for the government to instruct people to work from home.</p>

<p>However, employers still have a legal responsibility to protect their employees and others from risks to their health and safety. Your employer should be able to explain to you the measures they have in place to keep you safe at work. Some employers may request that employees undertake regular testing for COVID-19 to identify people who are asymptomatic.</p>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) has published guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/protect-people.htm" rel="external">protecting vulnerable workers</a>, including advice for employers and employees on <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/talking-to-your-workers/index.htm" class="govuk-link">how to talk about reducing risks in the workplace</a>.</p>

<p>If you need support to work at home or in the workplace you can apply for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work">Access to Work</a>. Access to Work may provide support for the disability-related extra costs of working that are beyond standard reasonable adjustments an employer must provide. Access to Work will prioritise applications from disabled people who are in the clinically extremely vulnerable group.</p>

<p>If you have access to occupational health and employee assistance programmes in the workplace, these services can also provide you with a range of health support and advice for your physical and mental health needs.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme">Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough)</a> is available until 30 September. You may be eligible throughout this period, even when shielding is paused, providing your employer agrees. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS)</a> is also available until 30 September.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons, subject to meeting the eligibility conditions.</p>

<p>If you have concerns about your health and safety at work then you can raise them with your workplace union, <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> or your local authority. Where employers are not managing the risk of COVID-19, <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> and local authorities may take action which can range from the provision of specific advice, issuing enforcement notices, stopping certain work practices until they are made safe and, where businesses fail to comply with enforcement notices, this could also lead to prosecution.</p>

<p>The existing employment rights framework provides protections against discrimination, unfair dismissal and detriment. Specific guidance has been published for employers and workers on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/if-you-need-to-self-isolate-or-cannot-attend-work-due-to-coronavirus">work absences due to coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/">Citizens Advice</a> also has information about your rights at work and how to solve problems in the workplace. If you have concerns you can also get advice on your specific situation and your employment rights by visiting the <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/contact" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Acas website</a> or calling the Acas helpline on 0300 123 1100.</p>

<h2>School, college and other educational settings</h2>

<p>Recent clinical studies have shown that children and young people are at very low risk of serious illness if they catch COVID-19. As a result, children and young people under the age of 18 are no longer considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable and should continue to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">same guidance as everyone else</a>.</p>

<p>Pupils and students should continue to attend their school or other education setting. It is important that children attend school for their education, wellbeing, mental health and long-term development.</p>

<p>A very small number of children and young people will have been advised to isolate or reduce their social contact for short periods of time by their specialist, due to their general risk of infection rather than because of the pandemic. If this was the case for your child, they should continue to follow the advice of their specialist.</p>

<p>The government has made <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" rel="external">rapid lateral flow tests available</a> to schools and colleges. The use of rapid lateral flow tests helps us to identify individuals with COVID-19 who do not have symptoms, which make up around a third of all cases. Finding asymptomatic cases, along with other infection prevention and control measures can help us manage the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>Lateral flow tests can also be accessed directly by whole families and households with primary school, secondary school, and college age children, including childcare, support bubbles, or staff members. Twice-weekly rapid testing is a vital tool in helping to control the pandemic by identifying cases of COVID-19 that would otherwise not be found. More information is available on how to <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">access rapid lateral flow tests</a>.</p>

<p>All early years providers, out-of-school settings, schools and colleges are continuing to put in place <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-parents-and-carers-need-to-know-about-early-years-providers-schools-and-colleges-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/what-parents-need-to-know-about-early-years-providers-schools-and-colleges-during-covid-19#guidance">measures</a> to help minimise the risk of spreading COVID-19. These include handwashing, use of face coverings in specific situations, enhancing cleaning, ventilation and managing suspected and confirmed cases.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>Whilst the legal requirement to wear a face covering has been lifted from 19 July, the government expects and recommends that people continue to wear face coverings in crowded areas, such as public transport. Wearing a face covering, especially when there is close contact between people in enclosed and crowded spaces will still help to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. It may also help those who are clinically extremely vulnerable feel more relaxed. It is important that face coverings fit securely around the face and safely cover the mouth and the nose.</p>

<h2>Going to shops and pharmacies</h2>

<p>Clinically extremely vulnerable people are now advised to follow the guidance that applies to the rest of the population. You may still wish to consider going to the shops and pharmacy at quieter times of the day.</p>

<p>Priority access to supermarket delivery slots using the shielding support website ended on 21 June. You can continue to book delivery slots in the usual manner from a supermarket.</p>

<p>You can also continue to ask for short-term help from the NHS Volunteer Responder scheme with telephone support if you are feeling lonely, or for help with collecting shopping (if you are unable to use any of the online or telephone shopping options now available through most supermarkets), medication or other essential supplies that you need delivered to your home. You can ask for help by visiting  <a rel="external" href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS Volunteer Responders</a> or calling 0808 196 3646 between 8am and 8pm.</p>

<h2>If you require additional care and support</h2>

<p>It is important that you continue to receive the care and support you need to help you stay safe and well. Providers of social care and medical services are making every effort to ensure services remain open and as safe as possible.</p>

<p>You should continue to seek support from the NHS for your existing health conditions. You can access a range of NHS services from home, including ordering repeat prescriptions or contacting your health professional through an online consultation. To find out more visit <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/health-at-home/">NHS Health at home</a>, or <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/" class="govuk-link">download the NHS App</a>. If you have an urgent medical need, call NHS 111 or, for a medical emergency, dial 999.</p>

<p>The measures you may have taken to respond to COVID-19 may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness. These feelings are a completely normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. As society is gradually and safely reopened, you may find that your wellbeing improves as you reconnect with family and friends, and return to routines and activities that help to keep you well.</p>

<p>You can visit the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/">Every Mind Matters website</a> for advice and practical steps that you can take to support your wellbeing and manage your mental health. If you are feeling lonely, the <a rel="external" href="https://letstalkloneliness.co.uk/" class="govuk-link">Let’s Talk Loneliness website</a> also has a variety of tips, advice and further resources that you may find helpful.  The <a href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">NHS Volunteer Responders programme</a> also offers telephone support through Check in and Chat Volunteers. Check In and Chat Plus Volunteers provide a regular check-in by telephone to you for up to 10 weeks, with typically 3 calls taking place each week.</p>

<p>If you are struggling with your mental health, you can reach out for support. Visit the <a rel="external" href="https://hubofhope.co.uk/" class="govuk-link">Hub of Hope</a> to find local sources of mental health support and services, both from the NHS and from other organisations close to you. Your GP will be able to refer you to NHS talking therapies, which can provide treatment for depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, or you can self-refer online.</p>

<p>If you or a loved one are experiencing a mental health crisis, you can call a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/mental-health/find-an-urgent-mental-health-helpline" class="govuk-link">local NHS mental health helpline</a> for 24-hour advice and support, or contact the Samaritans on 116 123 or through emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a></p>

<p>Any carers or visitors who support you with your everyday needs can continue to visit. They should continue to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to stop the spread of COVID-19</a> at all times.</p>

<p>You can also access additional support from your energy supplier. Energy suppliers are required by the regulator, Ofgem, to hold a register of customers in a vulnerable circumstance, called a Priority Service Register. If you are clinically extremely vulnerable you can be added to this register. For information about how to be added to the register and the additional services your supplier can provide you, please visit <a rel="external" href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/getting-extra-help-priority-services-register" class="govuk-link">Ofgem’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Telecom providers are also required by their regulator, Ofcom, to support their vulnerable customers. For information about the additional services your supplier may be able to provide you as a vulnerable customer, please visit <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/what-is-ofcom/consumer-vulnerability">Ofcom’s website</a>.</p>

<p>If you are struggling as a result of coronavirus, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-support" class="govuk-link">find out how to get coronavirus support</a> or contact your local council to find out what support is available.</p>

<h2>Definition of clinically extremely vulnerable groups</h2>

<p>Although people who are defined as clinically extremely vulnerable are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus,  recent clinical studies have shown that children and young people are at very low risk of serious illness if they catch COVID-19. As a result, children and young people under the age of 18 are no longer considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable.</p>

<p>There are 3 ways you may be identified as clinically extremely vulnerable and therefore included on the Shielded Patient List:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You have one or more of the conditions listed below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your clinician or GP has added you to the Shielded Patient List because, based on their clinical judgement, they deem you to be at high risk of serious illness if you catch the virus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have been identified through the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/risk-assessment/population">COVID-19 population risk assessment</a> as potentially being at high risk of serious illness if you catch the virus.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you do not fall into any of these categories, and have not been contacted to inform you that you are on the Shielded Patient List, you should continue to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">guidance that applies to everyone</a>.</p>

<p>If you think there are good clinical reasons why you should be considered clinically extremely vulnerable, discuss your concerns with your GP or hospital clinician. People with the following conditions are automatically deemed clinically extremely vulnerable and therefore have been previously included on the Shielded Patient List:</p>

<ul>
  <li>solid organ transplant recipients</li>
  <li>people with specific cancers:
    <ul>
      <li>people with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy</li>
      <li>people with lung cancer who are undergoing radical radiotherapy</li>
      <li>people with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment</li>
      <li>people having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer</li>
      <li>people having other targeted cancer treatments that can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors</li>
      <li>people who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6 months or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>people with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>
  <li>people with rare diseases that significantly increase the risk of infections (such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), homozygous sickle cell disease)</li>
  <li>people on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of infection</li>
  <li>problems with your spleen, for example splenectomy (having your spleen removed)</li>
  <li>people with Down’s syndrome</li>
  <li>people on dialysis or with chronic kidney disease (stage 5)</li>
  <li>women who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired</li>
  <li>other people who have also been classed as clinically extremely vulnerable, based on clinical judgement and an assessment of their needs – GPs and hospital clinicians have been provided with guidance to support these decisions</li>
</ul>
