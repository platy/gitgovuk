<p>You may previously have received a letter or email identifying you as someone who is clinically extremely vulnerable (<abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>), and you may have been advised to shield during earlier stages of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Most people who were identified as <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr> are now well protected after receiving their primary and booster vaccination doses. For most people who were <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>, you are no longer at substantially greater risk than the general population, and you are advised to follow the same guidance  as everyone else on staying safe and preventing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), as well as any further advice you may have received from your doctor.</p>

<p>Pregnant women are strongly advised to get vaccinated. If you are pregnant and you develop symptoms of COVID-19, it is important that you contact your GP, midwife or maternity team, or 111. Guidance for pregnancy and COVID-19 can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/pregnancy-and-coronavirus/" rel="external">NHS website</a>. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (<abbr title="Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists">RCOG</abbr>) also has a range of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-pregnancy-and-women-s-health/" rel="external">information on COVID-19 in pregnancy and vaccination</a>.</p>

<p>There is no longer separate guidance for people previously identified as <abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>, although we recommend anyone with underlying health conditions takes care to avoid routine coughs, colds and other respiratory viruses.</p>

<p>If you have not yet received the COVID-19 vaccine, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/" rel="external">get vaccinated</a>. Evidence indicates that  completion of your primary course of COVID-19 vaccine (either 2 or 3 doses) provides very effective protection against hospitalisation. It usually takes around 2 to 3 weeks for your body to develop its protective response.</p>

<p>To maintain this high level of protection  you should also get a booster vaccine for COVID-19 when offered. The booster programme is open to every adult who has had a second dose of the vaccine at least 3 months ago.</p>

<p>You should continue to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">follow the same guidance&nbsp;as the general public</a> on staying safe and preventing the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>There remains a smaller number of people who, in spite of vaccination, are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19. This is due to a weakened immune system (immunosuppressed) or specific other medical conditions and requires enhanced protections such as those offered by antibody and antiviral treatments, additional vaccinations and potentially other non-clinical interventions. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk">guidance for people whose immune system means they are at higher risk</a>.</p>

<p>There is different guidance available for people living in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-highest-risk/" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/shielding-extremely-vulnerable-people" rel="external">Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-and-vulnerable-people" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
