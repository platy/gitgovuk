<p>Pleas submitted online are dealt with by a single magistrate sitting with a legal adviser under the Single Justice Service (SJS). This saves people time and effort, as they do not need to respond by letter or attend court in person. Instead, defendants can submit their plea at a time and place of their choice using any internet-enabled device.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Important statistics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>561,288 pleas submitted online since 2014, and 706,128 total pleas (includes multiple offences)</li>
  <li>over 150,000 online pleas submitted in 2021</li>
  <li>43 police forces signed up to the service</li>
  <li>75% users either satisfied or very satisfied with the service</li>

<span class="number">3. </span>Looking ahead in 2022</h2>
<p>During this year, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work with the police and main stakeholders to continue the transition to the new online plea service (part of our Common Platform digital case management system)</li>
  <li>continue working with our Service Centres</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Feedback</h2>
<p>After exceeding the speed limit while driving on the motorway, Alex received a Single Justice Procedure Notice. He had the choice to submit his plea online, using our digital service, or to reply by post. Alex was keen to resolve the situation as quickly as possible, and so he opted to use the online form on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Alex had chosen to plead guilty and connected to the online service. He found most of the questions straightforward. However, there was one page he had a problem with so he contacted the Courts and Tribunals Service Centre and spoke to one of our trained call handlers. He explained the situation and asked for help to make sure he did everything correctly.</p>

<p>Our call handler talked him through the process and made sure he had all the information he needed to successfully complete the online process. Once he had submitted his plea, Alex received a confirmation email.</p>

<p>His case was heard through the Single Justice Service: a magistrate considered all the facts and determined the result removing the need for those involved to attend court. From making his plea to receiving the result, the whole process took around one week to complete.</p>

<p>Alex received a fine and 3 points on his driving licence. He had notification of this by email, and it was followed up by a court order sent by post.</p>

<p>This was a worrying time for Alex, but he was relieved to find the process quick and straightforward, and that he did not have to go to court.</p>
