<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Faster, better, greener delivery of major infrastructure is essential to support our economic growth, connectivity between places, essential utilities, energy security and Net Zero. It needs to support our ambitions for levelling up and to enhance and protect the environment. The Nationally Significant Infrastructure Planning (NSIP) Development Consent Order (DCO) system is the process by which local people are consulted and development receives consent, ensuring infrastructure is delivered in ways which contribute to our ambitions for levelling up and to enhance and protect the environment. Through the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill, the Government will take legal powers to improve this system. We are also announcing funding to ten local authority projects to support innovation and to ensure the needs of local communities are better reflected in the process. Our amendments to the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill will, when enacted, enable:</p>

<h3>Fast track consenting</h3>

<p>A power which will enable the relevant consenting department Secretary of State to set a shorter statutory timeframe for a DCO examination. This enables the establishment of a fast-track consenting route for cases where quality standards are met. In the British Energy Security Strategy, the government committed to a range of measures to reduce consent time for Offshore Wind Projects from up to 4 years down to 1 year. The government will consult on quality criteria, underlying regulations and guidance changes, later this year. This amendment will be laid on 30 August 2022 for debate at Commons Committee stage of the Bill.</p>

<h3>Faster post-consent changes</h3>

<p>A power for the Secretary of State to set secondary legislation relating to the decision-making process associated with Non-Material Change (NMC) applications. At present, changes to consents which are deemed non-material can take up to 16 months to be determined and sometimes cause significant delays to delivery. This legislation will enable government to develop and pilot an improved, faster approach, bringing in statutory timeframes if necessary. This amendment will be laid on 30 August 2022 for debate at Commons Committee stage of the Bill.</p>

<h3>Charging developers for expert input</h3>

<p>Enabling powers so that government agencies which provide technical expert advice on DCO applications will be able to charge developers for their NSIP services, across the statutory and non-statutory parts of the process. Capacity issues in key statutory agencies can create delay. The government will consult on our approach to implementing charging frameworks later this year. This amendment will be published for consideration at Commons Report stage of the Bill.</p>

<h2>Innovation and capacity building for local authorities affected by NSIPs</h2>

<p>Local Authorities play an essential role in the NSIP process. They represent the needs and views of local people, deliver local impact reports, work with developers to ensure development will benefit local people and economies, ensure plans are integrated with local infrastructure, and are often responsible for monitoring compliance with planning requirements once development begins. Through the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Innovation and Capacity fund, we are funding 10 projects in local authorities which will be particularly affected by applications for major transport, energy and water schemes over the next year. Following a fair and competitive tender process, the following local authorities were successful in securing funding to explore a range of ways of improving the process:</p>

<p>1. Cambridgeshire County Council</p>

<p>2. Crawley Borough Council</p>

<p>3. Cumbria County Council</p>

<p>4. Eden District Council</p>

<p>5. Essex County Council</p>

<p>6. Hinkley and Bosworth Borough Council</p>

<p>7. Norfolk County Council</p>

<p>8. Selby District Council and North Yorkshire County Council (joint bid)</p>

<p>9. Somerset County Council</p>

<p>10. Suffolk County Council, on behalf of the district and county councils in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire</p>

<p>A full list of the project aims, local authorities involved, infrastructure sectors covered, and funding amount can be found in the Further details of successful bids section below.</p>

<h2>Wider improvement to the Development Consent Order process</h2>

<p>The NSIP planning system was created under the Planning Act 2008, to establish statutory timescales and a ‘one stop shop’ DCO process for major infrastructure, with decisions being made by the relevant Secretary of State (for Energy, Transport, Environment or Levelling Up). Since its first decision in 2011, the system has considered 113 major transport, energy, and wastewater infrastructure projects. Prior to the NSIP system major infrastructure projects took significantly more time to go through the planning process, for example Sizewell B nuclear power station took 7 years to be consented. In comparison Norfolk Boreas, which was consented in 2021, took 2 and a half years from application submission to its DCO being granted.</p>

<p>In the National Infrastructure Strategy (2020) (NIS) the government committed to a cross-government NSIP Reform Programme with the ambition to speed up timescales by up to 50% for some projects entering the system from September 2023. In 2021, we conducted an operational review of the NSIP process, hearing from over 130 users and groups about potential for improvement. We also invested in project acceleration pilots and workshops to explore how processes could be improved. Responses came from a range of perspectives including local authorities, community groups, promoters of infrastructure, statutory consultees, environmental non-governmental organisations, professional bodies and practitioners with a range of expertise.</p>

<p>The measures set out above are key steps towards improvement of the performance of the DCO system. They will allow projects submitting their applications from September 2023, to benefit from a fast-track route if the qualifying criteria being developed are met. They will ensure the system has the resilience to respond to the increasing pipeline of major infrastructure projects while delivering faster consenting for some projects without compromising on environmental or community outcomes. The Nationally Significant Infrastructure Planning Reform Programme is also taking forward several other actions to improve the system, including reviews of the Energy and National Networks National Policy Statements. Work to create a new system of Environmental Outcome Reports which will streamline and improve transparency of environmental assessment is also being taken forward through the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill. The government intends to publish a full NSIP Reform Action Plan, as well as consultations on national policy statements and on further regulatory and guidance changes to improve the operation of the system, over the coming months.</p>
