<p>People aged 50 years and over, health and social care workers and younger people at risk are being offered a booster dose of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. The NHS will contact you when it is your turn to have a booster.</p>

<h2>What is coronavirus or COVID-19?</h2>
<p>COVID-19 is a very infectious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is more serious in older people and those with certain health conditions.</p>

<h2>Why you are being offered a COVID-19 booster</h2>

<p>Like some other vaccines, levels of protection may begin to wane over time. This booster dose will help extend the protection you gained from your first 2 doses and give you longer term protection.</p>

<p>The booster will help to reduce the risk of you needing admission to hospital due to COVID-19 infection this winter.</p>

<h2>Timing of booster</h2>
<p>The booster is being offered at least 6 months after your last dose. Like your previous doses, the vaccine will be given in your upper arm.</p>

<p>Protection against severe disease from the first 2 doses seems to decline very slowly. So don’t worry if your booster vaccine is given a few weeks after the 6 months time-point. The booster dose should help to extend your protection into the next year.</p>

<h2>Which vaccine you will be offered</h2>

<p>You will be given a booster dose of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. These vaccines have already been given to millions of people in the UK.</p>

<p>You will be offered the right vaccine for you which may be the same or different from the vaccines that you had before.</p>

<h2>Side effects</h2>

<h3>Common side effects</h3>

<p>As with your previous dose the common side effects are the same for all COVID-19 vaccines used in the UK, and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having a painful, heavy feeling and tenderness in the arm where you had your injection – this tends to be worst around 1 to 2 days after the vaccine</li>
  <li>feeling tired</li>
  <li>headache</li>
  <li>general aches, or mild flu like symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>You can rest and take paracetamol (follow the dose advice in the packaging) to help make you feel better. Although feeling feverish is not uncommon for 2 to 3 days, a high temperature is unusual and may indicate you have COVID-19 or another infection.</p>

<p>Although a fever can occur within a day or two of vaccination, if you have any other COVID-19 symptoms or your fever lasts longer, stay at home and arrange to have a test. Symptoms following vaccination normally last less than a week. If your symptoms seem to get worse or if you are concerned, you can call NHS 111.</p>

<h3>Serious side effects</h3>

<p>Worldwide, there have also been recent, very rare cases of inflammation of the heart called myocarditis or pericarditis reported after Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>These cases have been seen mostly in younger men within several days after vaccination. Most of these people recovered and felt better following rest and simple treatments.</p>

<p>You should seek medical advice urgently if, after vaccination, you experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chest pain</li>
  <li>shortness of breath</li>
  <li>feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart</li>
</ul>

<p>If you had serious side effects after any previous dose you may be advised to avoid or delay further vaccination. You should discuss this with your doctor or specialist.</p>

<h2>Those who shouldn’t have a booster</h2>

<p>There are very few people who should not have a booster.</p>

<p>If you have had a severe reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine you should discuss this with your doctor.</p>

<h2>Can you still catch COVID-19 after having the vaccine?</h2>

<p>The COVID-19 vaccination will reduce the chance of you suffering from COVID-19. It may take a few days for your body to build up some protection from the booster.</p>

<p>Like all medicines, no vaccine is completely effective – some people may still get COVID-19 despite having a vaccination, but this should be less severe.</p>

<h2>If you have not had the first vaccinations</h2>

<p>If you have not yet had either of your first 2 doses of the vaccine you should have them as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You will still need the booster but the timing of it will depend on when you had your first 2 doses.</p>
