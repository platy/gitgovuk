<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Competition Scope and Challenge</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Background: Arm Morello and <abbr title="Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions">CHERI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Building systems that are “Secure by Design” (software, hardware and systems that have been designed from the ground up to be secure) is a strategic priority for the UK.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-resilience-strategy-for-defence">The Cyber Resilience Strategy for Defence</a> outlines the Ministry of Defence’s (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) vision to build a stronger, cyber-resilient Defence. Realising this vision has become more important than ever, in an increasingly uncertain world with fast evolving technological and military challenges. In fact, analysis has shown that 70% of ongoing software vulnerabilities are due to memory safety issues. Utilising technologies that are inherently more secure are fundamental to the delivery of cyber-resilient systems.</p>

<p>Digital Security by Design (<abbr title="Digital Security by Design">DSbD</abbr>) is a UK Research and Innovation initiative supported by the UK Government to transform digital technology and create a more resilient, secured foundation for a safer future. The <abbr title="Digital Security by Design">DSbD</abbr> funded, Arm Morello Program, is a collaboration between academia, industry and government, that researches and develops the underpinning capabilities will pave the way business and people will use and trust technology.</p>

<p>A key element of the Morello research programme is the prototype <abbr title="System on a Chip">SoC</abbr> and associated Morello development Board, platform software and tools that together implement the principles of the innovative <abbr title="Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions">CHERI</abbr> security architecture. This <abbr title="System on a Chip">SoC</abbr> is the first mainstream chip to include hardware features to address memory safety issues, while also providing developers with innovative new tools and methods to enable fine grain protection of their applications. Further details can be found here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.dsbd.tech/how-it-works/" rel="external">https://www.dsbd.tech/how-it-works/</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Scope</h3>

<p>This competition is aimed at seeding the Morello <abbr title="System on a Chip">SoC</abbr> into the Defence and Security sector for research, evaluation and experimentation. Highly resilient embedded systems such as those that support aviation will be favoured as part of this competition, although any Defence and Security related system will be considered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Morello Boards</h3>

<p>Successful projects will be provided with an Arm Morello Board, with its cutting-edge <abbr title="Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions">CHERI</abbr> enabled Arm CPU architecture <abbr title="System on a Chip">SoC</abbr>, platform software, technical guides and community support, to trial and evaluate the effect of the new technologies within their software systems.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Competition Challenges</h2>

<p>The competition has three challenge areas. Your proposal may seek to address more than one challenge.</p>

<h4>Code Porting</h4>
<p>This challenge area seeks to port an existing codebase or tool (e.g. compiler) into the Morello environment and strengthen its security by using the Morello enhanced security features.</p>

<h4>Software Compartmentalisation</h4>
<p>This challenge area seeks to refactor an existing application to employ fine grain software compartmentalisation.</p>

<h4>Innovation</h4>
<p>This challenge area seeks to conduct research in an area  in line with competition scope, such as a security enhancing innovation, now enabled by the availability of the Morello features</p>

<p>We welcome proposals from across the full range of UK based suppliers including academia, individuals (i.e. sole traders), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large companies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Challenge Considerations</h3>

<p>At the conclusion of the project, a report will need to be produced detailing experimental outcomes and learnings. Aspects considered could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>what are the performance and storage effects of implementing memory safety?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are you able to replace all pointers by capabilities or just some of them?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what are the performance implications of implementing compartmentalisation?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how did <abbr title="Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions">CHERI</abbr> enable new fine grain isolations within a single application process?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how do these benefits compare to contemporary established code and data isolation and protection practices?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how do existing assurance/verification methodologies evolve as a result of having <abbr title="Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions">CHERI</abbr> features available?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what was the impact on known vulnerabilities and attack techniques?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Comparative assessment against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2022/2022_cwe_top25.html" rel="external">Common Weakness Enumeration Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses list</a>.</li>
      <li>Relevant components of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://attack.mitre.org/" rel="external">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> knowledge base.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how might a Morello aware attacker change their behaviour?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The minimum output shall be a report that will be shared with Arm to inform their Morello Evaluation programme. An additional classified report may be produced if the output requires it to be so and the proposer has the means to handle sensitive material, for example, List X.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Clarification of what we want</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Your proposal should include:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>clear demonstration of how the proposed work applies to a Defence and Security context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence that the proposal will have suitably qualified and experienced personnel delivering it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>detail of the experimentation, testing and performance evaluation strategy that will provide the evidence for the final report</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Proposers should consider:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the availability of programming language translators and tools. At the time of writing, only <abbr title="Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions">CHERI</abbr>-enabled C/C++ (Clang/LLVM) toolchains are currently available. However this may change. For up-to-date information on the development status of Morello support, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-profile/morello/development-tools/gnu-tools" rel="external">https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-profile/morello/development-tools/gnu-tools</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>application-level projects must be able to utilise the evolving maturity of the Morello supported operating systems. (Morello is currently only supported by <abbr title="Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions">CHERI</abbr>-adapted versions of evolving maturity of the open-source Linux/Android/FreeBSD Operating Systems distributed and maintained by Arm and the University of Cambridge)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>operating System level projects must support boot from an UEFI/Arm SystemReady ES certified platform</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Accelerating and commercially exploiting your innovation</h2>

<p>It is important that over the lifetime of <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> competitions, ideas are matured and accelerated towards appropriate end-users to enhance capability. How long this takes will depend on the nature and starting point of the innovation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>A clear route for commercial exploitation</h3>

<p>For <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> to consider routes for commercial exploitation, ensure your deliverables are designed with the aim to make it as easy as possible for collaborators/stakeholders to identify the innovative elements of your proposal.</p>

<p>Whilst early identification and engagement with potential end users during the competition and subsequent phases are essential to implementing an exploitation plan, during the competition phase there should be no correspondence between innovators and <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> other than via the Accelerator email or Commercial team.</p>

<p>All proposals to <abbr title="Defence and Security Accelerator">DASA</abbr> should articulate the expected development in technology maturity of the potential solution over the lifetime of the contract and how this relates to improved operational capability against the current known (or presumed) baseline.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>How to outline your exploitation plan</h3>

<p>A higher technology maturity is expected in subsequent phases. Include the following information to help the assessors understand your exploitation plans to date:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the intended defence or security users of your final product and whether you have previously engaged with them, their procurement arm or their research and development arm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>awareness of, and alignment to, any existing end user procurement programmes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the anticipated benefits (for example, in cost, time, improved capability) that your solution will provide to the user</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether it is likely to be a standalone product or integrated with other technologies or platforms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>expected additional work required beyond the end of the contract to develop an operationally deployable commercial product (for example, “scaling up” for manufacture, cyber security, integration with existing technologies, environmental operating conditions)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>additional future applications and wider markets for exploitation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>wider collaborations and networks you have already developed or any additional relationships you see as a requirement to support exploitation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how your product could be tested in a representative environment in later phases</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any specific legal, ethical, commercial or regulatory considerations for exploitation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Is your exploitation plan long-term?</h3>

<p>Long-term studies may not be able to articulate exploitation in great detail, but it should be clear that there is credible advantage to be gained from the technology development.</p>

<p>Include project specific information which will help exploitation. This competition is being carried out as part of a wider <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> programme and with cognisance of cross-Government initiatives. We may collaborate with organisations outside of the UK Government and this may provide the opportunity to carry out international trials and demonstrations in the future.</p>
