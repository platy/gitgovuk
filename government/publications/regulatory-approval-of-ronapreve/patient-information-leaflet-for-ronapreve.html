<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What Ronapreve is and what it is used for</h2>

<h4>What Ronapreve is</h4>

<p>Ronapreve contains the active substances ‘casirivimab’ and ‘imdevimab’. Casirivimab and imdevimab are a type of protein called ‘monoclonal antibodies’.</p>

<h4>What Ronapreve is used for</h4>

<p>Ronapreve is used to treat patients with confirmed acute covid-19 infection.</p>

<p>Ronapreve is used to prevent acute covid-19 infection.</p>

<p>Clinical trial experience of use is limited to individuals aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 35.5 kg.</p>

<p>Ronapreve is not a vaccine, it treats or prevents acute covid-19 infection.</p>

<h4>What is acute COVID-19 infection?</h4>

<p>Acute covid-19 infection is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. People can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.</p>

<p>Acute covid-19 infection illnesses can be very mild (sometimes with no symptoms). However, the symptoms can also be severe - including illness resulting in going to the hospital or illness causing death.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Although most acute covid-19 infection illness is mild, it can be serious - and may make some of your other illnesses worse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People of all ages with severe, long-lasting illness like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, seem to be more likely to have to go into the hospital for management of  acute covid-19 infection.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The symptoms of  acute covid-19 infection include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. These may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness can include breathing problems.</p>

<h4>How Ronapreve works</h4>

<p>Ronapreve attaches to a protein on the surface of the coronavirus called the ‘spike protein’. This stops the virus from getting into your cells and causing an infection. This can help your body to overcome the virus infection and may help you get better faster.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What you need to know before you are given Ronapreve</h2>

<h4>Warnings and precautions</h4>

</ul>

<h4>Pregnancy and breastfeeding</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This is because there is not enough information to be sure that this medicine is safe for use in pregnancy.</li>
  <li>This medicine will only be given if the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risks to the mother and the unborn child.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>This is because it is not yet known whether this medicine passes into human breast milk - or what the effects might be on the baby or milk production.</li>
  <li>Your doctor will help you decide whether to keep breast-feeding or to start treatment with this medicine.</li>
  <li>You will need to consider the potential benefits of treatment for you - compared with the health benefits and risks of breast-feeding for your baby.</li>
</ul>
