<h2>Preface</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This note provides country of origin information (COI) for decision makers handling cases where a person claims that to remove them from the UK would be a breach Articles 3 and / or 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) because of an ongoing health condition.</p>

<h3>MedCOI</h3>

<p>MedCOI is an Asylum and Migration Integration Fund financed project to obtain medical country of origin information. The project allows 11 European Union member states plus Denmark, Norway and Switzerland to make use of the services of the âMedCOIâ team in the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>

<p>The MedCOI team makes enquiries with qualified doctors and other experts working in countries of origin. The information obtained is reviewed by the MedCOI project team before it is forwarded to the UK or other national COI teams. Previous MedCOI responses are stored on its database which participating states are able to access.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>                 Law and policy</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>             Law and policy related to mental health</h3>

<p>1.1.1        The United States Department of Stateâs Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2019 stated: âLabour laws prohibit employment discrimination because of race, skin colour, gender, age, physical or mental disability, political beliefs, language, nationality, religion, family, HIV/AIDS status, or social origin. The government did not enforce the law and penalties were insufficient to deter violations.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.1.2        The Belgian Desk on Accessibility (BDA) of the Immigration Office in Belgium forms part of the MedCOI project; this project is financed by the European Commissionâs Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund with the purpose of obtaining medical country of origin information. The BDA carried out a fact-finding mission to Albania from 4 to 11 September 2016 in order to obtain up-to-date information about the healthcare system in Albania. The resulting report (the BDA/MedCOI report) was published in July 2017 and stated: âFrom a legal point of view, the Albanian state has ratified the most important laws at international level regarding the respect for the humane treatment of a person under special conditions. The government has also ratified the convention for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. In practice, the situation remains very difficult and challenging, not only for chronic but also for acute and urgent intervention cases.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.1.3        The International Trade Association published information in October 2019 which stated: ââ¦The National Agency of Drugs and Medical Equipment oversees registering drugs entering Albania. Since 2016, the Agency is also in charge of registering medical equipment. The MoH develops healthcare policies, proposes the national healthcare budget, and monitors state-owned health institutions.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.1.4        In March 2020 the Government of Albania released the 11th National Report on the implementation of the European Social Charter, which noted: âRegarding mental health care and persons with intellectual disability, the community approach of mental health service is specifically stated in Law No.44/2012 âOn Mental Healthâ.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.1.5        See <a class="govuk-link" href="#Community_care">Community care</a> for further information on this subject.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>             Government initiatives</h3>

<p>1.2.1        WHO reported in 2018: âIn accordance with international trends, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection is developing new national policies to increase the degree of autonomy of public hospitals. A higher degree of autonomy could provide opportunities for improving the quality of care and efficiency while attracting dynamic managers.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.2.2        WHO noted the Action Plan for the Development of Mental Health Services in Albania 2013-2022:</p>

<p>âThe aim of this strategy is for the protection of the rights of persons with special needs disorders and mental health and the fight against exclusion and social discrimination, through an integrated network of mental health services treatment, rehabilitation and social reintegration.</p>

<p>âWith two major strategic objectives;</p>

<p>1.    Decentralization of mental health services through network expansion and enhancement of existing services.</p>

<p>2.    Deinstitutionalization, by controlling the number of psychiatric beds and strengthening community mental health services.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.2.3        See <a class="govuk-link" href="#Community_care">Community care</a> for further information on this subject.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>             Funding</h3>

<p>1.3.1        The United Nations in Albania released the Progress Report for 2018 for the Albanian Programme of Cooperation for Sustainable Development 2019-2021, noting: âThe Government of Albania continues to implement the approach of Universal Health Coverage. Yet, disparities and inequalities persist among some groups of the population, notably among R&amp;E [Roma and Egyptian minorities], and between urban and rural areas. Spending on health care is still below three percent of GDP and ten percent of the national budget.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.3.2        As a comparison, Ariel Ãomo, head of child psychiatry at the Tirana University hospital âMaria Teresa,â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> produced a paper in 2015 in which he compared mental health provision in Albania with that in other countries in the region. He noted the per capita government expenditure in health (in US$), stating that this was $142 in Albania, $340 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, $444 in Macedonia, $516 in Montenegro, $1,490 in Slovenia, $1,580 in Greece, and $2,031 in Italy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>1.3.3        See <a class="govuk-link" href="#Accessibility_of_drugs/treatment">Accessibility of drugs/treatment (including regional and urban/rural variation)</a> for further information on this subject.</p>

<p>1.3.4        The United States International Trade Association, which is a website that provides information to âfoster economic growth and prosperity through global tradeâ<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>, noted on its Export.gov section, updated in October 2019:</p>

<p>âEstimates put the current health expenditure for 2018 between 6-7% of the GDP, or more than $1 billion [USD], out of which almost 60% is paid privately. According to the Albanian Ministry of Health (MoH), public healthcare spending in 2018 reached 48.6 billion leke ($450 million [USD]). Experts argue that healthcare spending in Albania is even higher considering the sizable informal economy.</p>

<p>âPublic healthcare spending is partially financed by compulsory health insurance contributions by employees and employers (a 3.4 % health insurance contribution, divided evenly between employer and employee, is imposed on salaries) and subsidized by the state budget. The Compulsory Health Insurance Fund (ISKSH), funded by the health insurance contributions and subsidized by the state budget, reimburses the prescription drugs for the insured and pays for the public healthcare services as well as some approved hospital healthcare services provided by the private healthcare providers.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.3.5        It was noted by WHO in 2018: âThe Compulsory Health Care Insurance Fund is the purchaser of services. Its budget is distributed as follows: 24% for PHC, 27% for other forms of outpatient care and reimbursement for medicines, 48% for hospitals, 2% for the national preventive check-up programme and 2% for administrative expenses.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.3.6        WHO also noted in 2018: ââ¦For most of the PHC buildings, a budget for repairs and maintenance has not been made available in recent decades.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.3.7        The BDA/MedCOI report, published in July 2017, stated:</p>

<p>âThe HIF [Health Insurance Fund] is a semi-autonomous structure from the MoH [Ministry of Health], founded in 1995 as the Health Insurance Institute. Later it became the HIF. The HIF is financed by the state budget and contributions. All the funds that go through the HIF are used to pay doctors, nurses, etcâ¦ Certain population groups are automatically included in the HIF: children, students, military personnel, pensioners and the unemployed. If you are unemployed, you get a document which has to be presented at the family physician to acquire a health insurance card.</p>

<p>ââ¦ All the people who work in the public and private sector and who pay their taxes are included in the health insurance scheme. Besides these people, there are a lot of people who are paid under the covers. People can also make a voluntary contribution which is around â¬20 [Euros] to get a contribution card and via this way this person is insured. The government has launched the idea of free healthcare financed by general taxation. The minister wants to go to the general taxation system by the end of 2017.</p>

<p>ââ¦The total number of employees at the hospital is only a third of what is necessary. More funds are needed to hire extra staff. Social workers play an important role in the rehabilitation and re-integration process of these patients. An estimated 30% of the patients [mental health patients] relapse and return to mental health services.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>             Inspections of institutions</h3>

<p>1.4.1        The United States Department of Stateâs Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2019 stated: âAs of August [2019] the Office of the Ombudsman inspected four mental health institutions during the year and found that patients were given inadequate psychiatric evaluations upon both admission to and discharge from the institutions.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">2. </span>                 The healthcare system</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>             Availability of healthcare</h3>

<p>2.1.1        The BDA/MedCOI report, published in July 2017, stated: âThere are not many facilities to treat people with mental illnesses in Albania.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.1.2        The BDA/MedCOI report, published in July 2017, stated:</p>

<p>âThe main problem to create a structure of psychosocial support in the country, is that it goes against the mentality in Albania. Until now, the treatment of mental health problems is only provided in psychiatric institutions. Since 2012, with the introduction of the new law on healthcare, the MoH in cooperation with other stakeholders, including the ARCT [Albanian Rehabilitation Centre for Trauma and Torture], have tried to include elements of deinstitutionalized care. The legal structure is in place today, but there is a lack of human resources and investments. The organization did not hear anything up until now of priority being given to mental healthcare. Most of the reforms up until now revolve around the EU admission process, notably the reform of the judiciary.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.1.3        The United States International Trade Association, which is a website that provides information to âfoster economic growth and prosperity through global tradeâ<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>, noted on its Export.gov section:</p>

<p>âThe healthcare system in Albania is mostly public, although private healthcare has become increasingly popular. The public healthcare service is organized at the primary, secondary, and tertiary service levels. Approximately 413 public healthcare clinics offer primary and secondary healthcare services and 42 public hospitals offer tertiary healthcare services. Pharmaceutical and dental services are almost entirely private. The share of private healthcare services has experienced impressive growth in the last decade. The number of specialized private diagnostic clinics, labs, and hospitals has been growing at a fast pace, especially in major urban areas. The 13 private hospitals, as well as dozens of private multi-disciplinary diagnostic clinics and labs, offer a full range of medical services.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.1.4        The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported in 2018:</p>

<p>âAccording to the basic package of PHC [primary health care] services, GPs have to (1) manage primary health care; (2) focus health care on individuals; (2) [sic] solve special health problems defined in the seven groups of services [which include mental health care]; (3) provide holistic and integrated health care; (4) adapt services to fulfil community health service needs; and (5) provide basic check-ups for the people in targeted age groups as defined by Ministry of Health and Social Protection (6). The basic package also highlights the competencies of GPs in five fields: clinical responsibilities, managing the health risks in the population, communication with patients, managing the patients and managing health care.</p>

<p>ââ¦ During the visits [of a delegation sent from WHO to Albania], it was observed that buildings are mostly old although well maintained. Some premises have been recently renovated. Some buildings show damaged offices, with the ceiling covered with mould, without a heating and ventilation system. The offices were small and uncomfortable. Some offices accommodate three to five people, including the patient, the GP and one or two nurses. Medical records are kept in the same office. Reception desks, even in larger PHC centres, are rather small with no or small waiting rooms. Some PHC centres in rural areas do not have waiting rooms.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.1.5        WHO also noted in 2018:</p>

<p>âPHC centres provide a scope of services defined by a basic package of PHC services adopted by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection in 2009. The Compulsory Health Care Insurance Fund pays for all services included in the basic package of PHC services. The package defines seven groups of services: (1) emergency care; (2) health services for children; (3) health services for women of reproductive age; (4) health services for adults; (5) health services for older people; (6) mental health care; and (7) health promotion and education. In 2015, the groups for women of reproductive age and children were revised to bring them up to date with latest best practices.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.1.6        The BDA/MedCOI report, published in July 2017, stated:</p>

<p>âThe MoH [Ministry of Health] has further developed the primary healthcare (PHC) system over the past few years. In September 2016 there were 1,600 family physicians across the country, as well as 6,000 nurses. A recent development has been the introduction of a general medical check-up for everybody between 40 and 65 years old. This was introduced by the MoH in the primary healthcare system. The check-up encourages people to visit their family physician. It raises awareness for certain health issues and helps keep the population stay healthy. The general check-up is provided free of charge.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup></p>

<p>2.2.4     The BDA/MedCOI report, published in July 2017, stated:</p>

<p>âThe hospital [Psychiatric hospital âSadik DinÃ§iâ Elbassan] opened in 1964 as the neuropsychiatric hospital âSadik DinÃ§iâ. After the 1990s the neurology department became part of the general hospital in Elbasan. It is the biggest hospital for psychiatric patients in Albania, which covers a population of 1,300,000.</p>

<p>âThere are 310 beds in the hospital which has a yearly turnover rate of 450 patients. There are 5 doctors of whom 2 work in the community centres of mental health under auspices of the hospital. The psychosocial staff consists of 10 social workers and psychologists. The hospital focuses on treatment and rehabilitation. There are 3 wards for acute patients. In theory, there are no closed wards in the hospital. The first ward where patients enter, is the admission ward. It is a mixed ward for men and women with 8 beds. The other 2 wards are separated for men and women. Each ward has a capacity of 30 patients. The 2 wards have a capacity of 60 patients in total. Besides these wards, the community centres for outpatient treatment are located in the same building. They have a staff of 8: 2 doctors, 2 psychologists, 1 social worker and 3 nurses.</p>

<p>ââ¦The patients who are hospitalized in the psychiatric hospital came on referral. Most of them come from Central Albania. The age of the patients varies from 18 years old up to 65. The psychiatric hospital is linked to the Mother Teresa UHC and takes care of children and adolescents suffering from mental illnesses.</p>

<p>ââ¦The psychiatric hospital also accommodates 75 patients born with mental disabilities who need to be in special care facilities. These patients were re-examined by the MoH [Ministry of Health] in 2015, seeing as they will be brought under the auspices of the Ministry of Social Welfare. These patients are currently still at the hospital and the situation in the hospital becomes aggravated because of their presence.</p>

<p>ââ¦The psychiatric hospital offers both types of treatment: medicinal treatment, as well as socio psychologic treatment and occupational therapy. Each patient gets into contact with a psychologist and social worker. They prepare the plan of treatment for the patient in coordination with the doctor and the patient. First, the patient is treated with medication, afterwards the patient works on his rehabilitation in society with the aid of a psychologist and social worker. There are two large rehabilitation centres at the psychiatric hospital where patients go to at least once a week. The staff consists of three persons for both centres. The centres organize occupational therapy on a daily basis for a total of 100 inpatients.</p>

<p>ââ¦The psychiatric hospital does not treat drug addicts. In Tirana there is a specific ward at the Mother Theresa UHC for addicted patients. Separate wards for drug addicts can be found in institutions in Elbasan, KorÃ§a, Berat, VlorÃ« and Shkodra.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup></p>

<p>âThe FFT were told that Albaniaâs reform of mental health is trying to change the situation to a more community based approach. There are community support clinics which are aimed at rehabilitating and supporting the transition from hospitalisation to home.</p>

<p>âD and E [Different and Equal, an NGO which assists victims of human trafficking, domestic violence sexual abuse] commented that the community centres are always full.

Different activities are organized, including cooking, drawing, etc. Before being sent to the shelters, the patients were treated as inpatients. The shelters are part of a strategy initiated by the MoH to provide deinstitutionalised care in mental healthcare. There are 2 protected homes to open in KorÃ§a, which will accommodate 6 men and 6 women. The staff who will work in KorÃ§a was selected and trained by Irish instructors under the guidance of the WHO. The Sadik DinÃ§i hospital selected the patients who will be sent to KorÃ§a. The hospital is awaiting the final approval of the MoH to send the patients over there.

<p>âThe European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg said on Tuesday that it had found in favour of Arben Strazimiri [who was arrested for attempted murder but was not found to be criminally liable because of paranoid schizophrenia], who was detained in a prison hospital because Albania does not have specialist healthcare institutions for people who have been ordered to undergo compulsory treatment for mental illness.</p>

<p>ââ¦Since then [his arrest in 2008], he has been held at the Prison Hospital in Tirana because the country doesnât have a specialist healthcare facility for those undergoing compulsory treatment. âThe court found in particular that there had been a longstanding failure by the Albanian authorities to set up a special medical institution for the mentally ill who were deprived of their liberty on the strength of court-ordered compulsory treatment,â the court said.</p>

<p>4.1.1        WHO reported in 2018:</p>

<p>âPreventive care and patient and family education are part of the basic package of PHC [primary health care] services. The description of preventive services is very detailed for monitoring the growth and development of children, who require frequent control visits during the first three years. Controls are then required once per year between four and six years of age.</p>

<p>âDedicated paediatricians and nurses responsible only for preventive services perform these services, which are organized as parallel services. In an urban PHC centre in Fier, a paediatrician covers 6000 children and provides only preventive check-ups, vaccination, preventive visits at home and prevention and management of child maltreatment from violence and abuse. This type of parallel services prevents a holistic assessment of child development and the detection of health problems, since it does not build on a trustful and continuous relationship with parents and teachers given the high number of children per paediatrician.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:65" rel="footnote">[footnote 65]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.2        The European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (ESCAP) released an undated interview with Ariel Ãomo (a Psychiatrist at Mother Teresa Hospital), in which Ãomo stated: ââ[â¦] the health system in Albania has not been able to enrol a great many professionals in child psychiatry, nor in allied professions. Today we have fifteen working child psychiatrists, some of them also work with adults, and in the allied professions we have only three psychologists for adults and youth.

<p>4.1.3        ESCAP released an undated article where it noted: âThe establishment of academic child and adolescent psychiatric training in Albania is developing slowly but steadily.

<p>5.1.1        In March 2020 the Government of Albania released the 11th National Report on the implementation of the European Social Charter, noting: âThe vision for the future [of mental health care in Albania] continues to be inspired by the philosophy of protection of the rights of persons with mental disabilities and special needs on mental health and the fight against exclusion and social discrimination through the establishment of an integrated network of mental health services for treatment, rehabilitation and social reintegration.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:71" rel="footnote">[footnote 71]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.2        In the Human Rights Council Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review on Albania in September 2019 it was recommended by Portugal that Albania: âRespect the rights of persons with mental health conditions and psychosocial disabilities, in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, including by combating institutionalization, stigma, violence and overmedicalization, and by developing community-based and people centred mental health services that promote their inclusion in the community and respect their free and informed consent.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:72" rel="footnote">[footnote 72]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.3        The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which is a part of the Organization for Security and Co-operation, reported in June 2019: âRestrictions on voting rights of citizens, who are mentally incapacitated, even when supported by a court decision, are contrary to international obligations.â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:73" rel="footnote">[footnote 73]</a></sup></p>

The Home Officeâs Country Policy and Information Team uses some standardised ToRs, depending on the subject, and these are then adapted depending on the country concerned.</p>

<p>For this particular CPIN, the following topics were identified prior to drafting as relevant and on which research was undertaken:</p>
