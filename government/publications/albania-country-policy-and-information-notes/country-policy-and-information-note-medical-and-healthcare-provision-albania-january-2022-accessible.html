<h2>Preface</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This note provides country of origin information (COI) for decision makers handling cases where a person claims that to remove them from the UK would be a breach of Articles 3 and/or 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) because of an ongoing health condition.</p>

<p>It is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of healthcare in Albania.</p>

<h3>Country of origin information</h3>

<p>The country information in this note has been carefully selected in accordance with the general principles of COI research as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/48493f7f2.html" rel="external">Common EU [European Union] Guidelines for Processing Country of Origin Information (COI)</a>, dated April 2008, and the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation’s (ACCORD), <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.coi-training.net/researching-coi/" rel="external">Researching Country Origin Information – Training Manual, 2013</a>. Namely, taking into account the COI’s relevance, reliability, accuracy, balance, currency, transparency and traceability.</p>

<p>The structure and content of the country information section follows a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Version_control_and">terms of reference</a> which sets out the general and specific topics relevant to this note.</p>

<p>All information included in the note was published or made publicly available on or before the ‘cut-off’ date(s) in the country information section. Any event taking place or report/article published after these date(s) is not included.</p>

<p>All information is publicly accessible or can be made publicly available, and is from generally reliable sources. Sources and the information they provide are carefully considered before inclusion. Factors relevant to the assessment of the reliability of sources and information include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the motivation, purpose, knowledge and experience of the source</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the information was obtained, including specific methodologies used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the currency and detail of information, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the COI is consistent with and/or corroborated by other sources.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple sourcing is used to ensure that the information is accurate, balanced and corroborated, so that a comprehensive and up-to-date picture at the time of publication is provided of the issues relevant to this note.</p>

<p>Information is compared and contrasted, whenever possible, to provide a range of views and opinions. The inclusion of a source, however, is not an endorsement of it or any view(s) expressed.</p>

<p>Each piece of information is referenced in a brief footnote; full details of all sources cited and consulted in compiling the note are listed alphabetically in the bibliography.</p>

<h3>Independent Advisory Group on Country Information</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/independent-chief-inspector-of-borders-and-immigration/about/research">Independent Advisory Group on Country Information</a> (IAGCI) was set up in March 2009 by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration to support him in reviewing the efficiency, effectiveness and consistency of approach of COI produced by the Home Office.</p>

<p>The IAGCI welcomes feedback on the Home Office’s COI material. It is not the function of the IAGCI to endorse any Home Office material, procedures or policy. The IAGCI may be contacted at:</p>

<h3>MedCOI</h3>

<p>MedCOI is an Asylum and Migration Integration Fund (AMIF) financed project to obtain medical country of origin information. The project allows 12 European Union member states plus Norway and Switzerland to make use of the services of the ‘MedCOI’ team in the Netherlands and Belgium. The MedCOI team makes enquiries with qualified doctors and other experts working in countries of origin. The information obtained is reviewed by the MedCOI project team before it is forwarded to the relevant COI Service</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>Our goal is to continuously improve our material. Therefore, if you would like to comment on this note, please email the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cipu@homeoffice.gov.uk">Country Policy and Information Team</a>.</p>

This can comprise an obstacle for the population to visit GPs [general practitioners] but also for the GPs to make home visits and/or to consult patients at more distant health post–ambulatories [note: post- ambulatory is a term used for everything affiliated with PHC centre facilities]. GPs serve the population on their lists and the schools located in the catchment area of the PHC centre.</p>

<p>‘The centres visited did not have vehicles.

<span class="number">3. </span>                 Healthcare system</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>             Structure</h3>

<p>3.1.1        In an article published in Sage Journals on 7 October 2020, Jonila Gabrani, Christian Schindler and Kasper Wyss from the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, University of Basel, Switzerland, noted that ‘… Albania, a south-eastern European country with a health system in transition, most health care providers continue to be owned by the Government. They have a 3 tiers level structure: primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare…</p>

<p>‘Albania has been engaged for several years in improving PHC services to better address health system challenges.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.2        In 2019, the International Trade Administration (ITA), led by the Under Secretary for International Trade, stated:</p>

<p>‘The healthcare system in Albania is mostly public [free], although private healthcare has become increasingly popular. The public healthcare service is organized at the primary, secondary, and tertiary service levels. Approximately 413 public healthcare clinics offer primary and secondary healthcare services and 42 public hospitals offer tertiary healthcare services. Pharmaceutical and dental services are almost entirely private…</p>

<p>‘Public healthcare spending is partially financed by compulsory health insurance contributions by employees and employers (a 3.4 % health insurance contribution, divided evenly between employer and employee, is imposed on salaries) and subsidized by the state budget. The Compulsory Health Insurance Fund (ISKSH), funded by the health insurance contributions and subsidized by the state budget, reimburses the prescription drugs for the insured and pays for the public healthcare services as well as some approved hospital healthcare services provided by the private healthcare providers.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.3        MedCOI: The Asylum and Migration Integration Fund (AMIF) financed project to obtain medical country of origin information (MedCOI) noted in March 2019 that in Albania’s health system ‘The diagnostic and treatment health service is organized in three levels: primary care [PHC], secondary hospital service, and tertiary hospital service.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.1.4        Expatfinder, a website aimed towards fee-paying foreign visitors but also citing public health care procedures available for Albanian citizens, noted that:</p>

<p>‘By law, all Albanian citizens are entitled to get equal access to healthcare in the country. The public healthcare system is controlled by the state and is divided into three tiers. The first level corresponds to primary health care, including health, hygiene, maternity and paediatric clinics, health education centres, local emergency rooms and rural hospitals. The next level caters to secondary care and is made up of diagnostic and medical services in hospitals and polyclinics. The last level administers tertiary care and consists of scientific research medicine, which includes four national university centres equipped with diagnostic services.</p>

<p>‘Funding for the public healthcare scheme comes from contributions from employers, employees and self-employed individuals.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>             Doctors and specialists</h3>

<p>3.2.1        In 2018, the WHO report noted that:</p>

<p>‘The composition of PHC teams varies according to the centre. GPs specialize either in adults (15 years and older) or in children. However, in small rural areas, GPs provide services to people of all ages. Urban areas have paediatricians performing check-ups of healthy children and paediatricians caring for sick children. A similar division of labour applies to nurses. Nurses are often subspecialized, with a narrow scope of services.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.2.2        The 2018 WHO report added that ‘In Tirana, the organization of the PHC centre includes diagnostic services staffed with specialized doctors, such as cardiologists, rheumatologists, orthopaedic surgeons, surgeons, obstetrician-gynaecologists and ophthalmologists.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.2.3        The Computer and Enterprise Investigations Conference (CEIC), founded in 1992 by a team of expert analysts and economists to provide analytical data for economic and investment research, indicated in an undated report there was a ratio of 1.216 physicians per 1000 people from data collected in 2016<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>             Pharmaceuticals</h3>

<p>3.3.1        Privacy Shield, an organisation designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in conjunction with the European Commission and Swiss Administration to support transatlantic commerce within data protection requirements under EU Law, noted in an undated report that:</p>

<p>‘Albania’s pharmaceutical sector includes 200 pharmaceutical warehouses, one thousand pharmacies, 210 pharmaceutical private agencies, and 42 pharmacy hospitals. Imports dominate Albania’s drug market and most major international brands are present in the country. Locally manufactured products, while growing recently, continue to account for a small share of the total market. In 2018, domestic production accounted for around 10% of market share.</p>

<p>‘The Ministry of Health monitors the pharmaceutical industry, and all drugs must be registered with the National Agency of Drugs and Medical Equipment. The government sets profit margins for actors involved in the distribution chain for both reimbursed drugs and non-reimbursable drugs.</p>

<p>‘The Compulsory Healthcare Insurance Fund (ISKSH), which manages the public health coverage plan, includes a mix of Bismarck and Beveridge models. ISKSH develops an annual reimbursement list of drugs that will be subsidized by the government for primary and hospital healthcare.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.3.2        The International Trade Administration (ITA) in its U.S. Companies Export website Export.com, last updated in October 2019, noted that:</p>

<p>‘Public healthcare spending is partially financed by compulsory health insurance contributions by employees and employers (a 3.4 % health insurance contribution, divided evenly between employer and employee, is imposed on salaries) and subsidized by the state budget. The Compulsory Health Insurance Fund (ISKSH), funded by the health insurance contributions and subsidized by the state budget, reimburses the prescription drugs for the insured and pays for the public healthcare services as well as some approved hospital healthcare services provided by the private healthcare providers…</p>

<p>‘The National Agency of Drugs and Medical Equipment oversees registering drugs entering Albania. Since 2016, the Agency is also in charge of registering medical equipment. The MoH [Ministry of Health] develops healthcare policies, proposes the national healthcare budget, and monitors state-owned health institutions.</p>

<p>‘In 2013, the Albanian government pledged to implement universal healthcare coverage and has since undertaken a series of steps toward implementation of this model. Since January 2016, roughly 600,000 uninsured Albanians benefit annually from free family doctor visits and reimbursable drugs, and close to one million Albanians aged between 35-70 years old, both insured and uninsured, are entitled to benefit from free medical check-ups provided under a PPP contract…</p>

<p>‘Albania imports all medical equipment and devices and around 90% of drugs.</p>

<p>‘All major pharmaceutical and medical equipment and device manufacturers are present in the market, mostly through distributors.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.3.3        Expatfinder noted that:</p>

<p>‘Generally speaking, the pharmaceutical industry in Albania is predominantly privatised. This country has a total of 1,020 pharmacies and 42 hospital pharmacies. Most of the drugs sold in Albania are imported and usually, international brands represent the market. It is the duty of the Ministry of Health to supervise the local pharmaceutical industry while the National Agency of Drugs and Medical Equipment handle the registration process.

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>             Private and public hospitals</h3>

<p>3.4.1        Expatfinder noted that ‘The private health sector in Albania is still also under development, and mostly covers dental and pharmaceutical services. Most of the private medical facilities are concentrated in Tirana including the Hygeia Hospital, American Hospital and German Hospital.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>             Recent developments in healthcare</h3>

<p>3.5.1        MedCOI noted the following in March 2019:</p>

<p>‘The state provides most of the services offered to the population in the field of promotion, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The private sector is still strengthening and covers most of the pharmaceutical service, dental service and some specialist diagnostic clinics that are mainly concentrated in Tirana. In the public sector, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection is responsible for the policies and strategies of the health system, its regulation and coordination of all actors within and outside the system.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.5.2        The 2018 WHO report also notes that:</p>

<p>‘In Albania, PHC is organized through a public network of providers of health services. …. On average, one PHC centre offers services to 8000–20 000 inhabitants, varying for urban and rural areas, registering a doctor: patient ratio of 1:2500 and nurse: patient ratio of 1:400. All PHC centres are responsible for 24/7 duty…</p>

<p>‘All PHC centres are under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, which recruits the medical and non-medical personnel and is responsible for investing in infrastructure and equipment. In most cases, the buildings and land are the property of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection or of the local governments. Each PHC centre has a chief physician, who is usually a general practitioner (GP).’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>             Impact of COVID-19</h3>

<p>3.6.1        In an undated report, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that ‘COVID-19 had an impact on Albanian citizens and its economy, but the authorities acted quickly to contain the spread of the virus…</p>

<p>‘Albania has experienced several waves of the pandemic. The economy reported the first case of COVID-19 on 8 March 2020. Two and a half months later, there were around 300 cases and 10 registered deaths per million inhabitants…</p>

<p>‘The prime minister declared a state of natural disaster throughout the economy on 25 March 2020. The government then prolonged the state until 23 June 2020 and took a series of measures to control the epidemic…</p>

<p>‘Albania had in place policy framework that provided a basis for dealing with the outbreak. It includes the National Civil Emergency Plan of Albania, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection Emergency Operation Plan, the National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan, and the Infectious Diseases Hospital Crisis Prevention Plan, Focused on Pandemic Flu H1N1.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.6.2        The WHO coronavirus disease (COVID-19) live dashboard (with vaccination data) noted that ‘In Albania, from 3 January 2020 to 9 December 2021 there have been 202,641 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 3,126 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 5 December 2021 , a total of 2,035,191 vaccine doses have been administered.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.6.3        OECD further noted that ‘The government has put in place numerous measures (amounting to 4% of GDP) to support the healthcare system, enterprises and households affected by the confinement measures…</p>

<p>‘It received emergency financing support from the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and other donors to help assist with the crisis response…</p>

<p>‘The short-term risk to human life from the COVID-19 has been curtailed thanks to authorities’ early response and citizens’ respect of confinement orders. Registered case and death numbers in Albania are among the lowest in the Western Balkans region.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.6.4        In an undated report, the COVID- 19 Health System Response Monitor (HSRM) which is supported by the WHO, the European Commission and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, stated that:</p>

<p>‘Measures have been implemented to reconfigure service delivery in an effort to increase treatment capacity. Elective procedures are deferred, and capacities at the two hospitals designated for COVID are freed from other medical services which have been transferred to other public hospitals (general surgery and urology to the Trauma Hospital, and TB to the Elbasan Regional Hospital). There is no evidence (positive or negative) of the implications of these efforts.</p>

<p>‘The COVID-19 designated hospitals that are meant to deal exclusively with COVID-19 patients are the Infectious Disease Services at the University Hospital Centre “Mother Tereza” (120 beds), named Hospital COVID 1, and the University Hospital “Shefqet Ndroqi” (193 beds), named Hospital COVID 2.</p>

<p>‘The role of primary care providers with regard to COVID-19 cases consists of:</p>

<p>• Supporting the surveillance teams in case detection and contact tracing.</p>

<p>• Responding on the phone to questions and concerns of people who are in their jurisdiction. Give advice, support, and medical assistance as needed.</p>

<p>• Following up with isolated and quarantined individuals; make sure they follow the medical advice and make sure they are transferred on time to COVID hospitals by the Medical Emergency Service, in case of a deterioration of their condition.</p>

<p>• Following up with convalescent/recovered cases after they are discharged from the hospital.</p>

<p>‘There is an increased availability of video, telephone or other alternative consultations for health services, including TeleMedicine Platform, E-referral, and E-prescription.</p>

<p>‘Measures to ensure additional inpatient capacities for COVID-19 cases include the following:</p>

<p>• Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 244 of 26 March 2020: “On the placement at the disposal of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the building of the former “Crystal” University”</p>

<p>• Normative Act No. 3 of 15 March 2020 “On special administrative measures during the COVID-19 infection period: Depending on the dynamics of hospitalization of people affected by COVID-19 infection, private hospitals, outpatient services, accommodation facilities, auto-ambulances and relevant health and support staff shall be made available to MoHSP for facing COVID -19, upon the Order of the Minister responsible for health”.</p>

<p>‘Measures were also taken to prohibit the export of medicines and medical equipment from the Republic of Albania. Permission to export medicines and medical equipment is granted only by authorization from the Minister of Health and Social Protection (Order of the Minister of Health and Social Protection No. 131 of 8 March 2020: “On the prohibition of the export of medicines and medical equipment”).’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup></p>

</ul>

<p>4.1.2        Albania’s National Cancer Control Program noted that ‘The National Committee for Cancer Control is fully functional and currently leads the National Cancer Control Program (NCCP). For the four key components: prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, and palliative care, responsibilities and specific tasks are designed.</p>

<p>‘The National Cancer Control Program document is developed and reviewed by all actors involved in the fight against cancer in Albania.</p>

<p>‘The 10- year action plan (2011-2020 which includes activities, timelines and</p>

<p>4.1.3        The same source added that ‘The cancer registry is based on hospital records of the “Mother Teresa” University Hospital Center in Tirana (TUHC). The computerization of data has started in 2008. The data collected from 36 districts are then sent to TUHC. The cancer and risk factors surveillance is based on the institutional collaboration between TUHC and the Institute of Public Health.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.4        Albania’s National Cancer Control Program further stated that ‘The National Oncology Service is part of “Mother Teresa” Hospital and the only specialized public institution in the country, with a multi-disciplinary team which deals with cancer diagnosis and treatment. This service has 111 beds, 31 physicians and consists of surgery pavilion (where surgery of breast, colon and rectum, soft tissues and bones, testicles, skin, and melanoma are performed), radiotherapy, chemotherapy, pathological anatomy, and diagnostic radiology pavilions.</p>

<p>‘University Clinics within “Mother Teresa” Hospital are: General Surgery, Urology, Surgery of the Thorax, Otorhinolaryngology, Maxillofacial Surgery, and Neurosurgery. These services provide primarily surgical treatment for tumors of the stomach, urinary tract, lung, head, neck, and brain.</p>

  <li>
    <p>‘Primary Health Care Centers and Specialties’ Policlinics: in Tirana and other districts across the country there are such centers for patients who initially go there for cancer diagnosis. These centers also include other sections for ambulatory patients diagnosed and treated for cancer (Oncology centers). These services are available in the main districts of the country (Tirana, Durres, Shkoder, Fier, Vlore, Lezhe, Elbasan, Kruje, Kavaja and Korca).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Private services: there is only one private complex hospital center in Tirana, Hygeia hospital, which provides a high quality multi-disciplinary complex service in oncology including radiotherapy with 2 linear accelerators, but every service is provided against direct payment from the patient.

<p>4.1.5        The same source continued: ‘Cancer drugs, according to priority can be divided into the following groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>‘Curable cancers and those cancers where the cost-benefit rate clearly favors the treatment with anti-tumor drugs and that can be managed properly with basic treatment regimen, based on relatively few drugs, which can be found in the market at relatively low cost as generic medicines. The widespread availability of these drugs should be the number one priority of health policy.</p>

  <li>
    <p>‘The second group of drugs may have some advantages in certain clinical situations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Based on current evidence, the third group of drugs (new drugs) is considered as not essential to real effectiveness in cancer care.

<span class="number">4.2 </span>             Breast cancer</h3>

<p>4.2.1        The Government of Albania’s Instituti i Shendetit Publik (ISHP) noted in 2017 that the following treatments were available for breast cancer at the Mother Teresa Hospital:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chemotherapy regimens: a treatment plan that specifies the dosage, the schedule, and the duration of treatment;</li>
</ul>

<p>in combination with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Taxane: a type of drug that blocks cell growth by stopping mitosis (cell division). Taxanes interfere with microtubules (cellular structures that help move chromosomes during mitosis). They are used to treat cancer. A taxane is a type of mitotic inhibitor and a type of antimicrotubule agent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trastuzumab: a monoclonal antibody used to treat breast cancer and stomach cancer. It is specifically used for cancer that is HER2 receptor positive. It may be used by itself or together with other chemotherapy medication.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Chemotherapy drugs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Epirubicin: chemotherapy drug, an anthracycline topoisomerase II inhibitor used as an adjuvant to treating axillary node metastases in patients who have undergone surgical resection of primary breast cancer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cyclophosphamide: a chemotherapy drug in a class of medications called alkylating agents. In treating cancer, it works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5-fluorouracil: a chemotherapy drug. It slows the growth of cancer cells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Docetaxel: an anti-cancer (“antineoplastic” or “cytotoxic”) chemotherapy drug. This medication is classified as a “plant alkaloid,” a “taxane” and an “antimicrotubule agent”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>4.2.2        An article published on 1 October 2018 in the medical journal The Breast noted that Neoadjuvant therapy was available at the Mother Teresa Hospital. The following information was found:</p>

<p>‘Neoadjuvant therapy refers to the systemic treatment of breast cancer prior to definitive surgical therapy. The primary objective of neoadjuvant therapy is to improve surgical outcomes in patients for whom a primary surgical approach is technically not feasible and in patients with operable breast cancer who desire breast conservation. Neoadjuvant therapy also allows for an early evaluation of the effectiveness of systemic therapy.</p>

<p>‘Oncology Service in UHC “Mother Teresa” is the greatest service of treating cancer in Albania, but it is not the only one.

<span class="number">4.8 </span>             Radiation therapy</h3>

<p>The International Atomic News Agency (IAEA) noted that ‘Radiation therapy machines are an essential part of effective cancer treatment…</p>

<p>‘“Mother Teresa”, which treats 90% of all cancer cases, is the only public hospital that provides radiation therapy treatment in this country of 3.3 million people.</p>

<p>‘The IAEA and Albania’s government joined forces ten years ago to support the hospital and have paid for the installation of this latest machine as well.</p>

<p>‘But it takes a lot more than the right equipment to provide effective cancer treatment.</p>

<p>‘The IAEA has assisted with drafting a national cancer control programme in Albania and the commissioning of nuclear medicine and radiotherapy machines since the establishment of the first radiotherapy unit at the hospital in 1966. It has also trained medical staff in machine handling and radiation safety”, said Minister of Health Ogerta Manastirliu.</p>

<p>‘Over the last few years, the hospital has expanded treatment techniques from cobalt teletherapy to linear accelerators, allowing doctors to treat complex cases faster and with more precision.</p>

<p>‘Today, the hospital has two linear accelerators (linac) for radiotherapy treatment and one single-photo emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) machine for the diagnosis of cancer, cardiovascular and other chronic non-communicable diseases. The second linac was delivered to the hospital in May 2018.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.8.1        IAEA also noted oncology treatments at the Mother Teresa Hospital where ‘A linear accelerator is the device most commonly used to treat cancer with external beam radiation.</p>

<p>‘This machine is used to treat all organs of the body. It delivers high-energy X-rays or electrons to the region of the patient’s tumour. These treatments can be designed in such a way that they destroy the cancer cells while sparing the surrounding normal tissue.</p>

<p>‘Radiation therapy, or radiotherapy, is a branch of medicine that focuses on the use of radiation to treat cancer. It is designed to use radiation to target and kill cells. In the case of cancer, when the radiation is applied to a cancerous tumour, or a mass of malignant cells, the targeted cells are damaged and killed, leading to a reduction of the tumour size or, in some cases, the disappearance of the mass.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.2 </span>          Special needs</h3>

<p>18.2.1     In an article entitled ‘Special Education Needs Provision within Mainstream Education’, the European Commission’s European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) noted on 28 March 2019 that until a few years ago:</p>

<p>‘… the only access to education, children with disabilities had, was attending a special primary school (Tirana, Vlora, Durrës and Elbasan) for the children who had intellectual disabilities, or the School for Blind children” and “The institute of deaf children” which are both in Tirana. The latter institutions offer dorm rooms, and all the expenses are paid by the government. However, for many years, a high number of children with disabilities have had unequal access to education, especially attending secondary or higher level education…</p>

<p>‘During the last decade, efforts have been made to develop a suitable regulatory framework that would guarantee the inclusion of children with disabilities, in all general schools. Law No. 69/2012, approved in July 2012 “On the Pre-university Education” marks an important step regarding the rights of children with disabilities, for their overall inclusion and quality education.</p>

<p>‘The principle of equality and non-discrimination is determined on the legal basis that regulates it. Article 5 of this law guarantees the right for education for a lot of categories, including the children with disabilities.</p>

<p>‘Article 20 guarantees the right to psycho-social services in the educational institutions. Article 44 focuses on the curriculum, and emphasizes the fact that the curriculum should be in compliance with the physical, mental, social, and ethical development progress of the students, and their individual learning characteristics…</p>

<p>‘Based on the regulatory framework that came into force, every child should be educated, but the decision to enrol the child in general or special school, is left in the hands of the parents. Thus, children with disabilities, regardless of the type and severity of disability, have the right to enrol in nurseries, kindergartens and general schools.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:107" rel="footnote">[footnote 107]</a></sup></p>

<p>18.2.2     In a report published on 2 December 2017 entitled ‘We All Matter! Situation Analysis of Children with Disabilities in Albania’, the United Nations International Children’s emergency Fund (UNICEF) noted that, ‘Physiotherapy, speech therapy and other habilitation therapies are provided mainly in day centers.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:108" rel="footnote">[footnote 108]</a></sup></p>

<p>18.2.3     UNICEF further noted that ‘The government Child Care and Development Centre in Tirana provides outpatient services for children with disabilities of age 0–6 years. It also has a 30-bed residential service for children living outside Tirana. The multidisciplinary team assesses children and provides therapeutic services including physiotherapy.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:109" rel="footnote">[footnote 109]</a></sup></p>

<p>18.2.4     Regarding rehabilitation and habilitaion services UNICEF noted in the same report that:</p>

<p>‘…children are provided through the health services at medical centers and hospitals and through municipal, NGO or privately run community-based centers also called Day Centres, Day Care Centres or Community Day Centres. According to both parents and children interviewed, Day Centres provide physiotherapy, speech therapy and other types of developmental therapy. Medical centers and hospitals provide some medicines and medical treatments, but no therapy.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:110" rel="footnote">[footnote 110]</a></sup></p>

<p>18.2.5     The Albanian news agency Exit News reported on 27 May 2021 that ‘Intellectual disabilities include Down syndrome, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). There are 681 people living with Down syndrome in Albania, about half of which (305) are under 18 years old.</p>

<p>‘According to a World Vision study conducted in 2018, 1 in 10 children aged 2-17 exhibit a high rate of behavior difficulties such as: attention disorders, communication or learning difficulties, memory problems, inappropriate behavior, hearing and vision issues, difficulty in engaging in social relationships, among others.</p>

<p>‘…10% of all children in Albania, about 70,000 in total, display difficulties but have yet to be diagnosed…</p>

<p>‘In all of Albania, this assessment [early assessment of intellectual disabilities] can only be done in two centers, both located in Tirana.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:111" rel="footnote">[footnote 111]</a></sup></p>

<p>18.2.6     Exit News further noted that ‘… specialized therapy presents an extra cost that families must bear all on their own. The average cost of private therapy is about €365 per month, a considerable discrepancy when compared to the €85 per month financial assistance that people with disabilities receive from the state.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:112" rel="footnote">[footnote 112]</a></sup></p>

<p>18.2.7     Two regional centres for autism were noted by the Non-Government Organisation (NGO) Albanian Children Foundation on 2 April 2015 in a report entitled ‘Inauguration of the second regional center for autism for adult children’ and observed that ‘After the inauguration of the Regional Center for Autism in Farka, 3 and a half years later the Albanian Children Foundation inaugurates another Regional Center for Autism, [Regional Center of Autism Nr.2 in Mjull-Bathore, Sauk] but this time for adult children over the age of 7…</p>

<p>‘After a standardized work of the staff of therapist and employees of the Center in Farka on modern methods, many children not only have overcome the “non communication” condition, but around 20 of them have been integrated into public and private schools in the country…</p>

<p>‘The second Regional Center for Autism is a Treatment, Therapeutic and Educational center for the excellence of talents of children over the age of 7 years with autism spectrum disorder. The structured teaching at this center is based on the combined work between behavioral therapist and professionals from different social fields in order to generalize their distinctive gifts and talents enhanced during therapy, as a profession for the future…</p>

<p>‘Courses provided by the Center are: 1-Therapy (individual + group); 2- Speech therapy; 3- Physiotherapy; 4- Painting; 5- Information Technology ; 6-Music; 7-Hairdresser; 8- Cooking; 9-Tailoring; 10-Physical education and 11- Gardening.</p>

<p>‘The social and physical environment set up and organized for these courses, provides not only visual teaching practices and techniques of the field, but also implementing them by children in order to enhance their gifts, talents and promoting the consolidation of a profession for the future.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:113" rel="footnote">[footnote 113]</a></sup></p>

<p>20.1.1     The Albanian government’s National Cancer Control Program 2011- 2020, published in April 2011 noted that:</p>

<p>‘Palliative care in Albania is relatively new. The first palliative care service for terminal cancer patients was established in 1993 by Ryder Albania Association. The Albanian Association of Palliative Care was established in 2002 as a consortium to develop palliative care in the country. Currently there are a limited number of associations and only one public service of palliative care that provide services to terminal cancer patients across the country…</p>

<p>‘Generally, palliative care services are sporadic and do receive financial support from the authorities and public health system.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:116" rel="footnote">[footnote 116]</a></sup></p>

<p>20.1.2     Albania’s National Cancer Control Program stated that the main structures involved in palliative care for oncology were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>‘Oncology Service in TUHC, which currently includes a psychologist and a social worker. But terminal patients are not frequently hospitalized in public hospitals, as they prefer to day [sic] at home.</p>
