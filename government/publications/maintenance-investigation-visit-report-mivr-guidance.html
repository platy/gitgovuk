<p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) carries out maintenance investigations of vehicle operator licence holders in England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p>The investigations check if the operator has suitable systems, facilities and arrangements in place.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> may report the outcome of a maintenance investigation to the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain.</p>

<p>The questions used during the maintenance investigation are set out in this guide, including the question requirements and assessment criteria. There may also be additional instructions and further information for each question.</p>

<h2>How to use this guide</h2>

<p>The maintenance investigation visit report has 14 question sections:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Operator legal entity</li>
  <li>Condition of vehicles examined at the fleet check</li>
  <li>Operating centre</li>
  <li>Inspection and maintenance records</li>
  <li>Driver defect reporting</li>
  <li>Maintenance facilities and arrangements</li>
  <li>Vehicle emissions</li>
  <li>Wheel and tyre management</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Load security – heavy goods vehicles (<abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr>) only</li>
      <li>Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr>) – public service vehicles (<abbr title="public service vehicles">PSVs</abbr>) only</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prohibition assessment</li>
  <li>Security requirements</li>
  <li>Previous reported shortcomings, conditions and undertakings</li>
  <li>Transport manager/responsible person</li>
  <li>Request for explanation response (where applicable)</li>
</ol>

<p>There is a maximum of 4 assessment outcomes for a question section:</p>

<ul>
  <li>satisfactory – the operator does not need to take any action</li>
  <li>mostly satisfactory – <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> gives advice to the operator</li>
  <li>unsatisfactory – operator action and explanation required</li>
  <li>report to the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain – operator action and explanation required</li>
</ul>

<h2>Investigation outcome</h2>

<h3>Satisfactory and mostly satisfactory</h3>

<p>The operator does not need to take any action, unless <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> has given them advice to improve any systems or procedures.</p>

<h3>Unsatisfactory</h3>

<p>The operator must respond with an explanation to show what action they’ll take to address the issues. Further action depends on the operator’s response but could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> closing the case</li>
  <li>deferred checks by the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> Remote Enforcement Office</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> sending the maintenance investigation visit report with any operator explanations to the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<h3>Report to the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain</h3>

<p>The operator must respond with an explanation to show what action they’ll take to address the issues. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will send the maintenance investigation visit report with any operator explanations to the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain.</p>

              <p class="app-c-published-dates__change-note">The separate guides for HGV and PSV investigations have been combined into a single guide.

##2. Condition of vehicles examined at the fleet check

Changed number of vehicles the examiner will inspect when investigating an operator.

There are two new questions:

* 2a: State the number of vehicles and trailers in possession for the scope of the investigation
* 2b: Were any vehicles or trailers inspected?

The old question 2b is now question 2c.

##3. Operating centre

Question 3b now has “mostly satisfactory” as an assessment outcome “if parking appears adequate but minor issue observed”.

## 4. Inspection and maintenance records

Changed number of files the examiner will use as a sample when investigating an operator. This is now based on whether the operator has any prohibitions issued in the last 15 months.

Question 4b is now “Are records completed?”

Question 4g no longer allows PSV operators to use other incident reporting forms when telling the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency about an incident.

## 5. Driver defect reporting

Question 5a now has “There is clear evidence that walkaround checks are not carried out” as a reason to report to traffic commissioners.

Question 5c now has “Clear evidence of vehicles being used with reported safety defects” as a reason to report to traffic commissioners.

##6. Inspection facilities and maintenance arrangements

Question 6b now has “Clear evidence there are no maintenance facilities or arrangements in place” as a reason to report to traffic commissioners.

Question 6c now has the following as reasons to report to traffic commissioners:

* clear evidence of poor maintenance standards resulting in safety-critical defects
* clear evidence of no management control

##7. Vehicle emissions

Question 7a now requires operators to use manufacturer’s type approved values when testing emissions systems.

Question 7a now has “There is clear evidence of deliberate modification or removal of manufacturers emission plate values” as a reason to report to traffic commissioners. 

##8. Wheel and tyre management

Question 8a now has “Clear evidence of no effective system in place leading to a wheel off incident” as a reason to report to traffic commissioners.

Question 8b now has “Clear evidence of the manufacturers date code being deliberately modified or removed” as a reason to report to traffic commissioners.

##10. Prohibition Assessment

For third party trailers where the operator was not responsible for the safety inspection, Question 10a now requires examiners to check if the driver would not have been aware of the defect either with a walkaround check, system warning or by towing the trailer .

##11. Security Requirements

An operator’s security system must now include security culture.

##13. Transport manager or responsible person

Question 13a now has “There is no evidence of a genuine link between the transport manager and the operation” as a reason to report to traffic commissioners.

Question 13c is now “Based on this investigation, has the transport manager/responsible person demonstrated effective and continuous management control of the operation and shown integrity?”

Question 13c now has:

*  “Effective control” instead of “Full control” as an assessment outcome
* an outcome of no control for “Obvious problems are being ignored by the transport manager or responsible person”
*  “Issues of integrity” as a new assessment outcome.

Question 13c 

##14. Request for Explanation (RFE) Response

The examiner will still report the operator to the traffic commissioners even if the request for evidence response is satisfactory.</p>
