<h3>On the characteristics of state policy for guaranteeing the state sovereignty of Ukraine in the temporarily occupied territories in Donetsk and Luhansk regions</h3>

<p>(Verkhovna Rada News (VRN), 2018, No. 10, article 54)</p>

<p>With amendments entered in accordance with Laws No. 113-IX of 19 September 2019, VRN, 2910, No. 42, article 238
No. 948-IX of 3 November 2020.</p>

<p>The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine,</p>

<p>based on the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine and the Constitution of Ukraine,</p>

<p>stressing that the Sovereignty of Ukraine extends to its entire territory, which within the limits of its internationally recognised state borders is integral and inviolable,</p>

<p>guided by the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on the Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations of 24 October 1970, the Helsinki Final Accords on Security and Co-operation in Europe of 1 August 1975,</p>

<p>following from the fact that in accordance with points “a”, “b”, “c”, “d” and “g” of article 3 of Resolution 3314 (XXIX) of the United Nations General Assembly, the aggression as defined on 14 December 1974 committed by the armed forces of the Russian Federation against Ukraine amounts to the crime of armed aggression, and seriously violates the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, in connection with Ukraine becoming a party to the Treaty on Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 5 December 1994, and the Russian-Ukrainian Friendship Treaty of 31 May 1997,</p>

<p>taking into consideration that the start date for occupation of part of Ukrainian territory, in particular the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol, is determined by Law of Ukraine “On guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of citizens and the legal regime in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine”,</p>

<p>confirming the Appeal of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to the United Nations, the European Parliament, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the GUAM Parliamentary Assembly, and the national parliaments of states of the world to declare the Russian Federation as an aggressor state, approved by the Resolution of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of 27 January 2015 No. 129-VIII, and the Declaration of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine “On repelling the armed aggression of the Russian Federation and overcoming its consequences”, approved by the Resolution of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of 21 April 2015 No. 337-VIII,</p>

<p>stating that, in the light of the provisions of the IV Hague Convention about the Laws and Customs of Land War and the appendices to it: the Provisions about the Laws and Customs of Land War of 18 October 1907, the Geneva Convention about the Protection of Civilians during War of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, which concerns protection of the victims of international armed conflicts (Protocol 1), of 8 June 1977, one of the consequences of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine became the temporary occupation of part of Ukrainian territory,</p>

<p>not recognising the temporary occupation by the Russian Federation of part of Ukrainian territory,</p>

<p>based on the provisions of the Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly “On the territorial integrity of Ukraine” of 27 March 2014 No. 68/262, which stress the illegitimacy of the referendum carried out in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, and urge the international community not to recognise any change in status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol on the basis of the results of the referendum in question,</p>

<p>taking into consideration the Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly “On the state of affairs in the area of human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol (Ukraine)” of 19 December 2016 No. 71/205 and of 19 December 2017 No. 72/190, which declare the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol to be territories temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation,</p>

<p>confirming the inseparable sovereign right of Ukraine to restore and maintain its territorial integrity within the limits of its internationally recognised state borders, including the territory of the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol,</p>

<p>declaring that the armed aggression of the Russian Federation began with an undeclared and covert incursion into Ukrainian territory by subdivisions of the armed forces and other security agencies of the Russian Federation, as well as by organisation and support of terrorist activity,</p>

<p>taking into account that the Russian Federation is committing armed aggression against Ukraine and carrying out temporary occupation of part of its territory with the assistance of Russian armed formations consisting of regular units and subdivisions, subordinate to the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, subdivisions and special formations, subordinate to other security agencies of the Russian Federation, their advisors, instructors, and irregular illegal armed formations, armed groups and groups of mercenaries, created, subordinated, led and financed by the Russian Federation, as well as with the assistance of the occupational administration of the Russian Federation, which consists of its state authorities and structures, functionally corresponding to the administration of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, and the self-proclaimed authorities under the control of the Russian Federation, which have usurped the functions of power in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine,</p>

<p>noting that the actions of the Russian Federation in the territory of specific areas in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol seriously violate the principles and standards of international law, in particular by means of: systematic failure to maintain the ceasefire regime and continuing shelling of civilian targets and infrastructure, which has caused numerous casualties amongst the civilian population, service personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and other military formations, in accordance with the laws of Ukraine; the continued practice of illegally arresting and detaining Ukrainian citizens in the temporarily occupied territories, and illegally removing them and detaining them in the Russian Federation; attempts to extend Russian legislation, including tax legislation, to the territory of specific areas in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol, making illegal demands for re-registration of enterprises and recovering funds for the benefit of the occupying administration of the Russian Federation in specific areas in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol; introduction of the Russian rouble as the single currency in the territory of specific areas in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol, arbitrary application of Russian educational standards in educational institutions, introduction of “external administration” in enterprises in specific areas in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol, and recognition of illegal identification documents and vehicle number plates in the territory of specific areas in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol; organisation and implementation of enforced disappearances, torture, inhuman treatment or punishment, and extrajudicial executions in relation to the civilian population, Ukrainian service personnel and hostages,</p>

<p>remaining loyal to the course of political and diplomatic regulation of the conflicts on the basis of the principles and standards of international law and the Charter of the United Nations,</p>

<p>confirming the inseparable sovereign right of Ukraine to self-defence in accordance with article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations,</p>

<p>confirming the Declaration of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine “On withdrawal of Ukraine from specific obligations determined by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights”, approved by the Resolution of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of 21 May 2015 No. 462-VIII,</p>

<p>taking into account the fact that the characteristics of the legal regime in the territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol are determined by Law of Ukraine “On guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of citizens and the legal regime in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine”,</p>
