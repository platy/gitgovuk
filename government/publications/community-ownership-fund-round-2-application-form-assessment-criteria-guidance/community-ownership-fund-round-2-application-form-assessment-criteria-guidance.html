<p>You should read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-ownership-fund-prospectus">full prospectus</a> before you begin your application.</p>

<p>You will need to submit an EOI form and have this approved before progressing to submit a full application to the Fund. The EOI form will test whether your project is likely to be eligible thorough a pass/fail assessment based on the eligibility requirements. The eligibility requirements can be found in the full prospectus.</p>

<p>If you still need to submit your EOI form, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/community-ownership-fund-round-2-how-to-express-your-interest-in-applying">submit it here</a></p>

<h2>Assessment framework</h2>

<p>The UK government will assess bids from across the UK against a common assessment framework.</p>

<p>Applications will be scored using this framework, and final decisions on funding will be made by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC).</p>

<h2>Assessment criteria</h2>

<p>Applications will be assessed on the following 4 criteria:</p>

<p>1.	Strategic case: applicants should show that without intervention the asset would be lost to the community, the impacts that this would have and support they have from the community and other partners.</p>

<p>The strategic case will account for 30% of the total assessment.</p>

<p>2.	Management case: applicants should show the objectives and deliverability of the project and how the asset will be run sustainably.</p>

<p>The management case will account for 30% of the total assessment.</p>

<p>3.	Potential to deliver community benefit: applicants should show how the asset will deliver community benefits under community ownership.</p>

<p>The potential to deliver community benefit will account for 30% of the total assessment. </p>

<p>4.	Added value of the community asset based on community need: using local data and information on community need, applicants should be able to show the added value of the asset to the community.</p>

<p>The added value of the community asset based on community need will account for 10% of the total assessment.</p>

<h2>Scoring and weighting</h2>

<p>Each criterion has a minimum score that must be met to be considered for shortlisting. Failure to meet this score on any single section will mean your application is not shortlisted.</p>

<p>Additionally, the combined score of sub-criteria 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 must total 12 or higher to be considered for shortlisting. This is to ensure your proposal has a viable and robust business case, financial management plan and the necessary skills to deliver.</p>

<p>To arrive at the overall score, the assessment scores for each criterion will be weighted according to the importance of that criteria. Total scores will be given as a percentage.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Strategic case</h2>

<h4>Total score and weighting</h4>

<p>The total score available for this section is 18. The minimum score to be considered for shortlisting is 11. This will be weighted to account for 30% of the overall assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1. </span>	Benefits</h3>

<p>This will be scored out of 5.</p>

<h4>Assessment and guidance</h4>

<p>In order for your project to be eligible for funding from COF your asset must be at risk of loss, or already be lost, to the community. It is important that you set out a strong case for intervention.  Your case for community intervention should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The current, or former, use of the asset and who benefits from it</li>
  <li>How the loss of the asset will, or already has, affected the people in the community</li>
  <li>Why the asset will be lost without community intervention</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2. </span>	Engagement</h3>

<p>This will be scored out of 10.</p>

<h4>Assessment and guidance</h4>

<p>It is important that you are able to show that the community have been involved in the formulation of your plans and there is strong support locally for them. You should be able to provide evidence of support you have for your plans to save the community asset.</p>

<p>This might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How you have engaged with the community and how this engagement has shaped your project plans</li>
  <li>Describing any fundraising you have done in the community</li>
  <li>How you have involved local people in the project</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also be able to show you have built local partnerships around your plans, and the role your proposals could play within other local plans. If you are working closely with local businesses or in conjunction with the council it’s important to give us details.</p>

<p>This might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Describing whether your project plans fit into any wider local plans or partnerships and the role your project could play in these</li>
  <li>Telling us about the support in the community for your project and how you gathered it</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3. </span>	 Environmental sustainability</h3>

<p>We would like you to give details on how your project supports the journey to Net Zero and incorporate low or zero carbon approaches. We are also interested to hear if your project considers and mitigates its impact on the natural environment.</p>

<p>This question will be scored out of 3.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	Management case</h2>

<h4>Total score and weighting</h4>

<p>You will need to submit a business plan, and any other supporting documents, when prompted at the end of your application. We will also ask for the key figures or details in this section, and where we can find this in your business plan. The business plan will be the key document we use to assess the management case.</p>

<p>Additionally, the combined score of 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 must total 12 or higher to be considered for shortlisting. This is to ensure your proposal has a viable and robust business plan and financial management plan.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1. </span>	Funding breakdown</h3>

<p>This will be scored out of 5.</p>

<h4>Assessment and guidance</h4>

<p>You will need to include an overview of funding information relative to your project. We want to fully understand the total costs of your project, what the COF funding will be used for, what your match funding will be used for, what your sources of match are and when you expect to have this match funding available.</p>

<p>You will be expected to provide a breakdown of the following in your business plan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Project costs</li>
  <li>Capital costs</li>
  <li>Revenue costs</li>
  <li>Total request for funding (capital + revenue costs)</li>
  <li>Match funding details</li>
  <li>Funding you have already secured</li>
  <li>Funding you still need to secure</li>
  <li>Timescales for securing the outstanding match funding</li>
  <li>Independent valuation of the asset (if you intend to buy it)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Community Ownership Fund will provide up to a maximum of 50% of the capital costs to purchase,  (and renovate and or repair) the community asset. You should demonstrate other sources of funding that you have secured or will be securing for the capital costs of your project.</p>

<p>Funding from the Community Ownership Fund may be committed ‘in principle,’ before you have secured other grants or loans. Applicants are reminded that as part of a Grant Funding Agreement a legal charge against the asset may be required. However, we will need evidence that you will be able to secure all match funding for your community asset and drawn down capital within 12 months of the date indicated on your offer letter. We expect that most applicants will have made significant progress on this front within six months.</p>

<p>Applicants should note that any costs incurred before the date of the offer letter provided to successful projects will not be considered as eligible match funding.</p>

<h3>
