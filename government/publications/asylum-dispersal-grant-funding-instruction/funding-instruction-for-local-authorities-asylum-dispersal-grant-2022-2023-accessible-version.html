<h2>Schedule 1</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Payments schedule</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>A payment will be made to facilitate Local Authorities to support requests for properties made under Full Asylum Dispersal. The payment is to address concerns raised by Local Authorities in relation to pressure on local services associated with supporting Asylum Seekers.</p>

<p>Full Asylum Dispersal grant two will support Local Authorities through quarterly grant payments of £3,500 per new and occupied bedspace opened between 28 March 2022 and 31 March 2023 inclusive.</p>

<h4>Payment Profile</h4>

<p>Under this funding instruction the Authority will make payments to the Recipient based on the number of eligible new and occupied bedspaces opened between 28 March 2022 and 31 March 2023 (inclusive) within the geographical bounds of the local authority. These will be paid as detailed in Table A below. No further funding will be paid by the Authority to a Recipient under this funding instruction. The Authority may opt to make further payments under further funding instructions but does not commit to do so within this instruction.</p>

<h4>Payment: Ongoing Participation and Contribution</h4>

<p>The Payment will be based on Home Office reports run at the end of each quarter.</p>

<p>Eligibility will be based on the growth of occupied beds in Home Office Supported Asylum Seeker accommodation opened since 27 March 2022 within the geographical bounds of the local authority under the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dispersal Accommodation (DA)</li>
  <li>Overflow Dispersal Accommodation (ODA)</li>
  <li>Initial Accommodation (IA)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each quarters payment will be for the growth between 27 March 2022 and the Payment Eligibility Date less the payments made for any growth already paid in prior quarters.</p>
