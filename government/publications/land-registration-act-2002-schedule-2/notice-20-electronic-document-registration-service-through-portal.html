<h2>Notice given by the registrar under Schedule 2 to the Land Registration Rules 2003</h2>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<p>1.In this Notice:</p>

<p>(a) expressions used have, unless the contrary intention appears, the meaning which they bear in the Land Registration Rules 2003 (SI 2003/1417), as amended from time to time,</p>

<p>(b) “development scheme” or “scheme title” means a registration arrangement made with the registrar to incorporate several parcels of land into a single registered title as they are acquired, as described in HM Land Registry’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/development-scheme">Practice Guide 72 – Development Schemes</a>,</p>

<p>(c) “electronic Document Registration Service through portal” means the service provided by the registrar to enable an application for registration to be made electronically by means of the portal, with such electronic documents and scanned copies of the deeds and documents attached as are required to support the application,</p>

<p>(d) “MD reference” means a reference supplied by the registrar to a lender which enables all or part of the wording for the registration of a legal charge to be generated automatically within HM Land Registry’s computer system,</p>

<p>(e) “portal” means the secure website platform used to access HM Land Registry’s Business e-services.</p>

<p>2.Reference to a form means the form of that description prescribed by Schedule 1 to the Land Registration Rules 2003, or designated by a direction of the registrar made under section 100(4) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<p>3.This notice does not apply to “eAP1 through portal” applications made pursuant to notice 25 “Electronic Document Registration Service through Portal – eAP1 applications” under rule 14 and Schedule 2 of the Land Registration Rules 2003.</p>

<h3>Currency of notice</h3>

<p>4.This Notice is made under rule 14 of, and Schedule 2 to, the Land Registration Rules 2003 and shall be current for the purposes of Schedule 2 on and after 0630 hours on 29 May 2020. It replaces on that date the Notice of 3 June 2019 in respect of electronic Document Registration Service through Portal.</p>

<h3>The delivery of applications electronically</h3>

<p>5.Arrangements have been made for an electronic Document Registration Service through portal for the types of applications listed in Schedule 1.</p>

<p>6.The use of the electronic Document Registration Service through portal is subject to the provisions of paragraphs 7 to 22.</p>

<h3>When applications may be delivered</h3>

<p>7.Applications may be delivered between:</p>

<p>(a) 0630 hours and 2300 hours every day.</p>

<p>(b) The service may not be available for up to 15 hours each month due to essential maintenance, improvement and testing work. The registrar will endeavour to undertake such work at times on a Sunday or when it will have minimal impact on applicants.</p>

<h3>Who may deliver applications</h3>

<p>8.Applications may be delivered only by a person or body who:</p>

<p>(a) has been approved by HM Land Registry to use HM Land Registry’s portal, and</p>

<p>(b) has accepted HM Land Registry’s Conditions of Use – the portal and Business Gateway and complies with those conditions, and</p>

<p>(c) has entered into an agreement allowing payment of fees by direct debit as authorised under article 13(2) of the Land Registration Fee Order 2013 (or under any Order which supersedes it).</p>

<h3>General limitations</h3>

<p>(a) for first registration,</p>

<p>(b) to register a charge of part only of a registered title,</p>

<p>(c) that includes more than 50 registered titles,</p>

<p>(d) that relates to a title the individual register of which is not held in electronic form,</p>

<p>(f) that relates to a development scheme or scheme title.</p>

<p>10.If more than one application is delivered together the applicant must quote all the title numbers affected by each application in the “Title numbers” box, and each application/document type in the “Application/document” box, in the Document Registration screen.</p>

<p>11.If a title number affected by an application is not quoted as required in paragraph 10, the application in respect of the unquoted title number will not be received for the purpose of rule 15 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 unless an application against that title number is opened manually by HM Land Registry, and until that manually opened application is entered in the day list, or until a further application is properly made in respect of the
unquoted title number in accordance with paragraph 10.</p>

<p>12.Any requisitions arising from the application will be delivered to the applicant electronically, and all replies to requisitions and further documents must be lodged through the Reply to Requisition service in HM Land Registry’s portal.</p>

<p>13.Any acknowledgment, certificate, vectorised plan or other result of an application will be issued by the registrar electronically. If for any reason the registrar considers that it cannot be conveniently issued in electronic form, he may issue it in paper form.</p>

<h3>Limitations on format of documents that will be accepted as attachments</h3>

<p>14.Electronic attachments to applications, including scanned plans, must:</p>

<p>(b) in full colour,</p>

<p>(c) at a resolution not less than 200dpi and not more than 600dpi.</p>

<h3>General particulars and documents to be provided</h3>

<p>(a) provide a scanned copy of form AP1 or such other form as would be required by the Land Registration Rules 2003 for an application of that type,</p>

<p>(b) in the case of an application to register a charge, provide the MD reference if there is one,</p>

<p>(c) in the case of an application to register a charge dated on or after 6 April 2013, where the chargor is a company, provide an electronic copy of the certificate of registration issued by Companies House, and a certificate or a conveyancer’s or lender’s written confirmation that the charge lodged for registration is:</p>

<p>18.After an application has been made through the electronic Document Registration Service via portal, documents previously omitted may be added to the application only while the application remains pending, and only through the service.</p>

<p>19.Subject to paragraph 20, only the forms listed in Schedule 2 and documents of the types listed in Schedule 3 may be submitted electronically in support of an electronic Document Registration Service application.</p>

<p>20.If evidence of compliance with Stamp Duty Land Tax or Land Transaction Tax legislation is required in respect of an application, an SDLT submission receipt in PDF, TIFF, GIF or JPEG may be attached to the application in the case of SDLT. Otherwise a scanned copy of an SDLT5 certificate or a Land Transaction Tax certificate should be attached.</p>
