<h3>Appendix</h3>

<p>1. The controlling conveyancer initiates and controls the signing process by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Uploading the agreed draft of the document – the transfer or legal charge – to the e-signing platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providing email details of all the signatories and the order in which they are to sign, setting themselves up as the final signatory. The controlling conveyancer may choose to make the other party’s conveyancer a “viewer” in the process so that they have access to the document once their client has signed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marking up the document to highlight where each signatory needs to sign and where they, the controlling conveyancer, will date the document upon completion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Requiring of the signing platform that qualified electronic signatures be used by all signatories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providing approval for the document to be sent out for signing by the signing platform.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. In the order specified, the platform makes each signatory aware that the document is ready for them to sign. Usually this will be by way of an email containing a link to the signing platform.</p>

<p>3. The platform also makes each signatory aware they must complete an ID process before signing and transfers them to the qualified trust service provider (“QTSP”) or provides them with a choice of QTSPs.</p>

<p>4. The QTSP determines if the signatory has a qualified certificate for electronic signatures. If the signatory does have a qualified certificate, the signatory provides the details and validity is checked by the QTSP. If the signatory does not have a qualified certificate, the QTSP completes the necessary ID verification process and issues a qualified certificate.</p>

<p>5. The signatory signs – if using an existing qualified certificate, after having authenticated himself or herself by providing a PIN and/or a One Time Password.</p>

<p>6. The platform arranges for the next signatory or signatories to complete the signing process.</p>

<p>7. Once the final signature has been added, the platform makes the controlling conveyancer aware that the document has been signed and is ready for their dating and signature.</p>

<p>8. Upon completion, the controlling conveyancer adds the time and date in the required field and also their signature. (The validity of the signatures can be checked before this is done.)</p>

<p>9. The platform provides the controlling conveyancer with an electronic version of the signed and timed and dated document together with a final completion certificate/audit report that records, among other things, who created the document, who signed it, the identity of the QTSP and the timing of the signatures.</p>

<p>10. If the controlling conveyancer is not also the conveyancer who will be lodging the application for registration, the controlling conveyancer sends the executed transfer to the lodging conveyancer.</p>

<p>11. Before lodging the application, the lodging conveyancer checks that all the signatures are valid.</p>
