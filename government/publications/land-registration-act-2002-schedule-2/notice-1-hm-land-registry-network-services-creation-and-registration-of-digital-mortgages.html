<h3>Currency and scope of notice</h3>

<p>2.This notice takes effect as follows:</p>

<p>(a) This notice is made under rule 54C of the Land Registration Rules 2003 and shall be current for the purposes of that rule on and after 0630 hours on 21 January 2019. It replaces Notice 1 of 6 April 2018 given under rule 54C of the Land Registration Rules (“the previous notice”).</p>

<p>(b) No digital mortgage completed before 21 January 2019 in compliance with the previous notice shall be invalidated by any changes to the conditions and limitations contained in this notice.</p>

<p>(c) Any digital mortgage prepared under the previous notice before 21 January 2019 but not made effective until on or after 21 January 2019 shall be valid for the purpose of this notice provided it complied with the conditions and limitations contained in the previous notice.</p>

<p>(d) If a digital mortgage is prepared and made effective on or after 21 January 2019 using the digital mortgage API through Business Gateway, it shall not be invalidated (or otherwise take effect upon registration other than as a legal mortgage) solely because it does not fully comply with the conditions and limitations contained in this notice.</p>

<p>3.For the purposes of rule 54D of the Land Registration Rules 2003, this notice applies to digital mortgages (being one kind of disposition which falls within rule 54A of the Land Registration Rules 2003) subject to the exceptions, limitations and conditions set out elsewhere in this notice.</p>

<p>7.Applications to register a digital mortgage may be delivered electronically between:</p>

<p>(a) 0630 hours and 2300 hours every day. Applications submitted outside these times, or submitted within these times on a Saturday or Sunday or a national holiday, will be accepted but not processed until after 0600 hours on the next business day.</p>

<p>12.A digital mortgage may only be granted where it charges the whole of the registered estate in a single registered title.</p>

<p>13.A digital mortgage cannot be granted by a body corporate, whether it is the borrower or a joint borrower.</p>

<p>14.The digital mortgage must, at the points it is created and made effective, be intended by the parties to be:</p>

<p>(a) a re-mortgage of a property where there is an existing charge that will be discharged as part of the same transaction, and</p>

<p>(b) a first charge, not a second or subsequent charge.</p>

<p>15.The borrower(s) must be the registered proprietor(s) of the registered estate when the digital mortgage is created and authenticated.</p>

<p>18.The digital mortgage must include a provision:</p>

<p>(a) to the effect that the borrower(s), with full title guarantee, charge(s) to the lender the property by way of legal mortgage with payment of all money secured by the charge,</p>

<p>(b) that the charge takes effect when the registrar receives notification from [a specified person] that the charge is to take effect, and</p>

<p>(c) specifying the person or persons who can notify the registrar when the charge is to take effect.</p>

<p>19.The digital mortgage may include additional provisions, whether or not they will appear in the register. If there is any conflict between any such additional provision and a provision that must be included under paragraph 18, the latter provision will prevail.</p>

<p>22.The borrower(s) cannot go through the authentication (digital signing) process until the subscriber who will make the digital mortgage effective has confirmed that they have carried out identity checks against the borrower(s), and those identity checks match the data supplied to HM Land Registry by the person who created the digital mortgage (if a different person).</p>

<p>(a) the eMD reference,</p>
