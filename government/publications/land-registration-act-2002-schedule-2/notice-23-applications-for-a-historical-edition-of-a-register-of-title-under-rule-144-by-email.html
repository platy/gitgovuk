<h2>Notice given by the registrar under Schedule 2 to the Land Registration Rules 2003</h2>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<p>1.In this notice:</p>

<p>(a) “the Rules” means the Land Registration Rules 2003 (SI 2003/1417) as amended from time to time, and a reference to a rule by number is to the rule so numbered in the Rules,</p>

<p>(b) “business day” means a day when HM Land Registry is open to the public under rule 216.</p>

<h3>Currency of notice</h3>

<p>2.This Notice is made under rule 132(1) of, and Schedule 2 to the Rules and shall be current for the purposes of Schedule 2 on and after 3 September 2018, and on that date replaces the Notice 23 – Applications for a historical edition of a register of title under rule 144 by email, of 11 July 2017.</p>

<h3>The delivery of HC1 applications by email</h3>

<p>3.(a) Arrangements have been made for delivering applications for a historical copy of a register of title under rule 144 of the Rules (“HC1 application”) by email, subject to paragraphs 3(b) and 4 to 9 inclusive.</p>

<p>(b) The HC1 application by email must not include an application for a title plan.</p>

<h3>Who may deliver an HC1 application by email</h3>

<p>4.HC1 applications by email may be made only by a person who has entered into an agreement allowing payment of fees by direct debit as authorised under article 13(2) of the Land Registration Fee Order 2013 (or under any Order which supersedes it) and who provides, if requested, their direct debit reference number.</p>

<h3>How applications must be delivered</h3>

<p>5.HC1 applications by email must be sent to the email address of the Durham Office of HM Land Registry:</p>

<p>Dm.OfficialCopiesTeamInbox@landregistry.gov.uk</p>

<h3>When the service is available</h3>

<p>6.HC1 applications by email may be made at any time on a business day except that—</p>

<p>(a) when the business day in question follows a day which is not a business day, then
applications cannot be made before 0800 hours on that business day, and</p>

<p>(b) when the business day in question is followed by a day which is not a business day,
applications may not be made after 1600 hours on that business day.</p>

<h3>Other conditions and limitations</h3>

<p>7.The HC1 applications by email must be made in HM Land Registry Form HC1.</p>

<p>8.If an HC1 application by email includes both a request for a historical edition of a register and
a historical edition of a title plan, or contains only a request for a historical edition of a title
plan, the application will be rejected and the customer will be asked to re-lodge their
application by post.</p>

<p>9.For security reasons, the results of an HC1 application by email will be issued by post or DX
only, not by email.</p>
