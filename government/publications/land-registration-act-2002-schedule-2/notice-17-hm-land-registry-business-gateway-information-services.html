<h3>Information as to pending applications</h3>

<p>2.Where there is an entry on the day list in respect of a pending application, the entry will indicate whether, at the time the entry was made, the application was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for first registration of the estate which has been allotted the title number (a “First Registration”),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for registration of a transfer of part of the estate in the registered title (a “Transfer of Part”),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for registration of a lease of all or part of the estate in the registered title to which section 27(2)(b) of the Land Registration Act 2002 applies (a “Dispositionary First Lease”),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an application to register a transfer or mortgage of the whole estate, or for any other change to the register (in each case described as a “Dealing”).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.Where two or more applications were delivered together, only one entry will be made. For example, the following applications are often delivered at the same time: to discharge a registered charge, to register a transfer and to register a legal charge. These will be covered by a single entry (a “Dealing”).</p>

<p>4.Where there is an entry on the day list in respect of a pending application, the following will be provided:</p>

<p>(a) The date and time the entry was made on the day list.</p>

<p>(b) If recorded on the day list, the name, address and reference of the person who lodged the application.</p>

<p>(c) If recorded on the day list, and entry is in respect of a Transfer of Part or Dispositionary First Lease:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a short description of the estate said by the applicant to be affected by the application,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the new title number allocated to the estate,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the parent title numbers out of which the new estate was granted.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>(d) How the application was received.</p>

<p>(e) The progress of the application for information only, but HM Land Registry cannot guarantee the accuracy of the progress revealed.</p>

<h3>Information as to official searches</h3>

<p>5.Where there is an entry on the day list in respect of an application for an official search with priority, the following will be provided:</p>

<p>(a) Whether the application is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for a search of the whole of the estate in the registered title (or an estate which is the subject of a pending application for first registration under the allotted title number), or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for a search of part of the estate in the registered title (or an estate which is the subject of a pending application for first registration under the allotted title number).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>(b) Whether the reason given by the applicant for making the application was that he intended to purchase, take a lease or take a registered charge.</p>
