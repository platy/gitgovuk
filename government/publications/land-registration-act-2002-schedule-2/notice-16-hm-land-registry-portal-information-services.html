<p>a. The information that would be seen in the expanded view of the particular application to which the reference relates (as described in paragraph 7), and</p>

<p>b. The date of completion or cancellation of any application to which the HM Land Registry reference relates if that completion or cancellation occurred within the last 30 calendar days.</p>

<p>4.In either case, the title number in respect of which the application for day list information was made will be displayed.</p>
