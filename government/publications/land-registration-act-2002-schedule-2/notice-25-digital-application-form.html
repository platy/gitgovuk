<h2>Notice given under Schedule 2 to the Land Registration Rules 2003</h2>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<p>1.In this Notice:</p>

<p>(a) expressions used have, unless the contrary intention appears, the meaning which they bear in the Land Registration Rules 2003 (SI 2003/1417), as amended from time to time,</p>

<p>(b) “AP1 application” means an application for which form AP1 is prescribed by the Rules,</p>

<p>(c) “Digital Registration service” is the service to enable certain applications to HM Land Registry to be made electronically by means of the portal using the digital application form, with such electronic documents and scanned copies of deeds and documents attached as are required to support the application(s).</p>

<p>(d) “development scheme” or “scheme title” means a registration arrangement made with the registrar to incorporate several parcels of land into a single registered title as they are acquired, as described in HM Land Registry’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/development-scheme">Practice Guide 72 – Development Schemes</a>,</p>

<p>(e) “digital application form” means a digital form that can be used when making certain applications using the Digital Registration service,</p>

<p>(f) “portal” means the secure website platform used to access HM Land Registry’s Business e-services,</p>

<p>(g) “the Rules” means the Land Registration Rules 2003,</p>

<p>2.Reference to a form other than the digital application form means the form of that description prescribed by Schedule 1 to the Rules or designated by a direction of the registrar made under section 100(4) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<h3>Currency of notice</h3>

<p>3.This Notice is made under rule 14 of, and Schedule 2 to, the Rules and shall be current for the purposes of Schedule 2 on and after 06:30 hours on 8 December 2021. It replaces on that date Notice 25 – Digital Application Form dated 18 August 2021.</p>

<h3>The delivery of applications electronically</h3>

<p>4.Arrangements have been made for a public beta to enable making:</p>

<p>(a) certain AP1 applications without submitting a form AP1, and</p>

<p>(b) applications for which the use of one or more of the forms in the Schedule to this Notice is prescribed by the Rules.</p>

<p>5.The use of the digital application form through the Digital Registration service replaces the form AP1 where it would otherwise be an AP1 application, and its use is subject to the provisions of paragraphs 6 to 22.</p>

<p>6.The use of the digital application form does not obviate the need to provide other forms in support of the application(s) made where their use is prescribed by the Rules or designated by a direction of the registrar made under section 100(4) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>

<h3>When applications may be delivered</h3>

<p>7.Subject to the availability of the service, applications may be delivered between 0630 hours and 2300 hours every day.</p>

<h3>Who may deliver applications</h3>

<p>8.Applications may be delivered only by a firm which already uses HM Land Registry’s electronic Document Registration Service and which has been approved and given access by HM Land Registry to use the public beta referred to in paragraph 4.</p>

<h3>Applications for which the digital application form can be used</h3>

<p>9.Subject to paragraph 10, an application made using the digital application form must be:</p>

<p>(i) an AP1 application, and for the purpose of the current release of the public beta, that includes an application to register:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a transfer for valuable consideration</li>
  <li>a transfer not for valuable consideration</li>
  <li>a transfer of a share</li>
  <li>a transfer subject to a charge</li>
  <li>a transfer under a power of sale</li>
  <li>an assent</li>
</ul>

<p>(ii) Charge Applications</p>

<ul>
  <li>a discharge of a charge</li>
  <li>a charge</li>
  <li>an obligation to make further advances</li>
</ul>

<p>(iii) an application for which a form set out in the Schedule to this Notice is prescribed by the Rules, and be of a type that is capable of being satisfactorily identified by selecting an option in the drop-down list provided by the box ‘Transaction – select from list’ in the ‘Select transaction’ screen in the Digital Registration service.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>(iv) an application of the types detailed in 9 (i) (ii) and (iii) above, in which one or more of the parties is acting by an attorney under an appropriate power.</p>

<h3>Application types for which the digital application form cannot be used</h3>

  <li>a transfer by operation of law</li>
  <li>a release from a charge (form DS3)</li>

</ul>

<p>(b) for first registration,</p>

<p>(c) that relates to an individual register of title that is not held in electronic form,</p>

<p>(d) that relates to a development scheme or scheme title.</p>

<p>11.If an application is made using a digital application form that is not an application for which the digital application form can be used, the registrar may treat it as an application made using the electronic Document Registration Service through portal, pursuant to Notice 20 given by the registrar under Schedule 2 to the Rules, but disregarding paragraph 3 of that Notice, or as an application made in paper form using form AP1 and/or one or more of the forms set out in the Schedule to this Notice.</p>

<h3>General conditions and limitations</h3>
