<h2>Annex A: movement standstill rule and exemptions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1) </span> Movement standstill</h3>
<p>a) Where one or more sheep, goats, cattle or pigs have been moved onto any premises, no animal(s) located on those premises may move off within the periods set out in the sub-paragraphs below (the ‘standstill period’) unless in accordance with the exemptions listed in paragraph 2 below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The movement of any cattle, sheep and/or goats onto premises will trigger a 6 day standstill period for any cattle, sheep, goats and/or pigs on those premises.</li>
  <li>The movement of any pig onto premises will trigger a 20 day standstill period on any pigs, and a 6 day standstill period for any cattle, sheep and/or goats on those premises.</li>
</ul>

<p>b) The movement of any of the above animals on foot via any premises not occupied by the owner or keeper of those animals will trigger the relevant standstill period (as set out above) on those premises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2) </span> Exemptions</h3>

<h4>a) Moves to markets, collecting centres, shows, breed inspections</h4>
<p>The movement of an animal onto premises licensed under the Animal Gatherings Order 2010 for a sale, show or exhibition, for onward consignment within Great Britain for further rearing, finishing or slaughter or for an inspection to confirm specific breed characteristics will not trigger a standstill period on that premises.</p>

<h4>b) Deer</h4>
<p>The movement of a deer onto premises will not trigger a standstill on any other animal on those premises. The movement onto premises of cattle, sheep, goats or pigs will not trigger a standstill period on any deer on those premises.</p>

<h4>c) Common land</h4>
<p>Animals may move between common grazing and the associated in-bye land occupied by the owner or keeper without observing a standstill period either on the in-bye or common grazing land.</p>

<p>The owner or keeper must have the registered right of common on the common grazing (or equivalent in the case of the New Forest, Epping Forest or the Forest of Dean).</p>

<p>Movements of animals from one common grazing to another do trigger the 6 day standstill period. In addition, animals may return from common grazing land to in-bye land without observing a standstill on the common grazing land.</p>

<p>However, their arrival back at the in-bye land will trigger a 6 day standstill period on the in-bye land which will need to be observed if the returned animals (or any other animals on the in-bye land) are to be moved to anywhere else other than back to the common grazing.</p>

<p>In the case of the movement of a pig to and from common grazing, any standstill period referred to above should be increased to 20 days.</p>

<p>Sheep rounded up from common land by a commoner can be returned from that commoner’s premises to the premises of the owner of the sheep or returned to the common without triggering a 6 day standstill period.</p>

<p>Movements returning sheep to the common land may take place under the relevant General Licence.</p>

<h4>d) Imported animals, animals destined for export and trade with other EU Member States</h4>
<p>Live animals imported from a third country, or live animals moved from another EU Member State will not trigger a standstill at the first premises in England that they are kept at (after the port or airport of entry itself, to which no standstill will apply either).</p>

<p>Livestock being moved to another EU Member State or for export to a third country will have to comply with EU residency time requirements, but (except for sheep and goats to be exported for breeding or fattening) need not respect a standstill on the premises of departure.</p>

<h4>e) Movements to slaughter</h4>
<p>Animals may move off premises direct to a slaughterhouse, slaughter collecting centre, dedicated slaughter collection centre or dedicated slaughter market irrespective of whether livestock have moved onto those premises in the previous 6 days (or 20 days for any pig on premises onto which other pigs have been moved).</p>

<p>From a dedicated slaughter market or dedicated slaughter collection centre, no animal may return to its premises of origin or move to any premises other than a slaughterhouse unless such a move is specifically (individually) licensed by APHA.</p>

<h4>f) Sole Occupancy Authorities</h4>
<p>Movements between premises linked as part of a SOA approved by APHA or its predecessors will not trigger a standstill period on the premises of destination within the SOA and need not respect any standstill period at the premises of departure within the SOA.</p>

<p>But movements onto any of the SOA premises from outside that linked group of premises will prevent movements off any of the SOA premises to premises not linked by the SOA for 6 days (or 20 days for any pigs on premises onto which pigs are moved) unless some other exemption is applicable.</p>

<p>Where a Sole Occupancy Licence (SOL) granted under the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Order 1983 remains in force, these exemptions will also apply but the detailed licence conditions of the existing SOL relating to movements to, from and within a SOL/SOA will continue to apply in full unless application is made for the SOL to be revoked and replaced by a SOA.</p>

<h4>g) Movements for veterinary treatment</h4>

<h4>Movements to</h4>
<p>All animals may move to premises for veterinary diagnosis or treatment and, in the case of goats, for the collection of semen, irrespective of whether livestock have moved onto the premises of origin in the previous 6 or 20 days (as appropriate).</p>

<p>Once at the veterinary treatment centre all animals, except pigs, must be held in complete physical isolation from all other animals present at the premises.</p>

<h4>Movements from</h4>
<p>Premises where veterinary diagnosis or treatment is carried out are not subject to standstill period requirements and all animals (including offspring born at the veterinary premises), other than pigs, may return to the premises of origin without triggering a standstill period on their return to the premises, provided that they have been isolated from other animals whilst undergoing veterinary treatment.</p>

<p>In the case of pigs, a standstill period will not be triggered on return to their premises of origin provided that they are kept in an APHA approved isolation facility for 20 days from their arrival.</p>

<h4>h) Movement to a laboratory for diagnostic tests</h4>
<p>An animal being moved to a laboratory for diagnostic tests to be carried out to ascertain whether the animal is affected by, or has been exposed to, disease need not respect any standstill period on the premises of departure, and will not trigger a standstill period on arrival at the laboratory.</p>

<p>Once at the laboratory all animals, except pigs, must be held in complete physical isolation from all other animals present at the premises.</p>

<h4>i) Movements to and from an Artificial Insemination Centre</h4>

<h4>Movements to</h4>
<p>Sheep and goats moving to an Artificial Insemination (AI) Centre can do so irrespective of whether livestock have moved onto the premises of departure in the previous 6 days provided that they have been in an APHA approved isolation facility for 6 days prior to departure to an AI Centre.</p>

<p>Cattle and pigs moving to an AI centre can do so irrespective of whether livestock have moved onto the premises of departure in the previous 6 or 20 days (as appropriate).</p>

<h4>Movements from</h4>
<p>Premises where AI is carried out are not subject to standstill requirements. Further, cattle can return to their original premises of departure from an AI centre without triggering a standstill on those premises.</p>

<p>If they have been isolated from all other animals while at the AI Centre, sheep and goats can return to their original premises of departure without triggering a standstill provided that they are placed in an APHA approved isolation facility on their return; otherwise they will trigger a standstill.</p>

<p>Pigs can also return to their original premises of departure without triggering a standstill provided that they are placed in an APHA approved isolation facility for 20 days after their return; otherwise they will trigger a standstill.</p>

<p>The collection of semen from goats is subject to the veterinary treatment rules - see g) above.</p>

<h4>j) Exemptions for breeding animals</h4>
<p>Breeding animals in an APHA approved isolation facility must not share the facility with other animals isolated for any other purpose.</p>

<h4>Breeding pigs</h4>
<p>No pig moving for breeding purposes shall trigger a movement standstill on the breeding premises provided that:</p>

<p>a) prior to it being moved, it either respects any movement standstill period on the premises of departure or, alternatively, is isolated for 20 days prior to the movement taking place in an APHA approved isolation facility; or</p>

<p>b) it is placed on arrival in an APHA approved isolation facility;</p>

<p>c) the recipient signs and sends to the local authority a declaration as set out in Part 2 of the General Licence for the movement of pigs that the pig being moved is intended for breeding;</p>

<p>d) it is individually identified;</p>

<p>e) no other pig that has moved onto the breeding premises in the 20 day period beforehand is placed into the APHA approved isolation facility with the pig being moved; and</p>

<p>f) any other pigs placed into the APHA approved isolation facility with the pig being moved shall remain there until the expiry of a 20 day period following the arrival in that facility of the pig being moved.</p>

<p>No pig returning from breeding to its premises of departure shall trigger a 20 day standstill on return if the pig is placed in an APHA approved isolation facility for 20 days after its return, or if both the premises of departure and the home premises are part of a “pyramid” (see paragraph k below) and the “pyramid” authorisation conditions are met.</p>

<h4>Breeding bulls</h4>
<p>For a seasonal period (from 1 August to 30 November every year):</p>

<ul>
  <li>bull/s will be allowed to leave premises that are under a 6 day standstill period for a market, provided that they have been placed in an APHA approved isolation facility for six days beforehand. The sender of the animals being moved must certify (by way of a declaration) that the animals are intended for breeding, are to be sold at market and have been confined in an APHA approved isolation facility for 6 days.</li>
  <li>breeding bull/s will not trigger a 6-day standstill period on their home premises if they are returning unsold from a market, provided that they are placed in an APHA approved isolation facility for six days. To claim the exemption the recipient of the animals being returned must certify (by way of a declaration) that the animals intended for breeding purposes have been confined in an APHA approved isolation facility for 6 days.</li>
  <li>breeding bull/s will not trigger a 6-day standstill period on the premises for breeding that they are being brought onto, provided that they are isolated there for six days in an APHA approved isolation facility. To claim the exemption the recipient of the animals must certify (by way of a declaration) that the animals have been received and been confined in an APHA approved isolation facility for 6 days.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any declaration to claim an exemption from standstill for the movement of breeding bulls must be sent to the Local Authority without undue delay. The form of the declarations for the breeding bulls moves as described above is set out at Part 2 or 3 of the General Licence for Cattle.</p>

<h4>Breeding rams</h4>
<p>For a seasonal period (from 1 August to 30 November every year):</p>

<ul>
  <li>breeding ram/s will be allowed to leave premises that are under a 6 day standstill period for a market, provided that they have been placed in an APHA approved isolation facility for six days beforehand. The sender of the animals being moved must certify (by way of a declaration) that the animals are intended for breeding, are to be sold at market and have been confined in an APHA approved isolation facility for 6 days. 
Any declaration to claim an exemption from standstill for breeding rams moved to a market must be sent to SouthWestern by the dispatching keeper without undue delay.</li>
  <li>breeding ram/s will not trigger a 6-day standstill period on their home premises if they are returning unsold from a market, provided that they are placed in an APHA approved isolation facility for six days. The recipient of the animals being moved must certify by way of a declaration that the animals intended for breeding purposes have been confined in an APHA approved isolation facility for 6 days.</li>
  <li>breeding ram/s will not trigger a 6-day standstill period on the premises for breeding that they are being brought onto, provided that they are isolated for six days in an APHA approved isolation facility. In the case of breeding rams, ewes placed in isolation with those rams will themselves have to spend six days in isolation. The recipient of the animals must certify by way of a declaration that the animals have been received and been confined in an APHA approved isolation facility for 6 days.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any declaration to claim an exemption from standstill for breeding rams moved to a farm (including those return unsold from a market) must be sent to SouthWestern without undue delay accompanying the movement document sent by the receiving keeper to report the move.</p>

<p>The form of the declarations for the breeding ram moves as described above is set out at Part 2 or 3 of the General Licence for sheep and goats.</p>

<p>When reporting the above mentioned moves the sending or receiving keeper as appropriate should tick the relevant box in section 1 of the Arams-1 movement document (‘moving animals from/to an approved isolation facility’).</p>

<h4>Breeding goats</h4>
<p>Breeding goats of either gender will not trigger a 6-day standstill on premises to which they are moved for breeding provided that they are isolated for six days in an APHA approved isolation facility before they leave the premises of origin.</p>

<p>The recipient of the animals must provide SouthWestern without undue delay with a copy of the accompanying movement document a declaration that the animals have been received, are intended for breeding on those premises and that they have been confined in an APHA approved isolation facility for 6 days prior to the move. Goats may return to the same breeding premises during the six day isolation period on their home premises.</p>

<p>The exemption for breeding goats is applied all year round and is not seasonal.</p>

<p>The form of the declaration for the breeding goat moves as described above is set out at Part 4 of the General Licence for sheep and goats.</p>

<p>The declaration made by the receiving keeper must accompany the movement document used to report the move.</p>

<p>When reporting the above mentioned moves the sending keeper should tick the relevant box in section 1 of the Arams-1 movement document (‘moving animals from/to an approved isolation facility’).</p>

<h4>k) Exemption for pig holdings approved under PRIMO</h4>
<p>Movements as referred to in Article 21 of the Pigs (Records, Identification and Movement) Order 2011, i.e. “pyramid” movements where the pig is intended for breeding or growing, and both origin and destination premises are approved by a veterinary inspector including authorisation of that combination of origin and destination premises.</p>

<p>Such animals need not respect any 20-day standstill period on the premises of departure and will not trigger a standstill period upon their arrival.</p>

<h4>l) Movements to and from shows</h4>

<h4>Pigs</h4>
<p>Pigs moving to or from shows, exhibitions, for breeding purposes, or a semen collection centre must be individually identified.</p>

<p>Pigs may move to a show without respecting standstill on the premises of departure provided they are individually identified and kept in an APHA-approved isolation facility for the 20 days prior to departure for the show.</p>

<p>Pigs may return from a show to the premises from which they departed for the show without triggering a movement standstill on those premises provided they are kept for 20 days after their arrival in an APHA approved isolation facility. Pigs must not share isolation facilities with other species. They may however go to another show within that period.</p>

<h4>Cattle, sheep and goats</h4>
<p>Cattle, sheep and goats may attend shows without having to observe a movement standstill period on the premises of departure, provided that they have been isolated from all other non-show animals on their premises of departure in an APHA approved isolation facility for 6 days before attending the show.</p>

<p>On return to the premises of departure, the cattle, sheep and goats must be kept in an APHA approved isolation facility for 6 days. If they are not kept in such a facility for that period then a 6 day standstill will be imposed on that premises.</p>

<p>Cattle, sheep and goats may return to their premises of departure between shows and move to a further show within 6 days provided that they are kept in an APHA approved isolation facility on those premises throughout the period they are there.</p>

<p>Alternatively, cattle, sheep and goats can move direct from one show to another without triggering a movement standstill period.</p>

<h2>Annex B: multiple pick-ups/drop-offs</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>There are no restrictions on multiple pick-ups and drop-offs for loads solely consisting of deer, save that the cleansing and disinfection provisions set out in the Transport of Animals (Cleansing and Disinfection) (England) (No. 3) Order 2003 must be complied with.</p>

<p>The following multiple pick-ups and drop-offs will be permitted for all movements of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs under each licence (and of any of these species combined with deer in a single load), subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p>(a) An unlimited number of pick-ups can be made delivering to a single destination, and an unlimited number of drop-offs can be made delivering from a single starting point (which may be a market);</p>

<p>(b) there must always be a single destination for multiple pick-ups, except that in loads involving multiple pick-ups, animals may be delivered to more than one slaughterhouse (but not any other type of premises);</p>

<p>(c) other than for deliveries to slaughterhouses (see (b) above), multiple pick-ups and multiple drop-offs cannot be combined in one trip;</p>

<p>(d) one or more pick ups from a market of any description or a collecting centre are permitted only in journeys involving movements to a slaughterhouse, but only where the market(s) and/or collecting centre(s) is/are the last premises from which animals is picked up before reaching the slaughterhouse. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Farm, Farm, Farm, Market, Market  Slaughterhouse, Slaughterhouse or</li>
  <li>Farm, Farm, Farm, Farm, Market  Slaughterhouse or</li>
  <li>Farm, Farm, Collecting Centre, Market, Collecting Centre  Slaughterhouse; Slaughterhouse</li>
</ul>

<p>e) where a chain of locations are visited in a multiple move resulting in the slaughter of animals, the entire move can only take place if the slaughterhouse/slaughterhouses is/are the final destination/destinations in the chain.</p>

<p>(f) all multiple pick-ups and drop-offs must take place on the periphery of premises using the approved methods described below.</p>

<p>(g) animals of more than one species may travel in a single vehicle at any one time.</p>

<p>(h) where the animals are travelling under individual licence, each batch of animals (i.e. the animals from each of the premises at which the vehicle loads) must be accompanied by a separate licence.</p>

<p>N.B. Stops to pick up or drop off livestock are not considered to be scheduled stops, the provisions for which are set out separately at Annex C.</p>

<h3>Multiple pick-offs</h3>

<ol>
  <li>One of the following methods must be used:</li>
</ol>

<h4>(a) Tailgating</h4>
<p>The animals to be picked up should be loaded on to a farm trailer at the farm. The farm trailer must be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected in accordance with the Transport of Animals (Cleansing and Disinfection) (England) (No. 3) Order 2003 since last being used.</p>

<p>Transfer to the collection vehicle must take place close to the perimeter boundary entrance of the premises but not on a public road.</p>

<p>The collection vehicle used to transport the animals will arrive at the farm, near to the farm entrance and park up on a suitable hard standing surface. The tailgate will be dropped and the farm trailer will reverse and drop its tailgate on top of the collection vehicle’s tailgate.</p>

<p>Before starting the transfer of animals, suitable hurdles/barriers/gates will be put in place to stop the animals escaping.</p>

<h4>(b) Use of pens</h4>

<p>Two pens will need to be erected and have an inter-connecting gate.</p>

<p>Pen 1 must be big enough to hold a large animal transporter. This pen will also need to have a hard standing surface i.e. concrete, so that the area can be properly cleansed and disinfected using an approved disinfectant after each use.</p>

<p>Pen 2 can have a soft surface i.e. grass and will be used to hold the animals prior to loading, and must have an inter-connecting gate with Pen 1. This facility must be located close to the entrance/boundary of the premises. The farmer will walk the animals being picked up into Pen 2.</p>

<p>The transporter will drive/ reverse into Pen 1. Once the collection vehicle is inside Pen 1, the gates must be closed before both the tailgate and the interconnecting gate of both pens are opened to start the loading of the animals. The hard standing surface and the pen structure themselves must be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected using an approved disinfectant after use.</p>

<p>N.B. The need for a Pen 1 facility to enclose the transporter does not apply where there are specialist secure loading facilities at the perimeter boundary of the farm e.g. the side doors and ramp of the vehicle are flush with the gates of the loading area to prevent animals from escaping.</p>

<h4>(c) Temporary pens</h4>

<p>The pen will be erected just outside the animal shed but on the periphery of the premises. The equipment/materials used to construct the pen and the surface on which it stands should first be cleansed and disinfected.</p>

<p>The surface must be made of impermeable material such as concrete or tarmac. The transporter will reverse into the pen and the pen’s gates closed to make an animal proof enclosure before the vehicle’s tailgate/tailboard is lowered. The animals are moved from the shed into the pen and loaded from there into the transporter.</p>

<p>The transporter is made secure and then leaves after cleansing and disinfection of tailgate/tailboard, wheels, wheel arches and tyres. All the equipment used to construct the pen, and the ground on which it stands, must again be cleansed and disinfected. The pen may then be dismantled.</p>

<h3>Multiple drop-offs</h3>

<ol>
  <li>One of the following methods must be used:</li>
</ol>

<h4>(a) Tailgating</h4>

<p>The drop off must take place at a place close to the perimeter boundary entrance of the premises, but not on a public road. The transporter dropping off the animals will arrive at the farm, near to the farm entrance, and park up on a suitable hard standing surface. The tailgate will be dropped and the farm trailer will reverse and drop its tailgate on top of the vehicle transporter’s tailgate. Before starting to transfer the consignment of animals, suitable hurdles/barriers/gates will be put in place to stop the animals escaping.</p>

<h4>(b) Use of pens</h4>

<p>Two pens will need to be erected and have an interconnecting gate.</p>

<p>Pen 1 must be big enough to hold a large animal transporter. This pen will also need to have a hard standing surface i.e. concrete, so that the area can be properly cleansed and disinfected using an approved disinfectant after each use.</p>

<p>Pen 2 can have a soft surface i.e. grass and will be used as an area to hold the animals after unloading, and must have an interconnecting gate with Pen 1. This facility must be located close to the entrance /boundary of the premises.</p>

<p>The transporter will drive/reverse into Pen 1. Once the transporter is inside Pen 1, the gates must be closed before both the tailgate and the interconnecting gate of both pens is opened to start unloading the animals.</p>

<p>Once the animals have been unloaded into Pen 2, the inter-connecting gate should be closed. The farmer will walk the animals that have been dropped off out of Pen 2 onto the farm premises. The hard standing surface and the pen structure themselves must also be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected using an approved disinfectant after use.</p>

<p>N.B. The need for a Pen 1 facility to enclose the transporter does not apply where there are specialist secure loading facilities at the perimeter boundary of the farm e.g. the side doors and ramp of the vehicle are flush with the gates of the loading area to prevent animals from escaping.</p>

<h4>(c) Temporary pens</h4>

<p>The pen will be erected just outside the animal shed but on the periphery of the premises. The equipment/materials used to construct the pen and the surface on which it stands should first be cleansed and disinfected.</p>

<p>The surface must be made of impermeable material such as concrete or tarmac. The transporter will reverse into the pen and the pen’s gates closed to make an animal proof enclosure before the vehicle’s tailgate/tailboard is lowered. The animals are unloaded from the transporter into the pen and moved from there into the animal shed.</p>

<p>The transporter is made secure and then leaves after cleansing and disinfection of tailgate/tailboard, wheels, wheel arches and tyres. All the equipment used to construct the pen, and the ground on which it stands, must again be cleansed and disinfected. The pen may then be dismantled.</p>

<h3>Multiple pick-ups/drop offs at markets and collecting centres</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Animals may be loaded/unloaded at any suitable point in a market or collecting centre premises approved under the relevant Animal Gatherings Order. Once all the animals have been unloaded, the vehicle being used to transport the animals must be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected using an approved disinfectant in accordance with the Transport of Animals (Cleansing and Disinfection) (England) (No. 3) Order 2003.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Annex C: scheduled stops conditions</h2>

<p>Scheduled stops will be permitted under the following conditions:</p>

<p>(a) the scheduled stop must be at one of the following:</p>

<p>i) Motorway service station;</p>

<p>ii) Official lay-by (on a trunk/main road);</p>

<p>iii) Lorry park or similar place;</p>

<p>(b) the vehicle must be parked on a hard standing;</p>
