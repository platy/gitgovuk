All GP practices in England whose IT systems are supplied by TPP or EMIS
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>11 February 2022</p>

<p>The health and social care system is taking extensive action to manage and mitigate the spread and impact of the current outbreak of COVID-19. Today, I am writing to GP practices in England, whose IT systems are supplied by The Phoenix Partnership (<abbr title="The Phoenix Partnership">TPP</abbr>) or Egton Medical Information Systems (<abbr title="Egton Medical Information Systems">EMIS</abbr>), under Regulation 3(4) of <abbr title="Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002">COPI</abbr> to require them to release primary care patient data, in respect of UK Biobank’s consented participants only, to UK Biobank, for the purposes set out in Regulation 3(1) of <abbr title="Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002">COPI</abbr>.</p>

<p>This notice requires all GP practices, whose IT systems are supplied by <abbr title="The Phoenix Partnership">TPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Egton Medical Information Systems">EMIS</abbr>, to instruct them to release the relevant primary care data to UK Biobank for purposes related to the outbreak of COVID-19.</p>

<p>If no further notice is sent to you by me, this notice will expire on 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>Purposes related to the outbreak of COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understanding COVID-19 and risks to public health, trends in COVID-19 and such risks, and controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 and such risks</li>
  <li>identifying and understanding information about patients or potential patients with or at risk of COVID-19, information about incidents of patient exposure to COVID-19 and the management of patients with or at risk of COVID-19 including: locating, contacting, screening, flagging and monitoring such patients and collecting information about and providing services in relation to testing, diagnosis, self-isolation, fitness to work, treatment, medical and social interventions and recovery from COVID-19</li>
  <li>understanding information about patient access to health services and adult social care services and the need for wider care of patients and vulnerable groups as a direct or indirect result of COVID-19 and the availability and capacity of those services or that care</li>
  <li>monitoring and managing the response to COVID-19 by health and social care bodies and the government including providing information to the public about COVID-19 and its effectiveness and information about capacity, medicines, equipment, supplies, services and the workforce within the health services and adult social care services</li>
  <li>delivering services and information to patients, clinicians, the health services and adult social care services workforce and the public about and in connection with COVID-19, including the provision of information, fit notes and the provision of healthcare and adult social care services</li>
  <li>research and planning in relation to COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>A record should be kept of all data processed under this notice.</p>

<h2>Why we are doing this</h2>

<p>UK Biobank has explicit consent from all its c.500,000 participants to be provided with, hold and process their healthcare records (both primary and secondary).</p>

<p>UK Biobank has secured frequent feeds from UK Health Security Agency for the confirmed COVID-19 cases and these data will be incorporated into the main UK Biobank database for researchers to study determinants of COVID-19 infection. However, as the COVID-19 situation worsens it is likely that many presumed cases will not be tested (especially among the elderly) and many individuals will remain at home (even when their symptoms are severe).</p>

<p>Consequently, the ability of UK Biobank to be able also to incorporate primary care data into its resource is likely to be of enormous value to obtain a more complete assessment of the determinants of COVID-19 outcomes. This is something that we need to continue to do now.</p>

<h2>Key points</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the validity of UK Biobank’s participant consent for this purpose has been reviewed and endorsed by the Information Commissioner’s Office</li>
  <li>only primary care data from UK Biobank’s consented participants will be extracted</li>
  <li>the proposed extraction is fully consistent with the provisions of the UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>UK Biobank only release de-identified data to its approved researchers (for the conduct of health-related research, relating to COVID-19 in this case, which is in the public interest) and so patient confidentiality is maintained</li>
  <li>the extraction will relate to the primary care coded data, including data on diagnoses (important for co-morbidities), on prescriptions (important for drug interactions) and on investigations (for pathology reports)</li>
  <li>following the instruction provided above, there is no further action that any GP practice needs to undertake</li>
  <li>this notice is limited to those GP practices whose IT systems are supplied by <abbr title="The Phoenix Partnership">TPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Egton Medical Information Systems">EMIS</abbr> because UK Biobank has appropriate agreements in place with these companies</li>
</ul>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>Simon Madden<br></p>

<p>On behalf of:<br>
Secretary of State for Health and Social Care</p>
