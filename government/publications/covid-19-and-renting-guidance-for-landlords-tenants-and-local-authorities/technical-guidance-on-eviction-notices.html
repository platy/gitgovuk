<h2>Coronavirus Act 2020 and renting</h2>

<h3>Technical guidance for landlords on the provisions of the Coronavirus Act 2020</h3>

<p>Non statutory guidance for landlords in the private and social rented sectors on the measures relating to notices seeking possession modified by the Coronavirus Act 2020. The measures affect most residential possession processes, the chief processes being notices under:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Section 21 Housing Act 1988 (Assured Shorthold Tenancies)</li>
  <li>Section 8 Housing Act 1988 (Assured and Assured Shorthold Tenancies)</li>
  <li>Section 83 Housing Act 1985 (Secure Tenancies)</li>
</ol>

<p>The measures also affect notices in relation to less common forms of tenancy under the 1988 and 1985 Acts, and notices under the Rent Act 1977. This guidance does not address these less common forms of tenancy.</p>

<p>All landlords reading this guidance should also read our advice on possession proceedings during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<p>The guidance in this document applies to England.</p>

<h2>Possession proceedings during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</h2>

<p>This guidance sets out the main modifications that the Coronavirus Act, as amended, makes to the notice requirements for a landlord seeking possession of their property under section 83 of the Housing Act 1985 and sections 8 and 21 of the Housing Act 1988. It sets out how  landlords should give notice under those provisions and the forms they should use. (See Section 81 and Schedule 29 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 as amended by the Coronavirus Act 2020 (Residential Tenancies: Protection from Eviction) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020), the Coronavirus Act 2020 (Residential Tenancies: Protection from Eviction) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2021), and the Coronavirus Act 2020 (Residential Tenancies: Protection from Eviction) (Amendment) (England) (No. 2) Regulations 2021.</p>

<p>The government made regulations extending the provisions of the Coronavirus Act 2020, meaning that from 29 August 2020 until 31 May 2021 landlords will not be able to start possession proceedings in most circumstances unless they have given their tenants six months’ notice. Shorter notice periods will apply to certain cases where the landlord wants to evict the tenant because of rent arrears of six months or more, anti-social behaviour (including rioting), certain cases of domestic abuse in the social sector, false statement, where the tenant has passed away or where the tenant doesn’t have the right to rent under immigration legislation.</p>

<p>From 1 June 2021, notice periods will be four months in most circumstances, including for cases where there are less than four months of unpaid rent. Notice periods for the most serious cases, as set out above, will remain lower. Notice periods for cases where there are less than four months of unpaid rent, will further reduce to two months’ notice from 1 August. Landlords seeking possession on the grounds of the death of the tenant, or that their tenant has ‘no right to rent’ should note that the minimum notice periods for these grounds will also return to their pre-COVID levels from 1 June 2021 of two months and two weeks respectively.</p>

<h2>Section 21 notices requiring possession of a property under an assured shorthold tenancy</h2>

<p>Landlords can only use a Section 21 notice to ask their tenants to leave their property:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the notice expires at or after the end of the fixed term.</li>
  <li>During a tenancy with no fixed end date - known as a ‘periodic’ tenancy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section 21 notices issued between 29 August 2020 and 31 May 2021 must give tenants at least six months’ notice that the landlord requires possession, and those issued on or after 1 June 2021 must give tenants at least four months’ notice.</p>

<p>Where a landlord gives a tenant a valid Section 21 notice  between 29 August 2020 and 31 May 2021 inclusive, the notice will be valid for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 months from the date it is given to the tenant, where Section 21(4D) applies; or</li>
  <li>4 months from the date specified in the notice as the date after which possession is required, if Section 21(4E) applies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a landlord gives a tenant a valid Section 21 notice on or after 1 June 2021, the notice will be valid for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>8 months from the date it is given to the tenant, where Section 21 (4D) applies; or</li>
  <li>4 months from the date specified in the notice as the date after which possession is required, if Section 21 (4E) applies.</li>
</ul>

<p>A landlord cannot use a Section 21 notice if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is less than 4 months since the tenancy started.</li>
  <li>The property is a house in multiple occupation and requires a licence under Part 2 of the Housing Act 2004 S55 and that licence has not been obtained. Unless a temporary exemption applies, an application for a licence has been made and is still effective or the landlord has notified their local authority that they are seeking a temporary exemption and that notification is still effective. (This applies even if a licence application or notification could not be made due to COVID-19 outbreak).</li>
  <li>The property is other residential accommodation and requires a licence under Part 3 of the Housing Act 2004 S79 and that licence has not been obtained. Unless a temporary exemption applies, an application for a licence has been made and is still effective or the landlord has notified their local authority that they are seeking a temporary exemption and that notification is still effective (this applies even if a licence application or notification could not be made due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak).</li>
  <li>The tenancy was granted on or after 6 April 2007 or is a statutory periodic tenancy that arose on or after that date and the landlord has not complied with the relevant <a href="https://www.gov.uk/deposit-protection-schemes-and-landlords" class="govuk-link">tenant deposit protection legislation.</a>
</li>
  <li>The council has served an improvement notice or an emergency remedial notice in the last 6 months.</li>

</ul>

<p>For tenancies granted on or after 1 October 2015, a landlord also cannot use a Section 21 notice if they have not given their tenants copies of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the property’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/buy-sell-your-home/energy-performance-certificates">Energy Performance Certificate</a>.</li>
  <li>a current Landlord Gas Safety Record (if the property has gas appliances installed).</li>

</ul>

<h2>Giving tenants a Section 21 notice</h2>

<p>Landlords must use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/assured-tenancy-forms#form-6a">Form 6A</a> if the tenancy was started or renewed after 30 September 2015.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/assured-tenancy-forms#form-6a">Form 6a</a> has been amended to reflect the changes to possession procedures which come into force on 1 June 2021 and it is available on the gov.uk assured tenancies forms webpage from 1 June. In particular, it states that where the notice is issued on or after 1 June 2021, tenants are entitled to at least four months’ notice before the landlord is able to apply to the court for a possession order. The Form 6A referring to the six-month notice period requirement can only be used for notices issued on and before 31 May 2021.</p>

<p>If the tenants do not leave the property by the date specified on the form as the date after which possession is required, the landlord can apply to the court, within the period for which the notice remains valid, for a possession order using either the standard possession process or the accelerated possession process.</p>

<h2>Section 8 notices seeking possession of a property under an assured or assured shorthold tenancy</h2>

<p>To give tenants a Section 8 notice that the landlord intends to seek possession using a ground in schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1988, a landlord must fill in Form 3 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/assured-tenancy-forms#form-3">-&nbsp; ‘Notice seeking possession of a property let on an assured tenancy or an assured agricultural occupancy’</a>.</p>

<p>Form 3 has been amended to reflect the changes to possession procedures made by the new regulations. The amended form now makes it clear that court proceedings cannot begin earlier than 4 months from the date the notice is served except in certain serious cases. These include those in relation to anti-social behaviour (including rioting), certain cases of domestic abuse in the social sector, false statement, where a tenant has accrued rent arrears to the value of at least 4 months’ rent, where the tenant has passed away and where the tenant does not have the right to rent under immigration legislation. The table below illustrates the notice periods now required for the different grounds.</p>

<p>Landlords need to specify in the notice the specific grounds they are using to seek possession of the property. The table below sets out the minimum notice a landlord needs to provide depending on which ground is being used.</p>

<p>If the case involves anti-social behaviour, and ground 14 or ground 7A is being relied upon, then the notice period for those grounds will apply even if other grounds are also being used.</p>

<p>Where the landlord relies on multiple grounds (but not ground 14 or ground 7A) the notice required will be the higher of the notice periods relevant to those grounds.</p>

<p>Where the landlord is seeking possession on grounds 1, 2, 5 to 7A, 9 or 16 (without ground 14) court proceedings also cannot begin before the date on which the tenancy (had it not been assured) could have been brought to an end by a notice to quit served at the same time as the notice.</p>

<p>The validity of Section 8 notices remains unchanged by the Coronavirus Act 2020. Section 8 notices continue to be valid for 12 months after they are served.</p>

<p>Landlords can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/standard-possession-orders" class="govuk-link">apply to the court for a possession order</a> if the tenants do not leave by the date specified in the form as the earliest date on which possession proceedings can be brought.</p>

<h2>Notices under section 83 of the Housing Act 1985 seeking possession of a property let under a secure tenancy</h2>

<h2>Part I – Secure Periodic Tenancies</h2>

<p>To give tenants notice that the landlord intends to seek possession of a secure periodic tenancy, a&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;must fill in&nbsp;this form - ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/secure-tenancy-forms" class="govuk-link">Part I Notice of Possession under section 83 of the Housing Act 1985’.</a></p>

<p>The form has been amended to reflect the changes to possession procedures following the new regulations under the Coronavirus Act 2020.</p>

<p>A new version of Form 6a which has been amended to reflect the changes to possession procedures coming into force on 1 June will be made available on the gov.uk assured tenancies forms webpage from 1 June. The amended form will make clear that for notices issued on or after 1 June 2021, tenants are entitled to at least four months’ notice before a landlord is able to apply to the court for a possession order.</p>

<p>The existing Form 6a referring to the six-month notice period  requirement will remain available until 1 June 2021 and should be used for notices issued before this time.</p>

<p>Landlords need to specify in the notice the specific grounds they are using to seek possession of the property. The table below sets out how much notice a landlord needs to provide depending on which ground they use.</p>

<p>This includes where possession is being sought on Ground 2 of Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985.  Where that is the case, the notice period associated with Ground 2 will apply even where any of the other grounds are also being used.</p>

<p>Where the landlord relies on multiple grounds (but not ground 2) the minimum notice required will be the higher of the notice periods relevant to those grounds.</p>

<p>Landlords can apply to the court for a possession order if the tenants do not leave by the specified date.</p>

<h2>Part II – Secure Tenancies for A Fixed Term</h2>

<p>To give tenants notice that the landlord intends to seek possession of a secure tenancy for a fixed term (that contains a provision which allows a landlord to bring it to an end before the fixed term expires), a&nbsp;landlord&nbsp;must fill in&nbsp;this form - ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/secure-tenancy-forms" class="govuk-link">Part II Notice of Seeking Termination of Tenancy and Recovery of Possession under section 83 of the Housing Act 1985’</a></p>

<p>The form has been amended to reflect the changes to possession procedures following the new regulations under the Coronavirus Act 2020. The amended form now makes it clear that court proceedings cannot begin earlier than 6 months from the date the notice is served except in certain serious cases. These include those in relation to anti-social behaviour (including rioting), certain cases of domestic abuse, false statement and where a tenant has accrued rent arrears to the value of over 6 months’ rent. The Table below illustrates the notice periods now required for the different grounds.</p>

<p>Landlords need to specify on the notice the specific grounds they are using to seek possession of the property. The table below sets out how much notice a landlord needs to provide depending on which ground they use.</p>

<p>Where the anti-social behaviour ground, ground 2 is being relied upon, the notice period associated with that ground will apply even where any of the other grounds are also being used.</p>

<p>Landlords can apply to the court for a possession order if the tenants do not leave by the specified date.</p>

<h3>Minimum notice period lengths under Section 83 of the Housing Act 1985</h3>

<p><strong>Legislation:</strong> Section 83, Housing Act 1985 / For grounds see Schedule 2 to the Act / Applicable to secure tenancies</p>

<h2>A note on making alterations to the prescribed forms</h2>

<p>The wording in these forms has been carefully drafted to ensure that the person on whom it is served may understand what is being proposed and what they may do in response. Legislation requires you to use the prescribed form, or a form substantially to the same effect. Failure to serve the correct form may mean the Court will not grant a possession order. You should not alter the wording in these forms unless a form says you may do so. If you alter the wording, the form may be invalidated. You must also comply with any notice periods set out in the form.</p>
