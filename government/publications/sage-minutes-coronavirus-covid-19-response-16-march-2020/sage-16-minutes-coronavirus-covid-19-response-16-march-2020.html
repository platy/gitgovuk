<p>Participants who were observers and government officials were not consistently recorded therefore this may not be the complete list.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>1. On the basis of accumulating data, including on <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> critical care capacity, the advice from <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> has changed regarding the speed of implementation of additional interventions.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> advises that there is clear evidence to support additional social distancing measures be introduced as soon as possible.</p>

<p>3. These additional measures will need to be accompanied by a significant increase in testing and the availability of near real-time data flows to understand their impacts.</p>

<p>4. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> will further review at its next meeting whether, in the light of new data, school closures may also be required to prevent <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> capacity being exceeded.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> did not review the work on intermittent application of measures nationally or geographically in detail but will do so.</p>

<h2>Situation update</h2>

<p>6. London has the greatest proportion of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> outbreak. It is possible that London has both community and nosocomial transmission (such as in hospitals).</p>

<p>7. It is possible that there are 5,000 to 10,000 new cases per day in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> (great uncertainty around this estimate).</p>

<p>8. <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> cases may be doubling in number every 5 to 6 days.</p>

<p>9. The risk of one person within a household passing the infection to others within the household is estimated to increase during household isolation, from 50% to 70%.</p>

<h2>Behavioural and social interventions</h2>

<p>10. The objective is to avoid critical cases exceeding <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> intensive care and other respiratory support bed capacity. The figures for capacity are now clear but intensive care bed capacity will increase by 20% or more.</p>

<p>11. It is vital to understand numbers of cases regionally relative to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> capacity, to know where local more stringent interventions might need to be introduced.</p>

<p>12. With sufficient interventions (assuming they are implemented and adopted effectively for a sufficient period of time), modelling indicates it may be possible to keep cases below the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>’s critical and respiratory care capacity.</p>

<p>13. The science suggests additional social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible.</p>

<p>14. Compliance with the measures by the public is key.</p>

<p>15. It is expected to take two to three weeks before the impacts of measures are observed (this needs to be monitored carefully and the appropriate metrics need to be in place).</p>

<p>16. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> cannot be certain that the measures being considered by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Government">HMG</abbr> will be sufficient to push demand for critical care below <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> capacity but they may get very close under the <abbr title="Reasonable Worst Case">RWC</abbr> scenario.</p>

<p>17. While <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr>’s view remains that school closures constitutes one of the less effective single measure to reduce the epidemic peak, it may nevertheless become necessary to introduce school closures in order to push demand for critical care below <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> capacity. However school closures could increase the risks of transmission at smaller gatherings and for more vulnerable groups as well as impacting on key workers including <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff. As such it was agreed that further analysis and modelling of potential school closures was required (demand or supply, and effects on spread).</p>

<p>18. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> agreed that its advice on interventions should be based on what the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> needs and what modelling of those interventions suggests, not on the (limited) evidence on whether the public will comply with the interventions in sufficient numbers and over time.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>DHSC to compile numbers – to be updated daily – of cases regionally, set against local NHS ventilator and ICU capacity; SPI-M to check approach meets their needs; the data on epidemic growth and ventilator or ICU capacity need to be linked to predict areas of potential pressure (this model should be owned within DHSC or NHS – CMO has asked Clara Swinson)</li>
  <li>SPI-M to coordinate further rapid modelling of school closures taking account of key factors and at risk groups</li>
  <li>DfE to work with DHSC and PHE on specific guidance for schools and universities, including personal hygiene measures and methods to apply social distancing within these settings building on what has been done elsewhere (for example Singapore)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> testing</h2>

<p>19. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> highlighted the critical importance of scaling up antibody serology and diagnostic testing to managing the epidemic. A solution is urgently required, with a plan for implementation.</p>

<p>20. Antibody testing is particularly vital to address the central unknown question of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases.</p>

<p>21. <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> explained how testing is being scaled up over the coming weeks to 10,000 per day – focused on intensive care units, hospital admissions and key workers.</p>

<p>22. <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> is urgently assessing commercial self-test options, with accuracy a key criterion.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>PHE to update SAGE on the efficacy and feasibility of rolling out a rapid home swab test for antigens, including the mechanism for collection (for next meeting)</li>
  <li>PHE to develop a proposal for ramping up antibody serology and diagnostic testing capacity, seeking input from DSTL and the National Laboratories Alliance</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Data flows</h2>

<p>23. Close to real-time, high-quality data are important to the strategy the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is pursuing. All options to get this data flow need to be considered. <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> are arranging a workshop as soon as possible to discuss and make this happen. Duplication of effort on this needs to be avoided.</p>

<p>24. Duplication of effort also needs to be avoided on other data requirements, for example for measuring public behaviour (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> will coordinate efforts on this).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Action</h3>

<ul>
  <li>DHSC, NHSE and PHE to urgently work with NHSX and GO-Science on a data strategy, ensuring there is access to real time data to track the UK epidemic and that is delivered in a form of use to operational leads, SAGE and COBR</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Publication of <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> papers and other materials</h2>

<p>25. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> agreed to publish a chronological set of papers and other documents which have informed the questions it has considered and its advice to date.</p>

<p>26. It is important to demonstrate the uncertainties scientists have faced, how understanding of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> has developed over time, and the science behind the advice at each stage.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Action</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SAGE secretariat to explore option of launching release of SAGE materials at Science Media Centre, involving several SAGE participants</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Next meeting of <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr>
</h2>

<p>27. The next meeting will revisit the effects of school closures (including impact on epidemic curve, behavioural effects, workforce consequences).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SAGE to discuss at its next meeting how school closures could affect NHS critical care capacity, considering in particular:
    <ul>
      <li>additional epidemiological benefits of school and university closures over and above HMG measures to be announced (SPI-M)</li>
      <li>effects of closing schools before Easter holidays vs not reopening schools after Easter holidays (SPI-M)</li>
      <li>effects of partial school closures (for example allowing attendance for children of key workers only) and internal social distancing measures within schools (as per Singapore) (SPI-M)</li>
      <li>whether the health benefits of school closures could be outweighed by the effects of children being looked after by grandparent or childminders, and or pupils interacting socially in other locations (SPI-M and SPI-B)</li>
      <li>impacts of school closures on NHS staffing (including respiratory trained) (NHS)</li>
      <li>alternatives to closure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
