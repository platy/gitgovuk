<h2>
<span class="number">1 Rule </span> 6 Status</h2>

<p>1.1. There are two sets of Inquiry Procedure Rules which may be relevant to the appeal you are interested in:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2685/contents/made" rel="external">The Town and Country Planning (Enforcement)(Determination by Inspectors) (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2002 (Statutory Instrument 2002/2685)</a> - These are used where the appeal will be decided by an Inspector on behalf of the Secretary of State. This will be the case for almost all appeals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2686/contents/made" rel="external">The Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2002 (Statutory Instrument 2002/2686)</a> - These are used where the appeal will be decided by the Secretary of State.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Rule 6 status refers to rule 6 (6) of the Inquiry Procedure Rules for appeals determined by an Inspector (rule 8 of the rules for appeals determined by the Secretary of State).</p>

<p>1.2. Rule 6(6) states that:</p>

<p>“The Secretary of State may in writing require any other person, who has notified him on an intention or wish to appear at an inquiry, to serve -</p>

<p>a. 3 copies of their statement of case to him within 4 weeks of being so required</p>

<p>b. in the case of an enforcement appeal, simultaneously, a copy of their statement of case on any person specified by the Secretary of State</p>

<p>and the Secretary of State shall, as soon as practicable after receipt, send a copy of each such statement of case to the Local Planning Authority (<abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>) and to the applicant/appellant”.</p>

<p>1.3. From this extract, you will see that Rule 6 parties have the responsibility to send us a statement of case (see section 3). They also have rights which are explained in this guide.</p>

<p>1.4. With rule 6 status you will be considered a main party. You will be sent copies of the documents sent to us by the other main parties - the appellant (the person making the appeal), the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> and any other Rule 6 parties. You will be entitled to appear at the inquiry and to ‘cross- examine’ other parties (to question witnesses about their evidence).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> How to apply for rule 6 status</h2>

<p>2.1. If you wish to take a very active part in an inquiry you should write to our case officer requesting rule 6 status.  However, to avoid making the inquiry too repetitive, we encourage participants with similar views to group together and choose a spokesperson to appear at the inquiry on the group’s behalf.  You should state who you are representing (for example, a parish council or local community group), why you want rule 6 status and briefly explain what you can bring to the inquiry that another party may not. It is unusual for rule 6 status to be granted to individuals.</p>

<p>2.2. Rule 6 parties can offer significant value to inquiries. However, this is only the case where rule 6 parties add substantively to the case being made by the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> or the appellant.</p>

<p>2.3. Depending on whether you oppose or support the appeal you may wish to consult the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> or the appellant to find out what their position will be at the inquiry. This will help you to decide whether your position can be satisfactorily represented by them. If this is the case, you would not need to ask us for rule 6 status.</p>

<p>2.4. We will review your request and decide whether rule 6 status will be granted in line with the considerations in 2.1 - 2.3.</p>

<p>2.5. Please see the following for the full inquiry timetable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>[8.4 in the Enforcement Appeals Procedural Guide]https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide/procedural-guide-enforcement-notice-appeals-england#the-procedures) if you are interested in an enforcement notice appeal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/certificate-of-lawful-use-or-development-appeals-procedural-guide/procedural-guide-certificate-of-lawful-use-or-development-appeals-england#the-procedures">7.4 in the Lawful Development Certificate (<abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr>) Appeals Procedural Guide</a> if you are interested in an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appeal</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is very important for all parties to keep to the timetable for the receipt of documents. You may wish to familiarise yourself with the content of the relevant Procedural Guide depending on whether you are interested in an enforcement appeal or a lawful development certificate appeal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3 Statement </span> of case</h2>

<p>3.1. We will instruct Rule 6 parties to send us a statement of case, usually within 4 weeks of the date of our letter which grants rule 6 status.</p>

<p>3.2. In your statement of case, you will need to give full details of the case you will put forward at the inquiry.  You must list any documents, including maps and plans, to which you intend to refer or use in evidence. Although you only have to list documents at this stage, it would be helpful if you supplied copies with your statement of case. Please see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">8.4.9 in the Enforcement Appeals Procedural Guide</a> if you are interested in an enforcement notice appeal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/certificate-of-lawful-use-or-development-appeals-procedural-guide">7.4.9 in the Lawful Development Certificate (<abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr>) Appeals Procedural Guide</a> if you are interested in an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appeal</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>for further information on what to include in your statement of case.</p>

<p>3.3. You must send us one copy of your statement of case for the Inspector and one each for the appellant, the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> and any other Rule 6 parties. On larger inquiries where 2 Inspectors are appointed, or where an additional copy of documents is required for the Secretary of State, we will ask you to provide 2 copies for the Inspectors.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4 Statement </span> of common ground</h2>

<p>4.1. The appellant and the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> must jointly prepare a statement of common ground. This should list all agreed matters and should include basic facts such as the site description, area, planning history, relevant planning policies, and as many other matters as possible relating to the appeal site.</p>

<p>4.2. The statement of common ground must be received by us no later than 4 weeks before the start date of the inquiry.</p>

<p>4.3. With the agreement of the appellant and the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>, rule 6 parties can also agree a statement of common ground. This will establish those matters which are agreed with the main parties, which means that the inquiry can then focus on the issues which are in dispute.  If you wish to do this, you should contact the appellant and the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> at the earliest opportunity - even if this is before you have asked us for Rule 6 status.</p>

<p>4.4. If there is more than one rule 6 party, it can also be helpful if they can jointly produce a statement of common ground.</p>

<p>4.5. For further information on statements of common ground please see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>8.4.13 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">Enforcement Appeals Procedural Guide</a> if you are interested in an enforcement notice appeal</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5 Proofs </span> of evidence</h2>

<p>5.1. A proof of evidence is the document containing the written evidence about which a person appearing at a public inquiry will speak.</p>

<p>5.2. If you propose to give, or to call another person to give, evidence at the inquiry by reading a proof of evidence you must send:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>3 copies of it and any written summary (see paragraph 5.7) to us</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one copy of it and any written summary to the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>, appellant and any other rule 6 parties</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>no later than 4 weeks before the date the inquiry starts. However, if the Inspector has specified a different timetable for the receipt of the proofs of evidence you must meet that timetable.</p>

<p>5.3. The main role of a proof of evidence is to allow witnesses to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have previously provided evidence in one document which helps them to present their case at the inquiry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give their professional opinion or opinion based on local knowledge, on evidence provided by other parties in their statements of case</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>5.4. For a description of what to include in your proof of evidence, please see:</p>

<p>5.5. The evidence of each of your witnesses should address distinct topics and not overlap another’s.</p>

<p>5.6. Witnesses and their advocates should limit the length of proofs.  If the proof exceeds 1,500 words, it should be accompanied by a summary.  It is normally only the summaries that will be read out at the inquiry.</p>

<p>5.7. Summaries should concentrate on the main points at issue. They must not introduce new or different evidence nor go beyond the scope of the text they summarise.  It may sometimes be difficult to summarise complex technical evidence effectively, and the above advice is not intended to prevent witnesses properly explaining their evidence. Successful summaries of complex evidence will help make the main points clearer to the interested parties, as well as saving time.</p>

<p>5.8. If the proof of evidence includes evidence given by an expert witness, please see:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6 Core </span> Documents</h2>

<p>6.1. These are documents that are of general/background relevance to the inquiry. With the agreement of the other parties, a document that will be referred to by more than one party can be added to the core documents list. Either the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> or appellant may coordinate the core documents list. If you want to suggest inclusion of a core document, you should provide copies of that document to the appellant and to the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7 Sending </span> document to us electronically</h2>

<p>7.1. Whilst we encourage electronic working, we may request a hard copy of some documents (such as your proofs of evidence – see section 5) to ensure the smooth running of the inquiry. Any printed copies must be of the final versions provided to us.</p>

<p>7.2. For further information, please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appealing-to-the-planning-inspectorate-communicating-electronically-with-us">guide on how to communicate electronically with us</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8 Pre-inquiry </span> meetings</h2>

<p>8.1. When an inquiry is likely to last 4 or more days a pre- inquiry meeting is usually held, although one may be held before a shorter inquiry.  A pre-inquiry meeting is a public meeting, but it is mainly for the benefit of the Inspector and main parties.  We will invite rule 6 parties to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>8.2. The purpose of the meeting is to prepare for the actual inquiry by discussing procedural and other arrangements. No evidence about the case will be heard at the meeting. The meeting should help to ensure that the inquiry runs efficiently and will help everyone to concentrate on the main issues in dispute, saving time and expense for all.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9 Openess </span> and transparency</h2>

<p>9.1. Inquiries are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people.  Provided that it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media. Inspectors will advise people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>9.2. If you want to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, you should contact us and the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10 Inquiry </span> arrangements</h2>

<p>10.1. We ask the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> to arrange the inquiry venue. Inquiries are usually held in <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> offices, village halls or community centres. For further information please see the Planning Inspectorate’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/setting-up-a-venue-for-a-public-inquiry-hearing-or-examination/public-inquiries-hearings-and-examinations-venue-and-facilities-requirements">Public inquiries; Hearings and Examinations - venue and facilities requirements</a></p>

<p>10.2. We will notify the appellant, the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> and every person entitled to appear at the inquiry of the date, time, place and expected length of the inquiry and the name of the Inspector.</p>

<p>10.3. We want to hold all inquiries in buildings with proper facilities for people with disabilities. If you, or anyone you know, want to go to the inquiry and you have particular needs, please contact the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> to confirm that they can make proper arrangements.</p>

<p>10.4. Inquiries usually open on a Tuesday at 10:00. Unless there has been a pre-inquiry meeting (see section 8) the Inspector will agree the sitting times with the main parties at the start of the inquiry.  It is often agreed that the inquiry will start at 9:30 on subsequent days. Inquiries usually sit until about 17:00 or 17.30 each day but may finish earlier on a Friday. There will usually be a mid-morning and mid-afternoon break and a 1-hour break for lunch. The Inspector should not be approached during breaks as other participants in the inquiry would not know what was being said.  Inquiries do not usually sit on a Monday.</p>

<p>10.5. At the discretion of the Inspector, and dependent on a suitable inquiry venue being available, an evening inquiry session is occasionally held if there are a significant number of interested parties who cannot attend during the daytime inquiry sessions.</p>

<h2><span class="number">11 Advocates </span></h2>

<p>11.1. There is no requirement for anyone to be legally represented by a solicitor or barrister.  However, usually, each of the main parties at an inquiry are represented by an advocate. Advocates do not need to have legal qualifications.  Their role is to present their party’s opening statement, go through each of their witness’s evidence in chief, cross-examine the opposing parties’ witnesses, and present their party’s closing statement. When advocates are inexperienced the Inspector will assist and advise, where necessary, of the procedures to be followed.</p>

<p>11.2. If a Rule 6 party does not have an advocate, then one of their witnesses can act as advocate. This is especially important if you wish to cross-examine any of the other main parties. If you do not nominate somebody to be your advocate, then you will need to introduce yourself to the inquiry and present your proof of evidence without anyone taking you through it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12 What </span> happens at the inquiry?</h2>

<p>12.1. An inquiry is the most formal of the appeal procedures. It usually involves larger or more complicated appeals.  An inquiry may last for several days, or even weeks. It is not a court of law, but the proceedings will often seem to be similar.  Often expert evidence is presented, and witnesses are cross-examined.</p>

<p>12.2. The Inspector will normally have seen the site location and the surrounding area before the inquiry event but will normally make a further accompanied visit during or after the inquiry.</p>

<p>12.3. When the Inspector opens the inquiry on the first day, they will firstly deal with any housekeeping matters (such as what the inquiry is about and where the fire exits are). The Inspector will then usually give an outline of what will happen at the inquiry.  The Inspector will ask whether there are any interested parties who wish to speak at the inquiry, this is often called taking the appearances.</p>

<p>12.4. The order of appearances is at the discretion of the Inspector who will usually consider the views of the parties and the particular circumstances of the case. The Inspector will make it clear at the start of the inquiry what the order of appearances will be.</p>

<p>12.5. Normally the appellant will be asked whether they wish to make a brief opening statement, followed by the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>. Whether the parties make an opening statement or not, the appellant will usually present their case first; the witnesses will give their evidence and the opposing side will be allowed to cross-examine them.</p>

<p>12.6. After that the Inspector will normally ask (for each witness) if anyone who registered at the start of the inquiry that they wished to speak, and who opposes the case that has just been put forward, whether they have any questions to put to the witness.</p>

<p>12.7. This is followed by the other side presenting its case with witnesses being cross examined by the opposing side. Similarly, those who registered that they wished to speak and who oppose the case just put forward, will be asked if they have any questions to put to the witnesses. Rule 6 parties and then any other interested people who wish to speak will normally present their evidence after the appellant and the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> have finished their cases.</p>

<p>12.8. The Inspector will usually ask if you are willing to answer questions about your evidence. You do not have to do this, though it is often helpful to do so, and it may add weight to your evidence.  Do not feel intimidated.  The Inspector will not let anyone ask you hostile or unfair questions.</p>

<p>12.9. Leading questions (questions in which the answer is suggested by the question) are not allowed (for example “Would you agree that…”). The witness then may be subject to cross-examination by opposing parties.</p>

<p>12.10. If you object to the proposal, the appellant’s representative may ask you questions. If you support it, the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr>’s representative may ask you questions. In turn, Rule 6 parties should ensure that their cross-examination of other parties is succinct, fair and relevant to the planning matters at issue.</p>

<p>12.11. After cross-examination, parties can do what is called ‘re- examination’. If a witness has made a mistake or got confused during their cross-examination, their advocate can try to correct things by discussing the subject again and asking further questions of their witness to ensure that their case is clarified. A re-examination is not a chance to invite the witness to revisit clear answers given in cross-examination.</p>

<p>12.12. For further information on the Inquiry procedure, please see:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13 Giving </span> evidence on oath</h2>

<p>13.1. Where the inquiry involves a dispute between the appellant and the <abbr title="local planning authority">LPA</abbr> about the facts it is usual for the evidence to be given under oath (which the Inspector will administer) or after ‘affirming’. If your evidence/representations concerns facts, you will be required to give your evidence/representations under oath or an affirmation.</p>

<p>13.2. Inspectors will, where possible, seek early confirmation from the appeal parties if any witness to be called needs to swear on a religious text.  If so, the appeal party will be asked to bring the relevant Holy Book to the Inquiry.  <abbr title="local planning authorities">LPAs</abbr> may be asked to provide a copy of the necessary text.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14 At </span> the end of the inquiry</h2>

<p>14.1. After the evidence has been heard the parties may make closing statements which are an opportunity to sum up their case. They are usually read out loud from a pre-prepared written version and this can be added to, by hand if necessary, before being given to the Inspector and other main parties.</p>

<p>14.2. After the closing statements the Inspector will normally close the inquiry.  This is followed by the Inspector making arrangements to visit the appeal site.</p>

<p>14.3. If the inquiry was closed before the site visit no further discussion on the merits of the case will be permitted during the formal site visit. This is because it could lead to further oral evidence being given by one party or interested person and could compromise the fairness, openness and impartiality of the process.  The Inspector will be courteous but firm about not allowing any inappropriate discussions or comments to be made at the site visit.</p>

<p>14.4. However, where the parties have referred in their evidence to certain physical characteristics of a site, building or area, the Inspector will allow those to be pointed out.</p>

<h2><span class="number">15 Costs </span></h2>

<p>15.1. There is no cost to being a rule 6 party other than what you may incur in preparing your evidence (for example, photocopying, binding and posting) and attending the inquiry.</p>

<p>15.2. All parties to an appeal are normally expected to meet their own expenses.</p>

<p>15.3. If a party does not behave reasonably during the appeal process, they leave themselves open to costs being awarded against them.  This would be on the basis that the behaviour had directly caused another party to incur expenses that would not otherwise have been necessary.</p>

<p>15.4. There is guidance about costs awards in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appeals">planning practice guidance</a></p>

<p>15.5. It is important that you read this because it explains how, when and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>15.6. Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also, costs may be awarded at the initiative of the Inspector.</p>

<p>15.7. The Inspector will remind parties that any application for costs should be made before the end of the inquiry.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16 The </span> decision</h2>

<p>16.1. Almost all appeal decisions are made by the Inspector. However, in a very small number of cases, the Secretary of State will make the decision. In this case, the Inspector will write a report with their recommendations for the Secretary of State. Our case officer will normally write to the parties, within 10 working days of the close of the inquiry, to let them know the date by which the Secretary of State’s decision will be issued.
