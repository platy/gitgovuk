</div>

<h3>What is the Skilled Worker route?</h3>

<p>SK1.1. The Skilled Worker route is the main immigration route for overseas nationals who wish to work in the UK. It allows UK-based employers to recruit overseas workers to fill a wide range of skilled vacancies in the UK.</p>

<p>SK1.2. A Skilled Worker must have a job offer in an <a class="govuk-link" href="#skill-level">eligible skilled occupation</a> from a Home Office-approved sponsor. The job must normally be skilled to level 3 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) for England and Northern Ireland, or the equivalent level in Wales or Scotland. This is approximately to equivalent A-level standard. This does not mean the worker has to have A-levels or equivalent qualifications, but the work they do must be at that level.</p>

<p>SK1.3. You can also sponsor eligible healthcare professionals for the <a class="govuk-link" href="#health-and-care-visa">Health and Care visa</a>, which is a special subcategory of the Skilled Worker route.</p>

<p>SK1.4. All jobs sponsored on this route must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#salary-requirements">Skilled Worker salary requirements</a>.</p>

<p>SK1.5. Skilled workers can bring their family members (partner and children) to the UK and can apply to settle in the UK after 5 years’ continuous lawful residence on this (or another eligible) route.</p>

<h3>Who needs to be sponsored on the Skilled Worker route?</h3>

<p>SK1.6. You will need to sponsor any overseas national you wish to employ if they are not a ‘settled worker’ or do not otherwise have immigration permission to work for you in the UK. This includes most <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU, EEA</a> and Swiss nationals who arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>SK1.7. You do not have to sponsor certain categories of worker, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Irish citizens</li>
  <li>EU, EEA and Swiss citizens (and their eligible family members) who have been granted status under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>people with indefinite leave to enter or remain in the UK (also known as ‘settlement’)</li>
</ul>

<p>SK1.8. This is not a complete list. For further information on who does, and does not, need sponsorship, see section S1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#who-needs">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a></p>

<h4>Employment relationship between sponsor and worker</h4>

<p>SK2.5. As the sponsor, you will normally be the employer and therefore responsible for paying the sponsored worker. We recognise there are certain circumstances, such as in parts of the creative sector, where there is no direct employer-employee relationship. In such circumstances, the worker must still have a sponsor that is able and willing to accept all of the responsibilities and duties associated with being their sponsor.</p>

<p>SK2.6. There will also be circumstances where there is a clear statutory relationship between the employing body and a publicly funded body, where the publicly funded body can intervene in the running or funding of the employing or paying body. In these cases, the publicly funded body can be the sponsor.</p>

<p>There are 2 examples of this:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>A local authority has powers of control and direction over self-governing schools, so the local authority can sponsor teachers in these schools.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>A Strategic Health Authority, through its Deanery, Local Education and Training Board (LETB), provider, or commissioning organisation, has funding control of training posts for doctors and dentists within NHS Trusts, even though it is not the paying body. In this case, the Deanery or LETB can be the sponsor.</p>
</div>

<p>SK2.7. Where a worker is not your direct employee, we will look closely at the arrangement to make sure you can fulfil your sponsor duties and we will take action against you if we find you are not. For further information, see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="">Working for a third party</a> in this document</li>
  <li>‘Working on a contract basis’ in section S1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to keep your licence</h3>

<p>SK2.8. If you are granted a licence, you must comply with all of your sponsor duties. If you do not, we may take action against you, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>downgrading your licence rating</li>
  <li>suspending your licence</li>
  <li>revoking your licence</li>
  <li>reporting you to the police or other relevant authorities</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>SK3.3. This is not the full list of requirements – you must refer to the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-worker">Immigration Rules</a> for these.</p>

<h3>Points requirement</h3>

<p>SK3.4. All applicants on the Skilled Worker route must score 70 ‘points’ to be eligible. This includes 50 points for mandatory or ‘non-tradeable’ criteria, and 20 points for ‘tradeable’ criteria.</p>

<p>SK3.5. The mandatory criteria are set out in the table below. All applicants on the Skilled Worker route must score 50 points from this table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Points type</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
      <th scope="col">Points available</th>

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Sponsorship</td>
      <td>The applicant must have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#cos">valid Certificate of Sponsorship</a> for the role they wish to undertake. The role must meet <a class="govuk-link" href="#genuineness-requirement">the genuineness</a> and (where relevant) the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">third-party working</a> rules.</td>

For guidance on proving this requirement, see ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/knowledge-of-english">Knowledge of English</a>’ on GOV.UK</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>SK3.6. In addition to scoring 50 points for the above criteria, the applicant must also score 20 ‘tradeable’ points based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their <a class="govuk-link" href="#salary-requirements">salary</a> and</li>
  <li>other criteria, such as relevant academic qualifications held by them, being sponsored to work in a shortage occupation or an eligible health or education occupation, or because they are a ‘new entrant’ to the UK’s labour market</li>
</ul>

<p>SK3.7. For further information on salary requirement, see sections SK5 to SK8 of this document.</p>

<h4>Genuineness requirement</h4>

<p>SK3.8. We will not award points for sponsorship if we have reasonable grounds to believe that the job:</p>

<ul>
  <li>does not exist</li>
  <li>is a sham</li>
  <li>or has been created mainly so the worker can apply for entry clearance or permission to stay</li>
</ul>

<p>SK3.9. If you assign a CoS for a role which is not genuine, we will refuse the worker’s application and we may take action against you.</p>

<p>SK3.10. For further information on genuine vacancies, see section C1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>.</p>

<h4>Working for a third party</h4>

<p>SK3.11. You must not assign a CoS to a worker for a role which amounts to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the hire of the applicant to a third party who is not the sponsor to fill a position with that party, whether temporary or permanent; or</li>
  <li>contract work to undertake an ongoing routine role or to provide an ongoing routine service for a third party who is not the sponsor, 
regardless of the nature or length of any arrangement between the sponsor and the third party</li>
</ul>

<p>SK3.12. If we have reasonable grounds to believe you have done so, we will not award points for sponsorship. If that happens, we will refuse the worker’s application and may take action against you.</p>

<p>SK3.13. For further information on contract working, see section S1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>Financial requirement</h3>

<p>SK3.14. If the applicant is applying for entry clearance from outside the UK, or has been in the UK for less than one year at the date of application, they must show they have enough funds to support themselves and any family members in the UK.</p>

<p>SK3.15. If you are an A-rated sponsor, you can certify this requirement is met when you assign a CoS to them (also known as ‘certifying maintenance’). Otherwise, the applicant must provide evidence of funds as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-finance">Appendix Finance</a> to the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>SK3.16. For further information, see section S7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>ATAS requirement</h3>

<p>SK3.17. When you assign a CoS on the Skilled Worker route, you must check and confirm whether the worker needs to apply for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academic-technology-approval-scheme">Academic Approval Technology Scheme (ATAS) certificate</a> from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office before they can start (or continue) working for you.</p>

<p>SK3.18. A Skilled Worker will need an ATAS certificate if all of the following are true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are also licensed as a Student sponsor</li>
  <li>the worker is not an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#Exempt-nationalities">exempt national</a>
</li>
  <li>you are sponsoring the worker in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#Occupation-codes">relevant occupation code</a>
</li>
  <li>the work involves research at PhD level or above in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#Subject-areas">relevant subject area</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>SK3.19. If the worker needs an ATAS certificate, you should encourage them to apply for one as soon as possible, as they will need to include a copy of the certificate with their application for entry clearance or permission to stay. If they fail to do so, we will refuse their application and you may lose your sponsor licence (or licences).</p>

<p>SK3.20. For further information on the ATAS requirement, and your responsibilities in relation to it, see under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#ATAS-requirement">ATAS requirement</a> in section S7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>Former officially-sponsored students</h3>

<p>SK3.21. If the applicant has, in the 12 months before the date of application, received an award from a Government or international scholarship agency covering both fees and maintenance, they must provide written consent to their application from that Government or agency. If they do not, we will reject their application as invalid.</p>

<h3>Entry requirement</h3>

<p>SK3.22. Applicants must apply for entry clearance (a visa) to be able to come to the UK on this route. If they arrive in the UK without the relevant visa, they will be refused entry, even if they otherwise meet the requirements.</p>

<h3>Extension of permission</h3>

<p>SK3.23. Those already in the UK with permission on the Skilled Worker route can apply to extend their stay if they meet the relevant requirements – this could be to continue in the same employment or to change employer or employment. See section S9 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>‘Switching’</h3>

<p>SK3.24. Individuals in the UK on another immigration route can ‘switch’ (change route) to the Skilled Worker route if they meet all the relevant immigration requirements and were not last granted permission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as a Visitor</li>
  <li>as a Short-term student</li>
  <li>as a Parent of a Child Student</li>
  <li>as a Seasonal Worker</li>
  <li>as a Domestic Worker in a Private Household</li>
  <li>outside the Immigration Rules</li>
</ul>

<p>SK3.25. If a worker you wish to sponsor is in the UK on any of the above routes, they will need to leave the UK and apply for entry clearance as a Skilled Worker.</p>

<h3>Period of grant</h3>

<p>SK3.26. Successful applicants will be granted entry clearance or permission to stay for the period of employment stated on their CoS, up to a maximum period of 5 years, plus any time before the start date on the CoS and 14 days after the end date. You cannot assign a CoS for longer than 5 years. Applications can be made up to 3 months before the start date</p>

<h3>Settlement</h3>

<p>SK3.27. Workers who have been continuously and lawfully resident in the UK on the Skilled Worker route (or other eligible route) for 5 years or more may apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain-tier-2-t2-skilled-worker-visa">settle in the UK permanently</a> (known as ‘settlement’ or ‘indefinite leave to remain’). For details of the requirements, see paragraphs SW 19.1 to SW 25.2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-worker">Appendix Skilled Worker</a>.</p>

<h3>Further information on immigration requirements</h3>

<p>SK3.28. You can find more information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa">Skilled Worker visa</a> pages on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>SK3.29. You should also refer to sections S7 to S9 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for further information on immigration requirements, conditions of stay, extension applications and change of employment applications.</p>

<h2>SK4. Skill level requirement for Skilled Workers</h2>

<p>This section tells you how to ensure that any jobs you wish to sponsor workers for on the Skilled Worker route are at the appropriate skill level.</p>

<p>SK4.1. All applicants applying on the Skilled Worker route must score 20 points for having a job at the appropriate skill level. You can only sponsor a worker for a job which is listed as eligible for this route in either Table 1 or Table 2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a> or is under occupation code 6145 (Care workers and home carers).</p>

<p>SK4.2. When you assign a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) on the Skilled Worker route, you must choose an appropriate occupation code for the job from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>. If you are not sure which occupation code to use, there is guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/standardoccupationalclassificationsoc/soc2010" rel="external">Office for National Statistics website</a>. It is your responsibility to ensure you choose the correct occupation code.</p>

<p>SK4.3. We will not award points to an applicant (and so will refuse their application) if we have reasonable grounds to believe you have chosen a less appropriate occupation code for any of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the most appropriate occupation code for the job is not eligible on the Skilled Worker route</li>
  <li>the most appropriate occupation code for the job has a higher going rate than the salary you propose to pay the worker</li>
  <li>the applicant is also claiming points for a job in a <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-d">shortage occupation</a> and the most appropriate occupation code is not a shortage occupation</li>
  <li>the applicant is claiming points for an educational qualification (<a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-b">Option B</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-c">Option C</a>) and the most appropriate occupation code is not listed as “eligible for PhD points” in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Table 1 of Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>SK4.4. When assessing if you have chosen an inappropriate occupation code, we may consider a number of factors, including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether you have shown a genuine need for the job as described</li>
  <li>whether the applicant has the appropriate skills, qualifications and experience needed to do the job as described in the CoS</li>
  <li>your history of compliance with the immigration system including, but not limited to, paying your sponsored workers appropriately</li>
  <li>any additional information you may provide</li>
</ul>

<h2>SK5. Salary requirements for Skilled Workers: overview</h2>

<p>This section provides an overview of the salary requirements you must meet to sponsor a person on the Skilled Worker route and how we will check that you are complying with these requirements. You must also read sections SK6 to SK8 of this guidance.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Content included in this section:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#Guiding-principles">Guiding principles</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#salary-requirements">How much do you have to pay a Skilled Worker?</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#paye-reference">PAYE reference numbers</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Guiding principles</h3>

<p>SK5.1. You must ensure any worker you sponsor on the Skilled Worker route is paid in line with the salary rates set out in the Immigration Rules and in this guidance. The relevant Immigration Rules are contained in paragraphs SW 8.2 to SW 14.6 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-worker">Appendix Skilled Worker</a>. The going rates, where applicable, are set out in Tables 1 to 4 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>.</p>

<p>SK5.2. These rates have been set to make sure the resident labour market is not undercut. They will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect the latest available salary data.</p>

<p>SK5.3. If the amount you will pay the worker is below these rates, we will refuse their application for entry clearance or permission to stay.</p>

<p>SK5.4. If we grant permission to a sponsored worker, but later find that you stop paying, or have never paid, them in line with these rates, we will take action against you – this could include <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#C10">revoking your sponsor licence</a>.</p>

<p>SK5.5. In addition to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#C7">compliance visits</a>, we will undertake regular checks with HMRC to ensure you are paying at least the salary you stated on the sponsored worker’s <a class="govuk-link" href="#cos">Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)</a>, in any sponsor note you have added to the CoS, or in any other notification of a change in salary.</p>

<h3>How much do you have to pay a Skilled Worker?</h3>

<p>SK5.6. Unless a <a class="govuk-link" href="#transitional-arrangements-salary">transitional arrangement</a> or other exception applies, the salary you pay to the worker must meet or exceed all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="#general-salary-threshold">general salary threshold</a> – for most jobs, this is at least £25,600 per year</li>
  <li>the applicable <a class="govuk-link" href="#going-rate">going rate</a> for the occupation</li>
  <li>where applicable, the minimum <a class="govuk-link" href="#hourly-rate">hourly rate</a> (at least £10.10 per hour)</li>
</ul>

<p>SK5.7. If the going rate for the occupation is higher than the general salary threshold, you must pay the worker at least the going rate. If the going rate is lower than the general salary threshold, you must pay the worker 
at least the general salary threshold. In either case, you must pay at least the hourly rate (where this applies).</p>

<h4>General salary threshold</h4>

<p>SK5.8. The general salary threshold is normally £25,600 per year. In some cases, you can pay less than this (at least £23,040 or £20,480 per year) if the worker scores <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points">tradeable points</a> for attributes such as having a relevant PhD or being a new entrant.</p>

<p>SK5.9. The general salary threshold is calculated based on actual gross earnings, up to a maximum of 48 hours per week. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-general-salary-threshold">Calculation of general salary threshold</a> for further information.</p>

<p>SK5.10. We will not grant permission to a worker if they will be paid less than the applicable general salary threshold. The only exception is where the worker is a pre-registration nurse or midwife working towards registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, where they can temporarily be paid less than £20,480 per year. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#overseas-nurse-midwife">Sponsoring an overseas qualified nurse or midwife</a> for further information.</p>

<h4>Going rate</h4>

<p>SK5.11. For each eligible occupation code listed in Table 1 or Table 2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>, there is a ‘going rate’. The salary you pay to the worker must meet or exceed the applicable going rate. In some cases, you can pay 70, 80 or 90 per cent of the going rate if the worker scores <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points">tradeable points</a> for attributes such as having a relevant PhD or being a new entrant.</p>

<p>SK5.12. The going rate is calculated and pro-rated based on the number of hours the applicant will actually work. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-going-hourly-rate">Calculation of going rate and hourly rate</a> for further information.</p>

<p>SK5.13. There are <a class="govuk-link" href="#transitional-arrangement-going">transitional arrangements</a> relating to the going rate for some occupations.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> there are changes to the going rates for occupation codes listed in Table 2 of Appendix Skilled Occupations, as set out in Statement of Changes HC 1118. These changes come into effect for applications for entry clearance or permission to stay submitted from 9 a.m. on 11 April 2022. Workers who applied for, or were granted, permission before that date and time are not affected by these changes.</p>

<h4>Hourly rate</h4>

<p>SK5.14. You must pay your sponsored workers at least £10.10 per hour if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the worker made their application for entry clearance or permission to stay on or after 6 April 2021</li>
  <li>the worker did not hold permission as a Skilled Worker or Tier 2 (General) Migrant under the Rules in place before 6 April 2021 (or, if they did, has not held continuous permission on those routes since they were granted such permission); and</li>
  <li>you will be sponsoring the worker in an occupation code listed in Table 1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>SK5.15. The hourly rate requirement does not apply if the worker will be sponsored in an eligible health or education occupation code listed in Table 2 of Appendix Skilled Occupations, or if they qualify under a <a class="govuk-link" href="#transitional-arrangement-hourly">transitional arrangement for hourly rate</a>.</p>

<h3>PAYE reference numbers</h3>

<p>SK5.16. When you <a class="govuk-link" href="#cos">assign a CoS</a> to a Skilled Worker, you must tell us the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) scheme reference number through which the worker will be paid. We will use this information to check with HMRC that you are paying the worker the amount you said you would. If the worker is not paid through PAYE, you must tell us why on the CoS.</p>

<p>SK5.17. Before you assign any CoS, we recommend you first add any PAYE scheme reference numbers through which you will be paying your sponsored workers to your licence, using the ‘PAYE References’ tab in your sponsorship management system (SMS) account. You will then be able to select the relevant PAYE scheme when you assign a CoS to a sponsored worker.</p>

<p>SK5.18. If the PAYE scheme through which you pay the worker changes, you do not need to report this to us in relation to the individual worker. You must, however, ensure that the new PAYE scheme is listed in your SMS account.</p>

<p>SK5.19. For further information on managing PAYE reference numbers, see Guide 9 in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/manage-your-sponsorship-licence-sms-user-manual">SMS Manual 2: manage your sponsorship licence</a>.</p>

<h2>SK6. Tradeable points for salary</h2>

<h3>Transitional arrangements for salary</h3>

<p>SK6.22. If the applicant is not eligible for points under <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-table">Options A to F</a> above, you should check to see if they would qualify under any of the transitional arrangements below. These transitional arrangements also apply to settlement applications.</p>

<h4>Original CoS assigned before 24 November 2016</h4>

<p>SK6.23. An applicant who is in the UK and applying for permission to stay can claim 20 points for their salary (or meet the salary requirement in a settlement application, if relevant) if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they were previously granted permission as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant based on a CoS assigned to them by their sponsor before 24 November 2016</li>
  <li>they have had continuous permission as a Skilled Worker or Tier 2 (General) Migrant ever since; and</li>
  <li>
    <p>their salary will be whichever is the higher of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>£20,800 or above; or</li>
      <li>at least the going rate for the occupation code in which they are being sponsored</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>SK6.24. The other restrictions set out in this guidance (including the rules on <a class="govuk-link" href="#allowances">allowances</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-going-hourly-rate">pro-rating</a> still apply. This transitional arrangement applies to applications for permission to stay (and settlement) made before 24 May 2023, after which it will end.</p>

<h4>Transitional arrangement for hourly rate</h4>

<p>SK6.25. The £10.10 <a class="govuk-link" href="#hourly-rate">hourly rate requirement</a> does not apply if the applicant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applied for entry clearance or permission to stay before 6 April 2021; or</li>
  <li>was granted permission as a Skilled Worker (or Tier 2 (General) Migrant) under the Rules in place before 6 April 2021), and has had continuous permission as a Skilled Worker (or as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant) since then</li>
</ul>

<p>SK6.26. All other salary requirements set out in this guidance must still be met.</p>

<h4>Transitional arrangement for going rates</h4>

<p>SK6.27. If the applicant was sponsored to work in one of the occupation codes in the table below at the time they applied for their last permission as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and has continued to be sponsored in that occupation code ever since (whether as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant or as a Skilled Worker), the going rates in the table below apply, instead of the going rates listed in Table 1 of Appendix Skilled Occupations.</p>

<p>SK6.28. These going rates are based on a 40-hour working week and must be pro-rated for other working patterns, based on the weekly working hours stated by you on the worker’s CoS.</p>

<p>SK6.29. This transitional arrangement applies to applications submitted before 1 December 2026, after which it will end. All other salary requirements set out in this guidance continue to apply.</p>

<h2>SK7. Calculation of salary: allowances and pro-rating</h2>

<p>This section provides information on how we calculate whether a salary meets the Skilled Worker requirements, including the rules on allowances and pro-rating.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Content in this section:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#allowances">Allowances</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#workers-sponsored-less-than-year">Workers being sponsored for less than a year</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-general-salary-threshold">Calculation of general salary threshold</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-going-hourly-rate">Calculation of going rate and hourly rate</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>SK7.1. You must ensure you understand the rules on calculation of salary (including allowances and pro-rating). These apply to all <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points">tradeable points options</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#transitional-arrangements-salary">transitional arrangements</a>, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h3>Allowances</h3>

<p>SK7.2. Subject to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#transitional-allowances">transitional provision</a> below, we will only take into account guaranteed basic gross pay (before income tax and including employee pension and national insurance contributions). We will not take into account other allowances, pay or benefits (even if they are guaranteed), such as any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay which cannot be guaranteed because the nature of the job means that hours fluctuate</li>
  <li>additional pay such as shift allowance, or overtime or bonus pay, whether or not it is guaranteed</li>
  <li>employer pension and employer national insurance contributions</li>
  <li>any allowances, such as accommodation or cost of living allowances</li>
  <li>in-kind benefits, such as equity shares, health insurance, school or university fees, company cars or food</li>
  <li>one-off payments, such as ‘golden hellos’</li>
  <li>any payments relating to immigration costs, such as the application fee or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application">Immigration Health Charge</a>; or</li>
  <li>payments to cover business expenses, including (but not limited to) travel to and from the applicant’s home country, equipment, clothing, travel or subsistence</li>
</ul>

<p>SK7.3. When you enter the worker’s gross salary on their Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), you must not include any allowances, such as those listed above, in the figure. If we find you have done so, and a transitional provision does not apply, we may revoke your licence.</p>

<h4>Transitional provision for allowances</h4>

<p>SK7.4. If the worker is in the UK and is applying for permission to stay (or settlement), you may include guaranteed allowances in the salary figure entered on the worker’s CoS if all of the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the worker was previously granted permission as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant and has had continuous permission as a Skilled Worker or Tier 2 (General) Migrant ever since</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you sponsored the application which led to the worker’s last grant of permission and you are continuing to sponsor the worker; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the allowances are guaranteed, will be paid for the duration of the worker’s permission, and would be paid to a local settled worker in similar circumstances, such as London weighting</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>SK7.5. The other restrictions outlined in this section (including on other allowances and pro-rating) still apply. The application for permission to stay (or settlement) must be made before 1 December 2026, after which this transitional provision will end.</p>

<h3>Workers being sponsored for less than a year</h3>

<p>SK7.6. The general salary threshold and going rates listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-table">tradeable points table</a> refer to annual salaries. If the applicant will be working in the UK for less than 12 months, we will pro-rate their gross actual earnings, as recorded on their CoS, to the equivalent annual figure to determine if they meet the salary requirements. For example, if the worker is assigned a CoS for 6 months, and their gross pay will be £2,500 per month, this would equate to a gross annual salary of £30,000.</p>

<h3>Calculation of general salary threshold</h3>

<p>SK7.7. When considering if the <a class="govuk-link" href="#general-salary-threshold">general salary threshold</a> is met, we will only take into account salary for up to a maximum of 48 hours per week, even if the applicant works for longer than this. For example, a person who works 60 hours a week for £10.10 per hour will be considered to have a salary of £25,210 (10.1 x 48 x 52) and not £31,512 (10.1 x 60 x 52). They will therefore not meet the general salary threshold, unless eligible for <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points">tradeable points</a> under Options B to F.</p>

<p>SK7.8. If the applicant will be working part-time, we will only consider their actual gross earnings to determine if they are being at least the general salary threshold – we will not pro-rate their salary to the equivalent full- time earnings. For example, if the applicant works 20 hours per week for £19 per hour, their annual salary will be £19,760 (20 x 19 x 52) and they will not meet the general salary threshold.</p>

<h3>Calculation of going rate and hourly rate</h3>

<p>SK7.9. When assessing whether the applicant is being paid the going rate (and, where applicable, meets the £10.10 per hour salary requirement), we will take into account their full weekly working hours, as stated on their CoS, and pro-rate accordingly. This applies even if the applicant works more than 48 hours per week. The calculation we use depends on whether the occupation code is listed in Table 1 or Table 2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>.</p>

<h4>Occupation code in Table 1</h4>

<p>SK7.10. Going rates for occupation codes listed in Table 1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a> are based on a 39-hour week and will be pro-rated as follows:</p>

<p>(The going rate for the occupation code stated in Table 1 of Appendix Skilled Occupations) multiplied by (the number of weekly working hours stated by you on the applicant’s CoS) divided by 39</p>

<p>SK7.11. This means, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an applicant who works 60 hours a week in an occupation code in Table 1 with a going rate of £39,000 must be paid at least £60,000 (£39,000 x 60 ÷ 39) per year to meet the going rate requirement</li>
  <li>an applicant who works 30 hours per week in an occupation code in Table 1 with a going rate of £39,000 must be paid at least £30,000 (£39,000 x 30 ÷ 39) per year to meet the going rate requirement</li>
</ul>

<p>SK7.12. If the applicant’s salary is required to be at least 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate, the figure from the calculation above will be multiplied by 0.7, 0.8 or 0.9, as appropriate, to calculate the required salary under the going rate requirement. No reduction to 70%, 80% or 90% applies to the £10.10 per hour requirement.</p>

<h4>Occupation code in Table 2</h4>

<p>SK7.13. If the applicant is being sponsored for a job in one of the health or education occupation codes listed in Table 2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>, they must be paid the full going rate. This will be pro-rated according to the number of weekly working hours stated by you on the CoS and the pro-rating rules set out in Tables 3 and 4 of Appendix Skilled Occupations.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> going rates for occupation codes in Table 2 of Appendix Skilled Occupations have changed. See Statement of Changes HC 1118 for details. These changes apply to applications for entry clearance or permission to stay submitted from 9 a.m. on 11 April 2022. Where the worker applied for entry clearance or permission to stay before that date and time, the previous going rates apply, as set out in the Archived Immigration Rules and archived Skilled Worker sponsor guidance.</p>

<h2>SK8. Unpaid leave and salary reductions</h2>

<p>This section tells you about your responsibilities if a sponsored worker takes unpaid leave or if you reduce their salary.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#absences">If the worker takes unpaid leave</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#reduce-salary">If you reduce the worker’s salary</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>If the worker takes unpaid leave</h3>

<p>SK8.1. Workers can take short periods of unpaid leave. However, you must stop sponsoring a worker if they are absent without pay for more than 4 weeks in total according to their normal working pattern, during any calendar year (1 January to 31 December), unless the absences are due to any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>statutory maternity, paternity, parental, shared parental or adoption leave</li>
  <li>sick leave</li>
  <li>assisting with a national or international humanitarian or environmental crisis, with your agreement</li>
  <li>taking part in legally organised industrial action</li>
</ul>

<p>See ‘Unpaid leave’ in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>If you reduce the worker’s salary</h3>

<p>SK8.2. You can temporarily reduce the salary of a Skilled Worker or Tier 2 (General) Migrant you are currently sponsoring if the reduction coincides with one of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#absences">absences listed</a> – for example, if you are paying them a reduced salary, or they are receiving statutory payments only, while they are on maternity leave or sick leave.</p>

<p>SK8.3. If you wish to reduce the salary of a Skilled Worker or Tier 2 (General) Migrant in any other circumstances (either on a temporary or permanent basis), you must first check if you will need to assign them a new CoS, and if the worker will need to make a new application for entry clearance or permission to stay, before you can reduce their salary.</p>

<h4>Permitted salary reductions</h4>

<p>SK8.4. You do not need to assign a new CoS, and the worker does not need to make a new application, if you reduce the worker’s salary and any of the following are true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the worker has permission as a Skilled Worker and, following the reduction in salary, they would score 20 points for the same <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points">tradeable points option</a> as the option in which they scored the points which led to their current grant of permission:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>for example, if their current permission is based on points scored under <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-b">Option B</a>, their revised salary must continue to meet all of the criteria under Option B</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the worker has permission as a Skilled Worker or Tier 2 (General) Migrant and, following the reduction in salary, they would still be eligible for points under the transitional arrangement for <a class="govuk-link" href="#cos-assigned">CoS assigned before 24 November 2016</a>
</li>
  <li>the worker has permission as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant, and their revised salary would be eligible for 20 points under <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-a">Option A</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-f">Option F</a> if they were required to make an application on the Skilled Worker route</li>
  <li>the worker has permission as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant, was considered to be a new entrant when they were granted that permission, and they would be eligible for 20 points under <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-e">Option E</a> if they were required to make an application on the Skilled Worker route</li>
</ul>

<p>SK8.5. Although the worker does not need new permission in the above circumstances, you must still let us know via your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">sponsorship management system (SMS) account</a> that you have reduced their salary, and tell us what that salary is.</p>

<h4>Prohibited salary reductions</h4>
<p>SK8.6. If you reduce the worker’s salary, and none of the exceptions outlined in this section apply, you cannot simply continue to sponsor the worker. If the revised salary is eligible for points on the Skilled Worker route, you must assign the worker a new CoS, and the worker must make a successful application for entry clearance or permission to stay before you can start to pay them at the reduced rate.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If the worker scored 20 points under <a class="govuk-link" href="#points-option-a">Option A</a> when they were last granted permission, and they obtain a relevant PhD while they are working for you, you cannot simply reduce their salary to the levels stated in <a class="govuk-link" href="#points-option-b">Option B</a>. You must assign a new CoS, and the worker must make a successful application (scoring 20 points under Option B) before you can start to pay them a reduced salary.</p>
</div>

<p>SK8.7. If the revised salary you intend to pay the worker would not meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker route, as set out in the Immigration Rules and in this guidance, you must stop sponsoring them and tell us you have done so via your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">SMS account</a>.</p>

<p>SK8.8. Remember, we will make regular checks with HMRC to ensure you are paying the worker appropriately. If we find you are paying the worker less than you said you would, and the amount would not be eligible for points under the same <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points">tradeable points option</a> which led to their current grant of permission, or the change is not otherwise permitted by the Immigration Rules or this guidance, we will <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#C10">revoke your licence</a></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>SK9.1. If you wish to sponsor an overseas-trained nurse under occupation code ‘2231 Nurses’ or an overseas-trained midwife under occupation code ‘2232 Midwives’, you must ensure they have completed, or will complete, the appropriate steps to achieve registration with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nmc.org.uk" rel="external">Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC)</a> within an <a class="govuk-link" href="#timeframe-nmc-registration">8-month timeframe</a></p>

<p>SK9.2. A nurse or midwife trained outside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">European Economic Area (EEA)</a> or Switzerland must either hold a qualification that is comparable to the NMC’s standards of proficiency or pass the NMC test of competence. This test will assess the candidate’s qualifications, training and experience against the NMC’s standards to ensure they are capable of practising safely and effectively in the UK. It also considers whether the candidate has the necessary post-qualifying practice and experience in each appropriate area of nursing or midwifery.</p>

<p>SK9.3. A nurse or midwife trained inside the EEA who applies to register on or after 1 January 2021 and holds qualifications listed amongst those identified as meeting the requirements for automatic recognition in EU law under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02005L0036-20200424&amp;tocId127" rel="external">Annex V of Directive 2005/36/EC</a> (select the table of contents on the left-hand side and then select Annex V from the list) will have their qualification recognised on a near-automatic basis. This will continue to be the case for up to 2 years from 1 January 2021. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eea-qualified-and-swiss-healthcare-professionals-practising-in-the-uk">Guidance for EEA-qualified and Swiss healthcare professionals practising in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>SK9.4. Swiss nationals, UK nationals settled in Switzerland, and their non-EEA dependants and spouses who started their nursing or midwifery training before 31 December 2020 and apply to register on or after 1 January 2021 and hold qualifications previously recognised on a near-automatic basis by EU law under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02005L0036-20200424&amp;tocId127" rel="external">Annex V of Directive 2005/36/EC</a> (select the table of contents on the left-hand side and then select Annex V from the list) will have their qualification recognised on a near-automatic basis. This will continue to be the case for 4 years from 1 January 2021. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nmc.org.uk/registration/joining-the-register/register-nurse-midwife/switzerland/" rel="external">guidance on the NMC website</a> or visit the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eea-qualified-and-swiss-healthcare-professionals-practising-in-the-uk">EEA-qualified and Swiss healthcare professionals practising in the UK</a> on GOV.UK for more information.</p>

<h3>Timeframe for achieving NMC registration</h3>

<p>SK9.5. Overseas-trained nurses and midwives being sponsored on the Skilled Worker route must complete NMC registration within 8 months of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the start date on their Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) (if this is their first application for permission on the Skilled Worker route as a pre- registration nurse or midwife); or</li>
  <li>the start date of their previous employment (if they are applying for an extension to continue working as a pre-registration nurse or midwife)</li>
</ul>

<p>SK9.6. If the worker fails to achieve registration within 8 months of either of these dates, you must stop sponsoring them. You must not sponsor a nurse or midwife who has previously been sponsored by a different sponsor if they have failed to achieve full NMC registration within the timeframe specified above.</p>

<h3>Salary for pre-registration nurses or midwives</h3>

<p>SK9.7. Nurses sponsored under occupation code 2231 or midwives sponsored under occupation code 2232 must normally be paid in line with the rates under <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-f">Tradeable points option F</a>. However, you may temporarily pay a pre-registration nurse or midwife less than this (for up to 8 months) in either of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the worker previously held NMC registration and is undertaking an NMC-approved programme with a view to returning to practice; or</li>
  <li>
    <p>the worker is working towards NMC registration and both of the following apply:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the worker has passed the NMC’s English language requirements and Computer Based Test of competence, before the date of application; and</li>
      <li>the worker will sit an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to obtain NMC registration no later than 3 months after the job start date recorded on their CoS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>SK9.8. During this 8-month period, or until the worker achieves NMC registration (if sooner), the worker’s salary must be at least equal to the appropriate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcn.org.uk/employment-and-pay/nhs-pay-2020-21" rel="external">NHS Agenda for Change</a> Band 3 rate, as stated in Table 3 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>.</p>

<p>SK9.9. When you assign a CoS to a pre-registration nurse or midwife, you must confirm that you will stop sponsoring them as a nurse or midwife if they do not achieve full NMC registration within the <a class="govuk-link" href="#timeframe-nmc-registration">8-month timeframe</a>
SK9.10. Once the worker completes registration, you must pay them in line with rates stated under <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-f">Tradeable points option F</a>.</p>

<h3>Summary of the registration process</h3>

<p>SK9.11. The information below summarises the steps a nurse or midwife trained outside the EEA or Switzerland must complete to demonstrate that they are capable of safe and effective practice as a nurse or midwife in the UK. You must ensure that the individual completes these steps within the <a class="govuk-link" href="#timeframe-nmc-registration">8-month timeframe</a> outlined above if you wish to sponsor, or continue sponsoring, them. You should note this process is subject to change and you must also refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nmc.org.uk/registration/joining-the-register/trained-outside-the-eueea/" rel="external">Trained outside the UK page</a> on the NMC website for up-to-date details.</p>

<p>SK9.12. The registration process may be different for nurses or midwives trained within the EEA or Switzerland. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nmc.org.uk/registration/joining-the-register/register-nurse-midwife/" rel="external">Register as a nurse or midwife</a> on the NMC website for details.</p>

<p><b>Requirements:</b></p>

<h5>Qualification</h5>

<p>The candidate must have completed a nursing or midwifery training programme leading to registration in their home country as an entry-level registered nurse or midwife.</p>

<p>Unless that qualification has been deemed comparable to the NMC’s standards of proficiency, they will also need to complete a 2-part test of competence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part 1 is a multiple-choice computer-based test (CBT) administered on behalf of the NMC by a third party and can be taken in a test centre in most countries around the world</li>
  <li>Part 2 is a practical nursing or midwifery examination known as the <a class="govuk-link" href="#osce">objective-structured clinical examination (OSCE)</a> The OSCE is only available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nmc.org.uk/registration/joining-the-register/register-nurse-midwife/trained-outside-uk" rel="external">NMC-approved OSCE test centres in the UK</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h5>Health and character requirements</h5>

<p>The candidate will need to meet the health and character requirements for safe and effective practice – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nmc.org.uk/health-and-character" rel="external">Character and health decision-making guidance</a> on the NMC website for details.</p>

<h5>Language requirement</h5>

<p>The candidate must demonstrate they have the necessary knowledge of the English language for safe and effective practice as a nurse or midwife in the UK. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nmc.org.uk/registration/joining-the-register/english-language-requirements/" rel="external">English language requirements page</a> on the NMC website for details.</p>

<h5>Professional indemnity</h5>

<p>The candidate will need to confirm that there is in force, or will be in force, cover for them under an appropriate indemnity arrangement.</p>

<h5>Payment</h5>

<p>Payment of the evaluation fees and the registration fee.</p>

<h3>Objective-structured clinical examination (OSCE)</h3>

<p>SK9.13. Where required, the candidate will be invited to sit the OSCE in one of the approved <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nmc.org.uk/registration/joining-the-register/trained-outside-the-eueea" rel="external">NMC UK OSCE</a> test centres.</p>

<p>SK9.14. Candidates may sit the OSCE up to 3 times as part of one application for registration.</p>

<p>SK9.15. If the candidate is unsuccessful, they must wait a minimum of 10 working days between attempts.</p>

<p>SK9.16. If the candidate is unsuccessful after their 3 permitted attempts, their OSCE application will close. If they still wish to register as a nurse or midwife, they will be required to submit a new application to the NMC but will not be able to sit the OSCE again for a minimum of 6 months.</p>

<p>SK9.17. A candidate who fails the OSCE 3 times is unlikely to be able to achieve their NMC registration within the <a class="govuk-link" href="#timeframe-nmc-registration">8-month timeframe</a>. In such cases, you must stop sponsoring them as a nurse or midwife.</p>

<p>SK9.18. If you cease sponsorship for this or any other reason, you must tell us via your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">sponsorship management system (SMS) account</a> within 10 working days. If you fail to do so, we may revoke your sponsor licence. See section C1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a> for further information on your reporting duties.</p>

<h3>Completion of registration</h3>

<p>SK9.19. Once the candidate completes all the registration requirements, the NMC will send them their registration number or personal identification number (PIN). You must retain a copy of their PIN notification.</p>

<p>SK9.20. You must tell us within 10 working days through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">your SMS account</a> of the individual’s full NMC registration, confirmation they are now undertaking the role of a registered nurse or midwife, and their salary is equal to or exceeds both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£20,480 per year; and</li>
  <li>the going rate for the occupation code</li>
</ul>

<h2>SK10.Overseas criminal record certificate requirement</h2>

<p>This section tells you about the criminal record certificate requirement that some applicants in the Skilled Worker route must meet to be granted entry clearance or permission to stay.</p>

</div>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>SK11.1. If you have followed all the rules in this guidance and you wish to sponsor a worker on the Skilled Worker route, you must assign them a valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), using your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">sponsorship management system (SMS) account</a>.</p>

<p>SK11.2. Before assigning a CoS, you should satisfy yourself that the worker can meet the relevant the <a class="govuk-link" href="#immigration-requirements">immigration requirements</a>.</p>

<p>SK11.3. You cannot assign a CoS if you’re a B-rated sponsor, unless the worker is applying for permission to stay from within the UK and you sponsored the application which led to their last grant of permission. In all other cases, you must have an A-rating. For information on sponsor ratings, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a>.</p>

<h3>Defined and Undefined CoS</h3>

<p>SK11.4. There are 2 types of CoS you can assign on the Skilled Worker route, known as ‘Defined’ and ‘Undefined’ CoS.</p>

<p>SK11.5. If the person you wish to sponsor will be applying for entry clearance from outside the UK, you must first <a class="govuk-link" href="#defined-cos">apply for a Defined CoS</a> for them. You must wait until this application has been approved before you can assign the CoS to the worker. You can also apply for a Defined CoS if you have not yet identified a worker but think you may need to sponsor a worker from overseas.</p>

<p>SK11.6. If the person will be applying for permission to stay from within the UK, you must assign them an ‘Undefined’ CoS from your annual CoS allocation. If you do not have enough CoS left in your allocation to sponsor the worker, you can apply to increase your allocation: see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/manage-your-sponsorship-licence-sms-user-manual">SMS Manual 2: Manage your licence</a>.</p>

<p>SK11.7. It is very important that you understand the difference between the 2 types of CoS. You must not assign:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Defined CoS to a worker for any job other than the one you described in your application for that Defined CoS</li>
  <li>an Undefined CoS where a Defined CoS is required</li>
</ul>

<p>SK11.8. If you assign the wrong type of CoS, or give false information on your application for a Defined CoS, we may revoke your sponsor licence.</p>

<p>SK11.9. For more information on what a CoS is, and CoS allocations, see section S2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<p>SK11.10. You can find detailed technical guidance on how to assign or apply for a CoS on GOV.UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sponsorship-information-for-employers-and-educators#user-manuals%3A-sponsorship-management-system-(sms)">User manuals: sponsorship management system (SMS)</a>.</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>SK11.11. You must pay a fee for each CoS you assign – see the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">UK visa fees</a>’ page on GOV.UK for information on current fee levels.</p>

<p>SK11.12. Subject to certain exceptions, you will also need to pay an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-visa-sponsorship-employers/immigration-skills-charge">Immigration Skills Charge</a> for each worker you sponsor – see section S5 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2:sponsor a worker</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Use of the CoS</h3>

<p>SK11.13. Once you have assigned a CoS, the worker must use it within 3 months to apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>entry clearance (a visa) if they are outside the UK</li>
  <li>permission to stay if they are in the UK and eligible to extend their permission or switch to the Skilled Worker route</li>
</ul>

<p>SK11.14. If the CoS was issued more than 3 months before the date of application, we may reject their application and not consider it.</p>

<p>SK11.15. The worker must not apply for a visa or permission to stay more than 3 months before the start date recorded on their CoS. If they do, we will refuse their application.</p>

<p>SK11.16. We will also refuse the application if the CoS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has been <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#Cancelling-or-withdrawing-a-CoS">withdrawn by you or cancelled by the Home Office</a>. Visit this page for information on when a CoS can be withdrawn or cancelled</li>
  <li>was used in a previous application that was refused</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the CoS must confirm</h3>

<p>SK11.17. For a CoS to be valid, it must meet the requirements set out in paragraphs SW 5.1 to SW 5.6 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-worker">Appendix Skilled Worker</a> to the Immigration Rules.</p>

  <li>where the worker will carry out their employment – this should include their main work address and any other regular work addresses, if relevant</li>
  <li>whether the worker was sourced through an agent and, if so, details of that agent</li>
  <li>the job title</li>
  <li>the relevant occupation code for the role (choose from the drop-down list under ‘Job type’) – see section S3 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#occupation-code">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for more information on occupation codes</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h4>Choosing the correct category</h4>

<p>SK11.19. When you assign an Undefined CoS on the Skilled Worker route, you will be asked to select a ‘category’ from a drop-down list. The category you choose depends on the worker’s current immigration status and whether you will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#S5">pay the Immigration Skills Charge (ISC)</a> for them, as set out below:</p>

<h5>Skilled Worker (Switching immigration category – ISC liable)</h5>

<p>Choose this option if the worker will be applying to <a class="govuk-link" href="#switching">switch from another immigration route</a> (other than the Student route/Tier 4) to the Skilled Worker route and you are not liable to pay the ISC for them.</p>

<h5>Skilled Worker (extensions – ISC exempt)</h5>

<p>Choose this option if the worker will be making an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#extension">extension of permission application</a> (to continue working for you in the same occupation code) and you are not liable to pay the ISC for them.</p>

<h5>Skilled Worker (extensions – ISC liable)</h5>

<p>Choose this option if the worker will be making an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#extension">extension of permission application</a> (to continue working for you in the same occupation code) and you are liable to pay the ISC for them.</p>

<h5>Skilled Worker (Changes of Employment – ISC exempt)</h5>

<p>Choose this option if the worker will be making a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#change-employment">change of employment application</a> (to change job or employer) and you are not liable to pay the ISC for them.</p>

<h5>Skilled Worker (Changes of Employment – ISC liable)</h5>

<p>Choose this option if the worker will be making a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#change-employment">change of employment application</a> (to change job or employer) and you are liable to pay the ISC for them.</p>

<h5>Skilled Worker (graduate in Tier 4/Student route switching to Skilled Worker)</h5>

<p>Choose this option if the worker was last granted permission as a Student (or under the former Tier 4 route) and <a class="govuk-link" href="#switching">will be applying to switch</a> to the Skilled Worker route – you are not required to pay the ISC in these circumstances.</p>

<h5>Skilled Worker (Switching immigration category – ISC exempt)</h5>

<p>Choose this option if the worker will be applying to <a class="govuk-link" href="#switching">switch from another immigration route</a> (other than the Student route/Tier 4) to the Skilled Worker route and you are liable to pay the ISC for them.</p>

<h4>How long you can assign a CoS on the Skilled Worker route</h4>

<p>SK11.20. You can normally assign a CoS for the period you intend to employ the worker, up to a maximum of 5 years.</p>

<p>SK11.21. If you are sponsoring a worker who will be <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-e">claiming points for being a new entrant</a>, the maximum period you can assign a CoS is 4 years (including time already spent in the UK as a new entrant on the Skilled Worker or Tier 2 (General) routes, or on the Graduate route).</p>

<p>SK11.22. If you assign a CoS to a worker under occupation code ‘2231 Nurses’ or ‘2232 Midwives’, the start date you give on their CoS should be the earliest date of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date they will start working for you in familiarisation training</li>
  <li>if they have already passed the objective-structured clinical examination (OSCE) and received their registration number (PIN), the date they will start working for you as a fully NMC-registered nurse or midwife</li>
  <li>the date on which they will sit their OSCE</li>
</ul>

<p>SK11.23. You cannot sponsor a pre-registration nurse or midwife for longer than 8 months. You must confirm on the CoS that you will stop sponsoring the worker as a nurse or midwife if they do not achieve full NMC registration within 8 months of the job start date. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#overseas-nurse-midwife">Sponsoring an overseas qualified nurse or midwife</a> for further information.</p>

<p>SK11.24. For further information on start and end dates, see section S3 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#start">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>Reporting duties and record keeping</h3>

<p>SK11.25. Once you have assigned a CoS to a worker, you must tell us if they fail to start their employment, are absent without permission, or there are any significant changes to the nature of their work or salary, or to your organisation. For full details of your reporting and other duties, see: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>.</p>

<p>SK11.26. You must also keep records for each worker you sponsor as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keep-records-for-sponsorship-appendix-d">Appendix D</a> to the sponsor guidance.</p>

<p>SK11.27. If you fail to meet these duties, we may revoke your sponsor licence.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>SK12.1. You must apply for a ‘Defined’ Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) if the worker you wish to sponsor will be making their application for permission (entry clearance) from outside the UK. You can also apply for a Defined CoS if you have not yet identified a worker but think you may need to sponsor a worker from overseas.</p>

<p>SK12.2. You must not assign an Undefined CoS to a worker who will be applying for entry clearance – if you do, we are likely to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#Annex-C2">revoke your licence</a>.</p>

<p>SK12.3. You cannot apply for an annual allocation of Defined CoS. Instead, you must apply for a Defined CoS as and when you require one.</p>

<p>SK12.4. You cannot apply for a Defined CoS if your licence is B-rated or suspended.</p>

<p>SK12.5. A Defined CoS must otherwise meet all of the same requirements as an <a class="govuk-link" href="##cos-confirm">Undefined CoS</a> to be valid and eligible for points.</p>

<h3>How to apply for a Defined CoS</h3>

<p>SK12.6. You apply for a Defined CoS using your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">sponsorship management system (SMS)</a> account. The application can only be made by a Level 1 user – see the ‘Key personnel’ section of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a> for information on who can be a Level 1 user.</p>

<p>SK12.7. There is no additional fee to apply for a Defined CoS beyond the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">standard CoS fee</a>.</p>

<p>SK12.8. When you make your application, you must fill in all mandatory fields marked with an asterisk (*). If you do not, you will not be able to send your application. The information you give about the role is the same as you would give if you were assigning a Skilled Worker <a class="govuk-link" href="#cos-confirm">Undefined CoS</a></p>

<p>SK12.9. You can find detailed information on how to complete a Defined CoS application, and how to assign a Defined CoS, in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricted-certificate-of-sponsorship-sms-guide-12">SMS Manual 12</a>.</p>

<h4>Salary information on the CoS</h4>

<p>SK12.10. The salary you enter on the CoS must be a genuine reflection of what you intend to pay the worker. It must also be eligible for 20 points and meet all of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#salary-requirements">salary requirements</a> of the Skilled Worker route. If it does not meet the requirements, we will refuse the application.</p>

<p>SK12.11. If you have not identified a particular worker at the time you apply for a Defined CoS, you cannot assume the worker you eventually assign it to will be eligible for tradeable points under Options B (relevant PhD), C (relevant PhD in a STEM subject), or E (new entrant), unless you can provide a clear justification for this, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the case of <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-b">Option B</a>, that the job requires the successful candidate to have a relevant PhD</li>
  <li>in the case of <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-c">Option C</a>, that the job requires the successful candidate to have a relevant PhD in a STEM subject</li>
  <li>in the case of <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-e">Option E</a>, that the job is in a specified occupation code or is a regulated profession and the worker will be working towards a recognised professional qualification in that profession</li>
</ul>

<p>SK12.12. You can include this additional information in the ‘Summary of job description’ text box. If you cannot provide a satisfactory justification, the salary you enter on the CoS must be eligible for points under <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points-option-a">Option A</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>In the ‘Summary of job description’ text box, you should also state the number of hours the successful candidate, or candidates, will work each week. This will help us to confirm the stated salary meets the general threshold, going rate and hourly rate requirements, and therefore avoid delays in processing your application.</p>

<p>If the number of weekly hours is subject to negotiation or final agreement, you should enter the number of hours you would normally expect employees in a similar role to work each week, and enter “to be confirmed” (or a similar phrase) in brackets. You will be able to enter the correct number of hours when you assign the CoS to a worker.</p>

<h3>When we will decide your application</h3>

<p>SK12.13. If your application is straightforward and does not require any further information, we will normally decide your application for a Defined CoS within one working day.</p>

<p>SK12.14. We may check the information you send with your application before we can fully consider it – for example, if we have doubts about its validity or we are not sure if the role described on the CoS meets the requirements of the Skilled Worker route.</p>

<p>SK12.15.  If we need to make any checks, we may ask you for more information  or documents. You must send us any information or documents within the timescale specified in the request. If you do not, your application will be rejected and not considered. If you do send additional information or documents as requested, we will consider this within 20 working days of receipt.</p>

<h3>Decision on an application for a Defined CoS</h3>

<p>SK12.16. If your application for a Defined CoS is successful, it will be allocated to your SMS account, ready to be assigned to a worker.</p>

<p>SK12.17. We will refuse your application for a Defined CoS if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the job is not in an <a class="govuk-link" href="#skill-level">eligible skilled occupation</a>
</li>
  <li>we have good reason to believe you have chosen an inappropriate occupation code for the role</li>
  <li>the application would not be eligible for <a class="govuk-link" href="#tradeable-points">20 tradeable points for salary</a>
</li>
  <li>we have good reason to believe the <a class="govuk-link" href="#genuineness-requirement">job is not genuine</a> or amounts to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#working-third-party">hire of the worker to a third party</a>
</li>
  <li>the application otherwise does not meet the requirements of the Skilled Worker route</li>
</ul>

<p>SK12.18. We will also refuse your application, and may take action against you, if we have good reason to believe you have provided false or misleading information in your application.</p>

<h3>Time limit for assigning and using a Defined CoS</h3>

<p>SK12.19. Once we have allocated a Defined CoS to your SMS account, you will have 3 months to assign it to a worker. If you do not assign it within 3 months, it will be removed from your account. You should therefore only apply for a Defined CoS if you genuinely intend to assign it within 3 months.</p>

<p>SK12.20. Once you have assigned the CoS to a worker, they will then have 3 months to use it to support an application for entry clearance or permission to stay. If they do not use it within this period, it will be invalid and any application supported by it is likely to be rejected.</p>

<h4>If your licence is downgraded or suspended</h4>

<p>SK12.21. If you have any unassigned Defined CoS in your SMS account, and your licence is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#C8">downgraded to a B rating</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#C9">or is suspended</a>, you will not be able to assign these CoS. They will be removed from your account at the end of 3 months (unless you regain your A-rating and assign them to a worker during that period).</p>

<h4>Reclaiming invalid CoS</h4>

<p>SK12.22. If we find, after allocating you a Defined CoS, but before you have assigned it to a worker, that the application was in fact invalid, we will reclaim it from your SMS account. If you still need a Defined CoS, you will need to apply again.</p>

<h3>Changes to the details on a Defined CoS</h3>

<p>SK12.23. When you apply for a Defined CoS, the information you give in your application, such as the salary and job description, will appear on the CoS that is allocated to you if your application is successful. When you are ready to assign that CoS to a worker, you will not be able to change any of these pre-populated fields.</p>

<p>SK12.24. You can, however, add a sponsor note to let us know of the following changes only:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Change</th>
      <th scope="col">Extent to which change is permitted</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Salary</td>
      <td>You can change the salary you will pay to the worker, but the revised salary must be eligible for the same number of points as the salary stated in the original application for that CoS. If it is not, we will cancel the CoS.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Start and end date of the job</td>
      <td>You can amend either or both of these dates – but remember, the start date cannot be more than 3 months after the date the worker makes their application for entry clearance or permission to stay.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>SK12.25. These are the only changes you can make to a Defined CoS when you assign it. If anything else has changed, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a change in salary beyond the limits set out in the table above; or</li>
  <li>a change to the occupation code or job description</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
you must tell us so we can cancel the CoS</p>

<h3>If you give false information in your application</h3>

<p>SK12.26. You must only assign a Defined CoS if you intend to employ the worker according to the details stated in the application you made for it, or in any sponsor note added in the circumstances permitted above. If we subsequently find that you gave false information in your application, we will revoke your sponsor licence. Examples include, but are not limited to, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we find (either through a compliance visit or checking with HMRC) that the salary you pay to a worker whose application for permission was supported by a Defined CoS is lower than the salary stated in your application for that CoS</li>
  <li>you have assigned the CoS for a job other than the one described in the application for that CoS</li>
  <li>you have used an inappropriate occupation code to meet the skill level</li>
</ul>

<p>SK13.5. If the worker will not be employed in one of the above occupation codes, they will not be eligible for the Health and Care visa and will have to qualify under the standard Skilled Worker rules (and pay the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application">Immigration Health Charge</a>).</p>

<p>SK13.6. Health and Care visa applicants must meet all of the standard <a class="govuk-link" href="#SK3-immigration-requirements">immigration requirements</a> of the Skilled Worker route, in addition to the specific Health and Care visa requirements.</p>

<h3>Additional information you must include on the CoS</h3>

<p>SK13.7. When you assign a CoS to a Skilled Worker for a Health and Care visa, or apply for a Defined CoS that you intend to assign to such a worker, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>include in the ‘Summary of job description’ field of the CoS:
    <ul>
      <li>a brief explanation of how the worker meets the Health and Care visa criteria – for example, that they work for an NHS trust in one of the above occupation codes</li>
      <li>if you are a private organisation, provide brief information about the contract or agreement you have with NHS trusts or bodies to provide those services</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>tell the worker they are eligible for the Health and Care visa so they can correctly complete their visa application form – if you fail to do so, the worker’s visa application may be rejected</li>
</ul>

<p>SK13.8. If you forget to include information about how the worker meets the criteria or your contractual arrangements (if relevant) in the ‘Summary of job description’ field, you must add a ‘sponsor note’ with this information after you have assigned the CoS.</p>

<p>SK13.9. If you are a private organisation providing services on behalf of the NHS, we may ask you to submit evidence of your arrangements with the NHS. You must give us this evidence if asked.</p>
