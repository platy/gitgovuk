<p>Ukraine is the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the Second World War. Over 5.2 million refugees have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries since the conflict started <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In response to the continuing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, the UK government is providing humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Scale of humanitarian need</h2>

<p>The United Nations (<abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>) estimates that over 15.7 million people need humanitarian support within Ukraine, with over 25% of the population having been forced to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Food, medicine and basic hygiene items are scarce in the worst-hit areas. Ensuring humanitarian aid gets in and people can get out of these areas is a major challenge.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>UK government humanitarian objectives</h2>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, working with other UK government departments, aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide humanitarian aid in Ukraine and to people seeking refuge in the region. This includes protection and life-saving assistance, with a focus on women and children</li>
  <li>work with our allies to ensure that the international humanitarian system delivers a well-coordinated and well-funded response</li>
  <li>press for respect for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and call for unimpeded humanitarian access to ensure humanitarian aid gets to those who need it most and enable people to leave the worst affected areas safely</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What the UK government is doing</h2>

<p>The UK government quickly committed large-scale humanitarian funding, sent experts to the region, and delivered life-saving supplies from London to Kyiv, including medical and food aid.</p>

<p>The UK is providing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukraine-uk-pledges-another-80million-in-aid-to-help-ukraine-deal-with-humanitarian-crisis">£220 million of humanitarian assistance</a>. This £220 million pledge includes over £74 million to <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> and Red Cross Agencies and £25 million in matched funding to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://donation.dec.org.uk/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal" rel="external">Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal</a> – our largest ever aid match contribution.</p>

<p>The UK has over 320 staff working on the response to the crisis in the region, including humanitarian experts.</p>

<h2>
