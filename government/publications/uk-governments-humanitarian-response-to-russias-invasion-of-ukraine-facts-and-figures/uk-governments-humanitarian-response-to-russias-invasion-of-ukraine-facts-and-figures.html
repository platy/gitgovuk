<p>Ukraine is the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the Second World War. Approximately 6.65 million people inside Ukraine have been displaced since the conflict started, and 5.8 million people are registered as refugees across Europe <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In response to the continuing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, the UK government is providing humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>The United Nations (<abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>) estimates that 17.7 million people need humanitarian support within Ukraine, with around a third of the population having been forced to flee their homes.</p>

<p>Food, medicine and basic hygiene items are scarce in the worst-hit areas. Ensuring humanitarian aid gets in and people can get out of these areas is a major challenge.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>UK government humanitarian objectives</h2>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, working with other UK government departments, aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide humanitarian aid in Ukraine and to people seeking refuge in the region. This includes protection and life-saving assistance, with a focus on the most vulnerable, including women and children</li>
  <li>work with our allies to ensure that the international humanitarian system delivers a well-coordinated and well-funded response</li>
  <li>press for respect for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and call for unimpeded humanitarian access to ensure humanitarian aid gets to those who need it most and enable people to leave the worst affected areas safely</li>
</ul>

<span class="number">3. </span>What the UK government is doing</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK4Nkqtf3j4" rel="external">An overview of UK aid to Ukraine, 3 June 2022</a></p>

<p>The UK government quickly committed large-scale humanitarian funding, sending experts to the region, and delivering life-saving supplies to Ukraine, including medical and food aid.</p>

<p>The UK is providing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukraine-uk-pledges-another-80million-in-aid-to-help-ukraine-deal-with-humanitarian-crisis">£220 million of humanitarian assistance</a>. This £220 million pledge includes up to £145 million to <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> and Red Cross Agencies and £25 million in matched funding to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://donation.dec.org.uk/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal" rel="external">Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal (DEC)</a> – our largest ever aid match contribution. The DEC website explains <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.dec.org.uk/article/how-donations-are-helping-people-fleeing-conflict-in-ukraine" rel="external">how donations to this appeal are helping people fleeing conflict in Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>The priority for UK funding is to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-provides-further-humanitarian-aid-focused-on-most-vulnerable-in-ukraine">support the most vulnerable people</a>, including women and children, the elderly and disabled, in Ukraine and in the region around Ukraine.</p>

<p>We have provided £25 million to the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Refugee Agency as they support host governments in neighbouring countries to receive and care for refugees.
