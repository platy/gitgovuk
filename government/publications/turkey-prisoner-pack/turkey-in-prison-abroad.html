<p>This information is not meant to be definitive and is not a substitute for independent legal advice. Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage, or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information.

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Key Points</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you, but they cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer. Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad</a>.</p>

<p>This detention information pack is designed to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Turkey and who can help.  A printed copy is provided to those in prison or in custody. We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h4>Contacting us</h4>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British Embassy/Consulate and must do so if you want them to</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>even if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself, and should do so, particularly if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>friends or family can also contact the local British Embassy/Consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on 020 7008 5000</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British Embassy/Consulate even if you don’t want anyone to know that you have been arrested. This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British Government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>What we can do</h3>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help.  Once notified of your arrest or detention, consular staff will aim to contact you as soon as possible so that we can assess how we can help you.  We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions: our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>In Turkey, notification by the authorities to the Embassy/Consulate normally takes place within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Once we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide a list of local English-speaking <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/turkey-list-of-lawyers">lawyers and interpreters</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system including if legal aid is available</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep in regular contact with you, either by visiting or by letter. The frequency of contact will depend on local conditions and your personal circumstances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including medication</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>put you, or your family, in touch with a prisoners’ welfare charity called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in some circumstances we may be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>help to transfer money to you from your friends or family. In places where phone or postal services aren’t available, we can also pass on messages and deliver letters to the prison but generally we cannot arrange for delivery directly to you (see Prison: Access to help and services section below for more information)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in some circumstances we may be able to help you apply for a transfer to a prison in the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>What we can’t do</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>get you out of prison or detention</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>help you get special treatment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pay for any costs as a result of being arrested</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>forward you packages sent by friends or family</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prevent authorities from deporting you after release</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>First Steps</h3>

<h4>Can you / will you tell my family?</h4>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and can provide them with information about how to contact you in prison or detention. With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your well-being.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider the impact that not doing so might have.  For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h4>Will the UK Police be informed?</h4>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances in which information about you may need to be shared by ourselves or authorities in Turkey.</p>

<h4>Do I need a lawyer?  How can I find a lawyer?</h4>

<p>Although we cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime, we can offer basic information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. A list of local interpreters and English-speaking lawyers can be found at the end of this page. You will want to consider the benefits of local legal representation and to discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. In no circumstances can we pay your legal or interpretation costs.</p>

<h4>Can you get me out?</h4>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for you because you are British.  However, if you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards, we will consider whether to approach local authorities. This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for fair trial or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h4>Who else can help me?</h4>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with <a class="govuk-link" href="www.prisonersabroad.org.uk">Prisoners Abroad</a>, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Detention conditions in Turkey</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<h4>Can my family and friends visit me? How can I arrange a visit?</h4>

<p>Only close family are permitted to visit (Parents, children, spouses, siblings, aunts, uncles, nieces &amp; nephews). However, prisoners are allowed to nominate up to three people by filling in a “Friend form”. This form must be submitted within 60 days of arrest. Prisoners’ friends who are nominated are allowed visits if approved by the Public Prosecutor or Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>You are allowed one visit per week up to a total of four visits monthly: 3 closed, 1 open.</p>

<p>Depending on the nature of the offence, some visit applications may require permission from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This must be arranged by the Embassy/Consulate and takes a minimum of four weeks. Please contact the consular case officer should you wish to arrange this. Please ensure that you do not book travel until visit permission is received.</p>

<p>Visit applications which do not require permission from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, can be made in person to the public prosecutor on the day of the visit along with the below documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>petition letter to public prosecutor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>photocopy of passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>document showing the relationship between the prisoner and visitor (Issued by Consular staff)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The family should contact the British Embassy/Consulate in advance to book an appointment prior to the visit in order to obtain the necessary documents required by the public prosecutor.</p>

<p>Visitors must show their passport and the permission approved by the prosecutor in charge when they arrive at the prison. These are held by the prison and the passport is returned at the end of the visit.  Visitors will be searched before entering the prison.</p>

<h4>What can visitors expect?</h4>

<p>There are two types of visits: closed and open. Closed visits are where prisoner and visitor sit either side of a glass window and speak to each other on the phone.  Open visits are conducted in the ‘lawyers’ rooms’ where the prisoner and visitor can sit at opposite sides of a table. Visits can last up to 60 minutes. Guards are present during visits. In normal circumstances visits take place as planned. In recently built prisons you should expect to have retina scans entering and exiting the secure areas.</p>

<h4>What can visitors bring?</h4>

<p>Only clothes, books and magazines can be brought to prisoners, although some prisons do not accept anything else other than clothes. All bags and parcels will be searched before entry and authorities have the right to withhold items, they deem to be unacceptable. Clothes for prisoners in green, blue and khaki-coloured are not acceptable.</p>

<h4>Visits: Consular staff</h4>

<p>We hope to visit you every 6 to 12 months. You will be called to the prison’s ‘lawyers’ rooms during a Consular visit. If there are any mistreatment, welfare or medical issues we may make urgent visits between regular ones. Prisoners may send faxes to the Embassy/Consulates via prison authorities.</p>

<h4>Emergency trips outside of prison</h4>

<p>If the prison authorities and the Chief Public Prosecutor deem it appropriate, prisoners may be granted compassionate leave to attend funerals and visit critically ill immediate family members.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h3>

<h4>Arrival at the police station and basic rights</h4>

<p>Following arrest, the detainee should be informed, in English (if necessary, via an interpreter), why they have been arrested. Adults can be held in police cells for up to 24 hours maximum by which time they must either appear before a judge or be released. Up to 12 hrs can be added to 24 hrs for transfer from police station to the nearest court. If the crime falls under the jurisdiction of the high criminal courts that are responsible for serious crimes, this period is 48 hours. The only exceptions are mass crimes and terrorism where a person can be held up to 4 days. In addition, according to Counter Terrorism Law the detention period may be extended furthermore in complex cases.</p>

<p>If the detained foreigner does not object in writing, his/her situation is reported to the Embassy/Consulate. Please note, the British Embassy/Consulate will only inform family and friends of the arrest if the detainee authorises us to do so (there are some exceptions if you are a minor).</p>

<p>Detainees are examined by an entitled state doctor before and after detention. This makes it easier to investigate allegations of torture and ill-treatment.</p>

<p>Meeting with the detainee is a right granted only to his lawyer. Relatives or friends do not have the right to meet with the detainee. Embassy/Consulate staff do not have the right to visit you at the police station.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental rights that should be notified to the suspect or the accused before the interrogation is the right to benefit from the legal assistance of a lawyer. The suspect is informed before the arrest inquiry that s/he has the right to choose a lawyer and that s/he can benefit from legal assistance of a lawyer. If s/he is not in a position to choose a lawyer and if s/he wants to benefit from the legal assistance of the lawyer, s/he will be appointed a lawyer by the bar association, free of charge. The lawyer can be present in his/her statement or interrogation, before the arrest inquiry.</p>

<p>The detainee is allowed to report his/her arrest to a relative or designated person personally, provided that the purpose of the investigation is not endangered. Otherwise, the police or lawyer will inform the family about detention.</p>

<p>The detainee’s personal belongings, including mobile phones, will be held by the police and they will be given a receipt for these. The belongings will accompany the detainee to court and, if released by the judge, they will be returned to the detainee, unless they are kept as part of the court´s investigations.</p>

<p>Detainee will have access to food and water during their stay at the police station.</p>

<h4>Appearance at court</h4>

<p>There is no jury system in Turkey. Court trials are heard by the judge or panel of judges depending on the crime. The Court is made up of one or three judges alongside the court clerk, the prosecutor, the lawyer, the accused and the translator/interpreter. It is compulsory that all the above are present at the court hearing, otherwise it will be adjourned. All documents related to a case and further evidence must be submitted to the President of the Court. The trial will be heard in Turkish. The Court appoints and pays for an interpreter. Consular staff cannot act as interpreters.  Consular officers can check before the hearing if a lawyer and an interpreter are appointed. Consular Officers do not normally attend the hearings.</p>

<p>Turkish courts are very busy therefore the trials may take several years before a decision is made.</p>

<p>More information about the Turkey judicial system can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#the-turkish-judicial-system">the section ‘The Turkish judicial system</a></p>

<h4>Initial arrival at the prison</h4>

<p>Upon arrival you will be placed temporarily in the admittance cell. Here you will receive general information about prison rules and regulations in English. Within a few days the Prison Board will decide which cell is best suited for you and you will be moved to your permanent cell following the Board’s decision.</p>

<p>On arrival, whether on remand or after sentence, a prisoner will be searched and routinely documented. All money, jewellery and/or other valuables, medicine and toiletries should be declared and handed in to the authorities. They will be kept in the belongings department (“Emanet”) and a receipt will be given to the prisoner until their release or transfer elsewhere.</p>

<p>Also on arrival, the prisoner will be interviewed by the doctor and a social worker. Any medication must be declared, and the prison doctor will decide which they can keep or be kept in the infirmary. The doctor should be told of any on-going medical condition (it may be helpful to provide the prison medical staff with previous medical records).</p>

<p>The prisoner may keep and use their own clothing but there is a limit to number of clothing they can keep in their cell at one time. The rest of the clothing will be kept at deposit office (“Emanet”) and can be swapped when necessary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Prison: conditions and daily life</h3>

<p>As of 26/07/2021 there are totally 368 prisons in Turkey with a total capacity  of 251.089. There are differences among these facilities due to their type (open, closed, half closed), size and age of the building. Only some prisons accept foreign nationals. Although living conditions may change from prison to prison they accommodate library, infirmary, open air break areas and art/craft courses.</p>

<h4>Accommodation</h4>

<p>Sentenced prisoners and those on remand stay in the same cells. Over-crowding can be a major problem in some prisons. Women’s prisons are separate to men’s prisons. The number of inmates to a cell depends on the size of the cell and the number of prisoners in any one prison. A large prison can have dormitories with a capacity of 28 people split in to 7 rooms. Toilets and showers are mostly shared. Hot water is supplied. Laundry facilities are available but basic. Prisoners are responsible for the cleaning of their cell.</p>

<h4>Food and diet</h4>

<p>Prison food is free but very basic. Prisons supply 3 meals a day and they are typical Turkish cuisine. You will need funds to pay for supplements to your diet such as tea, coffee, sugar, fruit, sweets etc which can be bought from the prison shop (“Kantin”). Special diets for health reasons may be available in some prisons but not for religious/lifestyle requirements. Tap water suitable for drinking is available and you may buy bottled water from the prison shop.</p>

<h4>Hygiene</h4>

<p>Shower/bathing facilities are communal. Hot water is provided during designated days and hours. Prisoners need to buy their own toiletries from prison shop.</p>

<h4>Work and study</h4>

<p>Various workshops and courses are available however these activities have a limited capacity and the waiting list is usually long. All the workshops/courses are in Turkish and there is no interpretation service.</p>

<h4>Contact and languages</h4>

<p>If you are placed in a ward you may socialize with inmates. Although there will be prisoners of different nationalities it is not always possible to have English speaking inmates. Most of the guards do not speak English. You may order a Turkish/English dictionary to facilitate your communication with inmates and guards. Learning the language: speaking Turkish will help you understand what is going on, enable you to communicate your needs and ease the boredom and mental isolation of prison life.</p>

<p>Prisons have libraries but they may not have any books in English. If your prison accepts books the Embassy/Consulate will try to provide you some from donations. You may also order from outside but be aware that foreign language books are very expensive and not widely available in every area.</p>

<p>There is the possibility to request local language materials through the post from Prisoners Abroad (including language textbooks and dictionaries) if you are at a prison which accepts books.</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

<p>For you to maintain good physical and mental health, you will be given at least one hour a day to walk or work out in the prison yard. Different prisons offer different leisure activities.</p>

<h4>Climate</h4>

<p>Turkey is about 3.2 times bigger in size than the United Kingdom. Due to this fact 3 different climates (Mediterranean, Continental and Oceanic) are dominant in Turkey and the weather condition may change from region to region. Prisoners must provide their own clothing.  You may not keep blue, green or khaki-coloured clothes.</p>

<h4>Religion</h4>

<p>Imams and religion and ethics teachers give religion and ethics lessons, religious conferences and seminars to prisoners up to 24 hours a week in institutions.</p>

<p>Prisoners who have religious beliefs other than Islam can also meet with an authorized representative of their religion and receive religious and moral assistance from them, along with being able to obtain religious books.</p>

<h4>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h4>

<p>All arriving prisoners are seen by the prison psychologist. Any prisoners that have a drug addiction are monitored by the psychologist to ensure they are able to recover suitably. It is widely known that drug trafficking between inmates in prisons is widespread. Prisoners or detainees caught with any kind of illegal substances are punished accordingly by the prison authorities. Cigarettes are usually allowed inside Turkish prisons.</p>

<p>Incidences of harassment, threats or violence are rare, but if you do experience such treatment, you should report this to your Consular Representative as soon as possible. It is our responsibility to take up allegations of mistreatment against a British national.  We will only raise concerns with the prison administration if you request that we do so.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Prison: access to help and services</h3>

<h4>How can I receive money?</h4>

<p>There are two ways in which you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>private funds: deposited to you by your family or friends. See Annex for instructions on how to send funds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prisoners Abroad: depending on where you are detained, if your family can’t support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The British Government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners</p>

<h4>Private funds</h4>

<p>While the FCO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family.</p>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) operates a “Prison Comfort” system for money transfers to prisoners. Please ask your family to get in touch with the FCDO in order to arrange this.</p>

<p>We are unable to receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<p>Some prisons accept money transfers from abroad whereas others do not. Please ask the consular officers in the nearest Embassy/Consulate to check current regulations regarding money transfers.</p>

<h4>Prisoners Abroad</h4>

<p>In addition, Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity, may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not in receipt of any regular donations from other sources. Prisoners in Turkey are eligible for two of the three Prisoners Abroad funds; the Craig Feehan Fund and the Medical Fund.  Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#prisoners-abroad">Prisoners Abroad section</a> for more details.</p>

<h4>Can I receive medical and dental treatment?</h4>

<p>In the larger prisons, there is a health service under the authority of a practitioner. This service has an infirmary where basic medical treatment can be given, a dental treatment unit, a dentist and adequate staff. Daily examinations, vaccinations and urgent dental care of the prisoners as well as examinations of newly arrived prisoners in the institution are carried out by this service.</p>

<p>There are also 5 psychiatric centres in 5 prisons located close to psychiatric hospitals.</p>

<p>All state hospitals in Turkey have a special ward for prisoners.</p>

<p>If you need medical or dental treatment you should ask for an appointment to see the prison doctor or dentist. You write a request letter which is collected by prison wardens and passed to the medical division of the prison. Depending on the number of patients and the urgency of the situation, prisoners may be assisted the same day or after 2-3 days. Basic medical attention is free of charge. It is unlikely that you will be treated by an English speaking doctor. If you have a long-standing medical problem and have received treatment for this in the UK, it may be useful if you have your medical records, or at least a report, sent from your doctor in the UK.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor.  We can also liaise with your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests.</p>

<h4>Mail/Parcels</h4>

<p>Friends/family can send mail/parcels directly to the prison from abroad.  In some prisons it is known to take a long time to receive the mail/parcel. If necessary, Consular staff may deliver vital mail or parcels (such as necessary clothing) from family/friends to the prison during routine visits. The Embassy/Consulate is not able to forward mail on your behalf back to UK. All letters are opened and checked by prison staff before they are given to prisoners. Prison management only accept parcels sent by postal service, parcels which are sent by private courier companies are not accepted. Please note that some parcels may be subject to customs duty. Parcels that are subject to customs duty are kept at the depot of the Postal Service and a notification will be sent to the prison. As it is not possible for a prisoner to pay the duty and collect the parcel from the depot, you should expect the parcel to be sent back to the UK after 30 days of arrival in Turkey. Please note that delays may occur during this process.</p>

<h4>Can I make telephone calls?</h4>

<p>Usually there is weekly access to a payphone. Telephone cards are sold at the prison. You are only allowed to call immediate family, and a list of their numbers will need to be given to the prison authorities by the Embassy or Consulate.</p>

<h4>How can I make a complaint about mistreatment?</h4>

<p>If you have been mistreated, please inform Consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and inform you of any local complaint’s procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider. With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, please try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible, photos of the injuries you received. Alternatively, you can contact the Public Prosecutor responsible for the prison or the Prison Manager directly.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>The Turkish judicial system</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Overview and first steps</h3>

<h4>Is the system the same as the UK?</h4>

<p>In short, no, although on the face of it there are many similarities. For example, prisoners are presumed innocent until proven guilty; they have a right to legal representation, interpreter, fair trial and appeal. However, there are fundamental differences. For example, there is no jury system. Overall, the Turkish judicial system is very bureaucratic. Prisoners can remain in prison without having been sentenced for six months or more.</p>

<p>There are three types of courts, the Criminal Peace Court (Sulh Ceza), the Criminal Court of First Instance (Asliye Ceza) and the High Criminal Court (Ağır Ceza).  Remember that you should never sign anything you cannot read.  If you find yourself under pressure to sign, ask to speak to a representative from the British Embassy/Consulate.</p>

<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>

<h4>What should happen when I am arrested?</h4>

<p>Whether arrested at the airport or elsewhere, you will usually remain in a police cell for a day or two before you are taken to court to give your pre-hearing statement to the prosecutor. At this point, depending on the evidence, the judge decides to either arrest or release. If the decision is ‘arrest’ you are taken to prison to await your court hearing. The court hearing date is usually 3-6 months after the prosecutor’s first decision. In the police cells and in prison you will probably share a cell with several other people. You may have access to your belongings, but this depends on whether the police consider them as evidence. If considered as evidence, you will not be allowed to keep your possessions. Your passport and other identification will be taken and kept by the prison authorities in your file. Following arrest, the detainee should be informed, in English (if necessary, via an interpreter), why they have been arrested. Adults can be held in police cells for up to 24 hours maximum by which time they must either appear before a judge or be released. Up to 12 hrs can be added to 24 hrs for transfer from the police station to the nearest court. If the crime falls under the jurisdiction of the high criminal court which is responsible for serious crimes, this period is 48 hours. The only exceptions are mass crimes and terrorism where a person can be held up to 4 days. In addition, according to Counter Terrorism Law the detention period may be extended furthermore in complex cases.</p>

<p>If the detained foreigner does not object in writing, his/her situation is reported to the Embassy/Consulate. Please note, the British Embassy/Consulate will only inform family and friends of the arrest if the detainee authorises us to do so (there are some exceptions if you are a minor).</p>

<p>Detainees are examined by an entitled state doctor before and after detention. This makes it easier to investigate allegations of torture and ill-treatment.</p>

<p>Should you have any questions concerning the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. A list of local English-speaking lawyers is provided at the end of this pack.</p>

<h4>For how long can I be remanded in custody?</h4>

<p>It’s not unusual to be remanded in custody for between 6 and 24 months depending on your trial status. You are subject to the same rules and regulations as convicted prisoners when you are held in remand.</p>

<h4>What happens when I am charged?</h4>

<p>The suspect or defendant is told about the charge brought against her/him before taking statements or interrogation. The fact, which is the basis of the accusation and what crime it constitutes should be made known to the accused person. It is not possible to take a statement or make an interrogation without explaining what the suspect or defendant is accused of in a way that does not leave any room for hesitation. The decision of arrest is made by the Criminal Judge of Peace or the Judge of the Court at the prosecution stage. The orders for arrest are recorded digitally. If the procedures related to detention are made at the police station or gendarmerie, these transactions are recorded with a camera system. The person is reminded about whether he has requested a lawyer before being questioned, that he has the right to remain silent and that he has the right to collect the evidence he wants within the scope of his right to defence. There are some exceptions to recording statements in sexual crimes. The police, gendarme or court will provide an interpreter during the statements.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for bail?</h4>

<p>Bail is rarely granted for foreigners. Foreigners holding a valid residence permit or those who are married to a Turkish National can be granted bail depending on the charge. The FCO is not able to facilitate the transfer of bail funds. Bail restrictions can differ according to individual situations. A prisoner who qualifies for bail may have to  relinquish their passport to the Turkish authorities and a travel ban may be issued as part of the bail agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Trial and legal assistance</h3>

<h4>What kind of legal assistance is available?</h4>

<p>If you wish to hire a private lawyer, a list of English-speaking lawyers is provided at the end of this pack. Prisoners Abroad can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>Consular staff cannot give legal advice, but they can provide you with a list of lawyers, all of whom speak English. You may choose to appoint a lawyer to represent you; a list of lawyers in your area is included in this information pack. The British Embassy/Consulate cannot pay legal fees or guarantee to a lawyer that you will pay them.</p>

<p>If you do not have funds to hire a lawyer yourself, the court must appoint one. State appointed lawyers are free of charge, but they rarely speak English. As in any country, some lawyers are better than others (paying a large fee does not guarantee that you will get a good lawyer). If you decide to pay for a lawyer, it may be possible to agree a flat fee for the whole case before they begin work so that you do not find yourself facing ‘extra expenses’. Lawyers ask for a down payment before they start representing you.</p>

<h4>What happens at the trial?</h4>

<p>There is no jury system in Turkey. Court Trials are heard by the judge or panel of judges depending on the crime. The Court is made up of one or three judges, alongside the Court Clerk, the prosecutor, the lawyer, the accused and the translator/interpreter. It is compulsory that all of the above are present at the court hearing, otherwise it will be adjourned. All documents related to a case and further evidence must be submitted to the President of the Court. The trial will be heard in Turkish. The Court appoints and pays for an interpreter. Consular staff cannot act as interpreters.  No action can be taken without a court appointed interpreter. Consular Officers usually do not attend the hearings.</p>

<p>It usually takes between 3 to 6 months for cases to be brought to trial.</p>

<h4>Sentences</h4>

<p>At the end of the criminal trial, the court can give the following verdicts on the defendant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>acquittal, or not guilty</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>imprisonment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>security measures: meaning sanctions that take into consideration the safety of the perpetrator, such as any mental health issues that need to be addressed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>dismissal of the case</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discontinuance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no ground for sentence: unlike acquittal, this verdict is given when a crime was committed but the accused is deemed unable to be penalised by law</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once the defendant is acquitted or completed his sentence he will be released from prison and will be transferred to the nearest Deportation Centre by law enforcement officers. Deportation Centres are run by the Migration Management Directorate. The BN will be deported as soon as possible.</p>

<h4>How can appeals be made?</h4>

<p>Lawyers, on behalf of their client, have a right to appeal against the final decision within seven working days. It is common practice to appeal to make sure that the sentence is reviewed by an Appeal Court. There are two levels of appeal; the first one is the District Appeal Court and the second one is the Supreme Court in Ankara (capital of Turkey)</p>

<p>The appeal process is very slow can lead to delays in finalising the sentence. Because the appeal must be finished before a prisoner can apply for prison transfer to the UK, this process can cause a long delay.  Prisoners have a right to withdraw the appeal if they wish.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>What provision is there for reduction of sentence (remission) e.g. for good behaviour?</h4>

<p>The judge may decide to make deductions from the sentence for the good behaviour of the prisoner.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for early release, such as parole?</h4>

<p>Depending on the charge once half, two thirds or three quarters of a sentence is complete, an observation board will assess the prisoner`s case and the prisoner may receive the right to be transferred to an open prison or be released on parole.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for clemency or pardon?</h4>

<p>There has been no clemency since the abolition of the death sentence in Turkey. General Pardons (Genel Af) depend on the political dynamics of the country, but note that crimes considered as affecting the core values and conscience of society (e.g. rape, child abuse, serial murder etc.) are not subjected to Pardon.</p>

<h4>What about any financial penalties?</h4>

<p>Financial penalties form part of the sentence given. Financial penalties are not usually large amounts. Judicial fine is between 20 and 100 TL per day and depends on the judge’s evaluation.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to another prison within Turkey possible?</h4>

<p>Yes, but only when there are exceptional compassionate, medical or administrative reasons for doing so. Local prison directors must authorise the transfer. If you have been convicted, you will be allocated to a prison to serve your sentence. If you are interested in a transfer, please speak to your Embassy/Consulate who can raise your request in writing with the prison authorities. Not all prisons accept foreign prisoners.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to the UK a possibility?</h4>

<p>Yes, if all parties agree and only after being sentenced with no pending appeal. Turkey has ratified the Strasbourg Convention under which transfers are possible to the UK. The prisoner should submit a written petition for transfer (translated into Turkish) to the prison authorities. The Embassy/Consulate will help with this. Transfers can only take place once the prisoner’s final verdict is authorised, and the closed file has been received by the prosecutor in charge.</p>

<p>To transfer, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be a British citizen or have close family ties with the UK (normally through permanent residence in the UK)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not be awaiting trial</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have exhausted all appeals against your conviction and/or the length of your sentence; or have waived your right to an appeal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have at least 6 months of your sentence left to serve when you apply for transfer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have no outstanding fines or other non-custodial penalties</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The offence you were convicted for must also be a criminal offence in the part of the UK you wish to be transferred to: England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The authorities in the sentencing country may refuse your request. You should be aware that even if the sentencing state agrees to your transfer, then the UK authorities may also refuse your request. Reasons for this might include if you have not lived in the UK for a number of years and you have no close family residents there.</p>

<h4>What are the procedures for release and deportation?</h4>

<p>Once the defendant is acquitted or has completed his sentence he will be released from prison and will be transferred to the nearest Deportation Centre by law enforcement officers. Deportation Centres are run by the Migration Management Directorate. The BN will be deported as soon as possible. In most cases the Embassy/Consulate will be made aware of deportation. If the BN’s passport has expired or been lost the Embassy/Consulate will help to apply for a Travel document.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. Possibly you have never lived in the UK and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may simply want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Prisoners Abroad you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance it is best to write and tell your caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroad Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>making appointments with doctors and dentists</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Later, you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency.</p>

<h4>Would I have a criminal record in the UK?</h4>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>

<h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>FCDO letter: financial assistance – how to send money to the FCDO</h3>

<p>Each detainee has a personal account in the prison and funds can be deposited there for their use and withdrawn as necessary. It is possible for family and / or friends to transfer money through the FCDO in London and avoid paying bank charges (on smaller transfers). Some prisons in Turkey will also accept fund transfers via banks; detainees should enquire with the prison administration office if this is the case in the prison they are in and advise their families and friends accordingly.</p>

<p>The various ways monies can be sent via the FCDO are detailed below. Under the Consular Fees Order of 2016/2017, we are obliged to charge for this service. The fee is dependent on the amount that the depositor wishes to transfer as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Amount being sent</td>
      <td>Fee</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>One monthly payment up to £100</td>
      <td>Free</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Each additional payment or amount of £0.01 - £99.99</td>
      <td>£10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Each additional payment or amount of £100 - £499.99</td>
      <td>£25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Each additional payment or amount of £500 and above</td>
      <td>£50</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>When forwarding funds, the depositor should add the above fee to the amount that they wish to transfer. For example, if they want the recipient to receive £150, they will need to send us £175 (£150 to forward plus £25 fee).</p>

<p>If other friends and family also plan to transfer funds in the same month, they should consider coordinating payments so they know what FCDO fees to expect. We retain the right to further deduct any local overseas charges we may incur in passing the fees to the recipient.</p>

<p>Should we be unable to pay the funds locally to the recipient, FCDO policy is to refund amounts above £5 to the depositor by bank transfer. In this case, the depositor would be contacted for their bank details. Refunds may take several weeks as our internal processes can only start once all relevant costs have been cleared with local authorities.</p>

<p>Please note that our Corporate Service Centre in Milton Keynes is only responsible for payments. All other correspondence concerning the above named should be addressed to consular staff in Turkey.
Please note that we can only advance funds to the person overseas once the payment has cleared in our account.</p>

<h4>Electronic bank transfers</h4>

<p>Payment by electronic/internet bank transfer can be made either using online or telephone banking, or at a local bank or building society. For all bank transfers, the following details will be needed:</p>
