<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1 This Annual Report on Devolution has been laid before both Houses of Parliament by the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities pursuant to section 1 of the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016 (‘the 2016 Act’).</p>

<p>1.2 This Annual Report brings together updated information about devolution agreements reached or implemented between Government and areas between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>1.3 These devolution agreements, in response to proposals from areas, are agreements in which the Government undertakes to devolve powers and budgets to an area in return for changes in local governance and local political accountability.</p>

<p>1.4 Devolution within England aims to provide local areas with the levers they need to boost productivity in local economies and improve and integrate public services.</p>

<p>1.5 These devolution arrangements form part of the Government’s plans to level up across the country, and we will continue to engage with local areas looking to agree new devolution deals in the year ahead.</p>

<p>1.6 As set out in the Levelling Up White Paper, this Government will extend, deepen and simplify devolution across England so that by 2030, every part of England that wants one will have a devolution deal with powers at or approaching the highest level of devolution with a simplified, long-term funding settlement. We will open negotiations on deeper devolution deals with the West Midlands and Greater Manchester combined authorities, to act as the blueprint for other MCAs to follow. We will recast the geography of MCAs, where necessary, to ensure greater economic coherence. We have invited nine areas to agree new ‘County’ devolution deals, extending devolution to much more of England.</p>

<p>1.7 This Annual Report on Devolution covers a period during which areas have been responding to the outbreak of COVID-19. Throughout this financial year some COVID-19 funding has been delivered through Local Authorities and – in some instances – Combined Authorities. Such funds have not been captured in this year’s report as it focuses on financial resources that have been devolved as a result of agreements with local areas.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Areas with agreements</h2>

<p>Legislative requirement: Section 1 (2)(a) of the 2016 Act requires the Report to provide information on the areas of the country where agreements have been reached.</p>

<p>2.1 Between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, the Government confirmed no agreements with new areas, but progress has been made on the following areas where agreements had previously been reached:</p>

<p>2.2 Following the announcement by the Chancellor on 11 March 2020 that a West Yorkshire devolution deal was agreed, the West Yorkshire Combined Authority (Election of Mayor and Functions) Order 2021 to implement the West Yorkshire deal was made on 29 January 2021. This established the office of Mayor of West Yorkshire with the first election held on 6 May 2021. This legislation confers significant powers on the Mayor and Combined Authority including transport; education, skills and training; housing and regeneration. It also conferred, from 10 May 2021, the office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) on the Combined Authority, to be exercised by the Mayor.</p>

<p>2.3 The West Yorkshire Combined Authority (Election of Mayor and Functions) Order 2021 opens the way to the funding in the deal being made available to West Yorkshire. The Government have paid in 2020-21, the first £38m gainshare, subject to the West Yorkshire Combined Authority having satisfactorily put in place the required assurance framework.</p>

<p>2.4 In January 2020, the Sheffield City Region Combined Authority took the decision to progress their stalled devolution deal, previously agreed in 2015. After the local consultation ended in March 2020, the Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield Combined Authority (Functions and Amendment) Order 2020 was made on 27 July 2020 to implement the deal. In September 2020 Government made the first £30m annual investment fund payment to the MCA.</p>

<p>2.5 The publication of the draft Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) was due to be consulted upon from December 2020 but did not progress following Stockport Council’s decision on 3 December not to support. The remaining 9 constituent councils of the GMCA who supported the GMSF consultation have agreed in principle to continue with a joint local plan – called Places for Everyone - without Stockport. Therefore, there will not be a single plan which covers the whole of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority area. The constituent councils agreed to work towards a consultation on the joint local plan in the summer of 2021, with a view to the plan being adopted in the following financial year (2022-23).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Areas that have submitted proposals</h2>

<p>Legislative requirement: Section 1 (2)(b) of the 2016 Act requires the Report to provide information on the areas of the country where proposals have been received by the Secretary of State and negotiations have taken place but agreement has not yet been reached.</p>

<p>3.1 Between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, Hull and East Yorkshire (Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire) and York and North Yorkshire (York, North Yorkshire County Council, Harrogate, Selby, Craven, Scarborough, Ryedale, Richmondshire and Hambleton) were the areas that submitted formal proposals.</p>

<p>3.2 It is the Government’s intention to enter into negotiations on a mayoral devolution deal with York and North Yorkshire during 2022 and take forward discussions on an expanded Mayoral Combined Authority for the North East. Government will enter negotiations with a number of areas for County Deals, details of which are set out in the Levelling Up White Paper.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Functions exercisable by a Minister of the Crown that have been devolved</h2>

<p>Legislative requirement: Section 1 (2)(c) of the 2016 Act requires the Report to provide information on functions exercisable by a Minister of the Crown that have been devolved as a result of agreements so as to become exercisable by a mayor for the area of a combined authority (including information as to any such functions that remain exercisable by a Minister of the Crown as a result of an agreement providing for functions to be exercisable jointly or concurrently).</p>

<p>4.1 Between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, two statutory instruments (‘SIs’) were made to implement devolution agreements between the Government and areas. These SIs provided for the conferral of powers to establish the West Yorkshire Combined Authority and Sheffield City Region Combined Authority.</p>

<p>The following SIs were made between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, listed in chronological order:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Consideration of devolving powers to local government</h2>

<p>Legislative requirement: Section 1 (2)(e) of the Act requires the Report to provide information on the extent to which consideration has been given by a Minister of the Crown to the principle that powers should be devolved to combined authorities or the most appropriate local level except where those powers can more effectively be exercised by central government.</p>

<p>6.1 Over the reporting period, the Government continued to have discussions with areas about devolution, and to support the adoption of directly elected mayors.</p>

<p>6.2 In addition to commitments involving the immediate transfer of budgets and functions, deals negotiated to date include a wide range of commitments to further joint working between local partners and Government, including the development of business cases and Memoranda of Understanding on particular themes.</p>

<h2>Annex A: Underpinning legislation</h2>

<p>The Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016 (the 2016 Act) received Royal Assent on 28 January 2016. It amends the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 to facilitate the implementation of far more ambitious and wide-ranging devolution agreements with combined authority areas and with other areas. It is enabling legislation which provides a legislative framework which can be applied flexibly to different areas by secondary legislation. In particular, secondary legislation may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confer any local government function on a combined authority;</li>
  <li>confer any public authority function on a combined authority;</li>
  <li>provide for an elected mayor for a combined authority’s area who would exercise specified functions individually and chair the authority;</li>
  <li>provide for the mayor to undertake the functions of Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for the combined authority area (in place of the Police and Crime Commissioner); and</li>
  <li>confer any public authority function on a county council or district council.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the 2016 Act’s amendments to the 2009 Act streamline the process for establishing and changing the area of a combined authority, remove geographical limitations as to the establishment of combined authorities, and provide for streamlined governance reforms where these are agreed by one or more of the councils involved.</p>
