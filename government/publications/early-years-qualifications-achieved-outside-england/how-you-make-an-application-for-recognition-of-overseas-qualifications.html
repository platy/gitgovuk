<h2>Background</h2>

<p>If you did not get your qualification in England you will have to make an application for recognition to work as a qualified member of staff in an early years setting in England.</p>

<h2>Applications for recognition</h2>

<p>The Early Years Service provided by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ecctis.com" rel="external">UK National Information Centre (UK <abbr title="European Network of Information Centres">ENIC</abbr>)</a> ended on 31 December 2020. As of 1 January 2021, applications for recognition of overseas qualifications should now be sent for the attention of the early years workforce team.</p>

<p>Recognition will be granted where qualifications are comparable in scope, content and level to either of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-educator-level-3-qualifications-criteria">early years educator (<abbr title="early years educator">EYE</abbr>) qualifications criteria</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-practitioner-level-2-qualifications-criteria">early years practitioner (<abbr title="early years practitioner">EYP</abbr>) qualifications criteria</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should include the following in your request for recognition email to the early years workforce team:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>confirmation of either the EYE or EYP criteria that you want the qualification to be compared to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>photos of the final qualification certificate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your transcript, including a full breakdown of the content of the modules studied. Please provide us with as much detail as you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a statement of comparability (SoC) from UK ENIC (European Network of Information Centres) - the SoC will also need to include details of any English and maths qualifications obtained overseas to fulfil the literacy and numeracy requirements for level 3 early years educators</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can start an application for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.enic.org.uk/SOC" rel="external">UK <abbr title="European Network of Information Centres">ENIC</abbr> Statement of Comparability</a> on their website.</p>

<p>If any of the documents are not in English, we will need certified translations. The translations need to show the qualification title.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>We are unable to assess your request without the required evidence.</p>
</div>

<p>Email all your evidence to the early years workforce team at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:earlyyearsoverseas.qualifications@education.gov.uk">earlyyearsoverseas.qualifications@education.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>There are literacy and numeracy requirements for all candidates holding overseas qualifications.</p>

<p>Decisions already received from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> about qualifications achieved outside of England for working in the <abbr title="early years educator">EYE</abbr> or <abbr title="early years practitioner">EYP</abbr> staffing ratios will remain recognised and valid.</p>

<p>If you trained as a teacher overseas, you may be able to obtain qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>). This would enable you to work in early years or in primary schools. For more information, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts">qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>): qualify to teach in England</a>.</p>
