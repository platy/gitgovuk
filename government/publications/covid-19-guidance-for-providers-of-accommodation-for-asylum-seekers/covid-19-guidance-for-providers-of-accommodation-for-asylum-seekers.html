<p>The Home Office has a statutory requirement, under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, to arrange accommodation for asylum seekers and their dependants who would otherwise be destitute.</p>

<p>This guidance is aimed at all staff involved in providing support to asylum seekers in all accommodation settings. This guidance is of a general nature and should be treated as a guide. In the event of any conflict between any applicable legislation (including the health and safety legislation) and this guidance, the applicable legislation shall prevail.</p>

<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>This guidance has been updated to reflect changes to face coverings requirements and advice to those who are not legally required to self-isolate as a contact of someone with COVID-19 to take daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests.</p>

<h2>Main messages</h2>

<p>Accommodation providers should ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all residents are aware, understand and are regularly reminded of routine measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19</li>
  <li>measures are in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to enable residents to follow these procedures</li>
  <li>legal requirements on use of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">face coverings</a> by staff and residents in indoor public places, including hotels and hostels used for contingency accommodation are followed</li>
  <li>measures are in place to encourage and facilitate COVID-19 vaccination of residents and staff</li>
  <li>plans are in place specific to each accommodation setting covering the standard processes for:
    <ul>
      <li>the prevention of and response to COVID-19 cases</li>
      <li>management of individual cases and outbreaks in accommodation settings for asylum seekers</li>
      <li>these plans should apply to all accommodation settings including those for longer resident stays</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Staff working in accommodation settings for asylum seekers, such as initial accommodation centres (<abbr title="initial accommodation centres">IACs</abbr>) or contingency accommodation, should be aware of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/assessing-new-patients-from-overseas-migrant-health-guide">specific health needs in this population</a>. Staff should make health information available in languages that residents can understand.</p>

<p>Any NHS care received for COVID-19, including COVID-19 vaccinations, will be provided <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-entitlements-migrant-health-guide#main-messages" class="govuk-link">free of charge</a>, irrespective of immigration status. No immigration checks or NHS number are needed to enable testing or treatment of an asylum seeker for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Accommodation providers should work closely with local public health teams, as well as other partners, to ensure these measures are in place. To facilitate joint working, the local Director of Public Health should be contacted and made aware of new accommodation settings being set up as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Measures to prevent the spread of COVID-&nbsp;19</h2>

<p>Accommodation providers should be aware of what measures they can put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures should be communicated to residents in a language that they understand.</p>

<p>These measures include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advising residents of the most important symptoms of COVID-19 and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#symptoms">what to do if they have any of these</a>
</li>
  <li>ensuring residents are reminded of the legal requirements for the use of face coverings in public areas of indoor settings, specifically hotels and hostels used for contingency accommodation</li>
  <li>supporting residents and staff to use face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces or areas</li>
  <li>advising residents to wash their hands with soap and water and/or use hand sanitiser regularly throughout the day</li>
  <li>asking residents to cover their nose and mouth when they cough and sneeze</li>
  <li>encouraging and facilitating residents and staff to receive their COVID-19 vaccination, including booster doses</li>
  <li>ensuring residents and staff have the opportunity to take regular <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" class="govuk-link">rapid lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests</a> in line with current public health advice</li>
  <li>supporting residents and staff who are not legally required to self-isolate as a contact of someone with COVID-19 to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">take daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests</a>
</li>
  <li>ensuring ventilation of all spaces in accommodation settings</li>
  <li>advising staff and residents to avoid crowding in indoor spaces, for example lifts, corridors, reception areas</li>
  <li>using the NHS COVID-19 app</li>
  <li>ensuring there is a plan in place, specific to each accommodation setting, that covers processes for the prevention of and response to COVID-19 cases and outbreak management</li>
  <li>ensuring there are effective COVID-19 prevention activities and mitigations in place, such as regular room cleaning, along with COVID-19 outbreak plans</li>
</ul>

<p>Single rooms or rooms for families with en-suite bathroom facilities suitable for self-isolation provide the lowest risk accommodation and should be prioritised for new arrivals and known cases and their contacts who need to self-isolate/quarantine.</p>

<p>Accommodation providers should avoid movement of staff between accommodation settings if possible. In particular, staff should not work in more than one setting if there is a known COVID-19 case among residents or staff or an ongoing outbreak in one of their workplaces. Staff should comply with workplace risk mitigations including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers-and-third-party-healthcare-providers" class="govuk-link">workplace testing</a> as advised.</p>

<p>Accommodation providers should ensure staff are appropriately trained to implement measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including supporting residents when a case or an outbreak occurs.</p>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>COVID-19 spreads through the air by droplets and aerosols that are exhaled from the nose and mouth of an infected person. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">Face coverings</a> reduce the spread of droplets and aerosols carrying the virus by limiting the amount of the virus being released when you talk and breathe, helping to protect others.</p>

<p>There is a legal requirement to wear face coverings in most indoor public places, including hotels, and hostels, which may be used as contingency accommodation for asylum seekers.</p>

<p>Residents must wear face coverings when moving around in public areas of hotels and hostels, unless they are exempt for health, disability or other reasons. It is not mandatory for residents to wear face coverings when sleeping in dormitories with others. Providers should consider providing face coverings for all residents, and staff should remind residents that they are required to wear them when in these indoor settings.</p>

<p>It is also compulsory for staff to wear a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20210302222407mp_/https:/www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" rel="external">face covering</a> in areas that are open to the public and where they come or are likely to come within close contact of a member of the public, unless they are exempt for health, disability or other reasons.</p>

<p>Where asylum seekers are placed in accommodation settings other than hotels and hostels, residents and staff should be supported to continue to wear face coverings, particularly in poorly ventilated, crowded and enclosed spaces where social distancing would be difficult to maintain and in line with a risk assessment.</p>

<p>Staff may need to wear face masks in some circumstances as part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-services-for-people-experiencing-rough-sleeping/covid-19-guidance-for-commissioners-and-providers-of-hostel-services-for-people-experiencing-homelessness-and-rough-sleeping#ppe">personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</a> use.</p>

<p>Residents may have undiagnosed conditions that put them at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if they were to catch COVID-19. Providers should think particularly carefully about precautions they can take such as those described in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread" class="govuk-link">How to stay safe and help prevent the spread guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Around 1 in 3 people with COVID-19 do not have any symptoms. This means they could be spreading the virus without knowing it. Testing with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test twice a week increases the chances of detecting COVID-19 when a person is infectious but is not displaying symptoms, helping to make sure people do not spread the infection.</p>

<p>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is available for free to residents and staff working in accommodation settings for asylum seekers. Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests" class="govuk-link">how to get <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the high risk nature of these settings, ensure residents and staff have the opportunity to take <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" rel="external"><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests twice a week</a>. Staff should also consider taking an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test before they experience periods of high risk on particular days. This includes spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces, or before visiting <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/who-is-at-high-risk-from-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">people who are at higher risk of severe illness if they get COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Individuals with a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result should self-isolate and take a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test. If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is positive, they must self-isolate and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>New arrivals</h2>

<p>Asylum seekers identified either at the port of entry or in the community should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be asked whether they have been in a country or territory on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england" class="govuk-link">red list in the last 10 days</a>. Asylum seekers should follow the recommended testing and quarantine protocol of the highest risk area they have been in where this is known. If there is any uncertainty of the travel history, follow the processes for red list country testing and quarantine</li>
  <li>be asked if they have symptoms of COVID-19. The most important symptoms of COVID-19 are a recent onset of a new continuous cough, a high temperature, or a loss of, or change in, the normal sense of taste or smell. New arrivals should take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if any symptoms are reported and follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a> if they test positive by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
</ul>

<p>Any new arrivals for whom there is very reliable intelligence that they have only been in and travelled through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#green-list">countries which are not on the red list in the last 10 days before arriving in England</a> should be asked about their vaccination status. For these travellers, if there is proof that they are fully vaccinated with an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination#countries-with-an-approved-proof-of-vaccination-and-examples-of-proof-required" class="govuk-link">approved COVID-19 vaccine</a>, they must self-isolate and have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test before or on day 2.</p>

<p>If this day 2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is positive they must continue self-isolating and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>. If the day 2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is negative, they are no longer required to self-isolate or quarantine. They should take a second <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test on day 8.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#if-you-are-fully-vaccinated">Further information on travel to England and vaccination status is available</a>.</p>

<p>Any new arrivals who are not fully vaccinated, or those who have come from a red list country (irrespective of vaccination status):</p>

<ul>
  <li>should be placed in a managed quarantine facility or an equivalent facility and should quarantine for 10 days from the date of arrival</li>
  <li>should take an initial <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test as soon as possible (day 0) to assess infectiousness and take a follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if this <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is positive â if the follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, they must self-isolate for 10 full days from the date of their positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>if the initial <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is negative, they must have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test on days 2 and 8 of their 10-day quarantine period. If they test positive on either the day 2 or day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, they must self-isolate for 10 days following the date of that positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a> â this testing regimen must be followed even if they report that they have received <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination#countries-with-an-approved-proof-of-vaccination-and-examples-of-proof-required" class="govuk-link">one or more COVID-19 vaccinations</a>
</li>
  <li>should be provided with food and drink and have access to the internet and a phone during the quarantine period</li>
  <li>must quarantine for 10 days in a self-contained or family size room with en-suite facilities and should not be relocated during that period</li>
  <li>in line with legal requirements, asylum seekers travelling to England must complete their legally required 10-day isolation period before moving on to a new accommodation setting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Initial and contingency accommodation</h2>

<p>These accommodation settings include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>initial accommodation centres</li>
  <li>contingency accommodation such as hotels, hostels and former military accommodation</li>
</ul>

<p>This may include people (who may or may not be related) living at the same address and who share cooking facilities, bathrooms or toilets, or living areas.</p>

<p>Accommodation providers should ensure residents in these settings have access to primary care, for example by registering with a GP surgery, to ensure they have regular opportunities to discuss any health needs.</p>

<p>Wider guidance from the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) on managing possible and confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their contacts distinguishes between <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">household</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">non-household</a> contacts.</p>

<p>To use this guidance, providers of this accommodation will need to interpret the meaning of âhouseholdâ based on the set-up of their accommodation. This will depend on the layout of the accommodation and how it is organised.</p>

<p>In deciding what constitutes a household, the key factor is whether residents share living spaces, in particular: bathrooms, toilets, kitchens and sleeping space. Residents who share any of these should be considered as a household for the purposes of this guidance. In complex situations, providers of accommodation can seek advice from <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>âs local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team">health protection teams (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>Providers of this accommodation should make an assessment and draw up a plan for how to manage these settings to support isolation for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residents who have symptoms of COVID-19 and are waiting for a test result</li>
  <li>residents who have received a positive test result for COVID-19 (confirmed case)</li>
  <li>residents considered to be in the same household as someone with symptoms or who has had a positive test (household contacts)</li>
  <li>residents who have been identified as contacts of a confirmed case who they donât live with via NHS Test and Trace or by other contact tracing activities (non-household contacts)</li>
</ul>

<p>All people in the above categories should have their own self-contained accommodation (with their own bathroom and kitchen). If this is not possible, âcohortingâ based on COVID-19 status may be used to minimise health risks. Cohorting is a strategy which can be effective in limiting the spread of disease by gathering people into different areas depending on their status. For example, confirmed cases can be in one area of the accommodation and household contacts in another.</p>

<p>Residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should not mix with, be cohorted with, or spend time in rooms next to residents who have an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk of severe COVID-19. This includes not sharing bathrooms or communal areas.</p>

<p>Where the accommodation has a mix of residents with symptoms and/or confirmed cases and residents who are asymptomatic, providers should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether residents can safely isolate in their own room with an en-suite bathroom and have access to their own kitchen</li>
  <li>if residents cannot safely isolate in the accommodation, what other local options are available to support them</li>
  <li>the physical layout of the setting to ensure that there is no contact between groups outlined above</li>

</ul>

<p>As part of close working with local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, accommodation providers should ensure <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/containing-and-managing-local-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreaks/covid-19-contain-framework-a-guide-for-local-decision-makers#local-outbreak-management-plans" class="govuk-link">plans</a> are in place for each setting that cover the standard processes for prevention and response to COVID-19 cases and outbreaks, including when to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team" class="govuk-link">contact the local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr></a> and the local authority.</p>

<h3>Managing an outbreak</h3>

<p>Accommodation providers should have an outbreak management plan in place for each accommodation setting.</p>

<p>If any resident or staff member receives a positive COVID-19 test result, the outbreak management plan should immediately be implemented.</p>

<p>The most important symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of a new continuous cough, a high temperature, or a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell.</p>

<p>Accommodation providers should explain to residents what the legal duties are on making arrangements to immediately isolate any resident who develops any of these symptoms and arrange a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/get-a-test-to-check-if-you-have-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test for them</a>.</p>

<p>Some vulnerable people may not respond as well to the COVID-19 vaccine as others and may remain at higher risk of serious illness if they catch the virus. For these individuals, extra care should be taken to help reduce their risk of infection.</p>

<h2>Dispersal accommodation</h2>

<p>These accommodation settings include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>family homes</li>
  <li>houses of multiple occupancy (HMOs)</li>
</ul>

<p>These household settings are integrated into the community and it is important that residents understand the factors that can increase risk of transmission. Residents should be provided with information to assist them in using their personal judgement to manage their own risk including <a class="govuk-link" href="#measures">measures they can take to reduce COVID-19 infection</a>. Residents should be informed of and regularly reminded of these measures.</p>

<p>Accommodation providers should facilitate and encourage residents in these settings to register with a GP surgery to ensure they have regular opportunities to discuss any health needs.</p>

<h2>Suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19</h2>

<p>As part of close working with local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and local authorities, accommodation providers should ensure <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/containing-and-managing-local-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreaks/covid-19-contain-framework-a-guide-for-local-decision-makers#local-outbreak-management-plans">plans</a> are in place for each setting that cover the standard processes for prevention and response to COVID-19 cases and outbreaks, including when to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team" class="govuk-link">contact the local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr></a> and the local authority.</p>

<h3>If someone has COVID-19 symptoms or has a positive COVID-19 test result</h3>

<p>Anyone who develops <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-services-for-people-experiencing-rough-sleeping/covid-19-guidance-for-commissioners-and-providers-of-hostel-services-for-people-experiencing-homelessness-and-rough-sleeping#Symptoms">COVID-19 symptoms</a>, however mild, should self-isolate immediately and get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test even they have received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>Those who test positive must self-isolate. This is the law. For further details on the duration of self-isolation, see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>They should not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital except in an emergency. Where a resident has symptoms, providers should support residents to arrange to have a test to see if they have COVID-19 â this can be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">arranged online</a> or contact NHS 119 via telephone if internet access is not available.</p>

<p>If their symptoms do not get better after 10 days, or their condition gets worse, use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service, or call NHS 111 if internet access is not available. For a medical emergency call 999.</p>

<p>In both contingency and dispersal accommodation, it is the responsibility of residents with a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result to provide details to the NHS Test and Trace service. Accommodation providers should ensure the residents are aware of this responsibility and may need to provide support with this.</p>

<p>If the resident does not need to go to hospital, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">Stay at home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19</a> should be followed and used alongside this guidance.</p>

<p>Accommodation providers should follow guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a>, which includes guidance on dealing with laundry and waste.</p>

<h3>If a resident is identified as a contact of someone with COVID-19 symptoms or of someone with a positive COVID-19 test result</h3>

<p>Refer to the <a href="#contingency" class="govuk-link">initial and contingency accommodation section</a> for help in determining if a resident is a household or non-household contact.</p>

<p>Residents considered to be in the same âhouseholdâ as someone who has symptoms of, or has received a positive test for, COVID-19 are considered âhousehold contactsâ. They must self-isolate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#exempt">unless they are not legally required to do so</a>, and should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">Stay at home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>If a household contact develops <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" rel="external">COVID-19 symptoms</a>, they should be supported to arrange a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a>, self-isolate immediately and follow the advice in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home guidance</a>, even if their symptoms are mild.</p>

<p>If a resident is notified by NHS Test and Trace that they are a contact of someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test who they do not share a household with, they are a ânon-household contactâ. They must self-isolate and follow the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">non-household contacts, unless they are not legally required to do so</a>.</p>

<p>Those who share a household with the person identified as a contact do not need to self-isolate at this stage.</p>

<p>Accommodation providers should encourage residents to tell them if they need to self-isolate.</p>

<p>For further information on requirements for self-isolation, providers should follow the advice for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">household</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">non-household</a> contacts.</p>

<p>Contacts who are required to self-isolate should not be moved to new accommodation settings until they have completed their legally required 10 days isolation.</p>

<h2>Vaccination</h2>

<p>The NHS is currently offering <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">COVID-19 vaccines</a> to all those who are eligible.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 vaccination is provided by the NHS free of charge, irrespective of immigration status and no data will be shared with immigration authorities when a vaccination offer is accepted.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for people to have an NHS number or to be registered with a GP to receive a COVID-19 vaccination from local teams.</p>

<p>Asylum seekers should be offered COVID-19 vaccines according to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-30-december-2020" class="govuk-link">Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committed on Vaccines and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) prioritisation advice</a>.</p>

<p>Accommodation providers should work with local public health teams to support the development of solutions to deliver COVID-19 vaccinations for asylum seekers. This includes informing people about the vaccine and supporting them to feel confident in having it. They will also have a role in helping to identify the population and access appropriate sites to deliver vaccinations. There are leaflets and posters about the vaccination programme available.</p>
