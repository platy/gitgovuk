<p>As a Trader who uses a Customs Agent to submit declarations on your behalf, you must act now and move to the Customs Declaration Service. If you do not act now, you may no longer be able to make import declarations from 1 October 2022.</p>

<p>For your customs broker or agent to submit declarations for you on the Customs Declaration Service, you need to follow the 4 important steps outlined below.</p>

<p>If you view your <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-your-postponed-import-vat-statement">postponed import VAT statements</a> online, you will have already subscribed to the Customs Declaration Service, but there are still actions you need to take. You should begin from step 3.</p>

<h2>Benefits of the Customs Declaration Service</h2>

<p>The Customs Declaration Service is resilient, reliable, cost effective and adaptable to the future needs of business. It operates both the UK and EU Trade Tariffs and supports import and some export declarations.</p>

<p>The Customs Declaration Service saves you time by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>giving real time notifications and alerts on all your import and export declarations and movements, and</li>
  <li>allowing you to manage your business finances by opening a duty deferment account, make payments by card or bank transfer enabling your goods to clear without delay</li>
</ul>

<p>If your broker or agent isn’t ready to move to the Customs Declaration Service, you can find a list of agents who are by reading <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/customs-on-your-behalf">getting someone to deal with customs for you</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to submit declarations yourself please read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/customs-declaration-service-communication-pack/declarant-checklist-moving-to-the-customs-declaration-service">checklist for declarants</a>.</p>

<h2>The steps you need to take for your customs broker or agent to submit declarations for you on the Customs Declaration Service</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Apply for an Economic Operator Registration and Identification number</h3>

<p>You need an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number that starts with GB. Most businesses moving goods in and out of the UK already have one.</p>

<p>If you already have an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> starting with GB, go to step 2.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori">apply for an&nbsp;<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>&nbsp;number</a> if you don’t have one already. It’s free and it only takes 10 minutes to apply.</p>

<p>To apply for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number you need to have a Government Gateway user ID. If you don’t already have one, you will create one during the application process.</p>

<p>You should receive your&nbsp;<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>&nbsp;number within a week, but it can take longer during busy periods.</p>

<p>When applying for a new <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> you’ll be automatically subscribed to the Customs Declaration Service. Once you have received your <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> go to step 3.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Subscribe to the Customs Declaration Service</h3>

<p>You’ll then need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/cds-get-access">subscribe for the Customs Declaration Service</a>. This can take up to 5 working days.</p>

<p>You’ll need your Government Gateway user ID and password for yourself or your business. You will also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your&nbsp;<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>&nbsp;number that starts with GB</li>
  <li>your 10-digit Unique Tax Reference (<abbr title="Unique Tax Reference">UTR</abbr>) number – you can find this on any&nbsp;<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>&nbsp;payment reminders, or in your personal tax account</li>
  <li>the address for your business that we hold on our customs records – please tell us if your address has changed</li>
  <li>your National Insurance number (if you’re an individual or sole trader)</li>
  <li>the date you started your business</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Choose which payment method to use</h3>

<p>If you make all payments direct to a customs agent or broker who pay <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on your behalf, you should speak to them to confirm whether you now need to make any payments direct to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. If you don’t, you can move to step 4.</p>

<p>If you pay <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> directly for your import and export declarations, you can choose the payment method which is best for you. You can view your balances and payments for your financial statements and accounts once you’ve subscribed, as well as set up and amend standing authorities if you are a duty deferment account holder.</p>

<p>The main payment methods you can choose from are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-type-of-account-to-apply-for-to-defer-duty-payments-when-you-import-goods">duty deferment account</a> – you should review your Customs Declaration Service standing authorities to make sure your customs agent has access to your deferment account. You can set up or remove these when required. The Customs Declaration Service uses a separate&nbsp;<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>&nbsp;bank account to&nbsp;<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, so you’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/cds-setup-dda">set up a new direct debit</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-when-you-can-account-for-import-vat-on-your-vat-return">postponed VAT accounting</a> – if you’re making declarations for yourself and your business is registered for VAT in the UK, find out when you can, or need to, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/account-for-import-vat">account for import VAT</a> on your VAT return</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also choose to pay via:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/cash-account-for-cds">cash account</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/pay-cds-imports">immediate payment</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/individual-guarantee-customs-debts">individual guarantee</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/general-guarantee-account">general guarantee account</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Instruct your customs broker or agent</h3>

<p>You now need to tell your agent or broker that you have subscribed to the Customs Declaration Service. They may then ask you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up, check, or update which customs agents can use your accounts</li>
  <li>let them know about any changes to your preferred method of payment</li>
  <li>let them know about your commercial agreements (such as incoterms), awareness for all values, the location information, and nature of transaction information</li>
</ul>
