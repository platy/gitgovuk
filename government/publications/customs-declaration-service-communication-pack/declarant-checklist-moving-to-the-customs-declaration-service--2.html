<p>To make import declarations, you must move to the Customs Declaration Service from 1 October 2022. To do this, you need to follow the 7 important steps outlined below.</p>

<p>If you view your <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-your-postponed-import-vat-statement">postponed import VAT statements</a> online, you will have already subscribed to the Customs Declaration Service, but there are still actions you need to take. You should begin from step 3.</p>

<h2>Benefits of the Customs Declaration Service</h2>

<p>The Customs Declaration Service is resilient, reliable, cost effective and adaptable to the future needs of business. It operates both the UK and EU Trade Tariffs and supports import and some export declarations.</p>

<p>The Customs Declaration Service saves you time by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allowing you to securely upload documents and get messages</li>
  <li>giving real time notifications and alerts on all your import and export declarations and movements, and</li>
  <li>allowing you to manage your business finances by opening a duty deferment account, make payments by card or bank transfer enabling your goods to clear without delay</li>
</ul>

<h2>Seven steps to move to the Customs Declaration Service</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Apply for an Economic Operator Registration and Identification number</h3>

<p>You need an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number that starts with ‘GB’. Most businesses moving goods in and out of the UK already have one.</p>

<p>If you already have an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> starting with ‘GB’, go to step 2.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori">apply for an&nbsp;<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>&nbsp;number</a> if you don’t have one already. It’s free and it only takes 10 minutes to apply.</p>

<p>To apply for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number you need to have a Government Gateway user ID. If you don’t already have one, you will create one during the application process.</p>

<p>You should receive your&nbsp;<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>&nbsp;number within a week, but it can take longer during busy periods.</p>

<p>When applying for a new <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> you’ll be automatically subscribed to the Customs Declaration Service. Once you have received your <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> &nbsp;go to step 3.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Subscribe to the Customs Declaration Service</h3>

<p>You’ll then need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/cds-get-access">subscribe to the Customs Declaration Service</a>. This can take up to 5 working days.</p>

<p>You’ll need your Government Gateway user ID and password for yourself or your business. You will also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>&nbsp;number that starts with GB</li>
  <li>your 10-digit Unique Tax Reference (<abbr title="Unique Tax Reference">UTR</abbr>) number – you can find this on any&nbsp;<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>&nbsp;payment reminders, or in your personal tax account</li>
  <li>the address for your business that we hold on our customs records – please tell us if your address has changed</li>
  <li>your National Insurance number (if you’re an individual or sole trader)</li>
  <li>the date you started your business</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Authorise your software provider to make declarations on your behalf</h3>

<p>This will link your software to your Government Gateway user ID. Your software provider will tell you how to do this.</p>

<p>If you’re acting on behalf of multiple clients, you may need to authorise the software for each client. Your software developer will be able to help you with this. You may need to regularly refresh this authorisation with your provider.</p>

<p>If you don’t already have a software provider, you can check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-software-developers-providing-customs-declaration-support">list of software developers</a> providing customs declaration software.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Check the guidance</h3>

<p>The Customs Declaration Service is built on the Union Customs Code, which is fundamentally different from the Community Customs Code which <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> is based on. You can read about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/cds-communication-pack">key differences between&nbsp;<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>&nbsp;and the Customs Declaration Service</a>.</p>

<p>Please read the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/hmrc/cds-communication-pack">Customs Declaration Service communication pack</a> to understand how this impacts you and the declarations you intend to make.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Choose which payment method to use</h3>

<p>You can choose the payment method which is best for your declaration. You can view your balances and payments for your financial statements and accounts once you’ve subscribed , as well as set up and amend standing authorities if you are a duty deferment account holder.</p>

<p>The main payment methods are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-type-of-account-to-apply-for-to-defer-duty-payments-when-you-import-goods">duty deferment account</a> – the Customs Declaration Service uses a separate&nbsp;<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>&nbsp;bank account to&nbsp;<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, so you’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/cds-setup-dda">set up a new direct debit</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-when-you-can-account-for-import-vat-on-your-vat-return">postponed VAT accounting</a> – if you’re making declarations for yourself and your business is registered for VAT in the UK, find out when you can, or need to, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/account-for-import-vat">account for import VAT</a> on your VAT return</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also choose to pay via:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/cash-account-for-cds">cash account</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/pay-cds-imports">immediate payment</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/individual-guarantee-customs-debts">individual guarantee</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/general-guarantee-account">general guarantee account</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 6: Get access to the Trader Dress Rehearsal service</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-trader-dress-rehearsal-service">Trader Dress Rehearsal service</a> is a free service that lets you practice submitting declarations.</p>

<p>If you’d like to use the service, you should ask your software provider for access.</p>

<p>You can continue using the Trader Dress Rehearsal service after you start making declarations in live.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Submit live declarations</h3>

<p>Contact your software provider once you’re ready to make declarations. They’ll make the request for access to the live service for you.</p>

<p>You’ll find help and guidance such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/navigate-the-uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-for-imports">Navigate the CDS Declaration Instructions for Imports</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cds-uk-trade-tariff-volume-3-import-declaration-completion-guide/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-import-declaration-completion-guide">CDS Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>You should securely upload when you submit your supporting documents like licenses or certificates of origin.</p>
