<h2>How to complete your lawful development certificate appeal form</h2>

<p>This guide shows you how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an account</li>
  <li>Complete your form</li>
  <li>Submit your form</li>
  <li>Contact us</li>
  <li>Troubleshoot problems</li>
</ul>

<p>March 2021</p>

<h2>Before you start</h2>

<p>Before you make your appeal, you should enter into discussions with the local planning authority (LPA). We encourage you to continue these discussions, during the appeal. This will help to narrow the areas in dispute. A further application to the LPA may be your best route.</p>

<p>You should make your appeal only when all else has failed.</p>

<h2>System Availability</h2>

<p>Our online facilities will usually be available 24 hours a day. We will sometimes need to take the system out of service for a while to implement upgrades.  Wherever possible, we will do this outside of usual office hours.</p>

<p>All planned downtime for the appeals service will be advertised on <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate">GOV.UK</a>. Sometimes the Planning Portal itself may also be unavailable because of updates.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>Before you start, you should ensure that you have the following system requirements -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adobe Acrobat (Version 9 or higher recommended);</li>
  <li>an internet browser (Internet Explorer/Chrome/Firefox recommended);</li>
  <li>an email account.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making your appeal</h2>

<h3>Deadlines</h3>

<p>If an application for a lawful development certificate (LDC) is wholly or partly refused, or is granted in a different form from the application, or is deemed to have been refused where the LPA has not determined the application within the time-limit there is a right of appeal.  The time limits are</p>

<ul>
  <li>8 weeks for an LDC applications under section 191 or section 192</li>
  <li>6 weeks for an application under section 26H of receiving a valid application.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no time limit for making an appeal in relation to section 191 and section 192 applications.</p>

<p>However an appeal under section 26K <strong>must</strong> be received by us within <strong>6 months</strong> of the date of the notice of the LPA decision, or of the expiry of the 6 week period following receipt of a valid application.</p>

<h3>Openness and transparency</h3>

<p>Hearings and inquiries are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people.  Provided that it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media.  Inspectors will advise people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, they should contact us and the local planning authority in advance to discuss arrangements</p>

<h3>Guidelines for submitting documents</h3>

<h4>Acceptable file formats</h4>

<p>PDF                       .pdf</p>

<p>Microsoft Word            .doc or.docx</p>

<p>TIF                       .tif or .tiff</p>

<p>JPEG                      .jpg or .jpeg</p>

<p>PNG                       .png</p>

<p>ZIP                       .zip</p>

<h4>File sizes</h4>

<p>Documents submitted may be no bigger than 15mb each. It is your responsibility to keep your documents to a manageable size.</p>

<p>If you have documents that are larger than this, you can try the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Break long documents into several files, but note the document naming conventions below.</li>
  <li>Try and use black and white wherever possible (unless submitting photographs).</li>
  <li>If submitting images, your software may have file/image compression facilities to make them smaller.</li>
  <li>Note scanned documents are usually bigger than non-scanned versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Provided you are using the acceptable file types above, you can use ZIP files to compress documents.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>Remove any document security and enable macros if necessary.  Documents should not be password protected, they should not be formatted as âread onlyâ and printing should be enabled.</p>

<h4>Copyright</h4>

<p>Ensure you have the ownerâs permission and have paid any copyright licence fee before sending in documents.</p>

<h4>File names</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure all documents have descriptive names, including the type of document you are sending, eg âProposed plan 1 March 2014â.</li>
  <li>Number appendices and submit them as separate documents.  Ensure the first page includes the appendix number.  Name them to indicate what they form part of, and their sequence eg âAppeal statement Appendix 2 Traffic census.â</li>
  <li>Use âPart 1â, âPart 2â etc in the file name if you have split up a large document eg âAppeal statement in Appendix 1 Environmental Assessment Part 1 of 3â.</li>
  <li>Include the required paper size in the document name for plans and drawings eg âProposed plan A3 size 1 March 2014â.</li>
  <li>Include scale bar(s) on all plans and drawings.</li>
  <li>Do not use a colon â:â in any file names.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Scanning</h4>

<p>Ensure documents are complete and legible and avoid scanning more than one document into a single file.  Use black and white unless colour is essential.</p>

<h4>Ordnance Survey</h4>

<p>People may only scan an Ordnance Survey map if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an annual licence to make copies; or</li>
  <li>Have purchased a bulk copy arrangement; or</li>
  <li>Are using a local planning authority supplied map under the âmap return schemeâ (for which a fee is normally payable at the local planning authorityâs discretion), or</li>
  <li>Have purchased the site-specific map for the purposes of attaching to a planning application, appeal or representation.</li>
</ul>

<p>More information on map licensing is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/support/licensing.html" rel="external">Ordnance Survey website</a></p>

<h4>Images</h4>

<p>Send pictures, photographs, plans, maps or drawings as individual files.  Avoid the use of bitmap images as they are very large.</p>

<h4>Hyperlinks</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You should not use hyperlinks within documents you send to us.  Instead, you should download such documents yourself and attach them separately.</li>
  <li>You should not use hyperlinks to a website page containing multiple documents or links.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sending emails</h4>

<p>If you send anything by email you should get an automatic acknowledgement, provided it is sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:appeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">appeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a> or to a team email address (which can be found at the top of letters from us about the appeal).  If you do not get an automatic acknowledgement, then you should contact us.</p>

<p>For any correspondence which you send to us via email, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quote the appeal reference and/or appellantâs name, site address and local planning authority name in the subject line or in the body of your email.</li>
  <li>If you are attaching more than one document, please list them in the covering email.</li>
  <li>If you are sending a series of emails, include â1 of 5â, â2 of 5â etc in the subject line of the email, so we know how many to expect and can check with you if any appear to be missing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Formatting</h4>

<p>You should ensure that you number all pages accordingly.</p>

<h2>Application for appeal costs</h2>

<p>You and the LPA normally have to meet your own appeal expenses, whether we decide it by the written procedure, a hearing or an inquiry.</p>

<p>If a party does not behave reasonably they leave themselves open to costs being awarded against them.  This would be on the basis that the behaviour had directly caused another party to incur expenses that would not otherwise have been necessary.</p>

<p>Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties.  Also the Inspector may make an award of costs even if neither of the parties has made an application.</p>

<p>There is guidance about costs awards in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities planning practice guidance at: <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/appeals">www.gov.uk/guidance/appeals</a></p>

<p>It is important that you read this guidance because it explains how, when and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>The onus is on you to ensure that a properly substantiated claim for costs is made at the appropriate time.  Providing notice of intent does not justify a late application for costs.</p>

<p>You should note that uses and operations cannot be considered lawful where they are in contravention of any of the requirements of an enforcement notice,
in relation to the same development, which is in force (see Section 191(2)(b) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)).  If we consider that an enforcement notice is in force which will prevent the grant of an LDC so that the appeal will be dismissed we will write to you and explain this.  If despite this you proceed with an appeal you may leave yourself open to an award of costs against you â as pursuing an appeal in circumstances where an LDC cannot be granted could be seen as being unreasonable behaviour.</p>

<h2>Selecting the correct appeal form</h2>

<p>Once you have logged into your account, start the appeal process by clicking on the âMake a new appealâ button.</p>

<h3>Enter the name of your local planning authority</h3>

<p>Here you should type in the name of your local planning authority.  As you type, possible matches will be returned.  You can then select the correct one from the list. Note you cannot change your local authority once you are in the appeal form.</p>

<h3>Selecting your appeal form</h3>

<p>You will be asked a series of questions about your appeal, with each answer you give determining the next question.  You may need to consult your application documents, including any decision issued from your LPA.</p>

<p>If you want to make an appeal in relation to more than one application eg in relation to another application for an LDC or an application for planning permission you must make a separate appeal for each.</p>

<p>If you believe that you may have selected the wrong from, please select the âRestartâ button to begin the appeals process again.</p>

<h3>Meaningful name</h3>

<p>This name will be used to identify this appeal on your personal homepage.  Please use a name that clearly identifies the appeal to you, for example, the first line of the site address.  This is of particular importance if you are an agent who may be dealing with multiple cases.</p>

<h2>Completing the appeal form</h2>

<p>In this guidance, we use the same section headers as within the LDC appeal form.</p>

<h3>Appellant Details</h3>

<h4>Name</h4>

<p>Only the person who made the application can make an appeal.  If you are the appellant, by responding âYesâ, the details registered to your account will be displayed on the form.  Select âNoâ and you will be deemed to be acting as an agent for the appellant and so you should provide the appellantâs details.</p>

<h4>Preferred contact method</h4>

<p>If you are an unrepresented appellant and you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<p>If for any reason your details have changed since you created your account, you should change them through the My Details link at the top of the page.</p>

<h3>Agent Details</h3>
<p>You do not have to employ an agent to handle your LDC appeal.  If you decide to employ an agent he or she will probably complete the appeal form for you.</p>

<p>If you have an agent we will send all of our communications to them.  We will not send a copy to you.  You should ensure that you keep in touch with your agent about the appeal arrangements particularly if an âaccess requiredâ site visit is arranged.</p>

<h4>Preferred contact method</h4>

<p>If you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<p>If you are the agent completing the form, by selecting âNoâ to the question âAre you the appellant?â the details registered to your account will be displayed on the Agent Details section of the form.</p>

<h3>Local Planning Authority Details</h3>

<p>The name of the LPA, date of application, LPA reference number and decision notice (if issued) will usually be in the letter you received from the LPA confirming that your application was valid and on the decision notice if one was issued.</p>

<p>If the LPA did not validate or register your application, you should send us any relevant correspondence it sent to you.</p>

<p>The name of the LPA will have transferred through to the form from when you entered it at the start of the process. If you need to change the LPA you will need to restart from your homepage.</p>

<h3>Appeal Site Details</h3>

<p>The appeal site must be the same as the site given in the LDC application.</p>

<p>If you confirm that the address of the affected land is the same as the appellantâs address then this information will transfer over from the Appellant Details section (provided you have completed the Appellant Details section before the Appeal Site Details section).</p>

<h4>Does the appeal relate to an existing property?</h4>

<p>If the address of the affected building is not the same as the appellantâs address you will be asked an additional question as to whether the appeal relates to an existing property.  If it does, you can use the address finder to complete your details quickly.</p>

<h4>Postcode</h4>

<p>If the appeal site does not have a postcode, please provide the postcode of the nearest building.</p>

<h4>Health and safety at the site</h4>

<p>The site is likely to be inspected during the course of the appeal and the Inspector needs to be made aware of any potential problems.  The following questions indicate the type of information we need about the appeal site such as the condition of the land or any building to be entered.</p>

<p>We take seriously our duties with regard to the health and safety of our employees and those affected by our work.  Inspectors may abort the site visit if the conditions on site are unsatisfactory.  Failure to provide the necessary information may therefore result in a delay to your appeal.</p>

<p>1) Will the Inspector be expected to wear Personal Protection Equipment? Please give details.</p>

<p>2) Are any building works or other operations taking place on the site?  If it is a workplace, is there a risk assessment in place for visitors?</p>

<p>3) Are there any animals (eg pets or livestock) within the site? If so, you <strong>must</strong> ensure that <strong>ALL</strong> animals (both livestock or pets) will be kept away from the area to be visited.</p>

<p>4) Is the site remote or in an area likely to have a poor mobile phone signal?</p>

<p>5) Are there any areas that require specialist equipment or training for access eg confined spaces or use of ladders / scaffolding?  If a ladder will be used, you must explain why and give details of the heights involved and arrangements for securing the ladder.</p>

<p>6) Does the Inspector need to be aware of specific dangers within the site?  This would include uneven surfaces, equipment or substances kept at the site, risk of exposure to chemicals, asbestos or radiation.</p>

<p>7) Will it be necessary to view the site from a height, eg roof, balcony?  Are any railings or guards in place?</p>

<p>8) Are there any site specific safety arrangements in place?</p>

<p>9) Is the site accessible for persons with limited mobility?</p>

<p>10) Is there any overgrown vegetation that could restrict access to the site?  If so you will need to ensure that the site is made accessible to our Inspector and any other people accompanying him or her.</p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> also inform us of any relevant changes to the site which occur in the period leading up to a planned site visit, hearing or inquiry date.</p>

<h3>Details of the Appeal</h3>

<p>There are 3 types of LDC that may be applied for under section191 and section 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and section 26H of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990:</p>

<p>a. section 191 â whether an <strong>existing</strong> use of land, operational development or activity in breach of a planning condition is lawful; and</p>

<p>b. section 192 â whether a <strong>proposed</strong> use of buildings, land or operations intended to be carried out would be lawful.</p>

<p>c. section 26H â whether <strong>proposed</strong> works for the alteration or extension of a listed building would be lawful.</p>

<h4>Is there an effective enforcement notice on the site?</h4>

<p>You should note that uses and operations cannot be considered lawful where they are in contravention of any of the requirements of an enforcement notice, in relation to the same development, which is in force.  If we consider that an enforcement notice is in force which will prevent the grant of an LDC so that the appeal will be dismissed we will write to you and explain this</p>

<h3>Reason for the Appeal</h3>

<p>The LPAâs decision notice should make it clear if it has refused or partly refused to grant a certificate of lawful use or development or has granted it in a different form to the application.</p>

<p>The reason will have transferred through to the form from when you entered it at the start of the process. If you need to change the reason you will need to restart from your homepage.</p>

<h3>Choice of Procedure</h3>

<p>There are 3 possible procedures for the determination of an appeal: written representations, hearings and inquiries. We will decide which procedure your appeal should follow. Our decision will be based on the criteria which are set out in Annexe 1. We will also take into account any views you have expressed about which procedure would be most suitable for your case and the views of the LPA.</p>

<p>You should note if we decide at the initial stage that the appeal should proceed as a hearing or as an inquiry, the appointed Inspector will also subsequently  consider, whether a âcombined procedureâ would be appropriate, such as a hearing with some elements dealt with written representations or an inquiry with hearing and/or written representation elements, on the basis of the criteria.</p>

<p>We will keep the determined procedure, including any combined procedure, under review during the appeal and may change it at any point before a decision on the appeal is made.</p>

<p>Although the criteria in Annexe 1 do not directly apply to LDC appeals they are a useful indication of which procedure would be appropriate for these appeals.</p>

<p><strong>Please refer to Annexe 1 before indicating which method is your preferred procedure.</strong></p>

<p>The written representations procedure</p>

<p>This is normally the simplest, quickest and most straightforward way of making an appeal, it is simpler to undertake than a hearing or inquiry.  The Inspector will consider the LPAâs reasons for refusing the application, your grounds of appeal, any further representations received from you and the LPA and any representation received from interested people.  The Inspector will usually visit the site.</p>

<p>You may wish to look at âThe Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Written Representations Procedure) (England) Regulations 2002, Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 2683â.</p>

<p>We will use your responses to questions 1a) and 1b) to help us decide how the site visit should be conducted.</p>

<p>The hearing procedure</p>

<p>This procedure is likely to be suited to cases which require detailed discussion.  This procedure is likely to be suited to more complicated cases where questions need to be asked to establish the facts.  The hearing is an inquisitorial process led by the Inspector who identifies the issues for discussion based on the evidence received and any representations made.  The hearing may include a discussion at the site or the site may be visited, on an accompanied (without any discussion), or unaccompanied basis.</p>

<p>If you ask for a hearing you should explain on the appeal form why you think your appeal fits the criteria for a hearing.  Although you may indicate a preference for a hearing, we must also consider that your appeal is suitable for this procedure.  It is unlikely to be suitable if the evidence needs to be tested ie where the factual evidence about how long the development has been on site is in dispute.  If it is likely that evidence will need to be given on oath this cannot be done at a hearing so an inquiry would be necessary.</p>

<p>You may wish to look at âThe Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Hearings Procedure) (England) Rules 2002, Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 2684â.</p>

<p>The inquiry procedure</p>

<p>This is the most formal of the procedures.  Although it is not a court of law the proceedings will often seem to be quite similar.  An inquiry provides for the investigation into, and formal testing of, evidence, usually through expert witnesses.  Parties may be formally represented by advocates and evidence will sometimes be given on oath.  The site may be visited before, during or after the inquiry.  It is likely to be required if the evidence needs to be tested ie where the factual evidence about how long the development has been on site is in dispute.</p>

<p>If you ask for an inquiry you should explain on the appeal form why you think your appeal fits the criteria for an inquiry.</p>

<p>You may wish to look at âThe Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Determination by Inspectors) (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2002, Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 2685â.</p>

<p>For inquiry cases you are required to send to us a formal <strong>statement of common ground</strong> not later than 4 weeks before the inquiry.  You should begin discussing this with the LPA before you make your appeal.  The statement of common ground should include basic facts such as site description, area, planning history, evidence on technical issues and all other matters of agreement.  You should also list the specific areas where agreement is not possible.</p>

<p>For further information please see Annexe C, paragraph C.11 â<a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/government/publications/certificate-of-lawful-use-or-development-appeals-procedural-guide">Statement of common groundâ of our âProcedural Guide: Certificate of lawful use or development appeals â England</a>â</p>

<p>Q3a) How long do you estimate the inquiry will last?</p>

<p>In answering this question you should say how long you estimate the inquiry will last, including the time you think will be required to present all of your case.  Please be realistic - the estimate should include time for opening and closing the inquiry, and the time you consider may be necessary for questions to be put to both your and the LPAâs witnesses.  If you have instructed an advocate (eg an agent, solicitor, or barrister) to represent you it may be useful for you to get their views on the likely length of the inquiry.</p>

<p>We will take account of your estimate, the estimate we receive from the LPA and our own experience when we set the likely length of the inquiry.  Once set we will expect the length of the inquiry to stay within the agreed timetable.</p>

<p>To help us to do this please indicate at Q3b) how many witnesses you intend to call to give evidence at the inquiry and the topic areas they will cover and any other information which will help us to decide on the appropriate timetable for the inquiry.</p>

<h3>Appeal Statement</h3>

<p>The appeal should contain a clear and concise statement of your case and the reasons why you consider the subject of the application to be lawful.</p>

<p>You should note that there is no provision under section 195 for the planning merits of what has been applied for to be considered on appeal in relation to applications under sections 191 and 192.  As there is no power to grant planning permission it follows that the planning merits of the development are not relevant in deciding an LDC application or appeal; it rests entirely on the facts involved in each case.  It is open to you to apply to the LPA for planning permission in the normal way, without prejudice to your application or appeal for an LDC.</p>

<p>Similarly there is there is no provision under section 26K to grant listed building consent on an appeal in relation to an application under section 26H.  However decisions as to whether proposals affect the special architectural/historic character of a building in a particular way can involve a planning judgement.</p>

<p>In your appeal statement you may wish to put forward the case that the development that has taken place or the development that you propose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>does not amount to development, under section 55 of the Act, or that the change of use is not a material one (ie it is not subject to the requirements of planning control);</li>
  <li>is permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, or that the change of use is within the terms of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended);</li>
  <li>has been done, or built, within the terms of a planning permission;</li>
  <li>has become lawful as it is too late for the LPA to take enforcement action.  The time limits are as follows:-</li>
  <li>section 171B(1) of the Act gives a time limit of 4 years for notices alleging operational development such as building, mining or engineering works;</li>
  <li>section 171B(2) gives a 4 year limit for change of use from a building/part of a building to a single dwellinghouse.  This time limit applies either where the change to use as a single dwellinghouse involves development without planning permission, or where it involves a failure to comply with a condition or limitation subject to which planning permission has been granted;</li>
  <li>section 171B(3) gives a 10 year limit for any other change from the date of the breach.  This applies to changes of use and to breaches of any conditions attached to previous planning permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not enough to say âthe breach of planning control occurred more than 10 years agoâ, or âThe building was finished more than 4 years agoâ.  You need to be able to provide evidence to establish this and the onus of proof rests with you.</p>

<p>Your statement could for example refer to matters of which you have direct knowledge and where that is not possible, it would be prudent to supply wherever possible statements from other persons who have the necessary direct knowledge, and/or documentary evidence, for example dated photographs, invoices/receipts for works, etc.  This evidence should show that the use or operations have existed continuously for at least 10 years or 4 years as the case may be.</p>

<h3>Other Appeals</h3>

<p>If you have made any other appeals (including appeals against enforcement notices) which are awaiting a decision for this site or for nearby sites, please supply the reference numbers.  Where practical, and depending on the relevant timescales, we may consider related cases together.</p>

<h3>Supporting Documents</h3>

<p>We have listed the documents currently required on the certificate of lawful use or development appeal form.  We do not âchaseâ missing documents and so please make sure that you have sent us everything; if not your appeal will be delayed.</p>

<p>Please ensure that you have listed all the plans/drawings that you are sending to us and that they include reference to scale, orientation and paper size. You should send us copies of <strong>all</strong> plans sent to the LPA with your application (including plans which have been superseded, you should clearly mark these âsupersededâ).</p>

<p>You should not send new material when you make your appeal that was not considered by the LPA as part of the application. Therefore, any documents sent during the appeal should be directly relevant and essential to the case and in response to the reasons for refusal (if any).  The Inspector will normally only consider the documents and plans which were put before and considered by the LPA.</p>

<h3>Audio/Video</h3>

<p>We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us. We cannot accept audio or video evidence, as we cannot be sure that everyone involved has exactly the same version or that they have the equipment needed to access the evidence.</p>

<p>However, you may send a written summary within 6 weeks of the starting date for the appeal.</p>

<p>If the appeal will proceed by a hearing or inquiry, you may ask the Inspector at the event if they are willing to accept the audio/video evidence and allow it to be played at the hearing/inquiry.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to contact the LPA to find out whether it has suitable equipment at the venue to access the evidence, or if it will allow you to use your own. The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector it will become part of the hearing/inquiry evidence and will be retained by the Inspector. You will need to have additional copies of the audio/video evidence available as if the Inspector allows it to be played these copies will be given to the main parties Our Case Officer will be able to tell you how many copies you will need to provide.</p>

<h4>Annexe 1</h4>

<p><strong>Criteria for determining the procedure for planning, listed buildings, enforcement, hazardous substances, advertisement and discontinuance notice appeals</strong></p>

<p><strong>The criteria for each procedure cannot be fully prescriptive or entirely determinative: they require judgement to be applied using common sense. More than one criterion may apply.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Written representations</strong> - written representations would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the planning issues raised or, in an enforcement appeal, the grounds of appeal, can be clearly understood from the appeal documents and a site inspection (if required - A small number of appeals do not require a site visit and can be dealt with solely on the basis of the appeal documents); or</li>
  <li>the issues are not complex and the Inspector is not likely to need to test the evidence by questioning or to clarify any other matters; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal the alleged breach, and the requirements of the notice, are clear.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hearing</strong> - a hearing would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Inspector is likely to need to test the evidence by questioning or to clarify matters (For example, where detailed evidence on housing land supply needs to be tested by questioning); or</li>
  <li>the status or personal circumstances of the appellant are at issue (For example whether in traveller appeals the definition in Annex 1 of DLUHCâs planning policy for traveller sites is met); or</li>
  <li>there is no need for evidence to be tested through formal questioning by an advocate or given on oath; or</li>
  <li>the case has generated a level of local interest such as to warrant a hearing; or</li>
  <li>it can reasonably be expected that the parties will be able to present their own cases (supported by professional witnesses if required) without the need for an advocate to represent them; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, the grounds of appeal, the alleged breach, and the requirements of the notice, are relatively straightforward.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inquiry</strong> - an inquiry would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a clearly explained need for the evidence to be tested through formal questioning by an advocate (This does not preclude an appellant representing themselves as an advocate); or</li>
  <li>the issues are complex (For example, where large amounts of highly technical data are likely to be provided in evidence); or</li>
  <li>the appeal has generated substantial local interest to warrant an inquiry as opposed to dealing with the case by a hearing; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, evidence needs to be given on oath (For example where witnesses are giving factual evidence about how long the alleged unauthorised use has been taking place); or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, the alleged breach, or the requirements of the notice, are unusual and particularly contentious.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - It is considered that the prospect of legal submissions being made is not, on its own, a reason why a case would need to be conducted by inquiry. Where a party considers that legal submissions will be required (and are considered to be complex such as to warrant being made orally), the Inspectorate requires that the matters on which submissions will be made are fully explained â including why they may require an inquiry - at the outset of the appeal or otherwise at the earliest opportunity.</p>
