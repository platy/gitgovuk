<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>A <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> may be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legal-charges-registration-ch1">form CH1</a> in accordance with rule 103 of the Land Registration Rules 2003. This form is not prescribed and lenders may use charges tailored to their own particular requirements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Approved forms of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Lenders may have all their forms of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> approved by the Commercial Arrangements Section at HM Land Registry Head Office. Approval of charges carries the following benefits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enter-a-restriction-registration-rx1">form RX1</a> is needed to register a standard restriction applied for in the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>
</li>
  <li>No separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legal-charges-obligation-for-further-advances-ch2">form CH2</a> is needed to register an obligation to make further advances that is applied for in the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>
</li>
  <li>We will create computer codes for lenders with approved forms of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> which will ensure that their agreed name and address(es) for service and appropriate restrictions and obligation entries are always entered accurately in the register</li>
</ul>

<p>For details of the approval process, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/approval-of-mortgage-documentation">practice guide 30: approval of mortgage documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Application to register a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>
</h2>

<p>An application to register a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> should contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>application <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a>
</li>
  <li>certified copy <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legal-charges-registration-ch1">form CH1</a>, or the lender’s own form of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#application-form-ap1">Application form AP1</a> regarding retention of documents submitted with applications</li>
  <li>the prescribed fee</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> is by an overseas entity they will have to comply with the requirements in the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022. For information about this Act and evidence that must be provided to HM Land Registry, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-companies-and-limited-liability-partnerships-pg78">practice guide 78: overseas entities</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that form CH1 was amended on 1 August 2022 by the Land Registration (Amendment) Rules 2022 to require an overseas entity ID to be provided when applying to register a legal <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> by an overseas entity. You can also find information about this in practice guide 78. Where a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> is in the lender’s own form of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>, the borrower’s overseas entity ID must be included with the application.</p>

<p>You do not need to lodge mortgage documents incorporated by reference in the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> itself (for example, rules of a building society, mortgage conditions, or an agreement for loan).</p>

<p>Registered charges rank, as between themselves, according to the order in which they are entered in an individual register (section 48(1) of the Land Registration Act 2002 and  rule 101 of the Land Registration Rules 2003). However, this is subject to “an entry in the individual register to the contrary”. If you wish us to make an entry when registering a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> to the effect that the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> has priority over an existing registered <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>, you should make clear in the application (ideally in form AP1) that you are seeking such an entry as part of the application. The following is an example of when you might want such an entry to be made.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Charge A is created before <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> B (so <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> A has priority over <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> B, as first in time – section 28(1) of the Land Registration Act 2002)</li>
  <li>Notice is entered in the register in respect of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> A</li>
  <li>Subsequently, <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> B is completed by registration – at this stage the effect of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> A being noted is that its priority is protected as against <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> B (section 29(2)(a)(i) of the Land Registration Act 2002)</li>
  <li>Later, <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> A is also completed by registration</li>
</ul>

<p>It is arguable that retaining the notice in respect of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> A constitutes “an entry in the register to the contrary”, and so allows for <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> A to retain its priority over <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> B. But you may also wish, when applying to register <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> A, to seek an entry that expressly provides for <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> A to have priority over <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> B. It is likely that we will serve an objection notice on the proprietor of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> B before making any such entry.</p>

<p>We will not automatically remove the notice in respect of a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> when subsequently completing the grant of that <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> by registration, but it would still be advisable to make clear, when applying to register the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>, that the notice is to remain in the register, so that this is done; see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notices-restrictions-and-the-protection-of-third-party-interests-in-the-register">practice guide 19: notices, restrictions and the entry of third party interests in the register</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Charges by UK companies and limited liability partnerships</h2>

<p>For charges created by UK companies and limited liability partnerships on or after 6 April 2013, and where the application is lodged by a <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of s.18, Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (r.217A, LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr>, in addition to the application <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> you must also lodge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>certified copy of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>. It must not be redacted in any way</li>
  <li>a copy of the certificate of registration issued by Companies House. This will be an electronic copy if the application is lodged through e-DRS (electronic Document Registration Service) or a paper copy when sent by post. A paper copy does not need to be certified</li>
  <li>written confirmation or a certificate by the company, lender or a <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of s.18, Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (r.217A, LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> that the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> lodged for registration is:
    <ul>
      <li>a certified copy the original <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> of which a copy (or a redacted copy under section 859G of the Companies Act 2006) has been filed at Companies House</li>
      <li>a certified copy of the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> to which the accompanying certificate of registration relates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not lodge the appropriate certificate of registration at Companies House and the additional written confirmation or certificate, we will make a note to the entry in the register stating that the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> may be subject to the provisions of section 859H of the Companies Act 2006 (rule 111 of the Land Registration Rules 2003).</p>

<p>If the application is not lodged by a <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of s.18, Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (r.217A, LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> then we will also require a Companies House generated copy of the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>, bearing the unique identifier code for the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>, which should correspond with the code on the certificate of registration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Charges which contain plans</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> contains a plan, Companies House will only accept an A4 sized plan for filing electronically. Where the plan is larger you will have to reduce the size of the plan annexed to the copy <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> filed at Companies House. In these circumstances you can amend your written statement or certificate to say that the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> lodged for registration is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the original <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> of which a copy (or a redacted copy under section 859G of the Companies Act 2006) has been filed at Companies House, save that the plan filed has been reduced in size to meet Companies House electronic filing requirements</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> to which the accompanying certificate of registration relates</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Charges which are exempt from registration at Companies House</h3>

<p>The requirement for registration at Companies House does not apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> in favour of a landlord on a cash deposit given as security on the lease of land</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the meaning of the Lloyd’s Act 1982) to secure its obligations in connection with its underwriting business at Lloyd’s</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> excluded from the application of section 859A of the Companies Act 2006 by or under any other Act</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note: Charges created by overseas companies on or after 1 October 2011 do not have to be registered at Companies House nor will the provisions of rule 111A of the Land Registration Rules 2003 apply.)</p>

<p>An application for a restriction must be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enter-a-restriction-registration-rx1">form RX1</a> unless the application is for a standard form of restriction and is made in panel 8 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legal-charges-registration-ch1">form CH1</a>, or it is for a standard form of restriction made in an approved form of <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> (rule 92 of the Land Registration Rules 2003). No fee is payable in respect of the restriction if application for its entry accompanies the application to register the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> to which it relates.</p>

<p>Generally, any restriction entry that specifically relates to the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> you are discharging will be cancelled automatically when the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> is discharged. However, if a restriction in favour of the lender does not specifically refer to the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> being discharged, a separate withdrawal of that restriction in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdraw-a-restriction-registration-rx4">form RX4</a> must be lodged with the application to register the discharge. If form RX4 is not lodged, the restriction will remain in the register.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Application to note in the register a lender’s obligation to make further advances</h2>

<p>An application to note an obligation to make further advances in an <abbr title="means a charge not previously approved by the Commercial Arrangements Section at Land Registry Head Office.">unapproved charge</abbr>, or not in form CH1 must be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legal-charges-obligation-for-further-advances-ch2">form CH2</a>, panel 8 of form CH1 or in an approved <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> (rule 108 of the Land Registration Rules 2003). The application must be made by either the lender or their <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of s.18, Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (r.217A, LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr>. No fee is payable if the application to note a lender’s obligation accompanies an application to register the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> to which it relates.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Application to note agreed maximum amount of security</h2>

<p>Under rule 109 of the Land Registration Rules 2003, an application may now be made to note in the register an agreement for the maximum amount secured by a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>.</p>

<p>Even if such an amount is stated in the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> itself, irrespective of whether or not the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> has been previously approved by us, or in a subsequent deed of variation, an application to note the maximum amount must always be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legal-charges-security-ch3">form CH3</a>.</p>

<p>If a later agreement is made to amend the amount of maximum security stated in the register, a further application in form CH3 can be lodged, accompanied by the appropriate fee. Although an additional entry will be made in the register in respect of the new amount, the original entry will remain in the register.</p>

<span class="number">12.2 </span>Postponement by deed</h3>

<p>The deed must be validly executed by the lender whose <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> is being postponed.

<h3>
<span class="number">12.3 </span>Fees</h3>

<p>There is a fixed fee under the current Land Registration Fee Order unless the postponement is lodged at the same time as an application for which either a scale fee or another fixed fee has been paid (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-registration-services-fees">HM Land Registry: Registration Services fees</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span>Consent to restriction</h3>

<p>If there is a restriction in Form P in the register in favour of the postponing lender, you do not need a separate consent to registration of:</p>

<p>Consent is implied by the signing or execution of the postponement.

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Deeds of variation of a registered <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>General</h3>

<p>An application to register a deed of variation must be made under cover of an application form AP1, enclosing a certified copy of the deed.</p>

<p>Our Commercial Arrangements Section at HM Land Registry Head Office will continue to approve deeds of variation. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/approval-of-mortgage-documentation">practice guide 30: approval of mortgage documentation</a> for further information.</p>

<p>It is not possible to apply in a deed of variation for a restriction or for an entry to show that a lender is under an obligation to make further advances. If these entries are required, separate applications must be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enter-a-restriction-registration-rx1">form RX1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legal-charges-obligation-for-further-advances-ch2">form CH2</a> respectively.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span>Execution</h3>

<p>Although the borrower must execute the deed of variation, there is no requirement for the lender to do the same. We will accept that the lender will be bound by the terms of the variation if the deed is either lodged by the lender or a practitioner acting on behalf of the lender.</p>

<p>Rule 113 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 requires that an application to register a deed of variation must be made with the consent of the proprietor of any registered <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> (and the proprietor of any sub-<abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> derived directly or indirectly from such a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>) of equal or inferior priority to the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> being varied, if the other lender is adversely affected by the terms of the variation, unless that proprietor has executed the deed itself or its consent is not required under the terms of its <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> or sub-<abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>.</p>

<p>Our view is that alterations of the following types do not adversely affect a <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> (and sub-<abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> thereof) with equal or inferior priority.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A reduction in the interest rate</li>
  <li>A reduction in the capital debt</li>
</ul>

<p>However, we consider that any alterations that either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase the interest rate</li>
  <li>increase the capital</li>
  <li>extend the term of the earlier <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>
</li>
  <li>create an obligation to make further advances, to be such as may adversely affect any <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> (and any sub-<abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> thereof) with equal or inferior priority</li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances, the proprietor of any <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> (and sub-<abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>) adversely affected must (unless their consent is not required under the terms of their <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> or sub-<abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>) execute the deed; or give their written consent to the registration of the deed of variation. The consents, or a certificate by a <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of s.18, Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (r.217A, LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> that they hold the requisite consents, must be lodged with the deed of variation application.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the proprietor of any such <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> (or sub-<abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>) may supply a letter confirming that it does not consider its <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> (or sub-<abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr>) to be adversely affected by the terms of the variation and, consequently, feels that it does not need to execute the deed nor lodge a consent. However, in the absence of any evidence we will not raise a requisition. Instead, we will make a non-guaranteed entry in the following form in the register:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“A Deed dated __ made between __ is expressed to alter the terms of the Charge dated __ referred to above.</p>

<p>NOTE: Copy filed”.</p>
</div>

<span class="number">13.3 </span>Fees</h3>

<p>A fee is payable under the current Land Registration Fee Order (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-registration-services-fees">HM Land Registry: Registration Services fees</a>).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Digital mortgages</h2>

<p>A digital mortgage is a mortgage deed that has been created, signed and dated electronically using HM Land Registry’s digital mortgage service, which is part of HM Land Registry’s network under section 92 of the Land Registration Act 2002. The digital mortgage will be made under section 91 of the Land Registration Act 2002, and (before 6 April 2018) the Land Registration (Electronic Conveyancing) Rules 2008. On and after 6 April 2018 those Rules are revoked and rules 54A to D of the Land Registration Rules 2003 (as amended) will apply. This means the digital mortgages created through the digital mortgage service will be regarded for all legislative purposes as deeds.</p>

<p>Digital mortgage deeds will not need to be witnessed, as the electronic signature process effectively acts as an online notarial system. The identity of the borrower is checked in advance of signing and the signature is certified.
Although the digital mortgage deed is entirely electronic, it will be possible to get official copies of the deed in PDF format, once it is registered.</p>

<p>A digital mortgage deed can be distinguished from a paper mortgage deed in various ways, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is headed ‘Digital Mortgage Deed’</li>
  <li>it contains the statement: <br>“This <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> takes effect when the registrar receives notification from [<abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of s.18, Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (r.217A, LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> name] that the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> is to take effect” followed by the date the deed was made effective</li>
  <li>it includes a typographical representation of the borrower’s digital signature, such as: “Signed by Jane Louise Smith”</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span>The digital mortgage service</h3>

<p>The digital mortgage service is a service that enables a <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of s.18, Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (r.217A, LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> to create a digital mortgage deed. It can be used only to create remortgages of a borrower’s existing property.</p>

<p>A borrower will be able to access their digital mortgage deed using the ‘Sign Your Mortgage Deed’ service website. The borrower will need to prove their identity using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify">GOV.UK Verify</a>. Once the borrower’s identity has been confirmed, they will be able to sign their deed electronically. This includes confirming they are signing their deed by entering a code that has been sent to their mobile phone. Once the borrower has signed the deed, the <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of s.18, Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (r.217A, LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> can complete the transaction and make an application for registration.</p>

<p>The use of GOV.UK Verify is an additional identity check at the point of signature. Use of the service does not change the requirements for a <abbr title="means an authorised person within the meaning of s.18, Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (r.217A, LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> to undertake their own identity checks in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-of-identity-conveyancers">practice guide 67: evidence of identity: conveyancers</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span>How to use the digital mortgage service</h3>

<p>Conveyancers must be registered Business Gateway users who have signed an HM Land Registry Network Access Agreement, to use the service. They will also need to have developed the relevant IT capability to use the service.</p>

<p>A lender who undertakes their conveyancing in-house will also be able to use the service. To use the service, the lender’s digital mortgage deed will need to be approved in advance for use with the service, and allocated an e-MD reference.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Things to remember</h2>

<p>Always check that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> is in a form approved by us</li>
  <li>if it’s not, and the <abbr title="means a legal mortgage or charge over land">charge</abbr> is not in form CH1:
    <ul>
      <li>your application should also contain a form RX1 to enter a restriction</li>
      <li>your application should also contain a form CH2 to note an obligation to make further advances</li>
      <li>panels 5 and 10 on the application form AP1 have been completed, and if appropriate, your application includes a copy of the lender constitution in English or Welsh</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>if the borrower is an overseas entity that you have complied with the requirements in the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022</li>
  <li>you have enclosed form CH3 if an entry is required in the register to note an agreed maximum amount of security</li>
  <li>if your application includes a deed of variation, all the required parties have executed the deed or you have  included the necessary consents</li>
  <li>you have enclosed the appropriate fee?</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that HM Land Registry may be unable to process applications that are incomplete or defective and your application will risk losing its priority if we have to return it to you – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/return-and-rejection-of-applications-for-registration">practice guide 49: return and rejection of applications for registration</a> for more information.</p>
