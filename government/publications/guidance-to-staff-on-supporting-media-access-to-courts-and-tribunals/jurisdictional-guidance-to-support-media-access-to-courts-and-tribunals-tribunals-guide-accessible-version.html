<p>Although journalists can, in many cases, attend tribunal hearings, you may still be contacted to verify the facts about a case they have heard about or to obtain details of a specific case after the event. In general, you can release factual information contained within a tribunal document that is open to public inspection or placed on a public notice board at a tribunal venue.</p>

<p>You may also be approached by the media about a forthcoming case. In most cases you can give out the basic details of case i.e. name of parties, their representatives etc. in advance of the hearing once the date has been fixed.</p>

<p>For details of the hearings the media may attend, the types of information that can be given to them and those tribunals that publish decisions please see the details for each tribunal below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>First-tier Tribunal – Health, Education and Social Care Chamber Mental Health</h2>

<p>All mental health cases are heard in private unless the tribunal considers that it is in the interests of justice for the hearing to be held in public. Where a judge has ordered that a hearing should take place in public, please contact press office as far in advance as possible for advice on handling media attendance at the hearing.</p>

<p>Unless the tribunal gives a direction to the contrary, information about mental health cases and the names of any parties to the case must not be made public.</p>

<p>Where a Mental Health Tribunal hearing is being held in public, judicial direction must be sought as to whether information about the case can be released to members of the public or media. Please make press office aware of any requests for information from journalists about specific cases.</p>

<p>Mental Health Tribunal decisions and other documents are not available to members of the public or media unless a judge has directed otherwise.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Care standards</h2>

<p>Journalists may attend any hearing held in public. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/care-standards-tribunal-hearing-list">Current public cases</a> are published.</p>

<p>Basic case details – name of appellant, case number, date of hearing, venue – for listed cases are available at the above link and should be provided to journalists enquiring about specific cases.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Special Educational Needs and Disability Discrimination in schools</h2>

<p>All special educational needs cases and disability discrimination in schools’ cases are heard in private unless the tribunal considers that it is in the interests of justice for the hearing to be held in public.

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>First-tier Tribunal – Immigration and Asylum Chamber</h2>

<p>Journalists may attend any hearing held in public.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-and-asylum-daily-court-lists">Listings are published</a> and are updated daily with information for the following day’s hearings.</p>

<p>Parties may apply for anonymity. If granted, names do not appear on the cause lists published on the website or displayed in the tribunal venue. The judge will then decide who can attend the hearing. The judge should be alerted to any members of the media enquiring about attending hearings of anonymised cases.</p>

<p>Children in Immigration/Asylum proceedings – where they are the litigant– are anonymised on Court Lists and reporting restrictions may apply.</p>

<p>Basic case details – name of appellant, name of solicitor or firm of solicitors, case number, date of hearing, venue – for listed cases are available at the above link and should be provided to journalists enquiring about specific cases.</p>
