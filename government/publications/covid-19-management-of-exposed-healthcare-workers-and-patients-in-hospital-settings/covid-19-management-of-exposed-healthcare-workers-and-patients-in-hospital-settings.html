<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>The advice for health and social care staff who have a positive lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test result has changed. They are no longer required to have a follow-up polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test, and they should stay at home and self-isolate immediately. There are some exceptions which are detailed in the guidance.</p>

<p>The advice for health and social care staff returning to England from another country has also changed. Staff entering from any country not on the red list are no longer required to take a daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test until day 10 after return from travel.</p>

<p>There is additional advice for health and social care staff with a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test after 10 days of self-isolation. Managers can undertake a risk assessment of staff who test positive between 10 and 14 days.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Scope</h2>

<p>This guidance is intended for staff and managers in health and social care settings and includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>guidance relating to health and social care staff if they develop coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms, receive a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result or are identified as a contact of a COVID-19 case</li>
  <li>guidance on isolation requirements for patients and residents in health and social care settings after contact with COVID-19 cases</li>
  <li>guidance on repeat testing for COVID-19 for staff, patients and residents in health and social care settings</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff who have travelled to England from another country are required to adhere to national entry and self-isolation requirements and follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#red-list-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">relevant guidance</a>. There are specific instructions for those entering from countries on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">red list</a>. If staff are exempt from quarantine after following this guidance, they can return to work.</p>

<p>This guidance has been written by UK Health Security Agency primarily for a health and care professional audience in England with input from NHS England. Country specific advice may be available for each country across the United Kingdom. Please refer to <a rel="external" href="https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/a-to-z-of-topics/covid-19/" class="govuk-link">Health Protection Scotland</a>, <a href="https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/latest-information-on-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Public Health Wales</a>, or <a href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/news/covid-19-what-situation-northern-ireland" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Guidance for health and social care staff on COVID-19 symptoms, test results and being identified as a contact of a case</h2>

<p>All staff who come into contact with COVID-19 cases – whether or not they are protected by the use of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) – should remain vigilant to the possibility of contracting infection, and should follow the guidance in this document if they develop symptoms.</p>

<p>The main symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>For most people, COVID-19 will be a mild illness. However, if any member of staff has any of the symptoms listed above, even if those symptoms are mild, they should stay at home and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a>.</p>

<p>There are several other symptoms linked with COVID-19. These symptoms may have another cause and are not on their own a reason to have a COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. If staff members are concerned about their symptoms, they should seek medical advice.</p>

<p>Staff who have received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine and who have any of the main symptoms of COVID-19 or have received a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, should still follow this guidance. This is because it is still possible to get COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if you are vaccinated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> If a staff member develops COVID-19 symptoms</h3>

<p>If a health or social care staff member develops any of the main <a href="#symptoms" class="govuk-link">symptoms of COVID-19</a>, however mild:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">Stay at home guidance</a> and arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test either through their workplace arrangements or the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace service</a>, as soon as possible (testing is most sensitive within 3 days of the development of symptoms)</li>
  <li>if at home (off-duty), they should not attend work whilst awaiting their <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result and should notify their employer or line manager immediately</li>
  <li>if at work, they should inform their employer or line manager and return home as soon as possible</li>
  <li>if they have already taken an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and the result was positive they should follow the advice in section 2.2</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> If a staff member receives a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result</h3>

<p>If a staff member receives a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, they must complete a period of self-isolation. The isolation period includes the day the symptoms started (or the day their test was taken if they do not have symptoms), also described as Day 0.</p>

<p>Staff members do not need to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if they have already taken an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and the result was positive, unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they wish to claim the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme">Test and Trace Support Payment</a>
</li>
  <li>they have received an <a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/letter-to-patients-important-information-about-new-treatments-for-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link">email or letter from the NHS</a> because of a health condition that means they are suitable for new COVID-19 treatments</li>
  <li>they are taking <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests as part of research or surveillance programmes, and the programme asks them to take a follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>they have a positive day 2 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test after arriving in England <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">after travel from another country</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There is further detail in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">Stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Staff may be able to end their self-isolation period before the end of 10 days.</p>

<p>They can take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test from the sixth day of their isolation period, and another <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on the following day. The second <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be taken at least 24 hours later. If both <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests results are negative, they may end their self-isolation after the second negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result.  They should not take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test before the sixth day of their isolation period and should only end their self-isolation following 2 consecutive negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests which should be taken at least 24 hours apart. Refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection/#example" class="govuk-link">Stay at home guidance</a> for an infographic on ending self-isolation.</p>

<p>After each <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test, staff should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">report the test results on the GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

<p>Staff may then return to work if they meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the staff member’s symptoms have resolved, or their only symptoms are cough or anosmia which can last for several weeks</li>
  <li>the staff member should continue to undertake daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests for the remaining days of isolation period. For example, if the first <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test was taken on the sixth day, and the second <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test was taken on the seventh day, they should continue to take <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests on days 8, 9 and 10. If the first <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test was taken on the seventh day and the second <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test was taken on the eighth day, they should continue to take <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests on days 9 and 10</li>
  <li>if any of these <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results are positive the staff member should isolate and should wait 24 hours before taking the next <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test</li>
  <li>on days the staff member is working, the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be taken prior to beginning their shift, as close as possible to the start time</li>
  <li>the staff member must continue to comply with all relevant infection control precautions and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be worn properly throughout the day</li>
  <li>if the staff member works with patients or residents who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 (as determined by the organisation), a risk assessment should be undertaken, and consideration given to redeployment for the remainder of the 10 day isolation period</li>
</ul>

<p>The likelihood of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test in the absence of a high temperature after 10 days is low. If the staff member’s <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is positive on the 10th day, they should continue to take daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, and can return to work after a single negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result.</p>

<p>The likelihood of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test after 14 days is considerably lower. If the staff member’s <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is still positive on the 14th day, they can stop testing and return to work on day 15. If the staff member works with patients or residents who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 (as determined by the organisation), a risk assessment should be undertaken, and consideration given to redeployment.</p>

<p>Managers can undertake a risk assessment of staff who test positive between 10 and 14 days and who do not have a high temperature, with a view to them returning to work depending on the work environment.</p>

<p>Any staff admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms will be subject to the guidance for isolation for patients within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings">guidance for stepdown of infection control precautions and discharging COVID-19 patients</a>.</p>

<p>There is additional guidance on reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">Stay at home guidance</a>. Household contacts of the staff member should also follow this guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Returning to work criteria for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases</h3>

<h4>2.3.1 If a staff member is symptomatic when returning to work after a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test or after their isolation period has ended</h4>

<p>Staff who receive a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result can usually return to work providing they are medically fit to do so, subject to discussion with their line manager or employer and a local risk assessment.</p>

<p>If medically fit to do so, staff who receive a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result can return to work after their isolation period has ended <a class="govuk-link" href="#section2-2">(follow the advice in section 2.2)</a>,  provided their symptoms have resolved or if their only symptoms are a cough or anosmia, which can last for several weeks.</p>

<p>Staff who receive an inconclusive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result should continue to self-isolate and arrange another <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. They can return to work after their isolation period has ended <a href="#section2-2" class="govuk-link">(follow the advice in section 2.2)</a> or if their <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is negative.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 If a staff member has a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and was asymptomatic when the test was taken</h4>

<p>Staff who test positive for COVID-19 (either by <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test) and who were asymptomatic at the time of the test can return to work after their isolation period has ended (<a class="govuk-link" href="#section2-2">follow the advice in section 2.2</a>).</p>

<p>If they develop any of the main <a href="#symptoms" class="govuk-link">symptoms</a> of COVID-19 during their self-isolation period, they do not need to start a new self-isolation period. If any staff member is concerned, or their symptoms are worsening, they should contact 111 or speak to their GP.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> If a staff member is identified as a contact of a COVID-19 case</h3>

<p>If a staff member is providing care to or is in close contact with an individual with COVID-19 infection and is wearing the correct <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> appropriately in accordance with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">UK infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) guidance</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">How to work safely guidance</a>, they will not be considered as a contact for the purposes of contact tracing and isolation. This applies regardless of the vaccination status of the staff member.</p>

<p>If there has been a breach of recommended <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> during the care episode then the staff member would be considered a contact and should follow the advice below.</p>

<p>In non-patient facing areas, <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> precautions may unintentionally be less stringently adhered to – if <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> precautions have been compromised, or <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has been worn incorrectly or breached, the staff member should be considered a contact and follow the advice below.</p>

<h4>2.4.1  Exemptions from self-isolation if a staff member is fully vaccinated<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup> and is identified as a contact of a case</h4>

<p>Staff members notified that they are a contact of a COVID-19 case are not required to self-isolate if they are fully vaccinated. They should inform their line manager or employer immediately if they are required to work in the 10 days following their last contact with a COVID-19 case.</p>

<p>If the staff member develops symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, follow the guidance in <a href="#section2-1" class="govuk-link">section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of fully vaccinated health and social care staff will be able to continue in their usual role. The following apply to staff returning to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the staff member should not have any of the main <a href="#symptoms" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 symptoms</a>
</li>
  <li>the staff member should not have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">any travel related isolation requirements</a>
</li>
  <li>the staff member should immediately arrange for a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, either through their workplace arrangements or via the NHS Test and Trace service, and the result of this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test should be negative prior to returning to work</li>
  <li>following the negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result, the staff member should undertake an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test every day for the 10 days following their last contact with the case (even on days they are not at work). <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">should be reported on the GOV.UK webpage</a>
</li>
  <li>if a staff member has had COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days, they should not have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and should only undertake daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> antigen tests for this purpose</li>
  <li>on days the staff member is working, the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> antigen test should be taken before starting their shift, and the result should be negative</li>
  <li>the staff member should comply with all relevant infection control precautions and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn properly throughout the day</li>
  <li>if the staff member works with patients or residents who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 (as determined by the organisation), a risk assessment should be undertaken, and consideration given to redeployment during the 10 days following their last contact with the case</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above cannot be met, the staff member should not come to work and should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">Stay at home guidance</a> for the full 10-day period.</p>

<h4>2.4.2 If an unvaccinated or partially vaccinated staff member is identified as a contact of a COVID-19 case</h4>

<p>If an unvaccinated or partially vaccinated staff member is notified as a contact of a COVID-19 case, by NHS Test and Trace or their workplace, they must self-isolate unless they are exempt (because they are under 18, unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons or are taking part or have taken part in a clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine) and follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">Stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If a staff member is unvaccinated and is exempt from self-isolation in the community they should not attend work, or should be redeployed for the period of time they would be required to self-isolate. If a staff member is to be redeployed, they should comply with the mitigations outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section2-4-1">section 2.4.1</a>.</p>

<p>If they develop symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, they should follow the guidance in <a href="#section2-1" class="govuk-link">section 2.1</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Self-isolation requirements for inpatients who are identified as contacts of a case of COVID-19</h3>

<p>Inpatients who are known to have been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case while in hospital should be isolated or cohorted (grouped together) with other similarly exposed patients who do not have COVID-19 symptoms, until 14 days after last exposure if they remain in hospital. This applies to all patients, irrespective of whether they have been fully vaccinated or had a prior COVID-19 infection. If inpatients are discharged to care settings, they should be advised to remain isolated from others for the remainder of their 14-day-exposure window. If they are asymptomatic and fully vaccinated refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">admission and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19</a> for further information.</p>

<p>If inpatients are discharged to their own home they and their household should be advised to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">Stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If symptoms or signs consistent with COVID-19 occur in the self-isolation period following exposure then relevant diagnostic tests, including for COVID-19, should be performed. If they test positive for COVID-19, then all the patients they have been cohorted with will need to re-start their 14-day-isolation period from the date of their last exposure to a newly diagnosed case. This includes patients who are discharged to a care home facility.</p>

<p>If their COVID-19 test result is positive, follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings/guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-and-discharging-covid-19-patients" class="govuk-link">guidance for stepdown of infection control precautions and discharging COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients</a> which includes information on self-isolation requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Isolation requirements for residents of social care settings who are identified as contacts of a case of COVID-&nbsp;19</h3>

<p>Residents who are known to have been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case should be isolated or cohorted for 14 full days after their last exposure to a COVID-19 case. If they are cohorted, this should only be with other residents who do not have COVID-19 symptoms but who have also been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case. This also applies to residents who have previously recovered from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Asymptomatic and fully vaccinated residents will not require self-isolation if certain additional mitigations are in place. Refer to the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">admission and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19</a> for further information.</p>

<p>If symptoms or signs consistent with COVID-19 develop in residents in the 14-day period since last exposure, then testing for COVID-19 (along with any relevant testing for other potential diagnoses) should be performed.</p>

<p>If individuals who have been cohorted with other residents subsequently test positive for COVID-19 then all the residents they have been cohorted with will need to re-start their 14-day-isolation period from the date of their last exposure to newly diagnosed case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Exemptions from routine testing for individuals who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 within 90 days</h3>

<p>Fragments of inactive virus can be persistently detected by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> in respiratory tract samples following infection, and for some time after a person has completed their isolation period and is no longer infectious.</p>

<p>Asymptomatic staff, patients and residents who do not have severe immunosuppression, and who have previously tested positive for COVID by <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> OR <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test should be exempt from routine testing by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 90 days from their initial illness onset or test date.</p>

<p>This does not apply if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop new COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>are required to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test upon entry into the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>This exemption includes patients without severe immunosuppression, who require routine testing within 48 hours prior to discharge to a care home. However, any hospitalised care home resident who tests positive and is being discharged within their 14-day-isolation period should only be discharged to a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/designated-settings-for-people-discharged-to-a-care-home">designated setting</a>.</p>
