<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement for people with coronavirus (COVID-19) infection to self-isolate, however the public health advice for people with any of the main symptoms of COVID-19 or a positive test result is to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Due to the higher risk nature of health and social care settings, the advice for staff members working in these settings has not changed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Scope</h2>

<p>This guidance is for staff and managers in health and social care settings and includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>guidance for health and social care staff if they develop any of the main COVID-19 symptoms, receive a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result or are identified as a contact of a COVID-19 case</li>
  <li>guidance on isolation requirements for patients and residents in health and social care settings after contact with COVID-19 cases</li>
  <li>guidance on repeat testing for COVID-19 for staff, patients and residents in health and social care settings</li>
</ul>

<p>There is separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initial-investigation-of-possible-cases/investigation-and-initial-clinical-management-of-possible-cases-of-wuhan-novel-coronavirus-wn-cov-infection">guidance on investigation and clinical management of possible cases</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance has been written by the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) with input from NHS England and is primarily for health and social care management and staff in England. Country specific advice may be available for each country across the United Kingdom.

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Guidance for staff who have COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test result</h2>

<p>Staff who have received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine and who have any of the main symptoms of COVID-19, or have received a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, should still follow this guidance. This is because it is still possible to get COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if you are fully vaccinated<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> If a staff member develops COVID-19 symptoms</h3>

<p>The main symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>For most people, COVID-19 will be a mild illness. However, if any member of staff has any of the symptoms listed above, even if those symptoms are mild:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are advised to stay at home and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a>
</li>
  <li>if at home (off-duty), they should not attend work while awaiting their <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result and should notify their employer or line manager immediately</li>
  <li>if at work, they should inform their employer or line manager and return home as soon as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several other symptoms linked with COVID-19. Any of these symptoms may also have another cause. If staff members are concerned about their symptoms, they should seek medical advice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> If a staff member receives a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result</h3>

<p>Anyone who receives a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result should stay at home and avoid contact with other people. There is no need to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test after a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result.</p>

<p>Health and social care staff with COVID-19 should not attend work until they have had 2 consecutive negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results (taken at least 24 hours apart), they feel well, and they do not have a high temperature. The first <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should only be taken from 5 days after the day their symptoms started (or the day their test was taken if they did not have symptoms) - this is described as Day 0. If both <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests results are negative they may return to work immediately after the second negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result, provided they meet the criteria below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the staff member’s symptoms have resolved, or their only symptoms are cough or anosmia which can last for several weeks</li>
  <li>if the staff member works with patients or residents who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 (as determined by the organisation), a risk assessment should be undertaken, and consideration should be given to redeployment until period10 days after their symptoms started (or the day their test was taken if they did not have symptoms)</li>
  <li>the staff member should continue to undertake daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests until 10 days after their symptoms started (or the day their test was taken if they did not have symptoms). For example:
    <ul>
      <li>if the first negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test was taken on the fifth day, and the second negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test was taken on the sixth day, they can return to work but should continue to take <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests on days 7, 8, 9 and 10</li>
      <li>if the first negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test was taken on the sixth day and the second negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test was taken on the seventh day, they can return to work but should continue to take <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests on days 8, 9 and 10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>if any of these <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results are positive the staff member should isolate and should wait 24 hours before taking the next <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test</li>
  <li>on days the staff member is working, the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be taken prior to beginning their shift, as close as possible to the start time</li>
  <li>the staff member must continue to comply with all relevant infection control precautions and personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) must be worn properly throughout the day</li>
</ul>

<p>The likelihood of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test in the absence of a high temperature after 10 days is low. If the staff member’s <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is positive on the 10th day, they should continue to take daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, and can return to work after a single negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result.</p>

<p>The likelihood of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test after 14 days is considerably lower. If the staff member’s <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is still positive on the 14th day, they can stop testing and return to work on day 15. If the staff member works with patients or residents who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 (as determined by the organisation), a risk assessment should be undertaken, and consideration given to redeployment.</p>

<p>Managers can undertake a risk assessment of staff who test positive between 10 and 14 days and who do not have a high temperature, with a view to them returning to work depending on the work environment.</p>

<p>Any staff member admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms will be subject to the guidance for isolation for patients within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings">guidance for stepdown of infection control precautions and discharging COVID-19 patients</a>.</p>

<p>There is additional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">guidance on reducing the spread of COVID-19</a>. Household contacts of the staff member should also follow this guidance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> If a staff member receives a negative or inconclusive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result</h2>

<p>Staff who had symptoms of COVID-19 and who received a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result can return to work providing they are medically fit to do so, subject to discussion with their line manager or employer and a local risk assessment.</p>

<p>Staff who receive an inconclusive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result should not attend work and should arrange another <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. If this repeat <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive they should <a class="govuk-link" href="#section2-2">follow the advice in section 2.2</a>. If their <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is negative they can return to work.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Guidance for staff who are contacts of someone with COVID-19</h2>

<p>If a staff member is providing care to or is in close contact with an individual with COVID-19 infection and is wearing the correct <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> appropriately in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control">UK infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) guidance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes">How to work safely guidance</a>, they will not be considered as a contact for the purposes of contact tracing and isolation. This applies regardless of the vaccination status of the staff member.</p>

<p>If there has been a breach of recommended <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> during the care episode then the staff member would be considered a contact and should follow the advice below.</p>

<p>In non-patient facing areas, <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> precautions may unintentionally be less stringently adhered to – if <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> precautions have been compromised, or <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has been worn incorrectly or breached, the staff member should be considered a contact and follow the advice below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Staff members who are contacts of someone who has COVID-19</h3>

<p>Staff members who are a contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case should inform their line manager or employer immediately if they are required to work in the 10 days following their last contact with the case.</p>

<p>If the staff member develops symptoms of COVID-19 during this period, follow the guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section2-1">section 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of health and social care staff who are contacts will be able to continue in their usual role. The following apply to staff returning to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the staff member should not have any of the main <a class="govuk-link" href="#symptoms">COVID-19 symptoms</a>
</li>
  <li>the staff member should immediately arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and the result of this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test should be negative prior to returning to work</li>
  <li>if a staff member has had COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days, they should not have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>following the negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result, the staff member should undertake an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test every day for the 10 days following their last contact with the case (even on days they are not at work)</li>
  <li>on days the staff member is working, the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be taken before starting their shift, and the result should be negative</li>
  <li>the staff member should comply with all relevant infection control precautions and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn properly throughout the day</li>
  <li>if the staff member works with patients or residents who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 (as determined by the organisation), a risk assessment should be undertaken, and consideration given to redeployment during the 10 days following their last contact with the case</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above cannot be met, the staff member should not come to work and should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">People with COVID-19 and their contacts guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Isolation requirements for patients and residents in health and social care settings after exposure to a case of COVID-19</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Isolation requirements for inpatients who are identified as contacts of a case of COVID-19</h3>

<p>Inpatients who are known to have been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case (contacts) should be isolated or should be cohorted (grouped together) with other similarly exposed patients who do not have COVID-19 symptoms, until 10 days after last exposure if they remain in hospital.</p>

<p>There is a small residual risk of developing COVID-19 after 10 days following exposure to a confirmed case. As an additional precaution, a risk assessment should be undertaken regarding the need to continue isolation from 11 to 14 days after exposure. This risk assessment should take into account factors such as the nature and extent of exposure, vaccination status (including booster status) of the contact, the ward environment which the individual is being transferred to and the risk of contact with patients at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19. There should be strict adherence to the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance.</p>

<p>If inpatient contacts are being discharged to a care setting during their contact isolation period, the care home should be informed of their status as a contact before discharge and this should be clearly described in the discharge summary. Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes">admission and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19</a> for further information on duration of self-isolation period for care home residents. If inpatient contacts are discharged to their own home, they and their household should be advised to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">government guidance on staying safe and preventing spread</a>.</p>

<p>If an inpatient contact develops symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during their contact isolation period, diagnostic tests including a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test for COVID-19 should be performed and isolation continued.</p>

<p>If the COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings">guidance for stepdown of infection control precautions and discharging COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients</a> which includes information on isolation requirements. All the patients they have been cohorted with will need to re-start their isolation period from the date of their last exposure to this newly diagnosed case. This includes patients who are discharged to a care home facility.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Isolation requirements for residents of social care settings who are identified as contacts of a case of COVID-19</h3>

<p>Residents who are known to have been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case (contacts) should be isolated or cohorted for up to 10 days following their exposure to a COVID-19 case. If they are cohorted, this should only be with other residents who do not have COVID-19 symptoms but who have also been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case. This also applies to residents who have previously recovered from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Residents may be able to end their self-isolation earlier than 10 days subject to a risk assessment and negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results. Refer to the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes">admission and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19</a> (section 1.8) for further information.</p>

<p>If residents develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during the 10-day isolation period, <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing for COVID-19 (along with any testing for other potential diagnoses) should be performed.</p>

<p>If a contact who has been cohorted with other residents subsequently tests positive for COVID-19, all the residents they have been cohorted with will need to re-start their isolation period from the date of their last exposure to the newly diagnosed case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Repeat testing for COVID-19</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Exemptions from routine testing for individuals who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 within 90 days</h3>

<p>Fragments of inactive virus can be persistently detected by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> in respiratory tract samples following infection, and for some time after a person has completed their isolation period and is no longer infectious.</p>

<p>Asymptomatic staff, patients and residents who do not have severe immunosuppression, and who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 by <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test should be exempt from routine testing by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 90 days from their initial illness onset or test date.</p>

<p>This does not apply if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop new COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>are required to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test upon entry into the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>This exemption includes patients without severe immunosuppression, who require routine testing within 48 hours prior to discharge to a care home. However, any hospitalised care home resident who tests positive and is being discharged within their 10-day isolation period should only be discharged to a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">designated setting</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Assessment of repeat <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positive test results within 90 days of a prior positive test</h3>

<p>If an individual is re-tested by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> within 90 days from their initial illness onset or prior positive COVID-19 test and the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, a clinical risk assessment should be used to decide whether new infection (‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-investigation-and-management-of-suspected-sars-cov-2-reinfections/investigation-and-management-of-suspected-sars-cov-2-reinfections-a-guide-for-clinicians-and-infection-specialists">reinfection</a>’) is a possibility and to inform subsequent action including whether isolation is required.</p>

<p>Guidance on reinfection and performing clinical risk assessment is detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-investigation-and-management-of-suspected-sars-cov-2-reinfections">Investigation and management of suspected SARS-CoV-2 reinfections: a guide for clinicians and infection specialists</a>.</p>

<p>The advice of an infection specialist should be sought to inform clinical risk assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Routine testing with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests within 90 days of a prior positive test</h3>

<p>If a staff member has returned to work after testing positive for COVID-19, they should resume routine <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing, even if this is within 90 days of the positive COVID-19 test result.  If staff, patients or residents are tested with an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test within 90 days of a prior positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and the result is positive, they should start a new period of self-isolation (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section2-2">section 2.2</a>), unless a clinical or risk assessment suggests that a re-infection is unlikely. This risk assessment should inform subsequent action including whether isolation is required.</p>

<p>Guidance on reinfection and performing clinical risk assessment is detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-investigation-and-management-of-suspected-sars-cov-2-reinfections">Investigation and management of suspected SARS-CoV-2 reinfections: a guide for clinicians and infection specialists</a>.</p>

<p>The advice of an infection specialist should be sought to inform clinical risk assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> Isolation requirements for repeat positive test results 90 days or more after a prior positive test</h3>

<p>If an individual is re-tested by <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> 90 days or more after their initial illness onset or prior test date, and is found to be positive, this should be considered as a possible new infection. They should isolate from when their symptoms started or their test date if they do not have symptoms, and follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">People with COVID-19 and their contacts</a>. Reinfection should be considered and further management including need for isolation assessed according to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-investigation-and-management-of-suspected-sars-cov-2-reinfections">guidance on the investigation and management of suspected SARS-CoV-2 reinfections</a>.</p>
