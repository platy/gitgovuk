<h2>Background and legislation</h2>

<p>The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and the transition period ended on 31 December 2020, which means Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) is now no longer part of a safety and security zone with the EU.</p>

<p>The government recognises the impact that coronavirus (COVID-19) has had on businesses and is introducing border controls from the end of the transition period in stages. Safety and security export declarations have been required in most cases since 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Safety and security import declarations for goods arriving from the EU and other territories that did not require these before 1 January 2021 have been waived until 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2022, safety and security declarations will become due on goods being imported from the EU and other territories that did not require these before 1 January 2021 to Great Britain. This will reflect the existing model already in place for trade between Great Britain and countries outside the EU.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2021, safety and security declarations will become due on goods leaving Great Britain in  vehicles, and for empty containers, pallets and vehicles moving to the EU under a transport contract. This will reflect the existing model already in place for Great Britain trade with countries outside the EU.</p>

<p>Safety and security requirements for goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are in place as of 1 January 2021 and are covered in the Northern Ireland section.</p>

<p>Safety and security declarations continue to be required for goods entering and leaving the UK from countries outside the EU.</p>

<p>The UK is committed to upholding the principles of the World Customs Organisation (WCO) SAFE framework.</p>

<p>Any references to Great Britain within this document include the 3 island territories off the coast of Great Britain which are Crown Dependencies. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Isle of Man</li>
  <li>the Bailiwick of Jersey</li>
  <li>the Bailiwick of Guernsey (which includes Alderney and Sark)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The legislation</h3>

<p>The requirements for safety and security declarations are underpinned by the following legislation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2013/952/contents" rel="external">Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2015/2446/contents/wales" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2015/2447" class="govuk-link">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2447</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/341/contents">Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/341</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1624/made" class="govuk-link">The Customs Miscellaneous Non-fiscal Provisions and Amendments etc. (EU Exit) Regulations 2020</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/1011/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Customs (Safety and Security Procedures) Regulations 2021</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The safety and security regulations mandate pre-arrival information for all consignments entering Great Britain, with exceptions for qualifying Northern Ireland goods moving from either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Northern Ireland to Great Britain</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland to Ireland, and then to Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<p>The government has legislated to guarantee unfettered access for Northern Ireland business to the whole of the UK internal market.</p>

<p>For safety and security that means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no entry summary (<abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>) declaration as qualifying Northern Ireland goods enter the rest of the UK from Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>no requirement to submit export or exit summary (<abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr>) declarations for qualifying Northern Ireland goods leaving Northern Ireland for the rest of the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>The only exceptions to these arrangements will be goods falling within the very limited number of procedures relating to specific international obligations binding on the UK and the EU â for example, obligations on the movement of endangered species and where traders want to use special procedures like duty suspense where we would continue to provide facilitations.</p>

<p>On 9 September 2021, the government legislated to make sure that no <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration will be required for qualifying Northern Ireland goods which arrive in Great Britain having moved through Ireland. Further guidance will be provided closer to this change coming into effect.</p>

<p>All information submitted will be assessed against a set of risk rules, allowing the UK to continue to secure its borders effectively.</p>

<h2>Imports into Great Britain and Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>Safety and security data for imports is submitted by the lodgement of an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration.</p>

<h3>Responsibility</h3>

<p>The legal requirement to submit an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration lies with the operator of the active means of transport â for example the vessel, aircraft, train or road vehicle â on or in which the goods are brought into the customs territory (either Great Britain or Northern Ireland). We will refer to this party as the carrier.</p>

<p>For rail, this means the Rail Freight Operator who is authorised to traction the train through the Channel Tunnel, into Great Britain.</p>

<p>For maritime and air, the legal requirement is with the party that has contracted and issued the bill of lading or an air waybill, for the carriage of the goods into Great Britain or Northern Ireland. For sea, this means the shipping company is responsible, and for air, the airline.</p>

<p>For roll on roll off (<abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr>), this means the haulage company is responsible for lodging the declaration for âaccompaniedâ goods and the ferry operator for âunaccompaniedâ goods.</p>

<p>In the case of âcombined transportâ â such as a truck carried on a ferry â the obligation to file an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> lies with the operator of the active means of transport on arrival in the UK. Where a truck is carried on a ferry, and will drive off the ferry on arrival in the UK, the obligation lies with the trucking company.</p>

<p>Where a ferry is transporting an unaccompanied trailer or container, the active means of transport is the ferry, even where the trailer or container could be attached to a truck when it arrives at its destination.</p>

<h3>Accuracy and completeness</h3>

<p>Customs authorities and economic operators must be able to identify who is responsible for compliance with this requirement.</p>

<p>The declarant must provide the information known to them at the time of lodgement of the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>. Theyâre entitled to base their <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing on data provided by the trading or contracting parties.</p>

<p>All the data elements prescribed in the table in <a href="#appen-1" class="govuk-link">Appendix 1 for safety and security</a> and <a href="#appen-2" class="govuk-link">Appendix 2 for <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr></a> must be contained in the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing. If the declarant learns later that one or more particulars contained in the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing have been incorrectly declared, the provisions on amendments will apply.</p>

<p>Safety and security declarations are an important part of Border Forceâs frontier risk assessment processes. The timely provision of complete and accurate data will help your goods flow through the border more smoothly.</p>

<p>The government will continue to engage with carriers, hauliers and traders to make sure that their obligations to meet safety and security requirements are fully understood.  We will seek to support those who make genuine errors to get it right, including education and intervention. Enforcement action in respect of non-compliance will be evidenced based and proportionate. This action could involve goods being delayed at the border for further checks and risking fines.</p>

<h3>Who can submit the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Someone other than the carrier may lodge an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>. However, as it is the carrierâs responsibility to make sure that it is submitted within the legal time limits, and it must only be done by a representative or third party with the carrierâs knowledge and consent.</p>

<p>Arranging for an alternative third party <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing may be done through the use of commercial terms and conditions and may involve the third-party declarant and the carrier making amendments to an existing, or creating a new, contractual agreement that the third party is to file the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> instead of the carrier.</p>

<p>How the carrierâs consent to the third party <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing is to be evidenced and under which conditions and terms are subject to contractual agreement between the commercial parties. For example time for submission of the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>, the shipments involved, and the duration of the filing arrangement.</p>

<p>Except where there is evidence to the contrary, the customs authorities may assume that the carrier has given its consent under contractual arrangements and that the third partyâs lodging of the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> is made with the carrierâs knowledge and consent.</p>

<p>If responsibility is passed on to a third party, the legal liability to make sure that an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration is submitted remains with the carrier. However, the responsibility that the information provided is accurate lies with the declarant â in this case, the third party.</p>

<h3>When to submit</h3>

<p>Legislation requires that an electronic <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> must be lodged before arrival in Great Britain or Northern Ireland or, in the case of maritime deep-sea containerised shipments, before loading onto the vessel that will carry the goods into Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</p>

<h4>Time limits for submitting an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> to Great Britain or Northern Ireland</h4>

<p>Check the time limits for submitting an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maritime containerised cargo (except short sea containerised shipping) â at least 24 hours before loading onto the vessel that will carry the goods into Great Britain or Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>maritime bulk or break bulk (except short sea bulk or break bulk shipping) â at least 4 hours before arrival at the Office of First Entry in Great Britain or Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>short sea voyages â at least 2 hours before arrival at the Office of First Entry in Great Britain or Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>short-haul flights less than 4 hours in duration â at least by the time of the actual take off</li>
  <li>long-haul flights more than 4 hours in duration â at least 4 hours before arrival at the Office of First Entry in Great Britain or Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>rail â at least 2 hours before arrival at the UK customs Office of Entry (Dollands Moor for rail) or at least 1 hour if the journey is less than 2 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>Short sea journeys into Great Britain refer to journeys from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the English Channel â or the Atlantic coast of Europe from the point where it meets the English Channel to and including the port of Algeciras</li>
  <li>Norway</li>
  <li>Ireland</li>
  <li>the Faroe Islands &amp; Iceland</li>
  <li>ports on the Baltic Sea and the North Sea</li>
</ul>

<p>Short sea journeys into Northern Ireland refer to journeys from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Great Britain and the Channel Islands</li>
  <li>Greenland</li>
  <li>the Faroe Islands</li>
  <li>Iceland</li>
  <li>ports on the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea</li>
  <li>all ports of Morocco</li>
</ul>

<h4>Time limits for <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> accompanied and unaccompanied</h4>

<p>For <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> accompanied this must be lodged at least 2 hours before the goods are due to arrive in the Great Britain or Northern Ireland â for Channel Tunnel, due to juxtaposed controls this must be lodged at least 1 hour before arrival at the Eurotunnel EU terminal â  by the haulage company if goods are accompanied.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> unaccompanied this must be lodged at least 2 hours before the goods are due to arrive in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, by the ferry operator if goods are unaccompanied.</p>

<p>You can check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-roll-on-roll-off-ports" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> listed Ports</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>If youâre using the Goods Vehicle Movement Service</h4>

<p>The entry summary declaration will need to be submitted at the earliest of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the minimum timing requirement</li>
  <li>before check-in closes</li>
</ul>

<p>This is to allow for the movement reference number (<abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr>) from the entry summary declaration to be recorded in the Goods Movement Reference, which will be validated by the carrier at check in.</p>

<p>Check more information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-how-to-move-goods-through-ports-that-use-the-goods-vehicle-movement-service">Goods Vehicle Movement Service</a>.</p>

<h3>Which service to use and how to access it for imports into Great Britain</h3>

<p>Safety and security data is submitted by the lodgement of an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration.</p>

<p>For all goods imported into Great Britain, the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> will be submitted into the S&amp;S GB service.</p>

<p>This will apply to all imports using the following modes of transport:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sea and maritime</li>
  <li>air</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> (accompanied and unaccompanied)</li>
  <li>rail</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, when goods are moved from a country outside the EU to Great Britain via an EU port, for the movement to the EU port carriers are required to submit an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> into the Import Control System of the relevant EU member state. A separate <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> is required for the movement of goods from the EU member state to Great Britain, however, this requirement has been temporarily waived until 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2022, for the movement of goods from the EU member state to Great Britain, carriers will be required to submit a separate <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> into S&amp;S GB in line with the time limits.</p>

<p>S&amp;S GB does not have a user interface and therefore data will need to be lodged using compatible software.</p>

<p>This can be done by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employing the services of a Community System Provider (<abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>purchasing compatible software, available from software developers</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you need before you can submit <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> into S&amp;S GB</h3>

<h4>Access to the system</h4>

<p>As explained in the section above, you will need access to S&amp;S GB. You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-to-make-an-entry-summary-declaration-in-great-britain" class="govuk-link">register and enrol to use the S&amp;S GB service</a> and before you can do this you need a Government Gateway user ID and password.</p>

<p>You can find more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chief-trade-and-commercial-contacts-for-community-service-providers"><abbr title="Community System Providers">CSPs</abbr></a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-developers-providing-entry-summary-declaration-support" class="govuk-link">software developers</a> and it is your choice regarding the option that best suits your business needs. We will be happy to provide further information and support where necessary.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> should be submitted as an XML message and all technical documentation for third-party software providers and <abbr title="Community System Providers">CSPs</abbr>, including Application Platform Interface (API) specification, message types and authentication protocols, are available on the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation">HMRC Developer Hub</a>.</p>

<p>A testing environment is available to allow <abbr title="Community System Providers">CSPs</abbr> and software developers to test that their software works with the S&amp;S GB service.</p>

<p>If you need more details on technical specifications for S&amp;S GB, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk">SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>A Government Gateway user ID and password</h4>

<p>If you decide to submit the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations yourself, and you get the appropriate software, you will also need to register for a Government Gateway user ID and password. You may already have a Government Gateway user ID and password for other interactions with HM Government. If so, you can use the same Government Gateway user ID and then register and enrol for the access to S&amp;S GB.</p>

<p>You can find help and information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services">registering for HMRC Online services</a>.</p>

<h4>An <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number starting with GB</h4>

<p>If you move goods to Great Britain, you need an Economic Operator Registration Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr>) number that starts with GB to make the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration into the S&amp;S GB service.</p>

<p>The S&amp;S GB service does not share data or information with safety and security systems in other countries so the person lodging the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration, either the carrier or an appointed third-party representative, must have an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number starting with GB.</p>

<p>Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eori" class="govuk-link">get an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number</a>.</p>

<h3>Submitting an amendment for S&amp;S GB</h3>

<p>The legal requirement is that the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> is complete and accurate. There are a number of principles regarding what can be amended in the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> and when the amendment can take place. From a legal point of view, there is no restriction in the Customs Code or the Customs Code Implementing Provisions. However, you should not amend the particulars concerning the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>person lodging the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>representative</li>
</ul>

<p>The customs Office of First Entry (<abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr>) may be amended only if the new <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> is also in Great Britain. If the new <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> is not in Great Britain, follow the guidance in the section â<a href="#arrivals-diversions-S&amp;S-GB" class="govuk-link">Arrivals and Diversions â S&amp;S GB</a>â.</p>

<p>Amendments can only be made up until the point that the goods arrive in Great Britain. The time limits for the lodging of the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> do not start again after the amendment since, legally, it is the initial declaration that sets them.</p>

<p>There is no cancellation message for S&amp;S GB. <abbr title="entry summaries">ENSs</abbr> submitted can be amended but not cancelled. An amendment contains all the data of the original <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> plus any amendment made and overwrites the first entry. Where goods are no longer to be shipped it is not necessary to inform the S&amp;S GB service.</p>

<p>Within <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> and Road modes, it is recognised that periodic extensive disruption due to weather or industrial action can disrupt ferry/rail services and this could unduly impact the road haulage industry due to the volume and cost of amending their <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations. Where a routing suffers cancellations or delays in excess of 2 hours of the normal scheduled arrivals, an amendment would not be required as long as the following criteria are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vehicle moves on the same routing as declared within the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration</li>
  <li>the vehicle moves with the same carrier as declared within the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration</li>
  <li>the vehicle moves after the original declared sailing or scheduled departure time</li>
  <li>the vehicle moves from the declared port of departure no longer than 12 hours after its original declared sailing or scheduled departure time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Arrivals and Diversions for S&amp;S GB</h3>

<h4>Arrivals</h4>

<p>There is no requirement to submit an âArrival Notificationâ for goods being imported into Great Britain.</p>

<h4>Diversions</h4>

<p>Diversions to Great Britain for cargo that has not already been declared into S&amp;S GB will require <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations for that cargo. <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations should be submitted as soon as the decision to divert is made, but no later than 2 hours pre-arrival.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations have already been submitted in S&amp;S GB, amendments will be needed if the diversion results in a significant change to information such as port of arrival or date of arrival.</p>

<p>Amendments can be submitted up to the point of arrival in Great Britain.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances (âforce majeureâ), contact HMRC Import Control System helpdesk <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ics.helpdesk@hmrc.gov.uk">ics.helpdesk@hmrc.gov.uk</a> immediately for advice on next steps.</p>

<h3>What data is needed for S&amp;S GB</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration should be submitted for every individual consignment. For example, a trailer or container may be carrying one, two or many different consignments and therefore, an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration is required for each consignment.</p>

<p>The data to be provided on an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>, for risk assessment, includes information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vessel, conveyance, container or vehicle bringing the goods into Great Britain</li>
  <li>the route the conveyance takes to get to Great Britain</li>
  <li>the persons or companies involved in the transaction (such as a consignor, consignee, carrier or agent)</li>
  <li>the goods being brought into Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<p>The specific data elements required for an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> submitted into S&amp;S GB are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#appen-1">Appendix 1</a>.</p>

<h3>Data held by other parties in the supply chain for S&amp;S GB</h3>

<p>Although the carrier has the responsibility to make sure the submission of the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>, some of the data required may be held by other parties, such as freight forwarders or individual traders or importers. The carrier will decide who should submit the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> for individual shipments.</p>

<p>If a carrier decides to allow a third party to submit an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> on their behalf, they will need to arrange to pass the relevant conveyance and routing information to that third party.</p>

<p>Where a carrier decides to allow a third party to submit the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> on its behalf there are, among other required data elements, several that the third-party representative would need to obtain from the carrier prior to lodging the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number of the carrier</li>
  <li>mode of transport at the border</li>
  <li>the nationality of the active means of transport entering Great Britain</li>
  <li>expected date and time of first place of arrival or entry in Great Britain</li>
  <li>first place of arrival or entry code</li>
  <li>the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) vessel number (relating to maritime shipments), the flight number (for air), trailer number or vehicle registration number (for accompanied <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The carrier will need to make such data elements available to the third-party declarant preferably at the time of booking or as logically required for a timely submission of that partyâs <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing.</p>

<p>In all circumstances the carrierâs <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number and the carrierâs transportation document number must always be included in any third party <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filings.</p>

<p>For example for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maritime, ocean (master) bill of lading if known (or the booking reference number supplied by the carrier)</li>
  <li>air, (master) air waybill number</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> â CMR</li>
</ul>

<p>If a carrier decides to submit all <abbr title="entry summaries">ENSs</abbr> themselves then they may need to gather the required, more detailed, data on the goods and persons involved in the movement from other sources (such as freight forwarders or individual traders) further down the supply chain.</p>

<h3>Which Service to use and how to access it for imports into Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>For all goods imported into Northern Ireland, from Great Britain and countries outside the EU, the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> will be submitted into the Import Control System Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>).</p>

<p>This will apply to all imports using the following Modes of Transport: Sea and Maritime, Air, <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> (accompanied and unaccompanied).</p>

<p><abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr> does not have a User Interface and therefore data will need to be lodged using compatible software.</p>

<p>This can be done by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employing the services of a Community System Provider (<abbr title="Community System Provider">CSP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>purchasing compatible software, available from software developers</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr> is gradually being replaced by a new system, the <abbr title="Import Control System 2">ICS2</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Import Control System 2">ICS2</abbr> will become operational in 3 releases. Each release affects different operators and modes of transport. Operators will begin declaring their goods into <abbr title="Import Control System 2">ICS2</abbr> depending on the type of services they provide.</p>

<p>The first release of <abbr title="Import Control System 2">ICS2</abbr> requires express operators and postal operators moving postal consignments into Northern Ireland by air to submit Pre-Loading Advance Cargo Information (<abbr title="Pre-Loading Advance Cargo Information">PLACI</abbr>) information into <abbr title="Import Control System 2">ICS2</abbr>. Where relevant, express and postal operators have been required to submit <abbr title="Pre-Loading Advance Cargo Information">PLACI</abbr> information into ICS 2 since 31 August 2021.</p>

<p>The second release of <abbr title="Import Control System 2">ICS2</abbr> is expected to go live in March 2023 and will require full <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations for all air movements.</p>

<p>The third release is expected to go live in March 2024 and will require full <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations for rail, road and maritime modes of transport.</p>

<p><abbr title="Import Control System 2">ICS2</abbr> declarations will be submitted through the EU Shared Trader Interface (<abbr title="Shared Trader Interface">STI</abbr>). To access the <abbr title="Shared Trader Interface">STI</abbr>, traders will need appropriate software and to register through Uniform User Management (<abbr title="Uniform User Management">UUM</abbr>). This will be done by contacting HMRC and requesting a profile.</p>

<p>The EU has published information on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/general-information-customs/customs-security/import-control-system-2-ics2_en"><abbr title="Import Control System 2">ICS2</abbr> releases and requirements</a>.</p>

<h3>What you need before you can submit <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> into <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>
</h3>

<h4>Access to the system</h4>

<p>As explained in the section above, you will need access to <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr> to submit <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations. You can find more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chief-trade-and-commercial-contacts-for-community-service-providers"><abbr title="Community System Providers">CSPs</abbr></a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-developers-providing-entry-summary-declaration-support">software developers</a> and it is your choice regarding the option that best suits your business needs. We will be happy to provide further information and support where necessary.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> should be submitted as an XML message and all technical documentation for third-party software providers and <abbr title="Community System Providers">CSPs</abbr>, including API (Application Platform Interface) specification, message types and authentication protocols, are available via the HMRC Developer Hub.</p>

<h4>A Government Gateway user ID and password</h4>

<p>If you decide to submit the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations yourself, and you get the appropriate software, you will also need to register for a Government Gateway user ID and password. You may already have a Government Gateway user ID and password for other interactions with the UK government. If so, you can use the same Government Gateway user ID and simply enrol for the access to <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can find help and information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services">registering for HMRC Online services</a>.</p>

<h4>An <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number starting with XI or EU</h4>

<p>If you move goods to Northern Ireland, you need an Economic Operator Registration Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr>) number that starts with XI or EU to make the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration.</p>

<p>To get an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number that starts with XI, you must first have an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number that starts with GB.</p>

<p>If you already have an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number from an EU country which starts with EU, then you do not need an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number starting with XI. However, you may still need an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number starting with GB to use some UK customs systems.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eori" class="govuk-link">find more information about <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> numbers</a>.</p>

<h4>Trader Support Service â if you move goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland</h4>

<p>You could <a rel="external" href="https://www.tradersupportservice.co.uk/tss" class="govuk-link">sign up for the free Trader Support Service</a> which can complete the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations on your behalf.</p>

<h3>Submitting an Amendment for <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The legal requirement is that the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> is complete and accurate. There are a number of principles regarding what can be amended in the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> and when the amendment can take place. From a legal point of view, there is no restriction in the Customs Code or the Customs Code Implementing Provisions. However, you should not amend the particulars concerning the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>person lodging the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>representative</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> may be amended only if the new <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> is also in Northern Ireland. If the new <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> is not in Northern Ireland, follow the guidance in the section â<a href="#arrivals-diversions-ics-ni" class="govuk-link">Arrivals and Diversions â <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr></a>â.</p>

<p>Amendments can only be made up until the point that an âArrival Notificationâ is received into <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr> upon goods arriving at the <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> in Northern Ireland. The time limits for the lodging of the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> do not start again after the amendment since, legally, it is the initial declaration that sets them.</p>

<p>There is no cancellation message for <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>. <abbr title="entry summaries">ENSs</abbr> submitted can be amended but not cancelled. An amendment contains all the data of the original <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> plus any amendment made and overwrites the first entry. Where goods are no longer to be shipped it is not necessary to inform <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Within <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> and Road modes, it is recognised that periodic extensive disruption due to weather or industrial action can disrupt ferry and rail services and this could unduly impact the road haulage industry due to the volume and cost of amending their <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations. Where a routing suffers cancellations or delays in excess of 2 hours of the normal scheduled arrivals, an amendment would not be required as long as the following criteria are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vehicle moves on the same routing as declared within the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration</li>
  <li>the vehicle moves with the same carrier as declared within the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration</li>
  <li>the vehicle moves after the original declared sailing or scheduled departure time</li>
  <li>the vehicle moves from the declared port of departure no longer than 12 hours after its original declared sailing or scheduled departure time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Arrivals and Diversions for <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>
</h3>

<h4>Arrivals</h4>

<p>Upon arrival at the Northern Ireland air port, regardless of whether it is an <abbr title="Office of First Entry">OoFE</abbr> or OoSE, the âoperator of the active means of transportâ (carrier) entering Northern Ireland (the person acting on their behalf for customs) must submit an âArrival Notificationâ allowing customs to identify all the <abbr title="entry summaries">ENSs</abbr> that were previously submitted for the cargo carried on the vessel (or aircraft).</p>

<p>The Arrival Notification must cover all <abbr title="entry summaries">ENSs</abbr> on the vessel even if the goods are remaining on board or destined for discharge at either subsequent EU air ports or air ports outside of the EU.</p>

<h4>Diversions</h4>

<p>Diversions can be accepted within <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>, so long as the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration is still submitted as soon as the decision to divert is made, but no later than 2 hours pre-arrival.</p>

<p>If the diversion results in a significant change to information in the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration after submission, such as changes to the port of arrival or date of arrival, this should be amended.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances (âforce majeureâ), contact HMRC Import Control System helpdesk <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ics.helpdesk@hmrc.gov.uk">ics.helpdesk@hmrc.gov.uk</a> immediately for advice on next steps.</p>

<h3>What data is needed for <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration should be submitted for every individual consignment. For example, a trailer or container may be carrying one, two or many different consignments and therefore, an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration is required for each consignment.</p>

<p>The data to be provided on an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>, for risk assessment, includes information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vessel, conveyance, container vehicle bringing the goods into Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>the route the conveyance takes to get to Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>the persons or companies involved in the transaction (such as the consignor, consignee, carrier, or agent)</li>
  <li>the goods being brought into Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>The specific data elements required for an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> submitted into <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr> are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#appen-2">Appendix 2</a>.</p>

<h3>Data held by other parties in the supply chain for <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Although the carrier has the responsibility to make sure the submission of the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>, some of the data required may be held by other parties, such as freight forwarders or individual traders and importers. The carrier will decide who should submit the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> for individual shipments.</p>

<p>If a carrier decides to allow a third party to submit an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> on their behalf, they will need to arrange to pass the relevant conveyance and routing information to that third party.</p>

<p>Where a carrier decides to allow a third party to submit the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> on its behalf there are, among other required data elements, several that the third-party representative would need to obtain from the carrier prior to lodging the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number of the carrier</li>
  <li>mode of transport at the border</li>
  <li>the nationality of the active means of transport entering Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>expected date and time of first place of arrival or entry in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>first place of arrival or entry code</li>
  <li>the IMO vessel number (in the case of maritime shipments), the flight number (for air), trailer number or vehicle registration number (for accompanied <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The carrier will need to make such data elements available to the third-party declarant preferably at the time of booking or as logically required for a timely submission of that partyâs <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing.</p>

<p>In all circumstances the carrierâs <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number and the carrierâs transportation document number must always be included in any third party <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filings. For example for maritime â ocean (master), bill of lading or the booking reference number supplied by the carrier. Or for air, (master) air waybill number and for <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr>, CMR.</p>

<p>If a carrier decides to submit all <abbr title="entry summaries">ENSs</abbr> themselves then they may need to gather the required, more detailed, data on the goods and persons involved in the movement from other sources (such as freight forwarders or individual traders) further down the supply chain.</p>

<h3>What happens after submission in both S&amp;S GB and <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>
</h3>

<h4>Validation of data</h4>

<p>Information submitted in the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> will be subjected to various levels of validation (on the structure and content of the information) before an <abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr> is issued. Once the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> has passed all levels of validation, an <abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr> is issued to the person who submitted the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Risk assessment</h4>

<p>Once the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> has been validated, accepted and an <abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr> issued, it will be risk assessed against a set of risk rules. The results of the risk assessment will then be used by the UK Border Force to identify either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shipments they wish to prevent being loaded onto the vessel entering Great Britain (see Do Not Load message)</li>
  <li>imports that they may wish to control on entering Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<p>The provision of timely, complete and accurate data will prevent unnecessary delays in this process.</p>

<h4>Do Not Load (<abbr title="Do Not Load">DNL</abbr>) message</h4>

<p>For deep-sea containerised shipments only, a Do Not Load (<abbr title="Do Not Load">DNL</abbr>) message, the IE351, may be issued. This will be sent to the person submitting the declaration.</p>

<p>There are a number of steps which must be followed to make sure that the carrier will be made aware that a <abbr title="Do Not Load">DNL</abbr> has been issued where a third party (for example, a freight forwarder) has made the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the third-party may only file the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> with the ocean carrierâs knowledge and consent</li>
  <li>in its <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing, the third-party must identify the ocean carrier with the ocean carrierâs <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> number</li>
  <li>the third-party must also include both the container number(s) and the ocean carrierâs transport document number (that is, the master bill of lading number or booking reference number) in addition to its own (house) bill of lading number in its <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing</li>
</ul>

<p>Provided these data elements are included in the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>, and provided that the ocean carrier is IT-connected to S&amp;S GB or <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr> the ocean carrier would automatically be notified not only of the <abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr> for the third-party filing (which will serve as proof that the carrierâs obligation that an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> is filed has been met) but also of any <abbr title="Do Not Load">DNL</abbr> messages.</p>

<p>Based on the container and transportation document numbers included in the <abbr title="Do Not Load">DNL</abbr> message, the ocean carrier would be able to identify the containerised shipment that may not be loaded. Moreover, it is not unrealistic to expect that if a Customs Administration believed that a consignment posed such a serious threat that a <abbr title="Do Not Load">DNL</abbr> is appropriate then they would not simply rely on the sending of an electronic message to interested parties.</p>

<p>The UK Border Force will contact you to tell you what to do if you receive a Do Not Load message.</p>

<h3>Unintentional dual filing for both S&amp;S GB and <abbr title="Import Control System Northern Ireland">ICS NI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If the carrier has contractually agreed that a third party will file the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> instead of it, the carrier should not make its own <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> filing for that same shipment. Similarly, a third party may not file without the carrierâs prior knowledge and contractual agreement.</p>

<p>In cases where dual filings for the same shipment nonetheless occur, for example, the carrier and a third party both file an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> for the same shipment, customs authorities may decide to use both filings for their safety and security risk analysis. Otherwise, they will consider that the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> lodged by the carrier takes precedence.</p>

<p>Dual filings may affect compliance with the legal requirement that an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> is made if the information is not compliant with the relevant authority, or within the specified time limits.</p>

<h2>Exports from Great Britain</h2>

<h3>When an exit summary (<abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr>) declaration is needed</h3>

<p>Most exports will have safety and security requirements met with the customs export declaration which contains safety and security information. This is sometimes referred to as a combined exports declaration. The person(s) normally responsible for submitting a combined declaration is the exporter of the goods, or their representative.</p>

<p>The carrier of the goods has a legal responsibility to make sure the UK customs authority is provided with pre-departure safety and security information. The carrier will need to make sure they provide certain information to the person submitting the combined exports declaration.</p>

<p>An exit summary declaration (<abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr>) is required in some cases where the export consignments are not covered by a combined export declaration.</p>

<p>When an <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> is required, the responsibility for ensuring this is submitted lies with the carrier or the operator of the âactive means of transportâ.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> is required when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an empty pallet, container or vehicle is being moved under a transport contract</li>
  <li>goods have remained in temporary storage for more than 14 days</li>
  <li>goods have remained in temporary storage for less than 14 days, but the import safety and security declaration details are unknown, or the destination or consignee has changed</li>
  <li>goods are moved under transit using either a transit accompanying document (<abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr>), a transit security accompanying document (TSAD) or a transport internationaux routiers (<abbr title="Transport Internationaux Routiers">TIR</abbr>) Carnet document</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>A transport contract, or contract of carriage, is an agreement between a carrier and shipper or passenger, setting out each partyâs duties and rights.</p>
</div>

<p>A temporary waiver is in place from 1 January 2021 to 30 September 2021 for safety and security requirements, for two categories of movements only.</p>

<p>The temporary waiver applies to both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>empty pallets, containers and vehicles being moved under a transport contract to the EU (and to other countries for which a pre-departure declaration was not required before 31 December 2020)</li>
  <li>goods in <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> vehicles where there would otherwise be a requirement for an <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> (this will include, for example, transit movements using <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 October 2021, a permanent waiver of safety and security export requirements will apply to goods moved under common transit procedures from Great Britain to Ireland, where the goods are destined for Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Export safety and security information will be required on all other movements out of Great Britain, unless permanently exempt. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-when-to-make-an-exit-summary-declaration" class="govuk-link">find more information about those exceptions</a>.</p>

<p>Safety and security export declarations are not required for goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>Who is responsible for <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> and who can submit</h3>

<p>The legal requirement to submit an <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declaration lies with the âoperator of the active means of transportâ (for example, the vessel, aircraft, train or road vehicle) on or in which the goods depart the customs territory (for example, Great Britain). We refer to this party as the carrier.</p>

<p>For rail, this means the rail freight operator who is authorised to traction the train through the Channel Tunnel, into the EU.</p>

<p>For maritime and air, the legal requirement is with the party that has contracted and issued the bill of lading or an air waybill, for the carriage of the goods our of Great Britain. For sea, this means the shipping company is responsible and for air, the airline.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr>, this means the haulage company is responsible for lodging the declaration for âaccompaniedâ goods and the ferry operator for âunaccompaniedâ goods.</p>

<p>Where a ferry is transporting an unaccompanied trailer or container, the active means of transport is the ferry, even where the trailer or container could be attached to a truck when it arrives at its destination.</p>

<p>Someone other than the carrier may lodge an <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr>. However, as it is the carrierâs responsibility to make sure that it is submitted within the legal time limits, an <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> must only be lodged by a representative or third party with the carrierâs knowledge and consent.</p>

<p>Arranging for such an alternative third party <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> filing may be done through the use of commercial terms and conditions and may involve the third-party declarant and the carrier making amendments to an existing, or creating a new, contractual agreement that the third party is to file the <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> instead of the carrier.</p>

<p>How the carrierâs consent to the third party <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> filing is to be evidenced and under which conditions and terms are subject to contractual agreement between the commercial parties. For example, time for submission of the <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr>, the shipments involved, and the duration of the filing arrangement.</p>

<p>Except where there is evidence to the contrary, the customs authorities may assume that the carrier has given its consent under contractual arrangements and that the third partyâs lodging of the <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> is made with the carrierâs knowledge and consent.</p>

<p>If responsibility is passed on to a third party, the legal liability to make sure that an <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declaration is submitted remains with the carrier. However, the responsibility that the information provided is accurate, lies with whomever the declarant is â in this case, the third party.</p>

<h3>Which HMRC system to use and how to access it</h3>

<p>Export declarations, including <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declarations, are made on the HMRC Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) based National Export System (<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>).</p>

<p>You can get someone to deal with the declarations for you, or you can make the declaration yourself.</p>

<p>Youâll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>access to the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system</li>
  <li>software that can submit declarations</li>
  <li>to be registered for the <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you make the declarations yourself, you can use the <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> system to send declarations using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web</li>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>XML or Community Systems Providers</li>
</ul>

<p>You must have an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr>) number and a Government Gateway user ID and password.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can arrange for a third party with <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> access to submit the declaration on your behalf.</p>

<p>Check further information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-when-to-make-an-exit-summary-declaration" class="govuk-link">making exit summary declarations</a>.</p>

<h3>When to submit an <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You must present your <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> to customs before export so it can be risk assessed and the safety and security information must be submitted a specific number of hours before leaving the Great Britain port.</p>

<p>The way in which the goods are transported affects how far in advance the safety and security information must be provided.</p>

<p>Check the time limits for each mode of transportation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>âdeep seaâ containerised cargo â at least 24 hours before the goods are loaded</li>
  <li>âshort seaâ containerised and non-containerised cargo â at least 2 hours before leaving the port</li>
  <li>air traffic â at least 30 minutes before departure from an airport</li>
  <li>rail traffic â at least 2 hours before the goods leave Union territory</li>
  <li>road and inland waterways traffic â at least 1 hour before departure</li>
</ul>

<p>You can amend safety and security declarations after the initial submission if certain information changes (such as the ferry company used or time of arrival), up until the point of customs clearance.</p>

<h3>Which <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> process to follow</h3>

<p>There are different processes to follow depending on how and where you move your goods or empties out of Great Britain.</p>

<h4>Submit an <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> using the insert exit summary (<abbr title="insert exit summary">IEXS</abbr>) declaration type in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>
</h4>

<p>You will need to submit an <abbr title="insert exit summary">IEXS</abbr> declaration in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> if you are exporting goods from Great Britain to the EU or countries outside the EU by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any transport mode through an inventory linked port</li>
  <li>any transport mode other than <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> through a non-inventory linked port</li>
</ul>

<p>You should submit an <abbr title="insert exit summary">IEXS</abbr> declaration in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> using the Customs Procedure Code (CPC) 10 00 046. Further information on the data fields you will be required to complete in the declaration can be found in <a href="#appendix-3" class="govuk-link">Appendix 3</a>.</p>

<p>Once your exit summary declaration is accepted, youâll be issued with an <abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr>.</p>

<p>This exit summary declaration will still need to be presented to the customs Office of Export in the UK and gain permission to progress before the goods can leave the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-importance-of-the-declaration-unique-consignment-reference-ducr" class="govuk-link">using a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr></a>. You can use the <abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr> of the exit summary declaration or <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to present your goods.</p>

<p>The exit summary declaration must be âarrivedâ on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> at the port or airport. Input of the electronic arrival message completes presentation of the goods so that they may be cleared for the export procedure. You must make arrival messages at the port or airport. If the arrival message has been inputted fully and correctly, <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will proceed directly to acceptance and automated risk analysis.</p>

<p>At non-inventory linked ports, where <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> arrival facilities are not available, an approved loader for the location can request that HMRC input the goods as âarrivedâ on the system using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-exports-that-arrived-or-left-a-uk-port-that-were-not-declared-in-chief">form C1601</a>. If this is successful, the arrival message will be entered onto <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will then indicate whether the goods have been given clearance to be exported or HMRC may indicate that the goods should not be shipped, pending further enquiries or submission of further paperwork or the need for a physical check. If, at the end of the further checks process, HMRC or Border Force are satisfied that all is in order, HMRC will grant permission to progress and <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will indicate that the goods can then be shipped.</p>

<p>There is a requirement to notify the customs Office of Exit about goods departing the customs territory. All <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declarations will automatically be assumed as departed on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, so there is no need to facilitate the departure notification for <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declarations.</p>

<h4>Submit an âarrivedâ <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> using the Export Full Declaration type in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>
</h4>

<p>You will need to submit an âarrivedâ <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declaration in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> if you are exporting goods from Great Britain to the EU or countries outside the EU through either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> through a port which is not inventory linked</li>
  <li>any transport mode through Dover, Holyhead or Eurotunnel</li>
</ul>

<p>When an <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> is submitted as arrived, it is not necessary to submit a separate arrival message in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> after the arrived <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> has been submitted.</p>

<p>Some ports lack the physical space to run checks on consignments and are operating with Inland Border Facilities. This means an âarrivedâ exit summary (<abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr>) declaration will be required. When an âarrivedâ declaration is submitted, an arrival message is automatically sent as soon as the declaration is made, and, if necessary, the carrier can then be directed away from the port for checks elsewhere.</p>

<p>At non-inventory linked ports, submitting an âarrivedâ <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> means that the person submitting the <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> does not need to contact the National Clearance Hub to request that an arrival message is submitted in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. This will avoid disruption caused by carriers waiting for âpermission to progressâ which is only sent once a declaration is arrived.</p>

<p>To submit an âarrivedâ <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> you will need to enter the CPC 10 00 056 into the export full declaration (EFD) in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and declare declaration type (Box 1) as âEXAâ to submit the declaration as arrived. Further information on the data fields you will be required to complete in the declaration can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix4">Appendix 4</a>.</p>

<p>Once your exit summary declaration is accepted, youâll be issued with an <abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr>. The declarant will be notified by <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> whether permission to progress has been given or whether further checks are required. You should not move to the border location until permission to progress is received, or you are asked to do so.</p>

<p>Once permission to progress has been received, you may proceed to the port of exit and the goods may be shipped.</p>

<p>There is a requirement to notify the customs Office of Exit about goods departing the customs territory. All <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declarations will automatically be assumed as departed on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, so there is no need to facilitate the departure notification for <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declarations.</p>
