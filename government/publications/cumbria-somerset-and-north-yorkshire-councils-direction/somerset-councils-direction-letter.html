<p>Letter from

<strong>Paul Rowsell CBE</strong></p>

<p>Head of Governance Reform &amp; Democracy Unit</p>

<p>Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities
<br><br>
to:
<br><br>
<strong>Chief Executives of Somerset councils</strong>
<br><br>
10 May 2022</p>
</div>

<p>Dear Chief Executives,</p>

<p>I wrote to you on 17 March to inform you that the Secretary of State was minded to issue a direction under section 24 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, which would require, from the date of coming into effect of the direction, that those councils in Somerset to be dissolved on 1 April 2023 must seek consent of the person specified in the direction before entering into certain contracts or land disposals.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has considered the representations he received regarding the intended approach and has confirmed his decision, which is to issue a direction. The date of coming into effect has been amended to 16 June 2022 as requested. I enclose a copy of the direction in its final form, accompanied by the explanatory note.</p>

<p>We look forward to continuing to work with you all, to ensure the establishment of a successful Somerset Council delivering the quality of services and effective local government which the people of Somerset deserve.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>P Rowsell</p>
