<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>A lease may be extended by the grant of a new lease to the existing tenant, to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take immediate effect</li>
  <li>commence on a future date</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide excludes leases granted under the leasehold reform legislation (meaning the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 or the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993). For further details on dealing with these, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-leasehold-reform-legislation">practice guide 27: the leasehold reform legislation</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Where the new lease takes immediate effect</h3>

<p>In this case the tenants are taken, as a matter of law, to have surrendered their original lease (‘the old lease’) immediately before the new one commences. This rule is based on the doctrine of estoppel. Because the new lease is inconsistent with the old lease the tenants are estopped from denying that the old lease has come to an end.</p>

<p>The rule applies irrespective of the intention of the parties.</p>

<p>The surrender of the old lease must be effected in the register and the new lease registered in its place. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-to-apply-the-rules-and-make-substantive-applications-to-land-registry---new-lease-taking-immediate-effect">How to apply the rules and make substantive applications to HM Land Registry – new lease taking immediate effect</a>.</p>

<p>If the applicants’ existing leasehold title is registered, they should apply for closure of that title. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#closing-an-existing-leasehold-title">Closing an existing leasehold title</a>.</p>

<p>If the old lease is not registered, but is noted in the landlord’s title, they should apply for cancellation of the notice. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#cancel-notice">Cancellation of notice of unregistered lease on the landlord’s title</a>.</p>

<p>There may be occasions where the new lease takes effect subject to the existing lease and the existing leasehold title is not closed. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#new-lease-made">New lease made subject to old lease</a>.</p>

<h4>1.1.1 Use of deeds of variation</h4>

<p>It is clear in law that the term of a lease cannot simply be extended by deed. Instead, where a deed attempts either to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vary the length of a registered lease by increasing the term</li>
  <li>add new land to the extent demised by a registered lease</li>
</ul>

<p>it is treated in law as effecting a surrender of the existing lease by operation of law and the immediate grant of a new lease of the whole demised premises, including any additional land. If, therefore, such a deed is effected (whether to correct the original lease or subsequently vary its effect) it will need to be treated as operating in this way. As to the procedure, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#use-deeds-variation">Use of deeds of variation</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Where the new lease commences on a future date</h3>

<p>The new lease may commence at any time up to 21 years from the date of the grant, see section 149(3) of the Law of Property Act 1925. Therefore, if the old lease has less than 21 years to run, the new lease may be granted to commence on its expiry, or at some point in the future, prior to its expiry.</p>

<p>If the old lease has more than 21 years to run, it will have to be shortened, by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a separate deed of variation</li>
  <li>suitable wording in the new lease, so that it determines just before the commencement of the new lease</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-to-apply-the-rules-and-make-substantive-applications-to-land-registry---new-lease-commencing-on-a-future-date">How to apply the rules and make substantive applications to HM Land Registry - new lease commencing on a future date</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Retention of documents submitted with applications</h3>

<p>Original documents are normally required only if your application is a first registration.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="an authorised person within the meaning of s.18, Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (r.217A, LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> may, however, make an application for first registration on the basis of certified copy deeds and documents only. For information about this, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-registrations/practice-guide-1-first-registrations#acceptance-of-certified-copy-deeds">practice guide 1 – first registrations – Applications lodged by conveyancers – acceptance of certified copy deeds</a>.</p>

<p>If your application is not for first registration, then we will need only certified copies of deeds or documents you send to us with HM Land Registry applications. Once we have made a scanned copy of the documents you send to us, they will be destroyed, this applies to both originals and certified copies.</p>

<p>However, any original copies of death certificates or grants of probate will continue to be returned.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How to apply the rules and make substantive applications to HM Land Registry - new lease taking immediate effect</h2>

<p>In this case you will need to lodge applications to register the new lease and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>close an existing registered leasehold title</li>
  <li>cancel the notice of an unregistered lease, noted on the landlord’s title</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Registration of the new lease</h3>

<p>You need to lodge the application in either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a> with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/documents-list-dl">form DL</a>, in duplicate, if the application is for first registration (rules 23 and 24(1)(d) of the Land Registration Rules 2003)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> if the lease is out of a registered title (rule 13 Land Registration Rules 2003).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If granted on or after 19 June 2006 a lease out of a registered title must be a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prescribed-clauses-leases">practice guide 64: prescribed clauses leases</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to lodge, as appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a certified copy of the new lease</li>
  <li>the appropriate Stamp Duty Land Tax (<abbr title="stamp duty land tax">SDLT</abbr>) or Land Transaction Tax (LTT) certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If you need advice on whether <abbr title="stamp duty land tax">SDLT</abbr> or LTT evidence is appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <abbr title="stamp duty land tax">SDLT</abbr>, call the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) stamp taxes helpline on 0300 200 3510 from 8.30am to 5pm Monday to Friday except public holidays, or visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sdlt-online">HMRC’s stamp taxes website</a>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>for LTT, call the Welsh Revenue Authority (WRA) customer service centre on 03000 254 000 from 9.30am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday except public holidays, or visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://beta.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority" rel="external">WRA’s website</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>the consent of the landlord’s mortgagee, if required</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Where the consent is not lodged, we will make the following entry in the property register of the new title:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The title to the lease is, during the subsistence of the charge dated ….. in favour of ….. affecting the landlord’s title (and to the extent permitted by law, any charge replacing or varying this charge or any further charge in respect of all or part of the sum secured by this charge), subject to any rights that may have arisen by reason of the absence of chargee’s consent, unless the lease is authorised by section 99 of the Law of Property Act 1925.”</p>
</div>

<p>We will not make this entry if you lodge a copy of the mortgage deed, and confirm that the granting of the lease was permitted by the terms of the mortgage (by referring to the relevant clause in the deed) and that the mortgagee’s consent was not required.</p>

<p>A consent is always required where a charge on the landlord’s title is protected by a restriction preventing registration of a lease or a disposition.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the consent of any superior landlord, if the superior lease requires such consent to be obtained</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Where the consent of the superior landlord is not lodged we will make the following entry in the property register of the new title:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The registrar has not seen any consent to the grant of this sub-lease that the superior lease out of which it was granted, may have required.”</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>any consent required by a restriction or caution affecting the landlord’s title</li>
  <li>any charges or deeds of substituted security, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#deeds-substituted">Deeds of substituted security</a>
</li>
  <li>an application <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enter-a-restriction-registration-rx1">form RX1</a> for any restriction being applied for, other than a Form A restriction, see rule 92 Land Registration Rules 2003. However, you may apply for a standard form of restriction at clause LR13 of a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restrictions-and-leasehold-properties-pg19a">practice guide 19A: restrictions and leasehold properties</a> for advice on drafting restrictions relating to covenants in leases</li>
  <li>where the landlord’s title is unregistered, an examined abstract or epitome of title of the landlord’s title and any superior titles, if absolute leasehold is required</li>
  <li>contract for sale or for the grant of the new lease</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: You may need to lodge this if the new lease is granted to the buyer on the occasion of a sale of a registered leasehold property, as the old lease will still be registered in the name of the seller. In this case the buyer must lodge evidence that the existing proprietor has agreed to the grant of the lease.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a certified copy of the surrendered lease, which is not registered or noted, together with title to it</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Any mortgages, or other incumbrances, affecting the unregistered leasehold estate must be discharged or released. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#deeds-substituted">Deeds of substituted security</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a certified copy of the surrendered lease, if the new lease is drawn by reference to the terms of the surrendered lease.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note 1: Where the new lease imports terms from the surrendered lease, the imported terms must be at clauses LR8, LR9, LR10 or LR11 of a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>, or no register entries will be made, even if any imported terms would appear to require such an entry. For guidance on completing these prescribed clauses, see section 5 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prescribed-clauses-leases/practice-guide-64-prescribed-clauses-leases#the-prescribed-clauses">practice guide 64: prescribed clauses leases</a>.</p>

<p>Note 2: Where the new lease contains a reference to the surrendered lease, we will add an explanatory note to the short particulars of the new lease in the register. When the new lease is a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>, an explanatory note will only be added when the surrendered lease is referred to in the prescribed clauses, or in a part of the body of the lease referred to by the prescribed clauses. The wording of the note will vary depending on whether the surrendered lease was registered and whether the extension is being effected by a deed of variation.</p>

<p>Note 3: Where the surrendered lease has previously been varied, the register of the new leasehold title will only make reference to such deeds of variation as are specifically referred to in the terms of the new lease or the prescribed clauses of a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the lease is out of a registered title and is granted on or after 19 June 2006, with certain exceptions, the lease must be a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr> (rule 58A of the Land Registration Rules 2003). For further information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prescribed-clauses-leases">practice guide 64: prescribed clauses leases</a>.</p>

<p>To find out what happens to documents submitted with application forms, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#retention-documents">Retention of documents submitted with applications</a>.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 Fees</h4>

<p>The fee is payable under the current Land Registration Fee Order, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-registration-services-fees">HM Land Registry: Registration Services fees</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Use of deeds of variation</h3>

<p>A deed of variation extending the term will always be deemed to be effecting a surrender of the existing lease (by operation of law) followed by the immediate grant of a new lease. A deed that takes effect in this way does not have to be a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>, even if the lease being varied is itself a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>. However, this exemption does not apply if the terms of the variation expressly provide for the surrender of the existing lease or the grant of a new one. For further information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/amending-deeds-that-effect-dispositions-of-registered-land">practice guide 68: amending deeds that effect dispositions of registered land</a> - section 4.3.3 Prescribed clauses leases.</p>

<p>You need to lodge the application in either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a> with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/documents-list-dl">form DL</a>, in duplicate, if the application is for first registration (rules 23 and 24(1)(d) of the Land Registration Rules 2003)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> if out of a registered title (rule 13 of the Land Registration Rules 2003).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the documents listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#registration-of-the-new-lease">Registration of the new lease</a>, you will also need to lodge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a certified copy of the new deed of variation</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Any original deed lodged with your application will be retained and destroyed after a scanned copy is made(rule 203 of the Land Registration Rules 2003)</p>

<ul>
  <li>the appropriate <abbr title="stamp duty land tax">SDLT</abbr> or LTT certificate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If you need advice on whether <abbr title="stamp duty land tax">SDLT</abbr> or LTT evidence is required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <abbr title="stamp duty land tax">SDLT</abbr>, call the HMRC stamp taxes helpline on 0300 200 3510 from 8.30am to 5pm Monday to Friday except public holidays, or visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sdlt-online">HMRC’s website</a>
</li>
  <li>for LTT, call the WRA customer service centre on 03000 254 000 from  9.30am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday except public holidays or visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://beta.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority" rel="external">WRA’s website</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As the deed will operate as a surrender of the existing lease and the grant of a new one, you must consider any charges against the existing leasehold title. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#deeds-substituted">Deeds of substituted security</a>. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-211-fees">Fees</a> regarding fees.</p>

<p>To find out what happens to documents submitted with application forms, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#retention-documents">Retention of documents submitted with applications</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Closing an existing leasehold title</h3>

<p>This must be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> (rule 13 of the Land Registration Rules 2003).</p>

<p>You must consider any incumbrances on the title and, where appropriate, lodge evidence to support their release, withdrawal or cancellation to enable the title to be closed.</p>

<p>In respect of any charge affecting the closing leasehold title, you should lodge a form DS1 or arrange for the lender to submit an <abbr title="means an electronic DS1">e-DS1</abbr> or an electronic discharge (<abbr title="an electronic discharge">ED</abbr>).</p>

<p>Alternatively you may lodge a certified copy of a deed of substituted security. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#deeds-substituted">Deeds of substituted security</a>.</p>

<p>In respect of any restriction, you should lodge either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cancel-a-restriction-registration-rx3">form RX3</a> for its cancellation</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdraw-a-restriction-registration-rx4">form RX4</a> for its withdrawal</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if the restriction is in Form A, it will not prevent closure of the leasehold title if the surrender is by two or more proprietors or, where the surrender is by a single proprietor, if there is no capital money paid by the landlord to the tenant.</p>

<p>In respect of any home rights notice, you should lodge a form HR4, together with any necessary supporting evidence. For further information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/applications-under-the-family-law-act-1996">practice guide 20: applications under the Family Law Act 1996</a>.</p>

<p>In respect of any other notices which would prevent determination of the existing leasehold title, you should lodge either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-application-to-remove-un2">form UN2</a> for removal of a unilateral notice</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unilateral-notice-cancellation-un4">form UN4</a> for cancellation of a unilateral notice</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-cancellation-cn1">form CN1</a> for cancellation of a notice other than a unilateral notice, including equitable and noted charges</li>
</ul>

<p>Note 1: Any notice which would not prevent determination will be carried forward to the new leasehold title, unless an application for its removal or cancellation is included.</p>

<p>Note 2: Additional evidence may be required in support of any application to cancel, withdraw or remove a restriction or notice. For further information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notices-restrictions-and-the-protection-of-third-party-interests-in-the-register">practice guide 19: notices, restrictions and protection of third party interests</a>.</p>

<p>Where the existing leasehold title contains adverse easements or restrictive covenants that are not repeated in the landlord’s title, these may be carried forward to the new leasehold title.</p>

<p>You should also lodge evidence of the applicants’ right to apply if they are not the registered proprietors. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#registration-of-the-new-lease">Registration of the new lease</a>.</p>

<p>To find out what happens to documents submitted with application forms, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#retention-documents">Retention of documents submitted with applications</a>.</p>

<h4>2.3.1 Fees</h4>

<p>The fee is payable under the current Land Registration Fee Order, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-registration-services-fees">HM Land Registry: Registration Services fees</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Cancellation of notice of unregistered lease on the landlord’s title</h3>

<p>This must be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-cancellation-cn1">form CN1</a>, (rule 87(1) of the Land Registration Rules 2003).</p>

<p>You will also need to lodge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a certified copy of the surrendered lease</li>
  <li>the applicant’s title to it</li>
  <li>land charges searches against the current tenants, together with evidence to account for any entries revealed</li>
</ul>

<p>All incumbrances must be withdrawn or released, and any mortgages affecting the unregistered leasehold estate must be discharged. Alternatively, a deed of substituted security may be lodged. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#deeds-substituted">Deeds of substituted security</a>.</p>

<p>To find out what happens to documents submitted with application forms, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#retention-documents">Retention of documents submitted with applications</a> regarding retention of documents submitted with application forms.</p>

<h4>2.4.1 Fees</h4>

<p>The fee is payable under the current Land Registration Fee Order, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-registration-services-fees">HM Land Registry: Registration Services fees</a>.</p>

<p>Note: There is no authority to waive the fee for the CN1 application, regardless of the nature of any other applications lodged simultaneously.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Deeds of substituted security</h3>

<p>Before completing the new lease, the tenants should contact the chargee(s) of the old lease to find out their requirements.</p>

<p>The chargee(s) may prefer to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>release their existing charge and take a fresh charge over the new leasehold estate</li>
  <li>use a deed to substitute the security</li>
</ul>

<p>HM Land Registry would prefer that the charge on the old lease is discharged using either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mortgage-cancellation-of-entries-for-lenders-ds1">form DS1</a>
</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="an electronic discharge">ED</abbr>
</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="means an electronic DS1">e-DS1</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>and then a fresh charge executed over the land in the new lease.</p>

<p>However, we will accept a deed that substitutes the new lease as security for the existing charge, ie a deed of substituted security.</p>

<p>If using a deed of substituted security, the charge over the old lease must still be released. You can achieve this by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using a form DS1</li>
  <li>using an <abbr title="an electronic discharge">ED</abbr>
</li>
  <li>using an <abbr title="means an electronic DS1">e-DS1</abbr>
</li>
  <li>including clear words of release in the deed itself</li>
</ul>

<p>The deed must also make clear that it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>charges the new leasehold estate</li>
  <li>reaffirms or imports the provisions of the original charge</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is a restriction in the register relating to the original charge or an entry relating to an obligation to make further advances the entries will only be carried forward if fresh applications in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enter-a-restriction-registration-rx1">form RX1</a> and/or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legal-charges-obligation-for-further-advances-ch2">form CH2</a> is lodged, unless the deed of substituted security is an approved form of charge containing an application for a standard form of restriction and/or a further advances obligation.</p>

<p>To find out what happens to documents submitted with application forms, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#retention-documents">Retention of documents submitted with applications</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>New lease made subject to old lease</h3>

<p>If the new lease is made expressly subject to the old lease we accept that surrender of the old lease does not occur.</p>

<p>In such a case the new lease, as a lease of the landlord’s reversionary interest, is not inconsistent with the old lease.</p>

<p>We will not close the existing leasehold title.</p>

<p>Although this approach may have advantages, the existence of concurrent leases, with the same proprietor, registered under separate title numbers may be confusing for those subsequently dealing with the title.</p>

<p>If new conveyancers are employed on a sale and the position is not made clear to them, difficulties often result. The position may also be difficult to explain to a purchaser.</p>

<p>When registering such a new lease, we will have regard to the possibility that the proprietors of any charges affecting the old lease have an interest in the new lease. They may have such an interest under either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the terms of their charge</li>
  <li>general law</li>
</ul>

<p>If making an application to register such a new lease, you will need to make a specific declaration in clause LR4 of the new lease, lodge any charges affecting the old lease or list them in panel 10 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a> or panel 10 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a>. The declaration should be along the following lines:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“This lease takes effect subject to but with the benefit of the existing lease dated……..”.</p>
</div>

<p>Notice of the existing lease will be added to the title of the new lease and notice of the concurrent lease will be added to the landlord’s title.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, an entry along the following lines will also be made in the charges register:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The land is subject to such rights as may be subsisting in favour of the persons interested in a charge dated (date) made between (parties) of the lease dated (date) referred to in the Schedule of leases hereto”.</p>
</div>

<p>Note: This procedure only applies to leases that come into effect immediately.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How to apply the rules and make substantive applications to HM Land Registry - new lease commencing on a future date</h2>

<p>You need to lodge the application in either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a> with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/documents-list-dl">form DL</a>, in duplicate, if the application is for first registration (rules 23 and 24(1)(d) of the Land Registration Rules 2003)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> if the lease is out of a registered title (rule 13 of the Land Registration Rules 2003)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If granted on or after 19 June 2006 a lease out of a registered title must be a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>. For further information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prescribed-clauses-leases">practice guide 64: prescribed clauses leases</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to lodge, as appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a certified copy of the new lease</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If you lodge the original lease with your application this will be retained and destroyed after a scanned copy has been made (rule 203 of the Land Registration Rules 2003).</p>

<ul>
  <li>the appropriate <abbr title="stamp duty land tax">SDLT</abbr> or LTT certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If you need advice on whether <abbr title="stamp duty land tax">SDLT</abbr> or LTT evidence is appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <abbr title="stamp duty land tax">SDLT</abbr>, call the HMRC stamp taxes helpline on 0300 200 3510 from 8.30am to 5pm Monday to Friday except public holidays, or visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sdlt-online">HMRC’s stamp taxes website</a>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>for LTT, call the WRA customer service centre on 03000 254 000 from 09.30 am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday except public holidays, or visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://beta.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority" rel="external">WRA’s website</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>the consent of the landlord’s mortgagee, if required</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Where the consent is not lodged, we will make the following entry in the property register of the new title:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The title to the lease is, during the subsistence of the charge dated ….. in favour of ….. affecting the landlord’s title (and to the extent permitted by law, any charge replacing or varying this charge or any further charge in respect of all or part of the sum secured by this charge), subject to any rights that may have arisen by reason of the absence of chargee’s consent, unless the lease is authorised by section 99 of the Law of Property Act 1925.”</p>
</div>

<p>We will not make this entry if you lodge a copy of the mortgage deed, and confirm that the granting of the lease was permitted by the terms of the mortgage (by referring to the relevant clause in the deed) and that the mortgagee’s consent was not required.</p>

<p>A consent is always required where there is a restriction in favour of the landlord’s mortgagee on the landlord’s title.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the consent of any superior landlord, if the superior lease requires such consent to be obtained</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Where the consent of the superior landlord is not lodged we will make the following entry in the property register of the new title:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The registrar has not seen any consent to the grant of this sub-lease that the superior lease out of which it was granted, may have required.”</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>any consent required by a restriction or caution affecting the landlord’s title</li>
  <li>certified copies of any new charges, charging the new lease as additional security</li>
  <li>an application <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enter-a-restriction-registration-rx1">form RX1</a> for any restriction being applied for, other than a form A restriction, see rule 92 of the Land Registration Rules 2003. However, you may apply for a standard form of restriction at clause LR13 of a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>. See 
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restrictions-and-leasehold-properties-pg19a">practice guide 19A: restrictions and leasehold properties</a> for advice on drafting restrictions relating to covenants in leases</li>
  <li>where the landlord’s title is unregistered, an examined abstract or epitome of title of the landlord’s title and any superior titles if absolute leasehold title is required</li>
  <li>a certified copy of a deed of variation, if the term of the old lease has more than 21 years to run</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: A deed varying a lease that takes effect as a surrender and regrant of the leasehold estate does not have to be a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>. This exception applies whether or not the original lease was a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>certified copy of the existing lease, if the new lease is drawn by reference to the terms of the existing lease.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the lease is out of a registered title and is granted on or after 19 June 2006, with certain exceptions, the lease must be a <abbr title="any lease granted on or after 19 June 2006 which is required by r.58A, LRR 2003 to contain the prescribed clauses set out in Schedule 1A, LRR 2003">prescribed clauses lease</abbr> (rule 58A of the Land Registration Rules 2003).
