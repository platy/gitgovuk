<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Insolvency proceedings</h2>

<p>Insolvency proceedings are formal measures taken to deal with company debt.</p>

<p>There are many different types of company insolvency proceedings. We cover all of them in this guidance.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that not all companies involved in insolvency proceedings are insolvent.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Companies can be dissolved without going through insolvency proceedings</h3>

<p>If we have reason to believe that a company is not carrying on business or is not in operation, its name may be struck off the register and dissolved without going through liquidation. A private company that is not trading can apply to be struck off the Companies House register. This procedure is not an alternative to formal insolvency proceedings.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>See our guidance for more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/company-strike-off-dissolution-and-restoration">strike off, dissolution and restoration</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>&nbsp;Supervising insolvency procedures</h3>

<p>All liquidators, administrators, administrative receivers and supervisors taking office must be authorised insolvency practitioners.</p>

<p>Receiver managers, Law of Property Act (LPA) receivers and nominees appointed to manage a company voluntary arrangement moratorium do not have to be authorised.</p>

<p>Insolvency practitioners may be authorised by the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Association of Chartered Certified Accountants</li>
  <li>Insolvency Practitioners’ Association</li>
  <li>Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales</li>
  <li>Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland</li>
  <li>Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>&nbsp;Directors of an insolvent company</h3>

<p>The liquidator, administrative receiver or administrator must send a report to the Secretary of State of Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, on the conduct of all directors who were in office in the last 3 years of the company’s trading. The Secretary of State must decide whether it’s in the public interest to seek a disqualification order against a director.</p>

<p>Examples of the most commonly reported conduct are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continuing the company’s trading when the company was insolvent</li>
  <li>failing to keep proper accounting records</li>
  <li>failing to send in returns or pay any tax that is due</li>
  <li>disqualification for persistent breaches of companies legislation</li>
  <li>disqualification of unfit directors of insolvent companies</li>
  <li>disqualification following investigation of companies</li>
  <li>disqualification for wrongful trading</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>&nbsp;Moratorium</h2>

<p>A moratorium provides struggling businesses a formal breathing space. It prevents the company’s creditors from proceeding against the company during this time. During a moratorium no legal action can be taken against a company without leave of the court.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Obtaining a moratorium</h3>

<p>The directors must apply to the court for a moratorium. The moratorium will normally last for a period of 28 days and will be managed by a nominee, who may (or may not) be a registered insolvency practitioner.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>&nbsp;What we need</h3>

<p>The nominee must deliver a notice of the moratorium to Companies House. You must notify us if the moratorium ends, or is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>extended</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>further extended</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>renewed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being continued</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Insolvency (Scotland) (<abbr title="company voluntary arrangement">CVA</abbr> and Administration) Rules came into force on 6 April 2019. This introduced new statutory forms that you must file with us.</p>

<p>At the end of a moratorium a company may (or may not) proceed to a <abbr title="company voluntary arrangement">CVA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Company voluntary arrangements (<abbr title="company voluntary arrangement">CVA</abbr>)</h2>

<p>A <abbr title="company voluntary arrangement">CVA</abbr> is when a company proposes an agreement with its creditors. This arrangement must be approved by the court, in which the company has formally agreed terms with its creditors for the settlement of its debts.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>&nbsp;Proposing a <abbr title="company voluntary arrangement">CVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>A <abbr title="company voluntary arrangement">CVA</abbr> may be proposed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the administrator, where the company is in administration</li>
  <li>the liquidator, where the company is being wound up</li>
  <li>the directors, in other circumstances</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>&nbsp;Considering the proposal</h3>

<p>Where the nominee is not the administrator or liquidator, they must deliver notice of consent to the proposer as soon as possible after receiving the proposal. Within 28 days of receipt the nominee must submit a report to the court.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>&nbsp;Approving a proposal for a <abbr title="company voluntary arrangement">CVA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The nominee must invite members of the company to consider a proposal by summoning a meeting and inviting creditors to consider the proposal by a decision procedure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Once the <abbr title="company voluntary arrangement">CVA</abbr> is approved</h3>

<p>If the members and creditors approve the arrangement, the nominee or his replacement becomes the supervisor of the arrangement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>What we need</h3>

<p>The supervisor must send a copy of the chair’s report of the meeting.</p>

<p>The supervisor must send reports on the progress and prospects for the full implementation of the voluntary arrangement to all interested parties including Companies House every 12 months starting with the date the <abbr title="company voluntary arrangement">CVA</abbr> was approved.</p>

</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>&nbsp;Termination or full implementation</h3>

<p>When the arrangement is completed, the supervisor must send a copy of the notice to creditors and the supervisor’s report to us within 28 days after final completion or termination of the voluntary arrangement.</p>

<p>If the arrangement is suspended or revoked, you must notify us.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Administration</h2>

<p>Administration provides breathing space to allow a rescue package or more advantageous realisation of assets to be put in place. An administrator is appointed to manage a company’s affairs, business and property for the benefit of the creditors.</p>

<p>The person appointed must be an insolvency practitioner and have the status of an officer of the court, whether they’re appointed by the court, or not.</p>

<p>The objective of administration is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rescue a company as a going concern</li>
  <li>achieve a better price for the company’s assets or otherwise realise their value more favourably for the creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration)</li>
  <li>in certain circumstances, realise the value of property in order to make a distribution to one or more preferential creditors</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/companies-house-forms-for-insolvency-scotland#in-administration">full list of forms for companies in administration</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>&nbsp;Companies entering administration</h3>

<p>A company enters administration when the appointment of an administrator takes effect. An administrator may be appointed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an administration order made by the court</li>
  <li>the holder of a floating charge</li>
  <li>the company or its directors</li>
  <li>the liquidator of a company</li>
  <li>the supervisor of a <abbr title="company voluntary arrangement">CVA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a designated office of a magistrate’s court</li>
</ul>

<p>The administrator must perform their functions as quickly and efficiently as reasonably practicable in the best interests of the creditors as a whole.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>&nbsp;Notification when a company is in administration</h3>

<p>As soon as reasonably practicable, an administrator must send a notice of their appointment to the company and each of its creditors and publish notice of their appointment.</p>

<p>The administrator must also send a notice of their appointment to us.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>&nbsp;The process of administration</h3>

<p>Soon after their appointment, the administrator will request a statement of the company’s affairs from relevant people - such as an officer or employee of the company.</p>

<p>As soon as reasonably practicable and before the end of 8 weeks after the company enters administration, the administrator must make a statement setting out proposals for achieving the purpose of the administration or explaining why they cannot be achieved. The proposals may include a voluntary arrangement or a compromise or arrangement with creditors or members.</p>

<p>You must send the statement setting out the proposals to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Registrar of Companies for Scotland</li>
  <li>every creditor of the company whose claim and address he is aware</li>
  <li>every member of the company whose address he is aware</li>
</ul>

<p>Creditors will be asked to approve (with or without modifications) the statement of proposals. Following the initial meeting the administrator may form a creditors committee. The administrator must notify creditors of any revisions to the proposals.</p>

<p>Any decisions taken by creditors must be reported to us.</p>

<h4>Role of the administrator in the disposal of assets</h4>

<p>An administrator must not make a substantial disposal to a connected person within the first 8 weeks of administration unless they either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtain approval of the transaction from creditors</li>
  <li>have received and considered a report obtained by the connected person from an evaluator on the reasonableness of the proposed disposal</li>
</ul>

<p>The administrator must send a copy of the report to the creditors and Companies House at the same time as they send the administrator’s proposals.</p>

<p>If the report, or any previous reports, concluded that the disposal is not reasonable in the circumstances, the administrator must also send a statement explaining their reasons for carrying on with the disposal.</p>

<p>You must send a copy of the report, and if necessary, the statement, to Companies House, together with the administrator’s proposals.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/requirements-for-independent-scrutiny-of-the-disposal-of-assets-in-administration-including-pre-pack-sales">Read more about the disposal of assets in administration</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>&nbsp;Approval of statement of proposals</h3>

<p>The administrator will be able to use a process of deemed consent where they write to the creditors with a proposal. If they do not receive objections from 10% or more of creditors, the proposal will be deemed to be approved. If 10% or more creditors object, the office holder will use an alternative decision-making process, such as a virtual meeting.</p>

<p>Where the proposal is deemed to have been approved the administrator must, as soon as reasonably practicable, deliver a notice of the date of deemed approval to us.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>&nbsp;When administration ends</h3>

<p>There are several ways administration can end.</p>

<p>Administration can end automatically one year from the date the administration took effect. You must notify us. But the administration can be extended with the consent of the creditors or the court.</p>

<p>You must notify us of any extension.</p>

<p>An administrator who thinks that the purpose of administration has been sufficiently achieved must file a notice with the court and Companies House.</p>

<p>An administrator appointed by a court order may apply to the court to end administration if they think that the purpose of the administration cannot be achieved or the company should not have entered administration, or a creditors’ decision requires them to make the application. The court will discharge the administration order and the administrator must notify us.</p>

<p>An administrator appointed by the holders of a floating charge or by the company or its directors may end administration when the purpose of administration has been sufficiently achieved. The administrator must file notice with the court and Companies House.</p>

<p>Administration may end on the application of a creditor to the court. If the application is approved the administrator must send a copy of the order with the relevant form to us.</p>

<p>Administration may end and move into dissolution. This can happen if the administrator thinks that a company has no property with which to make a distribution to its creditors. The administrator must send notice of this to us and the company will be dissolved 3 months after the date the form is registered unless an order is made to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extend or suspend the period</li>
  <li>stop the dissolution</li>
</ul>

<p>You must send us notice of any order.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Administration can be converted to creditors voluntary liquidation (<abbr title="creditors voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The administration can be converted to <abbr title="creditors voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr> where the administrator of a company thinks the total amount each secured creditor of the company is likely to receive has been paid or set aside for him. Also, that a distribution will be made to any unsecured creditors of the company.</p>

<p>The administrator must send <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/move-a-scottish-company-from-administration-to-creditors-voluntary-liquidation-am22-scot">form AM22</a> (Notice of move from administration to creditors’ voluntary liquidation) to Companies House. The company converts from administration to <abbr title="creditors voluntary liquidation">CVL</abbr> on the date of registration of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/move-a-scottish-company-from-administration-to-creditors-voluntary-liquidation-am22-scot">form AM22</a>.</p>

<p>Once we register the form, you must also file <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appoint-liquidator-in-voluntary-winding-up-form-600">form 600</a> (Notice of appointment of liquidator). The appointment of the liquidator must not be before the date the company went into liquidation – the date of registration of the AM22.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Receiver</h2>

<p>There are different kinds of receiver and their powers vary according to the terms of their appointment.</p>

<p>An administrative receiver is a receiver or manager of the whole, or substantially the whole, of a company’s property who is appointed by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures of the company secured by a floating charge. They have the power to sell (or otherwise realise) the assets covered by the floating charge and apply the proceeds to the debt owed to the charge holder.</p>

<p>Receivers who are not administrative receivers may be appointed in other circumstances. For example, under powers contained in an instrument or document creating a charge over a company’s property, a receiver or manager may be appointed until the debt is recovered. Receivers may also be appointed under the Law of Property Act 1925.</p>

</div>

<h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>&nbsp;Compulsory liquidation</h2>

<p>Compulsory liquidation of a company is when the company is ordered by a court to be wound up.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/companies-house-forms-for-insolvency-scotland#winding-up-by-the-court">full list of forms for compulsory liquidation</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>&nbsp;Courts can order a compulsory liquidation</h3>

<p>The Court of Session, or Sheriff Court with the appropriate jurisdiction, may order the winding-up of a company. This may be, for example, on the petition of a creditor or creditors on the grounds that the company cannot pay its debts.</p>

<p>A company is regarded as not able to pay its debts if, for example, a creditor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is owed more than £750</li>
  <li>presents a written demand in the prescribed form (known as a statutory demand to the company</li>
  <li>the company fails to pay, secure or agree a settlement of the debt to the creditor’s reasonable satisfaction</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>There are other situations where a company is deemed not able to pay its debts.</p>
</div>

<p>The court may also order the company to be wound up on the petition of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the company itself</li>
  <li>the company’s directors or one or more members</li>
  <li>the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/" rel="external">Financial Conduct Authority</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>&nbsp;Information on the public record</h3>

<p>If the petition is successful, the company must send a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/give-notice-of-a-court-order-in-a-winding-up-for-a-scottish-company-wu01-scot">WU01(Scot) form</a> and a copy of the winding-up order to us and <abbr title="Accountant in Bankruptcy">AIB</abbr> and it will be placed on the company’s public record.</p>

<p>The petition itself is not presented to us and will not appear on the public record.</p>

<p>Unless the court directs other arrangements, the petition must be advertised in the Edinburgh Gazette.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>&nbsp;The appointment of the liquidator when an order is made to wind up the company</h3>

<p>A provisional liquidator may be appointed after the petition is presented. If a winding up order is made, an interim liquidator is appointed. Both the provisional and interim liquidator must notify us and <abbr title="Accountant in Bankruptcy">AIB</abbr> of their appointments.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>The duties of the interim liquidator</h3>

<p>Within 28 days of the appointment, the interim liquidator investigates the company’s affairs and will call meetings of creditors and contributories. Contributaries are people that are liable to contribute to the assets of a company in the event of it being wound up.</p>

<p>The meetings appoint the official liquidator who must notify <abbr title="Accountant in Bankruptcy">AIB</abbr> within 7 days. If no liquidator is appointed at the meetings, the court appoints a liquidator.</p>

<p>The liquidator must send to <abbr title="Accountant in Bankruptcy">AIB</abbr> a statement of receipts and payments for the first 12 months of liquidation and thereafter every 6 months until the winding up is complete.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>&nbsp;When the winding-up is complete</h3>

<p>When we, together with the <abbr title="Accountant in Bankruptcy">AIB</abbr>, receive notice from the liquidator of the final meeting that winding-up is complete, we will register it and publish its receipt in the Edinburgh Gazette.</p>

<p>Unless the Court directs otherwise, the company will be dissolved 3 months after the notice was registered with us.</p>
